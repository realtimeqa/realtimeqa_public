The debate was moderated by Fox News host Chris Wallace. Minutes and seconds are marked at various points for reference\n\n00:00 CHRIS WALLACE\n\nThe first of the 2020 presidential debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The Commission has designed the format: six, roughly 15 minute segments, with two minute answers and each candidate to the first question. Then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics, and the questions in each topic. I can assure you, none of the questions has been shared with the commission, or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is doing as a health security adviser to the commission for all four debates. As a precaution both campaigns have agreed that candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate. The audience here in the hall has pledged to remain silent: no cheers, no boo’s, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Biden.\n\n01:40 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, a lot of people have been waiting for this night, so let's get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late, Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate's to consider a nominee the court, Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the president and Republicans to jam through and an appointment and what you call an ‘abuse of power.’ My first question to both of you tonight: Why are you right in the argument you make, and your opponent wrong and where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court. President Trump, in this first segment you go first. Two minutes.\n\n2:29 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\n\nThank you very much, Chris, I will tell you very simply. We won the election, elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee, respected by all top, top academic -- good in every way, good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places so I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself, I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding, she's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that -- we have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, says she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time in a great school. And we just, we won the election, and therefore we have the right to choose her and very few people knowingly would say otherwise -- and by the way the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about that, doing it. If they had -- the only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the elections so they were stopped, and probably that would happen in reversal so definitely would happen reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it.\n\n3:50 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump, Thank you. Same question to your Vice President Biden you have two minutes.\n\n3:56 JOE BIDEN\n\nFirst of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President. I -- the American people have a right to have a say to who the Supreme Court nominee is, and that say occurs when they vote for United States senators and when they vote for the President of the United States. They're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already -- the election has already started. Tens of thousands of people have already voted. And so the thing that should happen is we should wait, we should wait and see what the outcome of this election is, because that's the only way the American people get to express their view, is by who they elect as president who they elect as vice president. Now, what's at stake here is, the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He's been running on that. He ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He's in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having insurance, health insurance, now, if they -- if it goes into court and, and the justice and I have nothing -- I'm not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she's written before she went to the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not constitutional. The other thing is on the court -- if it’s struck down, what happens? Women's rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could be held -- make more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. We're able to, they're able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets, and that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act. And there's 100 million people who have pre-existing conditions, and they'll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the senate is Democrat or Republican, then he goes forward; if not, we should wait until February.\n\n6:01 TRUMP\n\nThere aren’t 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as the say is concerned, people already had their say. They -- okay, Justice Ginsburg said -- very powerfully, very strongly -- at some point, 10 years ago or so, she said a president and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a president's elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years -- I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a president --\n\nBIDEN\n\nWho’s elected at the next election.\n\nTRUMP\n\n-- During that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years; I'm elected for four years. --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThe election’s already started.\n\n06:38 TRUMP\n\n-- Joe. The hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThat’s simply not true.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, you said\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentleman, we're now into open discussion, open discussion. Yes, I agree. Vice President.\n\n7:00 BIDEN\n\nNumber one. He knows that -- what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare, and we increase it, we do not wipe any -- and one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people have private insurance still, they can they do, they will under my proposal.\n\n7:25 TRUMP\n\nNot what you said. That is not what you said. Your party wants to go Socialist.They're gonna dominate you, Joe, you know that.\n\n7:36 BIDEN\n\nI am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party is what, I, in fact, approved of. What I approved of. Now here's the deal. The deal is that this is going to wipe out pre-existing condition -- by the way, the 20, the 200 million, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch. How many of those have survived? Over 7 million people have contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?\n\n8:05 TRUMP\n\nJoe, you had 308,000 military people die because you couldn't provide them proper health care in the military, so don't tell me about this\n\nBIDEN\n\nI’m happy to talk about this\n\n8:15 TRUMP\n\nAnd if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be 2 million people, because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban\n\n8:24 WALLACE\n\nAll right we're gonna jump in right now. Mr. President. Mr. President, there’s a moderator. We are going to talk about COVID in the next segment, but go ahead.\n\n8:36 BIDEN\n\nWell, let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe v Wade. That's on the ballot as well, in the court in the court. And so that's also at stake, right now.\n\n8:52 TRUMP\n\nYou don’t know that’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot, Why is it on the ballot. It's not on the ballot\n\nBIDEN\n\nIt’s on the ballot in the court\n\nTRUMP\n\nI don’t think so. There's nothing happening there. You don’t know her view on Roe v Wade. All right.\n\nBIDEN\n\nI don’t know --\n\n9:06 WALLACE\n\nAll right, all right, let's talk here. We got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen, and we’ve got a lot of time. On health care. And with that, we'll come back to Roe v Wade. All right, Mr President, the Supreme Court will hear a case, a week after the election, in which the Trump administration, along with 18 state attorneys general are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare. You have sent the last --\n\nTRUMP\n\nBecause I want to give good healthcare. Good healthcare.\n\nWALLACE\n\nIf I may ask that question, sir. Over the last four years you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare but you have never in these four years, come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.\n\n09:51 TRUMP\n\nYes I have. Of course I have. I'll get rid of the individual mandate which was added. That is absolutely a big thing, that was the worst part of Obamacare. The worst part of Obamacare. Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. I got rid of it.\n\n10:12 WALLACE\n\nI am the moderator in this debate. And I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.\n\n10:18\n\nGo ahead.\n\nWALLACE\n\nYou, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday, you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect people with pre-existing conditions, five days before this debate. So my question sir is, what is the Trump healthcare plan.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, first of all, I guess I'm debating you not him, but that's okay, I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. That has nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices, I'm going with favored nations which no president has encouraged to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down, 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government but you didn't do it, nobody's done it. So we're cutting health care, all of the things that we've done -- insulin. I‘ll give an example: insulin. It's going to, it was destroying families -- destroyed people, the cost -- ‘I'm getting it for so cheap; it's like water.’ You want to know the truth, so cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that --- what we're doing, prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they make just a tiny fraction -- this is big stuff.\n\n11:31 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, you'll be happy. I'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare, and the argument that he makes and other Republicans make, is that that is going to end private insurance.\n\nBIDEN\n\nIt is not.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI am asking the question. That it will, it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health care.\n\n11:37 BIDEN\n\nIt does not. It's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid, they can get that free. In most states, except governors who want to deny people are poor, Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare -- excuse me, Medicaid -- would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one --\n\n12:22 TRUMP\n\nSo you agree with Bernie Sanders, who’s left on the manifesto we call it, that gives you socialized medicine\n\n12:31 BIDEN\n\nLook. The fact of the matter is, I beat Bernie Sanders --\n\n12:42 TRUMP\n\nYou got very lucky.\n\n12:45 BIDEN\n\nI got very lucky, I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well. And tonight I'm going to -- here's the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far it's simply a lie. I'm not here to call out his lies; everybody knows he's a liar. I want to make sure -- I want to make the President --\n\nWALLACE\n\nCan you let him finish sir.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe doesn't know how to do that.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThere is no manifesto --\n\n13:25 TRUMP\n\nYou just lost the left. You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan.\n\n13:31 BIDEN\n\nFolks, do we have any idea what this clown is doing?\n\n13:36 BIDEN\n\nLet me tell you what. He is not for any help for people needing health care because he in fact already cost 10 million people their health care that they had from their employers, because of his recession, number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting health care through Obamacare now he wants to take it away. He won't ever look in your eye and say that's what he wants to do. Take it away,\n\nTRUMP\n\nNo, I want to give them better health care at a much much lower price because he has no, he doesn't know how to read fixed he has never already played it to an extent he has now.\n\n14:16 WALLACE\n\nI know you’ll realize you're both speaking at the same time. Let the President's -- go ahead sir.\n\n14:22 TRUMP\n\nObamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre existing conditions but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed, that they shouldn't even call it Obamacare. But I had a choice to make. Do I let my people run it really well, or badly. If I run it badly they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me, but more importantly I want to help people. Okay, I said you got to run it so well. That's me, and I just had a meeting with them; they said, ‘The problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive, premiums are too high, that it doesn't work,’ I suppose, people -- yes we do want to get rid of it. I want to get rid of something.\n\n15:07 WALLACE\n\nI have to give you roughly equal time, please let the vice president talk.\n\n15:12 BIDEN\n\nHe has no plan for healthcare. He sends out wishful thinking, he has executive orders that have no power, he hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody, he’s been promising a health care plan since he got elected. He has none. Like almost everything else he talks about, he does not have a plan. He doesn't have a plan. And the fact is, this man doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\nWALLACE\n\nOne final question for you, Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans -- we were originally talking about the Supreme Court here -- if Senate Republicans, go ahead and confirm justice Barrett, there has been talk about ending the filibuster, or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the president, but in fact it wasn't brought up by the President, it was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in Congress. So my question to you as you have refused in the past to talk about it: Are you willing to tell the American people tonight, whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court.\n\n16:16 BIDEN\n\nWhatever position I take on that, that'll become the issue -- the issue is, the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. We're in voting now, vote and let your senators know how strongly you feel. Vote now, in fact let people know it is your senators. I'm not going to answer the question.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWhy won’t you answer the question -- radical left -- well, listen.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWould you shut up, man.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWho is on your list?\n\n16:49 WALLACE\n\nWe have ended this segment. We're going to move on to the second segment.\n\n16:52 BIDEN\n\nThat was a really productive segment, wasn’t it.\n\n16:57 BIDEN\n\nKeep yapping, man.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThe people understand, Joe. In 47 years, you've done nothing then just.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAlright. The second subject is a covid-19, which is an awfully serious subject, so let's try to be -- A million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back toward anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is based on what you have said and done so far and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward. In this case, the question goes to you first. Sir, two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n17:54 BIDEN\n\nLook, 200,000 dead. You said over 7 million infected in the United States. We in fact have 5% or 4% of the world's population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people, they're dying. When he was presented with that number he said ‘it is what it is’ -- what it is what it is -- because you are who you are. That's why it is. The president has no plan. He hasn't laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He's on tape as acknowledging he knew. He said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it, because he didn't want to panic the American people. You don't panic, he panicked. In addition to that, what did he do? He went in and he, we were insisting that the Chinese, the people we had on the ground in China should be able to go to watch, and determine for themselves, how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. What did he do then? He then he waited and waited and waited. He still doesn't have a plan. I laid out or I could just watch, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear plus, we should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people to help they need to keep their businesses, open, open schools that cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap, get people the help they need to keep their businesses, open, open schools that cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the car, and in your golf course the golf course and going oval office\n\n19:54 TRUMP\n\nThe country would have been left wide open, Millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much -- it's China's fault, it should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault, by the way when you talk about numbers you know how many people died in Japan. How many people died in Russia. How many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done. I closed it and you said he's xenophobic, he's a racist and xenophobic because you didn't close in our country. You didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was too -- it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early -- in fact Dr. Fauci said President Trump saved thousands of lives. Many of your Democrat governors said President Trump did a phenomenal job. We worked with the governors. Oh, really, go take a look. The governor said I did a phenomenal job, most of them said that they attract people that would not be necessarily on my side, said that President Trump's a phenomenal job. We did. We got the gowns, we got the masks, we made the ventilators -- you wouldn't have made ventilators -- and now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already, fewer people are dying when they get sick, far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job. The only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on, it's just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press, because that's the way it is, unfortunately. I don't care. I've gotten used to it. But I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did, you don't have it in your blood. You could have never done that yet.\n\n21:30 BIDEN\n\nI know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done.\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell you didn't do very well in swine flu. H1N1. A disaster.\n\n21:38 BIDEN\n\n14,000 people died, not 200,000. There was no economic recession. We didn't shut down the economy. This is his economy, it's been shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because -- look you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died at COVID. How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to the nurse holding the phone up so you could in fact say goodbye. By the way, his own CDC director says, we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year, and he held up he said, if we just wear a mask we can save half those numbers -- just just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the, the whole notion of a vaccine. We prefer a a vaccine, but I don't trust him at all, and neither do you, I know you don't. What we trust is a scientist.\n\nTRUMP\n\nYou don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?\n\n22:44 WALLACE\n\nAnd let me, let me move on to questions about the future, because you both have touched on one of the -- two of the questions I'm going to ask. Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your government’s top scientists. The week before last, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield, said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public. You said that he was confused and mistaken. Those are your two words. But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your operation warp speed, has said exactly the same thing. Are they both wrong?\n\n23:24 TRUMP\n\nWell I've spoken to the companies, and we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political and save less. It is a very political thing I've spoken to Pfizer, I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to -- we have great -- Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by lot. It can become very political, because the left or I don't know --\n\nWALLACE\n\nHead of your operation warp speed, Dr. Slaoui --\n\nTRUMP\n\nI disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn't say that. He said it could be there but it could also be -- I had him in my office two days ago.\n\n23:58 WALLACE\n\nHe talked about the summer, sir, before -- it's generally available -- .\n\nTRUMP\n\nHe said it’s a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1. It could also be after that. We're gonna deliver it right away. We have the military all set up -- logistically, they're all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers, and they could do 200,000 a day. They're going to be --\n\nBIDEN\n\nThis is the same man who told you--\n\nTRUMP\n\nIt's all set up.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe said this would be gone away. Whether it'd be gone -- miraculously, like a miracle. By the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of it.\n\n24:32 TRUMP\n\nThat was said sarcastically, you know that. That was said sarcastically.\n\nBIDEN\n\nAnd so here's the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious, every serious company is talking about, maybe having the vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning or the middle of next year to get it out. If we get the vaccine. And pray to god we will. Pray god we will.\n\n24:56 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President, I want to pick up one of the -- pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can't trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts “will be muzzled, will be suppressed. Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate Senator Harris contributing to that fear?\n\n25:26 BIDEN\n\nNo more than the question you just asked. You pointed it out. He puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. Well, no, no, you can trust the scientists. She didn’t say that.\n\nWALLACE\n\nShe said, the public experts, quote, “will be muzzled, will be suppressed.”\n\nTRUMP\n\nShe did say that.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWell, that's what he's going to try to do, but there's millions of scientists -- there's thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital, that don't work for him. Their job doesn't depend on him. That's not -- they’re the people, and by the way --\n\nTRUMP\n\nI spoke to the scientists that are in charge. They will have the vaccine very soon.\n\nBIDEN\n\nDo you believe for a moment what he's telling you, in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue of COVID. He still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn't even tell you. He's on record saying that he panicked, or he just looked at the stock market -- one of the two -- because guess what: a lot of people died, and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter.\n\n26:35 TRUMP\n\nDid you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn't go to Delaware State. You graduated, either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word smart with me, don't ever use that word.\n\nBIDEN\n\nOh, give me a break.\n\nTRUMP\n\nBecause you know what, there's nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years, you've done nothing.\n\nBIDEN\n\nWell, let's have this debate. You would’ve had --\n\nTRUMP\n\nLet me just tell you something. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through -- I had to close the greatest economy in the history of our country. And by the way, now it's being built again --\n\nWALLACE\n\nWe’ll talk about the economy in the next segment, sir.\n\nTRUMP\n\nIt's going up fast --\n\nWALLACE\n\nOkay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled, so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward, by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those reopenings, Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and school. Why, sir?\n\nBIDEN\n\nBecause he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running, I’d know what the plan is. You've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with a PPE, as well as with sanitation they need. You have to provide --\n\nTRUMP\n\nTell that to Nancy Pelosi.\n\n27:51 BIDEN\n\nWill he just shush for a minute.\n\nTRUMP\n\nTell it to Nancy Pelosi. And Schumer.\n\n27:59 BIDEN\n\nNancy Pelosi and Schumer -- they have a plan. He won't even meet with them. The Republicans won't meet with them in the Senate. But he sits in his golf course -- I mean, literally, think about it --\n\nTRUMP\n\nYou probably play more than I do, Joe.\n\nWALLACE\n\nWhat about this question of reopenings, and the fact that --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWell, he wants to shut down this country. And I want to keep it open. And we did great --\n\nBIDEN\n\nYou need to shut it down --\n\n28:22 TRUMP\n\nWait a minute. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe. Just for one second.\n\n28:26 TRUMP\n\nWe want to -- he wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to because we didn't know anything about the disease. Now, we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot -- young children aren't, even younger people aren't. We've learned a lot. But he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing -- if you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down -- they have Democrat governors all. One of the reasons they’re shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election. This is political.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI wonder what's --\n\nTRUMP\n\nThose states, those states are not doing well that are shut down.\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we’re going to go on to another subject. You have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer, and in fact recently you have cited the, the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the effectiveness of masks?\n\nTRUMP\n\nNo, you have to understand -- if you look, I mean, I have a mask right here. I put the mask on it, you know what I think I need it. As an example, everybody's had a test, and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear a mask, when needed -- when needed, I wear masks. I don't -- I don’t wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen.\n\n29:51 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, go ahead, sir.\n\nBIDEN\n\nLook, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able to open. We provided money --\n\nWALLACE\n\nI was asking, sir, about masks.\n\nBIDEN\n\nOh. Masks -- masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now -- if everybody wore masks and social distancing between now and January, we'd probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters,\n\nTRUMP\n\nAnd they've also said the opposite. They've also said the --\n\nBIDEN\n\nNo serious person has said the opposite --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWhat about Dr. Fauci? Dr. Fauci said the opposite.\n\nBIDEN\n\nHe did not say the opposite.\n\n30:27 TRUMP\n\nHe said very strongly: Masks are not good. Then he changed his mind. He's admitted -- I’m ok with masks.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI want to talk about one last subject, because your different approaches have even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you're holding the large rallies, with crowds packed together thousands of people.\n\n30:44 TRUMP\n\nOutside.\n\nWALLACE\n\nOutside. Yes, sir. Great. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with --\n\nTRUMP\n\nCause nobody will show up.\n\nWALLACE.\n\nPeople with --\n\nTRUMP\n\nNobody shows up to his rallies.\n\nWALLACE\n\nIn any case, why you’re holding the big rallies, why you're not. You goes first, sir.\n\n31:00 TRUMP\n\nBecause people want to hear what I have to say, I mean, 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAre you not worried about the disease, though, sir.\n\n31:13 TRUMP\n\nWell, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It's outside -- that's a big difference according to the experts. And we do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see. I mean every -- and literally on 24 hours notice -- and Joe does the circles and has three people some place.\n\nBIDEN\n\nBy the way, did you see, one of the last reboot rallies he had -- a reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, ‘No no no. Stand back. Put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I'm way, way far away from those other people.’ That's what he said. I can't, I'm gonna be okay. He not worried about you. He's not worried about the people out there --\n\nTRUMP\n\nWe had no negative, no negative effect. We've had no negative effect, and we've had, 35 40,000, people at some of these rallies.\n\nWALLACE\n\nJust finish off because I want to move on to our next --\n\nBIDEN\n\nYes, I would. He's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing, and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. And he's a fool on that.\n\nTRUMP\n\nIf you could get the crowds, you would’ve done the same thing, but you can't -- nobody cares, nobody cares.\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, can we move on to the economy. The economy is, I think it's fair to say, is recovering faster than expected from the shutdown much in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth which is going to be there is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V shaped recovery. Vice President Biden you say it's more of a K shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy. President Trump, in this segment, you go first.\n\n32:56 TRUMP\n\nSo we built the greatest economy in history. We close it down because of the China plague, when the plague came in we closed it down, which was very hard, psychologically to do. He didn't think we should close it down, and he was wrong, again. To me it -- people would be dead now, instead of still 204,000 people is too much, one person is too much, should have never happened from China. But what happened is we've closed it down and now we're reopening, and we're doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we've put back into the workforce. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before, and he wants to close down the -- he will shut it down again. He will destroy this country, you know, a lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down and you take a look at what's happening in some of your Democrat run states where they have these tough shutdowns, and I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, said they’ll open up November 9. Why November 9? Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance, they can wash their hands, they can wear masks -- they can do whatever they want, but they can open these states up. When you look at North Carolina, when you look at -- these governors are under siege in Michigan and a couple of others. You gotta open the states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost like being in prison. And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. It's a very, very sad thing. And he'll close down the whole country, this guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don't need somebody to come in and say let's shut it down.\n\nWALLACE\n\nAlright, your two minute sir, we're now moved to you. As I, as I said posing the question, the president says it's a V shape recovery, you say it's a K shape recovery. What's the difference?\n\nBIDEN\n\nThe difference is millionaires and billionaires like him, in the middle of COVID crisis, have done very well. The billionaires array have made another $300 billion. Because of his profligate tax proposal and you only focus on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont -- all the small towns and working class towns in America. How well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.\n\nWALLACE\n\nI understand. You've agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have them.\n\nBIDEN\n\nI get my time back? The fact is that he is in fact worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president in the United States to leave office, I mean fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. The first one in American history. Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines, those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have went out there dying, people who have been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. The idea that he is consistent, that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID desks and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why does he want to open it up? Why doesn't he take care of the American -- you can't fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis, and he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home, in terms of your health and your safety. Schools -- why aren't schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. You know, they were going to give his administration was going to give the teachers and school students masks. Then they decided, no, couldn't do that, because it's not a national emergency, not a national emergency. They've done nothing to help small businesses, nothing. They're closing. One is six is now gone. He ought to get on the job, and take care of the needs of the American people, so we can open safely.\n\nWALLACE\n\nRight. Your time is up, sir.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI need to respond to that.\n\nWALLACE\n\nWell, you both have two minutes, sir.\n\n37:02 TRUMP\n\nExcuse me. He made a statement. People want their schools, no, people want their schools open. They don't want to be shut down. They don't want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It's so sad what's happening in New York, it's almost like a ghost town. And I'm not sure I can ever recover what they've done in New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThey want to be safe.\n\nTRUMP\n\nThey’ll be careful. But they want their schools -- I'm the one that brought back football, by the way, I brought it back Big Ten football. It was me, and I'm very happy to do it. People on all sides are very proud of me, and you don't want to --\n\nWALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment but first, Mr. President, As you well know, there's a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax, each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I'm asking you the specific question: Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes, each of those two years.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI paid millions of dollars in taxes. Millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers. I paid $38 million one year. I paid 27 million one year --\n\nBIDEN\n\nShow us your tax returns.\n\nTRUMP\n\nI went -- you'll see it as soon as it's finished, you'll see it. You know, what you want to do -- go to the board of elections. There's 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have -- I'm totally underleveraged because the assets are extremely good, and we have a very, we have a --\n\nWALLACE\n\nI’m asking a specific question, a specific question, which is --\n\nTRUMP\n\nLet me tell you, that I understand --\n\n38:49 WALLACE\n\nNo, Mr. President. I'm asking the question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?\n\n38:59 TRUMP\n\nMillions of dollars.\n\n39:00 WALLACE\n\nYou paid millions of dollars?\n\n39:02 TRUMP\n\nMillions of dollars. Millions of dollars. And you'll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it.\n\n39:05 BIDEN\n\nWhen?\n\n39:06 TRUMP\n\nBut let me tell you, Chris. Let me just say something. It was the tax laws-- I don't want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer. I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws and that's what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation, and for tax credits. We built a building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. You get an asset, which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired up right after that happened but--\n\n39:43 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, do you want to respond?\n\n39:45 BIDEN\n\nI do want to respond. Look, the tax code that made him, put him in a position that he pays less tax to the school teacher, make them, the money a school teacher makes. Is because of-- He says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code, but that's why I'm going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And we're going to eliminate those tax cuts and make sure that we invest in the people who, in fact, need the help. People out there need help--\n\n40:15 TRUMP\n\nBut why did you do it over the last 25 years? Why doesn’t he do it over the last 25 years?\n\n40:19 BIDEN\n\nBecause you were president-- Because you were president and destroyed things up.\n\n40:22 TRUMP\n\nYou were a senator--\n\n40:24 BIDEN\n\nYou are the worst president America’s ever had\n\n40:26 TRUMP\n\nLet me just say Joe I've done more in, in 47 months, I've done more than you've done in 47 years, Joe. We've done things that you never even thought of doing, including fixing the broken military that you gave me, to taking care of the vets--\n\n40:30 WALLACE\n\nWe’re talking -- Mr. President, we're talking about the economy. I'd like to ask you about your plans going forward. Because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan, if you were to be elected president, focuses a lot on big government. Big taxes. Big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it's just coming out of a recession.\n\n41:14 BIDEN\n\nWell, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth because it would be about buying American. And we have to. We're gonna make-- The Federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to build, to the like. And under my proposal, we're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a--\n\n41:50 WALLACE\n\nRespectfully, sir. I’m talking about taxes, not spending.\n\n41:54 BIDEN\n\nWell, by the way, I'm gonna eliminate a significant number of the tax. I'm gonna make the, the corporate tax 28%, shouldn't be 21%. You have 19 companies--91 companies, federal, I mean in the fortune 500, who don't pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.\n\n42:11 TRUMP\n\nWhy didn’t you do it when you were vice president with Obama?\n\n42:15 BIDEN\n\nBecause, because you in fact passed that. That was your tax proposal.\n\n42:18 TRUMP\n\nI got it done and you know what happened? Our economy boomed like it's never boomed --\n\n42:23 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, Mr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?\n\n42:32 BIDEN\n\nNot lower taxes for the American people.\n\n42:46 WALLACE\n\nBut in Obama's economy booming. It turns out that in Obama's final three years as president more jobs were created. A million and a half more jobs than in the first three years of your presidency.\n\n42:48 TRUMP\n\nThey had the slowest recovery. Since 19 -- economic recovery, since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you have to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot, but they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. Let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401k's. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas -- You want to terminate my taxes? I'll tell you what, you’ll lose half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here they'll leave for other places. They will leave, and you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen.\n\n43:29 BIDEN\n\nLook, we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression, in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery, the crazy jobs you're talking about. He comes in on a booming economy. He blew it. He blew it.\n\n43:44 TRUMP\n\nIt wasn’t booming. It wasn’t booming.\n\n43:49 WALLACE\n\nSir, wait. Wait. Is it fair to say he blew it when, when there was record low unemployment before COVID?\n\n43:57 BIDEN\n\nYeah. Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in the hole--\n\n44:04 TRUMP\n\nExcuse me, Chris. Wait, Chris. They said it would take?\n\n44:05 BIDEN\n\nNumber one, number two, number three --\n\n44:09 TRUMP\n\nNo, you’re number two. Chris, Chris.\n\n44:12 BIDEN\n\nThis guy --\n\n44:13 TRUMP\n\nThey said it was a miracle to bring back manufacturing, I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing --\n\n44:20 BIDEN\n\nWe did not give up. I'm the guy who brought back the automobile industry.\n\n44:23 TRUMP\n\nHe totally gave up on the auto industry --\n\n44:24 WALLACE\n\nAlright, let him --\n\n44:26 BIDEN\n\nWe brought back, I was asked to bring back, Chrysler and General Motors. We brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They're gone. He blew it. And in fact, they're going --\n\n44:34 TRUMP\n\nOhio had the best year it's ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they've ever had --\n\n44:39 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\n44:40 TRUMP\n\nMany car companies came in from Germany, from China. They went to Michigan, went to Ohio.\n\n44:47 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President --\n\n44:48 BIDEN\n\nAnd so, you take a look at what he's actually done. He's done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. You know, he talks about the art of the deal. China's made, perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit with Mexico --\n\n45:06 TRUMP\n\nChina ate your lunch --\n\n45:07 WALLACE\n\nAlright, gentlemen --\n\n45:09 TRUMP\n\nChina ate your lunch, Joe. No wonder your son goes in and he takes out what he takes out, billions of dollars. Takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we're at it, why is it, just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave your son $3.5 million? What did he do to deserve it? What did he do --\n\n45:34 WALLACE\n\nYou asked a question. Let him answer.\n\n45:36 BIDEN\n\nNone of that is true.\n\n45:38 TRUMP\n\nOh, really?\n\n45:39 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. Mr. President, please. You asked a question--\n\n45:41 BIDEN\n\nTotally discredited. Totally discredited and by the way --\n\n45:46 TRUMP\n\nHe did get $3.5 million, Joe?\n\n45:48 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice -- Mr. President --\n\n45:49 TRUMP\n\nHe got $3.5 million.\n\nBIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\nTRUMP\n\nOh, really?\n\n45:52 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. It's an, it's an open discussion, please. You --\n\n45:55 TRUMP\n\nNo. It’s a fact.\n\n45:57 WALLACE\n\nWell, you’ve raised an issue. Let the vice president answer.\n\n45:59 BIDEN\n\nTotally discredit --\n\nTRUMP\n\n-- $183,000a month? With no experience and energy?\n\n46:07 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, let him answer.\n\n46:08 BIDEN\n\nMy son did nothing wrong --\n\n46:09 TRUMP\n\nYes, he did --\n\n46:10 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, let him answer.\n\n46:12 BIDEN\n\nHe doesn’t want to let me answer because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally, thoroughly discredited --\n\n46:17 TRUMP\n\nBy who? The media.\n\n46:20 BIDEN\n\nBy everyone, well by the media, by our allies, by the World Bank, by eh- by everyone has discredited. Matter of fact.\n\n46:30 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, please stop.\n\n46:30 BIDEN\n\nMatter of fact, even the people who testified under oath.\n\n46:32 TRUMP\n\nSo let me ask you this --\n\n46:39\n\nHe testified under oath and his administration said, I did my job and I did very well.\n\n46:45 TRUMP\n\nI don’t know who they are --\n\n46:46 BIDEN\n\nWell I'll give you the list of the people who testified. Sir, you’ve already fired most of them because they did their jobs.\n\n46:53 TRUMP\n\nWell some people don’t --\n\n46:56 WALLACE\n\nWait a minute, you get the final word.\n\n46:57 BIDEN\n\nWell, it's hard to get any word with this clown, excuse me, this person.\n\n47:00 TRUMP\n\nLet me just say --\n\n47:02 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, Mr. President. Mr. President.\n\n47:06 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n47:07 TRUMP\n\nWhy did he deserve three and a half million for Moscow?\n\n47:08 BIDEN\n\nLook, here's the deal. I want to talk about families and ethics. I don't want to do that. I mean his family we could talk about all night. His family --\n\n47:18 TRUMP\n\nMy family, my family lost a fortune coming down and helping us with government and\n\n47:23 WALLACE\n\nMr. President.\n\n47:24 TRUMP\n\nEvery single one of them lost --\n\n47:26 BIDEN\n\nThis is not about his family or my family. It’s about your family.\n\n47:30 TRUMP\n\nThree and a half million dollars.\n\n47:31 Biden\n\nThat's not true. It doesn't want to talk about what you need, you, the American people. It's about you. That's what we're talking about.\n\n47:41 WALLACE\n\nAlright, that's the end of this segment. We're moving on. Mr. President --\n\n47:47 TRUMP\n\nCan I be honest? It's very important to --\n\n47:49 BIDEN\n\nTry to be honest.\n\n47:50 WALLACE\n\nNo, the answer the question is no. No, I, sir.\n\n47:54 TRUMP\n\n-- with a billion dollars.\n\n47:56 BIDEN\n\nThat is absolutely not true --\n\n48:00 WALLACE\n\nGentleman I hate to raise my voice, but why should I be different than the two of you? So here's the deal, we have six segments. We have ended that segment, we're going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are gonna have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I can asked a question about race but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But we, I think that the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruption. I'm appealing to you sir to do that.\n\n48:34 TRUMP\n\nWell, him too.\n\n48:36 WALLACE\n\nWell, frankly, you've been doing more interrupting-\n\n48:38 TRUMP\n\nWell that’s alright, but he does plenty.\n\n48:40 WALLACE\n\nWell, less than, sir less than you have. Let's please continue on. The issue of race. Vice President Biden you say that President Trump's response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president,\n\n49:05 TRUMP\n\nOh yeah sure.\n\n49:05 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump, you have often said that you believe you have done more for black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. My question for the two of you is why should voters trust you, rather than your opponent, to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first.\n\n49:26 BIDEN\n\nIt's about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It's about the Constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to quite require equity for everyone, equality for the whole America.\n\nBut we've never accomplished it, but we've never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got into the race was with most people. Close your eyes. Remember what those people look like coming out in the fields carrying torches. Their veins bulgy. Spewing, just spewing anti Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and when they asked the president what he thought he said there were very fine people on both sides. No presidents ever said anything like that.\n\n50:09 WALLACE\n\nOne second, sir.\n\n50:10 BIDEN\n\nSecond point I'd make, is that when Floyd was killed -- when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military to use tear gas on em so he could walk across to a church and hold up a bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said he only, all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred, racist division. This is a man who in fact, he talks about helping African Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn't do something quickly by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man? This man is a savior of African Americans? This man cares at all? This man has done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what it did has been disastrous for the African American community. So --\n\n51:24 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal with race?\n\n51:30 TRUMP\n\nHe did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African Americans are super predators. And they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it, Joe.\n\n51:40 WALLACE\n\nSir, it’s his two minutes.\n\n51:41 TRUMP\n\nSo you did that and they called you super predator. And I'm letting people out of jail now that -- You have treated the African American population, community -- You've treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 199 -- And that's why, if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time. Because they saw what you did. You called them super predators, and you've called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200-250 military leaders in total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida, I have Texas, I have, Ohio. I have every, excuse me. Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said ‘I support President Trump.’ I don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words, you're gonna lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what, if they called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won't do it because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe. Because we believe in law and order but you don’t. The top 10 cities, and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats. Just radical left. And they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe. To a point where you don't say anything about law and order. And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it.\n\n53:30 WALLACE\n\nAlright, I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Brianna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question “Whether justice could be equally applied in America”. Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country?\n\n53:54 BIDEN\n\nYes, there is a systemic injustice in this country. In education, in the law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent honor men and women that risk their lives every day to take care of us. But there are some bad apples and when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I'm going to do is president of the United States is call together, an entire group of people at the White House. Well, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to police chiefs, and we're going to work this out. We're going to work this out so we change the way in which we have more transparency. And when these things happen, these cops aren't happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren't happy to see what happened to Brown and Taylor. Most don't like it, but we have to have a system report, held accountable. When, and by the way, violence in response is never appropriate. Never appropriate. Peaceful protests is. Violence is never appropriate.\n\n55:00 TRUMP\n\nWhat is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of town and burned down your stores and kill people all over the place?\n\n55:04 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, Mr. President. President Trump, I’d like to continue with this. I promise we're gonna get to the issue of law and order in a moment. Your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, end with sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?\n\n55:37 TRUMP\n\nI ended it because it's racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it and so does everybody else. And he would know it.\n\n55:54 WALLACE\n\nWhat is radical -- What is radical about racial sensitivity training?\n\n55:59 TRUMP\n\nIf you were a certain person, you had no status in life, it's sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place, it's a racist place, and they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not gonna allow that to happen.\n\n56:31 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden?\n\n56:33 BIDEN\n\nNobody’s doing that. He's just, he’s racist. Here's the deal, I know a lot more --\n\n56:38 WALLACE\n\nLet him finish.\n\n56:40 BIDEN\n\nThe fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It's important that people know they don't want to, many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings. But it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of a sense of self esteem. It's a little bit like how this guy and his friends looked down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics like me who grew up in Scranton. They look down on people who don't have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They look down on people who are a different color. In fact, we're all Americans. The only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody. There's nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism.\n\n57:35 WALLACE\n\nVice President -- I mean, President Trump, sir.\n\n57:37 TRUMP\n\nDuring the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred, you look at Ferguson, you look at, you go to very many places. Look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened- Frankly, it was more violent than what I'm even seeing now,\n\n57:55 BIDEN\n\nOh my god, this is ridiculous.\n\n57:56 TRUMP\n\nBut the reason is that the Democrats that run these cities don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order.\n\n58:03 BIDEN\n\nViolent crime -- Violent crime --\n\n58:03 TRUMP\n\nYou still haven’t mentioned, are you in favor of law and order?\n\n58:04 BIDEN\n\nI'm in favor of law. You --\n\n58:07 TRUMP\n\nAre you in favor of law and order?\n\n58:13 BIDEN\n\nLaw and order with justice where people get treated fairly. And the fact of the matter is violent crime went down 17%, 15% percent in our administration. It’s gone up on his watch.\n\n58:24 TRUMP\n\nIt’s gone down much more.\n\n58:28 WALLACE\n\nAlright, alright. Mr. President -- Mr. President, you’re now gonna be very happy because we’re gonna talk about law and order.\n\n58:34 TRUMP\n\nThe places we had trouble with Democratic-run cities --\n\n58:39 WALLACE\n\nThat's exactly my question. There have been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer, particularly. And you often blame that on Democratic mayors and Democratic governors, but in fact there have been equivalent spikes in Republican-led cities, like Tulsa, and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue?\n\n58:59 TRUMP\n\nI think it's a party issue. You could bring in a couple of examples, but if you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago where 53 people were shot and eight died. Shot. If you look at New York where it's going up like these never seen anything. The numbers are going up 100, 150, 200% crime. It is crazy what's going on, and he doesn't want to say law and order because he can't. Because he'll lose his radical left supporters, and once he does that it's over with. But if he ever got to run this country, and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have -- Our suburbs would be gone, our suburbs would be gone, and you would see problems like you’ve never-\n\n59:38: BIDEN\n\nHe wouldn’t know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn.\n\n59:39 TRUMP\n\nOh, I know suburbs.\n\n55:43 BIDEN\n\nI was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All of these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There's many people today driving their kids to soccer practice, or to black and white and Hispanic in the same car, as there have been any time in the past. What really is the threat to the suburbs and their safety has to deal with COVID? They're dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment. They're being flooded. They're being burned out, because he has refusal to do anything. That's why the suburbs are in trouble.\n\n1:00:15 WALLACE\n\nI do want to talk about this issue of law and order, though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders Task Force you talk about “reimagining policing”. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean? And do you support- Let me finish the question. What does re-imagining policing mean? And do you support the Black Lives Matter call for for community control of policing?\n\n1:0046 BIDEN\n\nLook, what I support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face. And I'm not totally opposed to defending the police officers. Matter of fact, police, local police, they only want defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 911 call to have someone with him as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community police, like we had before, where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That's when crime went down. It didn’t go up, it went down. And so we have to be --\n\n1:01:25 TRUMP\n\nThat’s not what they're talking about, Chris. That’s not what they’re talking about. That’s about defunding the police.\n\n1:01:31 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true.\n\n1:01:35 TRUMP\n\nHe doesn't have any law - He has no law enforced -\n\n1:01:39 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true. That’s not --\n\n1:01:39 TRUMP\n\nOh really? Who do you have? Name one group that supports you. Name one group that came out and supported you, go ahead, like we have time.\n\n1:01:46 BIDEN\n\nWe don't have time to do anything --\n\n1:01:53 WALLACE\n\nGentleman, I’m gonna take back control. And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent. In Portland, Oregon, especially, we had more than 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice President, you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the Democratic nominee, and earlier tonight you said that you are the Democratic Party right now. Have you ever called the Democratic mayor of Portland the Democratic governor of Oregon and said ‘Hey, you gotta stop this. Bring in the National Guard. Do whatever it takes. That you'd stop the days and months of violence in Portland?\n\n1:02:40 BIDEN\n\nI don't hold public office now. I am a former Vice President. I've made it clear, I've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. Anyone who committed it --\n\n1:02:53 WALLACE\n\nBut you've never called for the people- Excuse me, sir. You’ve never called for the leaders in Portland, and in Oregon, to call in the national office and knock off 100 days of riots.\n\n1:03:05 BIDEN\n\nThey can, in fact, take care of it if he’d just stay out of the way. Look-\n\n1:03:11 TRUMP\n\nOh really? Oh really? -- The killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him. For three days Portland didn’t do anything.\n\n1:03:18 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump. President Trump. I interrupt- President Trump\n\n1:03:22 TRUMP\n\nI had to send the US Marshals to take care of business --\n\n1:03:24 WALLACE\n\nGo ahead, sir\n\n1:03:25 BIDEN\n\nAnd by the way, you know, his own former spokesperson said, you know, riots and chaos and violence help his cause. That's what this is all about.\n\n1:03:34 TRUMP\n\nI don’t know who said that.\n\n1:03:35 BIDEN\n\nI do.\n\n1:03:35 TRUMP\n\nWho?\n\n1:03:36 BIDEN\n\nI think it was Kellyanne Conway.\n\n1:03:37 TRUMP\n\nI don't think she said that.\n\n1:03:39 BIDEN\n\nShe said that. And so here's, here's the point. The point is that is that that's what he is keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn't want to calm things down. Instead of going in and talking to people and say, ‘let's get everybody together, figuring out how to deal with this’, what he does he do? He just poured gasoline on the fire. Constantly, at every single solitary time.\n\n1:04:00 WALLACE\n\nAnd to end this, button up this segment, I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly warned us-\n\n1:04:07 TRUMP\n\n-answer his stuff.\n\n1:04:08 WALLACE\n\nYou have- No, you've been talking-\n\n1:04:11 TRUMP\n\nHe made a statement- I would love to end it.\n\n1:04:12 WALLACE\n\nI’m asking you- You know, sir- You know, if you want to switch seats-\n\n1:04:17 TRUMP\n\nVery quickly, we could do that but if - the National Guard it would be over. There’d be no problem, but they don’t want to accept the national guard.\n\n1:04:23 WALLACE\n\nOkay, you have repeatedly criticized the Vice President for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing groups. But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups? And to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, as we've seen in Portland? Are you prepared specifically to do that?\n\n1:04:46 TRUMP\n\nSure, I’m prepared to do it. I would say- I would say, almost everything I see is from the left-wing, not from the right wing-\n\n1:05:55 WALLACE\n\nSo what do you, what do you say-\n\n1:04:56 TRUMP\n\nI'm willing to do anything I want to see peace.\n\n1:04:57 WALLACE\n\nThen do it, sir.\n\n1:04:59 BIDEN\n\nSay it, do it, say it.\n\n1:05:00 TRUMP\n\nYou want to call them -- What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me --\n\n1:05:04 WALLACE\n\nWhite supremacists and, white supremacists and right-wing --\n\n1:05:07 BIDEN\n\nThe Proud Boys.\n\n1:05:07 TRUMP\n\nProud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem. This is a left-wing problem\n\n1:05:19 BIDEN\n\nHis own FBI director said -- white supremacists. Antifa is an idea not an organization. Militia --\n\n1:05:27 TRUMP\n\nOh you’ve got to be kidding me\n\n1:05:27 BIDEN\n\nHis FBI said --\n\n1:05:28 TRUMP\n\nWell then, you know what --\n\n1:05:29 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, we’re done, sir. We’re going to go on to the next-\n\n1:05:39 BIDEN\n\nEverybody in your administration tells you the truth that that’s a bad to bad idea. You have no idea.\n\n1:05:43 TRUMP\n\nAntifa is a dangerous, radical group --\n\n1:05:46 WALLACE\n\nGentleman, we're now moving on to the Trump and Biden records.\n\n1:05:50 TRUMP\n\n-- they overthrow you\n\n1:05:51 WALLACE\n\nPresident, I'm gonna ask you a question. When the President seats a second term, it’s generally a referendum on his record. But Vice President Biden you'd like to quote your dad's sayings which is ‘Don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative’. And in this case, sir, you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I'm going to ask each of you, why should voters you, President over your opponent. In this segment, President Trump you'll go first. 10 minutes.\n\n1:06:19 TRUMP\n\nBecause there has never been an administration or president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years, and that's despite the impeachment hoax. And you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton where a whole big con job. But despite going through all these things, where at a fight both flanks, behind me and above, there has never been an administration, that's done what I've done. The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history. Lowest unemployment numbers. Everything was good, everything was go -- And by the way, there was unity. People were calling me. For the first time in years they were calling, and they were saying ‘it's time maybe’. And then what happened? We got hit but now we're building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military including space force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA, which was a mess under him. 308,000 people died. They didn't have proper health care. He was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA. Our vets, we take care of our vets. But we've rebuilt our military. The job that we've done- And I'll tell you so some people say me the most important, by the end of the first term, I'll have approximately 300 federal judges, Court of Appeals judges 300. And hopefully, three great Supreme Court judges, justices. That is a record, the likes of which very few people- And you know one of the reasons I have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you don't leave any judges. That's like, you just don't do that. They left 128 openings. And if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say ‘if you left us 128 openings, you can't be a good president. You can't be a good Vice President’. But I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it'll probably be above that by the end of this term, 300 judges. It's a record.\n\n1:08:22 WALLACE\n\nLooking at both your records, why should voters elect you president, as opposed to President Trump -- You get two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n1:08:29 BIDEN\n\nUnder this president we become weaker, sicker. poorer, more dividing and more violent. When I was Vice President, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it, I did. We left a booming economy, and he caused the recession. With regard to be weaker, the fact is that I've gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we're not going to take any of his stuff. He's Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.\n\n1:09:01 TRUMP\n\nYour son --\n\n1:09:02 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, no --\n\n1:09:03 BIDEN\n\nAnd by the way --\n\n1:09:04 WALLACE\n\nMr. President. Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed that both sides would get two answers uninterrupted. Your side agreed to it. Why don't you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir?\n\n1:09:18 BIDEN\n\nNever keeps his word.\n\n1:09:19 WALLACE\n\nNo, I’m not asking. That was rhetorical question.\n\n1:09:23 BIDEN\n\nCan you go back 30 seconds?\n\n1:09:25 WALLACE\n\nYeah, yes you may. Go ahead.\n\n1:09:26 BIDEN\n\nSo, thirdly we’re poorer. The billionaires have gotten much, much more wealthy by a tune of over four three to $400 billion more, just since COVID. You in the home, you got less. You're in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent, when we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He's president of the United states. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided, the nation can't stay divided. We can't be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them be losers and being, and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got, he got the Bronze Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a patriot. And the people left behind there were heroes.\n\n1:10:23 TRUMP\n\nReally? You talking about Hunter? Are you talking about Hunter?\n\n1:10:23 BIDEN\n\nand I resent -- I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden. You’re talking about --\n\n1:10:30 TRUMP\n\nI don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out, dishonorably discharged for cocaine use.\n\n1:10:37 BIDEN\n\nThat's not true, he wasn’t dishonorably discharged. None of that is true.\n\n1:10:39 TRUMP\n\n-- and he didn't have a job until you became vice president. Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places --\n\n1:10:48 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n1:10:49 TRUMP\n\nHe made a fortune and he didn’t have a job.\n\n1:10:50 BIDEN\n\nMy son -- My son -- My son, like a lot of people, like a lot of people you know I had a drug problem. He's overtaken it. He's fixed it. He's worked on it. And I'm proud of him.\n\n1:11:02 TRUMP\n\nBut why was he given tens of millions of dollars?\n\n1:11:05 BIDEN\n\nHe wasn't given tens of millions of dollars\n\n1:11:08 WALLACE\n\nPresident Trump you’ve --\n\n1:11:11 BIDEN\n\nAlready been discredited\n\n1:11:13 WALLACE\n\nWe've already been through this, I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, you know, as the moderator sir I'm going to make a judgement call there.\n\n1:11:20 TRUMP\n\n-- 3.5 million dollars. Let’s talk about Moscow --\n\n1:11:24 BIDEN\n\nThat is not true. That report is totally discredited.\n\n1:11:25 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen --\n\n1:11:27 BIDEN\n\nMitt Romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayers money. That report was written for political reasons.\n\n1:11:33 WALLACE\n\nYou know, I'd like to talk about climate change.\n\n1:11:36 BIDEN\n\nSo would I --\n\n1:11:37 WALLACE\n\nOkay, the forest fires in the West, are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blame the fires on climate change, Mr. President, you said, ‘I don't think the science knows.’ Over your four years, you have pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama environmental records. What do you believe about the science of climate change? And what will you do in the next four years to confront it?\n\n1:12:11 TRUMP\n\nI want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon, if you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven't destroyed our businesses, our businesses are put out of commission. If you look at the Paris accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what's going on, because our businesses are doing well as far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management, in addition to everything else. The forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees, that a years old and they're like Tinder, and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette and then the whole forest burns. You've got to have forest management-\n\n1:12:52 WALLACE\n\nWhat do you, what do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?\n\n1:12:57 TRUMP\n\nI believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water and do whatever else we can that's good. You know we're planting a billion trees, the billion tree project, and it's very exciting.\n\n1:13:08 WALLACE\n\nDo you believe that human pollution, gashouse, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet?\n\n1:13:15 TRUMP\n\nI think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent yes. I think, to an extent, yes. But I also think we have to do better management of our forests. Every year, I get the call. ‘California is burning California's burning.’ If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. You know in Europe they live that, forest cities, they call forest cities. They maintain their forests. They manage their forests. I was with the head of a major country. It's a forest city. He said, ‘Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California, there shouldn't be that problem’. I spoke with the governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor, but he said you know at some point, he can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground. That's burning down because of a lack of management.\n\n1:14:07 WALLACE\n\nBut sir, if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan, which limited carbon emissions in power plants? Why have you relaxed --\n\n1:14:16 TRUMP\n\nBecause it was driving energy prices through the sky --\n\n1:14:22 WALLACE\n\nWhy have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars?\n\n1:14:27 TRUMP\n\nNot really, because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car. And you're talking about a tiny difference. And then what would happen, because of the cost of the car, you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10-12 years old. If you did that the car would be safer, it would be much cheaper-\n\n1:14:48 WALLACE\n\nIn California, they simply ignored --\n\n1:14:51 TRUMP\n\nTake a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, so, and by the way we're gonna see how that turns out, but a lot of people agree with, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I'm okay with electric cars too. I think I'm all for electric cars with big incentives or electric cars. But what they've done in California is just-\n\n1:15:17 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden I'd like you to respond to the President's climate change record, but I also want to ask you about a concern. You proposed $2 trillion in green jobs you talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035. And zero, net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says, a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.\n\n1:15:46 BIDEN\n\nHe's absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, when -- During our administration Recovery Act I was able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than, or as cheap as coal, and gas, and oil. Nobody's going to build another coal fire plant in America. No one's going to build another oil fire in America. They're going to move to renewable energy, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that they can do that we're gonna put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future. We're going to build a economy, that in fact, is going to provide for the ability, us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized. In a way that, in fact, they'll, they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero in terms of energy production by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs. Creating millions of jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage. By having a new infrastructure that in fact is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris accord. I will join the Paris accord because with us out look what's happening. It's all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no no relationship with foreign policy. Brazil, the rainforest to Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More, more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's admitted the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars. And say, ‘Here's $20 billion. Stop, stop, tearing down the forest. And if you don't, then you're going to have significant economic consequences’.\n\n1:17:52 WALLACE\n\nWhat about the argument that President Trump basically says that you have to balance, environmental interests, and economic interests? And he's drawn a line\n\n1:18:02 BIDEN\n\nBut if he hadn't drawn a line. He still, for example, makes sure that we- He wants to make sure that methane is not a problem. We could, you could now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that we don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. He says that, the fact that it's all true and here’s the deal --\n\n1:18:22 TRUMP\n\nHe’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it's not 2 billion or 20 billion as you said, it's $100 trillion.\n\n1:18:31 BIDEN\n\nI'm talking about -\n\n1:18:31 TRUMP\n\nYou wanna rip down buildings and rebuild the buildings -- where airplanes are out of business. Where there are two car systems or where they want to take out the cows.\n\n1:18:40 BIDEN\n\nThat’s not true. Not true. Not true. Not true.\n\n1:18:43 TRUMP\n\nThat's not true either, right? Now, this is a, this is a 100. That's more money than our country could make in a hundred years.\n\n1:18:50 BIDEN\n\nThat is simply not true.\n\n1:18:55 WALLACE\n\nLet me -- Let me -- Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, the president said, I think some people who support the president would say, ‘That sounds like it's going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.’\n\n1:19:18 BIDEN\n\nWhat it's gonna do, it’s gonna create thousands and millions of jobs. Good-paying jobs-\n\n1:19:22 WALLACE\n\nLet him finish, sir.\n\n1:19:23 BIDEN\n\nHe doesn’t know how to do that. The fact it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs. And these tax incentives to people to weatherize, where he wants to get her get rid of, is going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we're paying now to deal with the hurricanes, with a deal with- By the way he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, ‘Maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, they may' --\n\n1:19:44 TRUMP\n\nI never said that you made it up. You make up a lot.\n\n1:19:46 BIDEN\n\nAnd here's the deal, we are going to be in a position where we can create, hard, hard good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes rising seas. We're in real trouble. Look what's happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn't happen before. There because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world's problem. We in fact- But the rest of the world we got to get them to come along. That's why we have to get back into, back into the Paris accord.\n\n1:20:32 WALLACE\n\nAll right, gentlemen.\n\n1:20:33 TRUMP\n\nChris, so why didn't he do it for 47 years? You were vice president. Why didn't you get the world- China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We're supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements, the Green New Deal is 100 trillion dollar plan --\n\n1:20:48 BIDEN\n\nThat is not my plan. The Green New Deal is not my plan.\n\n1:20:56 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen, gentleman --\n\n1:20:58 TRUMP\n\nYou said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it. What he did is he said- He called the military stupid bastards\n\n1:21:06 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Vice President -- Please, stop.\n\n1:21:15 TRUMP\n\nI would never say that.\n\n1:21:18 WALLACE\n\nMr. Vice President answer his question his final question.\n\n1:21:21 BIDEN\n\nThe final question is I can't remember which of all is real.\n\n1:21:24 WALLACE\n\nI’m having a little trouble myself. But about the economy, and about this question of what it's going to cost. The Green New Deal and the idea of what, what your environmental changes to --\n\n1:21:38 BIDEN\n\nThe Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. You're not going to build plants that in fact are great polluting plans.\n\n1:21:44 WALLACE\n\nDo you support the Green New Deal?\n\n1:21:46 BIDEN\n\nPardon me?\n\n1:21:47 WALLACE\n\nDo you support the Green New Deal?\n\n1:21:49 BIDEN\n\nNo, I don't support the Green New Deal.\n\n1:21:50 TRUMP\n\nOh you don't? Well that’s a big statement. You just lost the radical left.\n\n1:21:55 BIDEN\n\nI support the Biden plan that I put forward.\n\n1:21:59 WALLACE\n\nOK.\n\n1:22:00 BIDEN\n\nThe Biden Plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal.\n\n1:22:02 WALLACE\n\nAll right, gentlemen, final segment. Election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks, because it'll not only be the election day but also counting some ballots mailing ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next President will be the legitimate winner of this election? In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first.\n\n1:22:41 BIDEN\n\nPrepared to let people vote. You should go to Iwillvote.com. Decide how they're going to vote, when they're going to vote and what means by which they're going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, as well as the FBI director, says there's no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that they're going to be millions of people, because of COVID, that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots, like he does by the way. He sits behind the Resolute desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance, the polls are open on time and they'll pull stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to scare people into thinking that it's not gonna be legitimate. Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote. Vote. Vote. If you're able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you're able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you because you will- He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. Whether or not when the votes are counted, and they're all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted.If I lose, it will be accepted. But, by the way, if, in fact, he says he's not sure what he's gonna accept, let me tell you something, it doesn't matter. Because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He's going to go. He won’t stay in power. It won't happen. It won't happen. So vote. Just make sure you understand you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change or are we gonna get four more years of these lies?\n\n1:24:31 WALLACE\n\nMr. President, two minutes.\n\n1:24:32 TRUMP\n\nSo when I listened to Joe talking about a transition, there's been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition. Because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started on the day I won and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with the First Lady, they were a disaster, a grace to our country. And we've caught them. We've caught them all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that because we caught you in a sense. And President Obama was sitting in the Oval office. He knew about it too so don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots is concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot. Okay, so listen it is okay. You're soliciting, you're asking they send it back, you send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited, they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some with the name Trump, just happen to have the name Trump, just the other day. In wastepaper baskets. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two, in a Democratic area they sent out 1000 ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's nice for November 3, you're watching and you see who won the election. And I think we're gonna do well because people are really happy with the job they've done. But you know what, we won't know, we might not know for months. Because these balances are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election can be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. A fraud, and it's a shame. And can you imagine where they say, ‘you have to have your ballot in by November 10’. November 10. That means 7 days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states with that. All run by Democrats. All run by Democrats. It’s a rigged election.\n\n1:26:40 WALLACE\n\nOkay, okay, sir. President Trump, you’re gonna be able to continue. You have been charging for months and mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it's going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, the last midterm election, 3, million people voted mail-in voting. That was a quarter, more than a quarter, of all the voters that year cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a justice Barrett, to settle on a disputes?\n\n1:27:17 TRUMP\n\nYeah, I think we're getting them to look at the ballots, differently. I don't think I want them in terms of the election itself, but for the ballots I'd say. Because what’s happening is incredible. I just heard, I read today where 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They, they take them ‘we don't like them. we don't like them’.\n\n1:27:36 WALLACE\n\nThere are millions of ballots going out right now.\n\n1:27:39 TRUMP\n\nYou do a solicited ballot.\n\n1:27:42 WALLACE\n\nNo, no, I'm asking you about the fact that millions of people --\n\n1:27:46 TRUMP\n\nYou go and vote. You go and vote, like they used to do. You either do a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in and sending it back in and your sending. We have mailmen with lots of a- Did you see what's going on, take a look at West Virginia, mail-in ballots. They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country. This is no -- This is not going to end well.\n\n1:28:12 BIDEN\n\nThere is no evidence of that. Five states have had mail-in ballots in the last decade or sol, including two republican states. And you don't have to solicit the ballot. It's sent to you, and sent to your home. All we're saying is, they're saying is, that there has to be a postmark, by the time by Election Day. If it just doesn't get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes because-\n\n1:28:38 TRUMP\n\nYou’re wrong. You’re wrong\n\n1:28:41 WALLACE\n\nAnd I want to continue with you on this -- Vice President Biden --\n\n1:28:44 TRUMP\n\nChris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that\n\n1:28:45 WALLACE\n\nExcuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years, with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable number, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots, are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out or there is some other irregularity they just see through that deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a justice Barrett will settle any disputes?\n\n1:29:12 BIDEN\n\nI'm concerned that any court would settle this. Because here's the deal, when you, when you get a ballot and you fill it out, you're supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn't know, you have someone say that this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you when the, before the ballot is thrown out, that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot, because someone made a mistake in not dotting the correct i. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say to you ‘that is totally legitimate’\n\n1:29:46 WALLACE\n\nAlright --\n\n1:29:49 TRUMP\n\nWhen you have 80 million ballots sent in and swamping the system -- You know it can't be done, you know it can’t. And already there have been --\n\n1:29:56 WALLACE\n\nAlright, so wait a minute. Final question is, in eight states, election workers are prohibited, currently by law in eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them, until Election Day. That means that it's likely, because there's going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is. And it could be days, it could be weeks.\n\n1:30:25 TRUMP\n\nCould be months.\n\n1:30:28 WALLACE\n\n-- until we know who the new president is. So I first for you sir. Finally, for the, for the vice president. I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge our supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? Will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump will go first.\n\n1:30:54 TRUMP\n\nI’m urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went into watch, they were called poll watchers, a very safe very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging, I am urging my people- I hope it's gonna be a fair election. If it's a fair election, I am 100% on board. But if I see 10s of thousands of ballots being manipulated. I can't go along with that.\n\n1:32:31 WALLACE\n\nDoes that mean you are gonna tell your people to take to the streets?\n\n1:32:32 TRUMP\n\nI’ll tell you what it means. It means you have a fraudulent election. You're not equipped to, these people aren't equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found balance in a wastepaper basket days ago and they all had the name, military fellas. They were military, they all had the name, Trump on them. You think that’s good?\n\n1:31:51 WALLACE\n\nVice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?\n\n1:32:05 BIDEN\n\nYes. Here's the deal, they count the ballots, as you pointed out some of these ballots in some states can't even be open until Election Day. And if there's thousands of ballots, it’s gonna take time to do it. And by the way, our military. They've been voting, by ballots since the end of the Civil War in effect. And that's what's happened gonna happen. Why was it not, why is it for them to somehow not fraudulent? It's the same process. It's honest. No one has established at all, that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots. That somehow it's a fraudulent --\n\n1:32:41 TRUMP\n\nIt's already been established. Look at --\n\n1:32:45 WALLACE\n\nYou had an opportunity to respond. Go ahead.\n\n1:32:48 BIDEN\n\nHe has no idea what he's talking about. Here's the deal, the fact is, I will accept it and he will too. Because you know why? Because once the winner is declared, after all the, all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that'll be the end of it. That'll be the end of it. And if it's me, in fact, fine. And if it's not me, I'll support the outcome. And I'll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I'll be president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy --\n\n1:33:16 TRUMP\n\nI want us to --\n\n1:33:21 WALLACE\n\nGentlemen? Will you say that’s the end of it? This is the end of this debate. We're going leave it there. To be continued in more debates as we move on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it's been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University, and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow. October 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9pm Eastern that we hope you watch. Until then, thank you and good night.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/26/coronavirus-live-updates-senate-stimulus-us-deaths-donald-trump/5079447002/", "title": "Coronavirus updates: US surpasses China in deaths ...", "text": "China is no longer the global leader in cases of the virus that originated on its soil. The United States, with about one-fourth the number of people of the world's most populous country, overtook China and Italy in confirmed coronavirus cases on Thursday.\n\nThat dubious distinction took place as jobless claims smashed a record and U.S. deaths neared 1,300 as the coronavirus tightened its grip on America. Still, the prospect of a stimulus package soon becoming reality helped propel a third consecutive stock market rally.\n\nDespite the continued increase in cases of COVID-19, President Donald Trump repeated his recent message that the country needs to get back to work.\n\n“The mortality rate is way, way down,” Trump said. “The people that actually die, that percentage is much lower than I expected.”\n\nThe Labor Department, in announcing the unemployment claims numbers for last week, said what Americans already knew — that layoffs hit the hospitality and food service industries particularly hard. Other industries that struggled included health care and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing industries, Labor said.\n\nCongress was trying to supply a ray of hope. The House is scheduled to take up a Senate-passed, $2 trillion emergency aid proposal Friday. Swift passage was expected — after an initial hangup, the package flew through the Senate on Wednesday night by a vote of 96-0. Trump has expressed a willingness to sign the measure.\n\nConfirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. had surpassed 85,000 by early Friday, leading to 1,296 deaths. The global death toll was more than 24,000, with confirmed cases over 532,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.\n\nDaily coronavirus updates: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nOur live blog is being updated throughout the day.

More headlines:\n\nUS becomes world leader in COVID-19 cases, surpassing China and Italy\n\nThe U.S. surged past China and Italy to become the planet's most infected nation Thursday, a stark milestone in the coronavirus era — and a reminder of its deadly, culture-changing effects on American life.\n\nPart of the reason for the nation's top ranking is cause and effect: The U.S. has drastically ramped up its testing protocols to identify infected people and those who may be carriers of the virus. As testing has increased, so has the number of confirmed cases.\n\nBut the new numbers also reflect a slow roll-out of the measures to combat the virus, especially an initial lack of testing capabilities that left officials unable to identify how quickly the disease was spreading and where to focus resources.\n\n– Mike James\n\nAmerican Airlines flight attendant, 65, dies of coronavirus\n\nPaul Frishkorn, a Philadelphia-based American Airlines flight attendant and union representative, has died from coronavirus, the flight attendants union confirmed Thursday.\n\n\"It is with deep sadness we report that one of our own … has passed away from Covid-19,\" Lori Bassani, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents 27,000 flight attendants at American Airlines, said in a statement.\n\nFrishkorn, 65, was described as a tireless advocate for the flight attendant corps who was spending time in the Philadelphia crew room \"answering questions and assisting our members through this difficult time\" before he fell ill, according to the statement.\n\nSpeaking by phone to USA TODAY, Bassani said that Frishkorn's death has increased the already deep concern for flight attendants working amid the highly contagious virus.\n\n\"When this hits one of your own, it sheds a whole new light on the coronavirus,\" said Bassani. \"This does spread more fear among our ranks. This is a killer virus, unlike any we have experienced.\"\n\n– Bryan Alexander\n\nDeath rate in New Orleans soars; city could become next epicenter\n\nThe number of known coronavirus cases in Louisiana jumped to 2,305 on Thursday, an increase of 510 cases from Wednesday, and a total of 83 deaths, according to the Louisiana Department of Health. Nearly half of Louisiana's cases -- 997 -- came from New Orleans.\n\nThrongs of revelers may have brought the coronavirus to New Orleans during Mardi Gras celebrations.\n\nBut the city’s poverty rate, lack of healthcare and affordable housing, coupled with high rates of residents with preexisting medical conditions, may be driving its explosive growth and could make it the next U.S. epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nThe city reported Thursday that a 17-year-old teen died after contracting the virus, bringing the city's coronavirus death tally to 46 — more than half of the state's total death count.\n\nNew Orleans Homeland Security Director Collin Arnold said hospital capacity in the New Orleans region is dwindling and the city will need additional hospital beds within weeks.\n\n– Rick Jervis, Maria Clark and Lorenzo Reyes\n\n3 migrant children in US custody test positive for coronavirus in New York\n\nThree unaccompanied minor children in U.S. custody in New York have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Thursday.\n\nThe children, whose ages and nationalities weren't released, are in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The office is responsible for housing migrant minors.\n\nThe agency said it is doing an evaluation of the children and will not release them from New York care provider facilities. It has stopped placements of unaccompanied minor children in the states of California, New York, and Washington, which have been the hardest hit by the coronavirus. With more than 30,000 cases in New York, the state has become the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic in the United States.\n\n– Monsy Alvarado, NorthJersey.com\n\nStimulus package checks up to $1,200 for most Americans expected soon\n\nThe House is expected to vote Friday on the stimulus package and passage would send the legislation to President Donald Trump for his signature. Once signed, it is expected money will be distributed in the next three weeks.\n\nHighlights of the bill include direct payments of up to $1,200 for most individuals and $2,400 for most married couples filing jointly, with an extra $500 for each child.\n\nHere's how you can calculate the amount of stimulus money your household can expect.\n\nUnemployment insurance benefits would be expanded, increasing the maximum benefit by $600 a week for up to four months. Benefits would be available to workers who are part-time, self-employed or part of the gig economy. People who are still unemployed after state benefits end could get an additional 13 weeks of help. Food assistance programs would get a boost, and homeowners with federally backed mortgages would be protected from foreclosures for as long as 180 days. Students with federal loans could suspend payments until October.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Ledyard King\n\nUS stocks surge for third day in a row despite 'horrible' unemployment news\n\nU.S. stocks notched their first three-day rally in six weeks on hopes that Congress will quickly approve a coronavirus rescue package for the economy while the outbreak in China is showing signs that it has been largely contained.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1,351.62 points, or 6.4%, to close at 22,552.17. The blue-chip average has advanced more than 20% over the past three days, its biggest three-day gain since 1931. The Standard & Poor’s 500 added 6.2% to finish at 2,630.07.\n\nThe gains came despite the daunting number of claims following a wave of layoffs from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Record unemployment data is horrible news, but we knew it was going to be terrible,\" said Joe Conroy, founder of Maryland-based Harford Retirement Planners. \"Most people agree that we’re in a recession. What's helped prop up the market are signs that China is starting to contain the virus.\"\n\n– Jessica Menton\n\nRecord 3.3 million Americans apply for unemployment benefits amid coronavirus\n\nThe number of Americans filing initial applications for unemployment benefits jumped nearly twelvefold to a record 3.3 million last week, the Labor Department said, offering the most vivid evidence yet of the coronavirus’s widespread damage to the economy. The total was well above the 1.5 million claims economists had forecast, according to the median estimate of those surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nThe pandemic has set off the most abrupt near-shutdown of the economy in history. Many restaurants, shops, movie theaters, sports arenas and other gathering spots were compelled to close their doors or scale back service – and lay off staff.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci goes live on Instagram with NBA star Steph Curry\n\nIn what is arguably the most important play of his 11-year pro basketball career, Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors hosted Dr. Anthony Fauci on a Thursday Instagram Live video.\n\nNearly 50,000 viewers tuned in — including former President Barack Obama, pop star Justin Bieber, rapper Common and former teammates Andre Iguodala and Leandro Barbosa. More will likely watch the archived version. Either way, they will have witnessed something that does not usually match what they see on social media.\n\nFor nearly 28 minutes, Curry asked Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, questions about COVID-19, testing and social distancing. Fauci gave precise answers to all of them.\n\nFauci explained the difference between the flu and the coronavirus, which he considered \"much more serious.\" Although young people are not as vulnerable to COVID-19, Fauci argued they should still follow social distancing rules because of the rare chance they could become ill and the likely chance they could pass the virus to someone older. Fauci predicted that large events, including the NBA season, will not take place until \"the country as a whole is turning that corner.\"\n\nFauci has been a popular TV guest this week, and is scheduled to appear on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah late Thursday night. Earlier Thursday, he spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper during the network's coronavirus town hall, explaining that Trump's desire to open the country by Easter was an \"aspiration projection.\" Fauci added that Trump is listening to medical experts, including Fauci, and understands they have to evaluate the virus's impact \"in real time.\"\n\n– Mark Medina\n\nDeath toll rises in New York\n\nOne hundred people in New York state died Wednesday from the coronavirus, the state's single deadliest day since the virus at the center of a global pandemic first hit, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. The surge of deaths pushed New York's total count to 385 since the beginning of March, when the state found its first confirmed case of COVID-19.\n\nNew York remains the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak with 37,258 confirmed cases – almost half of the national total as of Thursday afternoon. Cuomo said the outbreak's peak in the state is still at least two weeks away, and the state was battling to make room in hospitals and obtain ventilators.\n\n\"I don’t want to sugarcoat the situation,\" Cuomo said. \"The situation is not easy. But easy times don’t forge character. It’s the tough times that forge character.”\n\n– Joseph Spector\n\nIs Florida the next New York?\n\nFlorida has come under fire after its beaches remained jammed with spring breakers last week, and Gov. Ron DeSantis has ignored calls to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order.\n\nThat may contribute to the state becoming the next hot spot for COVID-19, a chilling possibility considering the elderly are the most likely to die from the disease and Florida is home to nearly four million people 65 and over, the second-highest number in the U.S. behind California.\n\nHospitals and doctors around the state say they still don't have nearly enough testing kits and can't get the ones they have analyzed fast enough, echoing complaints from state health officials across the country. Health officials have completed 27,000 tests so far in Florida, while New York is doing more than 18,000 tests a day.\n\n– Alan Gomez\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot: 40,000 coronavirus hospitalizations expected\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot implored Chicago residents to “stay home, save lives” in an address to the city, warning there could be tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We could be expecting upwards of 40,000 hospitalizations in the coming weeks,'' Lightfoot said. \"Not 40,000 cases, but 40,000 people who require acute care in a hospital setting. That number will break our healthcare system.”\n\nCrowds of hundreds of people have been seen congregating along the city’s lakefront in recent days, which a fiery Lightfoot called a “blatant violation” of Illinois’s stay-at-home order. She warned future violators would be arrested and Thursday closed the city’s lakefront trail, 606 trail and Riverwalk, along with adjacent parks and beaches.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday approved a major disaster declaration for Illinois, freeing federal funding.\n\n– Grace Hauck\n\nTesla to make ventilators; hockey helmet firm to make face masks\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said the company's solar-panel factory in Buffalo, New York, hopes to begin ventilator production \"as soon as humanly possible.\" Musk tweeted that \"we will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.\" New York actually invested $750 million to help build the plant. Cuomo said the state, which has about 12,000 ventilators, may need as many as 40,000 in the next few weeks as the coronavirus outbreak races toward its peak in the state.\n\nAnd Bauer, a hockey equipment manufacturing company, said it has shifted its focus to make products like masks and shields for medical professionals.\n\n– Joseph Spector and Chris Bumbaca\n\n2-month-old Tennessean tests positive for COVID-19, has mild symptoms\n\nA 2-month-old who has tested positive for COVID-19 in Nashville could be the youngest pandemic patient in the nation, officials say. City health officials said metro Nashville had 36 new cases in 24 hours. Alex Jahangir, the city's coronavirus task force chair, said the infant has mild symptoms and is home \"doing well.\"\n\nChildren appear to be at lower risk for the harshest effects of COVID-19 than adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but they are not immune to the disease.\n\n– Yihyun Jeong\n\nMore coronavirus news, tips and information from USA TODAY:\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/02/13/covid-news-coronavirus-restrictions-rolled-back-nevada-ohio/6745057002/", "title": "COVID news: Coronavirus restrictions rolled back in Ohio, Nevada", "text": "Several states and cities rolled back COVID-19 restrictions this week.\n\nIn Montana, Gov.

Charlie Baker, who warned against offers of help from complete strangers. \"If you’re contacted by somebody soliciting to take you to a site, please report it to the authorities,\" Baker said Thursday.\n\nSeniors should accept help only from someone they trust, he said. Many senior centers in the state are offering help. Some officials called on the Republican governor to put the vaccine companion program on hold.\n\n\"While it may have been well-meaning, it took less than 24 hours for this new state policy to be abused,\" Boston City Councilor Andrea Campbell in a statement.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Steve Owens said a group of lawmakers have urged Baker to pause the program, noting that he saw an ad from someone offering $250 to drive an eligible resident to a vaccination site.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nOxford University testing vaccine in children\n\nThe University of Oxford plans to test its COVID-19 vaccine – which is being produced and distributed by AstraZeneca – in children for the first time, becoming the latest vaccine developer to assess whether its coronavirus shot is effective in young people.\n\nThe trial announced Saturday seeks to recruit 300 volunteers between the ages of 6 and 17, with up to 240 receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and the remainder a control meningitis vaccine.\n\nAndrew Pollard, chief researcher on the Oxford vaccine trial, says that while most children don’t get severely ill from COVID-19, \"it is important to establish the safety and immune response to the vaccine in children and young people as some children may benefit from vaccination.\"\n\n– Associated Press\n\nBacklogged COVID-19 death reports propel US to single-day record\n\nOhio's efforts to clean up backlogged death reports propelled the U.S. to a stunning single-day record of 5,443 COVID-19 death reports on Thursday, Johns Hopkins University data shows. The previous record was 4,436 cases reported exactly a month earlier.\n\nOhio reported 63 deaths on Tuesday, 721 deaths on Wednesday, and 2,559 deaths on Thursday.\n\nDeaths in the U.S. have been slowly dropping since a peak several weeks ago. The nation is reporting an average of fewer than 100,000 new cases per day now. That's still more than 1 new case every second, but it's less than half the rate the country was reporting in January.\n\n– Mike Stucka\n\nData from California shows Black people get low percentage of shots\n\nCalifornia released much-awaited statewide race and ethnicity data for COVID-19 Friday, and the results show that Black people so far account for just 2.8% of all people who have received at least one shot.\n\nWhite people have received nearly 33 percent, according to the data collected by the California Department of Public Health.\n\nThe data did not immediately explain the disparity. It showed also that Asian Americans who have received at least one vaccine dose account for 13.1%, Latinos 15.8%, and multi-race 13.9%.\n\nCalifornia – and several other states – have come under fire in recent weeks for lagging behind in reporting data on how vaccinations are being delivered across ethnic groups. A lack of data is further masking vaccination rollout transparency, health equity researchers say, and the data deficit is hurting those most vulnerable. So far, less than 20 states are releasing vaccination counts by race and ethnicity, and the data is incomplete.\n\nCDC guidelines to reopen schools: Vaccinations not a must\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says public schools can safely reopen amid the pandemic if a host of safety measures are taken including keeping 6 feet of physical distancing inside school buildings where possible. And while the vaccination of teachers is important, according to the CDC, it isn't a must for in-person instruction.\n\nThe CDC on Friday released new highly anticipated guidelines for reopening schools that are still closed and conducting classes virtually as the COVID-19 virus rages. President Joe Biden has repeatedly pointed to the guidelines as key to his goal of reopening the majority of schools within his first 100 days.\n\nThe guidelines – billed as a \"roadmap\" and a \"one-stop shop\" to safely reopen schools – are not federal mandates, but rather \"recommendations based on the best-available evidence.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nAfter losing homes amid COVID-19, more people are living in cars, RVs\n\nAmericans are being driven into their vehicles by pandemic-fueled woes. And their ranks are likely to grow as the government safety net frays and evictions and foreclosures rise.\n\n“It’s in times of crisis that the fragility of our systems are laid bare,” said Graham Pruss, a postdoctoral scholar with the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the UC San Francisco Center for Vulnerable Populations.\n\nEven before COVID, millions struggled to afford a decent place to live. The pandemic has made the housing crisis even worse, says Pruss. He expects a surge in the number of people without permanent homes taking refuge in cars, vans, RVs and campers – and not just in the nation’s most expensive regions such as the San Francisco Bay Area where vehicles have increasingly become a form of affordable housing, but all over the country.

We went through a rough patch after Memorial Day and the July 4th holiday, but we’ve been able to get a better handle on the virus once the Governor issued a statewide mask order and the increased vigilance of most Alabamians who practice social distancing and are mindful of the danger of this virus. That said we would like to do better and can do better. There has been far too much loss of life—more than 2,400 Alabamians have died, as well as more than 200,000 Americans. There is no question that other, northern states suffered in the early onset of COVID-19, when there was little consensus about how best to stop the spread. In the early days, far too many—in elected office, in the media and elsewhere—were quick to politicize the virus and that made a coordinated response more difficult. The conversation became more about how the virus would affect poll numbers and the stock market than how it would impact our lives and livelihoods. From day one, I have tried to take politics out of it, follow the medical experts, and focus on stopping the spread of the virus and securing relief for those who need it most.\n\nQ: How do you rate the federal government’s response to the outbreak, and how did it affect the caseload in Alabama?\n\nEveryone knows the administration could have handled the healthcare response better, especially early on. We lost several weeks in getting tests out because we did not accept WHO testing and our first batch of tests were spoiled. We did not properly allocate testing or personal protective equipment (PPE) so most states were forced to compete against each other with no federal coordination. I also had hoped for an earlier and more aggressive use of the Defense Production Act but that did not materialize. I do think the federal action has improved, and I am hopeful that Operation Warpspeed will be ready to roll out for the distribution of a vaccine once one is approved. Until we do have a vaccine it is critical that Governor Ivey’s mask order and Safer At Home order remain in effect to help get the virus under control.\n\nWith regard to Congressional response, I believed it was very good early on. We acted very quickly in a bipartisan way to pass the CARES Act. Unfortunately, things bogged down in May, and the issue became more partisan. I was very disappointed that nothing was accomplished as the unemployment program came to an end, schools reopened and local governments began laying off workers. I still believe that Congress should act as soon as possible to deliver relief to families, businesses and institutions, like schools, hospitals, and the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nQ: Do you believe the April lockdown was an appropriate response to the virus? Should it have been longer or shorter, and why?\n\nI think it was the right decision based on the information available at the time. We had to react to a rapidly spreading virus that we knew to be deadly. Some people injected politics into the lockdowns from the get-go and made it harder to do the right thing to keep people safe. We know now that these lockdowns worked, but we also know they were painful to the economy. I wish the administration would have better used that time to ramp up testing and contact tracing so that we could have avoided some of the increases in the summer numbers like we saw in Alabama. That said, I have always maintained that we could re-open the economy but do it safely if we followed the CDC guidelines.\n\nQ: Do you support Gov. Kay Ivey’s mask order, issued in mid-July? Why or why not?\n\nYes, I strongly commend Governor Ivey for implementing a statewide mask order which I believe has helped in our efforts to lessen the spread of COVID-19. It is imperative that we continue to wear our masks and socially distance. It took her issuing an order for people to fully grasp the significance without injecting politics.\n\nQ: Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed the CARES Act in late March. Debate about a second relief package bill has focused on supplements to unemployment and payments to ensure people stay at home. What level of federal unemployment adjustment (if any) do you support, and why?\n\nI believe we should re-start the $600 per week in unemployment relief that was originally authorized through the CARES Act, and it should be included in the next COVID-19 relief package—but I don’t believe this emergency unemployment should be the sole priority of relief legislation. Many Americans lost their jobs, through no fault of their own. People are hurting right now and need this $600 per week to help put food on the table. A young man called my office recently and told us he was selling his plasma to make ends meet. It doesn’t need to be that way, but because Senator McConnell refuses to act we have not seen meaningful relief brought to the Senate Floor in months. It should also be remembered that these benefits are going straight back into the economy. People are paying their rent or mortgage, buying food and other necessities. The extended unemployment certainly helps individuals and families get through this crisis but also helps keep our economy going.\n\nQ: Alabama today (Friday, Sept.18) reported that unemployment in the state had reached 5.6%. Does this lessen the urgency of an aid package, and why or why not?\n\nI am pleased to see that there has been progress in terms of the unemployment rate, but every economist I’ve heard from agrees that the economy will not reach full strength until we first get the virus under control. With school starting back up, and flu season approaching, we cannot let our guard down. I believe that we absolutely need another relief package. An influx of funds to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) will help mitigate future job losses, as would relief for state and local governments. Many businesses have stated that a round of layoffs are likely in October and many cities and counties are feeling the pinch and will do the same thing. We sure can’t start laying off first responders in the middle of this crisis. What we don’t want to see happen is any decline in the progress we have made, and that is likely without further government help.\n\nQ: What other issues, if any, should be addressed in a second relief package? Several issues have been raised from aid to state and local governments to election security to litigation protections for businesses.\n\nWe must pass substantive legislation that funds not only the accelerated search for a vaccine but protects the lives and livelihoods of people In Alabama and across the country. I believe Hazard Pay for frontline workers is a critical piece of any relief package. I have co-sponsored legislation and been a strong advocate for economic relief to individuals, families, small businesses, local governments, and vital institutions such as schools, hospitals and the U.S. Postal Service. I have also pushed for Medicaid expansion during this pandemic to help more than 300,000 Alabamians access health coverage.\n\nFor months, I have been calling for increased relief for state and local governments, more funding for testing, and Hazard Pay for our frontline workers. We also must continue to support the CDC and NIH in order to ensure that we are maximizing our ability to effectively combat this virus.\n\nEarly in the outbreak, there was widespread discussion about expanding the manufacture of personal protective equipment in the United States. What specific steps could be taken at the federal level to do so?\n\nI am leading that important discussion. In late April, I urged Governor Ivey to create a healthcare manufacturing task force that would help identify the best ways for Alabama to utilize its existing manufacturing infrastructure to begin producing medical supplies and PPE. We’ve seen some businesses, like HomTex in Cullman, adapt their facility for making health care equipment. But we’ve also seen around the country that smaller companies who want to do what they feel is the patriotic duty just aren’t able to make it work financially.\n\nIn May, I introduced the Build Health Care Equipment in America Act to incentivize the reopening of idle factories and put them to use producing critical health supplies, like PPE, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe bottom line is that regardless of how long this pandemic lasts, America’s need for more healthcare equipment is going to be with us from this point on.\n\nQ: Public health departments around the nation say that they lack the staff and funding to educate and administer a COVID-19 vaccine, should one become available. What steps would you support to provide health departments with the resources to distribute any COVID-19 vaccine that is developed?\n\nDistributing and administering a COVID-19 vaccine to millions of Americans will be a massive, complex process that will take cooperation from all levels of government and the private sector. We should be planning our distribution process now. Congress should include additional funding for public health departments in the next COVID-19 legislative package to ensure they have the staff and supplies necessary to help with vaccination efforts. I have been and continue to be a strong advocate for increased healthcare infrastructure, and the pandemic has really put a spotlight on the inadequacies in our current healthcare system.\n\nQ: What has the pandemic shown you about the American health care system? Based on what you’ve learned, what steps should the federal government take to prepare for a future outbreak?\n\nCOVID-19 has shown us that we are all connected, that my health depends on my neighbor’s health, and that our economy depends on the health of the community. It has also put a spotlight on the disparities in healthcare access along racial and socio-economic lines. The virus has had a disproportionate effect on African Americans, and much of this can be attributed to a lack of access to quality and affordable healthcare. COVID-19 has also highlighted the fragile state of rural healthcare in Alabama and across the country. I have long been a proponent of expanding Medicaid and still believe that would raise the level of the health of Alabamians while also bringing in billions of federal dollars.\n\nIn order to be prepared for the next pandemic, we must learn from the response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative that we have a clear and transparent federal response, and this must include a plan for better coordination between the federal government and state and local governments. This includes re-establishing the White House pandemic office to coordinate such a crisis that was shut down by the Trump Administration.\n\nWe must work to bring medical and pharmaceutical manufacturing back to America to ensure that we are more adequately equipped to handle another crisis like the current one.\n\nWhile the World Health Organization has not been perfect in its response to COVID-19, I do believe that we need to rejoin and continue to fund the World Health Organization to make it more effective. This will help make sure that we are doing all that we can to continue to develop strategies and research that will help us fight and coordinate future pandemic responses.\n\nSimilarly, we must continue to support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There have been issues with coordination and guidance from the CDC in the response to COVID-19, but I believe that we have the opportunity and the obligation to work to improve how the CDC operates. In the event of another pandemic, a strong and effective CDC will be critical to saving lives.\n\nFinally, expanding Medicaid in Alabama would raise the level of health of Alabamians and thus allow them to better fend off any future viruses.\n\nContact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Brian Lyman at 334-240-0185 or blyman@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/08/vice-presidential-debate-full-transcript-mike-pence-and-kamala-harris/5920773002/", "title": "Vice presidential debate: Full transcript of Mike Pence and Kamala ...", "text": "This is a transcript of the 90-minute debate between Vice President Mike Pence and vice presidential nominee Sen.

From the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2020, sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m Susan Page of USA TODAY. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy. In Kingsbury Hall tonight we have a small and socially distant audience and we've taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in the audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they've agreed to express that enthusiasm, only twice. At the end of the debate and now when I introduce the candidates. Please welcome California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nPENCE\n\nThank you.\n\n01:05 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris and Vice President Pence thank you for being here. We're meeting as President Trump and the First Lady continue to undergo treatment in Washington after testing positive for COVID-19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the coronavirus. The two campaigns in the Commission on Presidential Debates have agreed to the ground rules for tonight. I'm here to enforce them on behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching. One note, no one in either campaign, or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance what topics will raise or what questions I’ll ask. This ninety-minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about 10 minutes each. I'll begin the segment by posing a question to each of you, sometimes the same question, sometimes a different question on the same topic. You will then have two minutes to answer, without interruption by me or the other candidate. Then we'll take six minutes or so to discuss the issue. At that point, although there will always be more to say, we'll move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is lively, but Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil. These are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectable exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Let's begin with the ongoing pandemic that has caused our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control. Over the past week, Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had more COVID cases over the past seven days than in the week before. Nine states have set new records. Even if a vaccine is released soon, the next administration will face hard choices. What would a Biden administration do in January and February that a Trump administration wouldn't do? Would you impose new lockdowns for businesses and schools in hotspots? A federal mandate to wear masks? You have two minutes to respond, without interruption.\n\n03:15 HARRIS\n\nThank you Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. We're looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people who in the last several months had to file for unemployment. And here's the thing, on January 28, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it's lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didn't tell you. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28, as opposed to March 13, what they knew what you might have done to prepare? They knew and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said you're on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, you’re on the other side of his ledger if you don't. And in spite of all of that, today they still don't have a plan. They still don't have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that and frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to reelection, based on this.\n\n05:21 PAGE\n\nThank you- Thank you, Senator Harris. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, more than 210,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since February. The US death toll as a percentage of our population is higher than that of almost every other wealthy nation on Earth. For instance, our death rate is two and a half times that of Canada, next door. You head the administration's Coronavirus Task Force. Why is the U.S. death toll, as a percentage of our population, higher than that of almost every other wealthy country? And you have two minutes to respond, without interruption.\n\n05:55 PENCE\n\nSusan Thank you. And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it's a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of Americans first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator Joe Biden, Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe it’s saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that’ve been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump's leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally 10s of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. It’s saved countless American lives.\n\n08:05 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice Pres- Thank you Vice President Pence- Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, would you like to respond?\n\n08:11 HARRIS\n\nOh, absolutely. Whatever the Vice President's claiming the administration has done, clearly it hasn't worked when you're looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss. And you know, the vice president is the head of the task force and knew, on January 28, how serious this was. And then, big thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed, the vice president said when asked ‘Well, why didn’t y'all tell anybody?’, he said ‘Because the president wanted people to remain calm’.\n\nPAGE\n\nWell, let's go –\n\nHARRIS\n\nNo, I – Susan, I – This is important –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, I have to weigh in here –\n\n08:53 HARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President, I’m speaking.\n\nPENCE\n\nI have to weigh in –\n\nHARRIS\n\nI'm speaking. I wanna –\n\n08:58 PAGE\n\nYou have 15 more more seconds and then we'll give the vice president a chance to respond.\n\n09:01 HARRIS\n\nThank you. So I want to ask the American people, how calm were you when you were panicked about where you're going to get your next roll of toilet paper? How calm were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn't know when they could go back?\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Sen Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\nHow calm were you when your children couldn't see your parents because you were afraid they could kill them?\n\n09:19 PAGE\n\nLet’s give Vice President Pence a chance to respond. Vice President Pence, you have one minute to respond.\n\n09:22 PENCE\n\nYou know there's not a day gone by that I haven’t thought of every American family that’s lost a loved one. And I want all of you to know that you'll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn't worked, that's a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made.\n\nHARRIS\n\nI’m referring to your president.\n\nPENCE\n\nThe reality – If I may, if I may finish, Senator. The reality is Dr. Fauci said everything that he told the President in the Oval Office, the president told the American people. Now President Trump I will tell you his boundless confidence in the American people and he always spoke with confidence that we'll get through this together. But when you say it hasn't worked- When Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birks and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said if the President didn't take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. But that's the reality.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nThey also said to us if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans.\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nNow, one life lost is too many, Susan.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you –\n\nPENCE\n\nBut the American people, I believe, deserve credit for the sacrifices that they have made, putting the health of their family and their neighbors first, our doctors our nurses, our first responders –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and I'm going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done.\n\n10:43 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence, you in the front row in a Rose Garden event 11 days ago, at what seems to have been a super-spreader event for senior administration and congressional officials, no social distancing, few masks, and now a cluster of coronavirus cases among those who were there. How can you expect Americans to follow the administration safety guidelines to protect themselves from COVID when you were at the White House have not been doing so?\n\n11:10 PENCE\n\nWell, the American people have demonstrated over the last eight months that when given the facts they're willing to put the health of their families, and their neighbors and people they don't even know first. President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice. In the height of the epidemic, when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey, and New York, and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward. But the reality is the work of the President of the United States goes on. A vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us and the president introduced Judge Amy Coney Barrett –\n\nPAGE\n\nYes, thank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n12:05 PENCE\n\nAt that- If I may say, that Rose Garden Event, there’s been a great deal of speculation about it. My wife Karen and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus. And it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise, the difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not not just mandates with the coronavirus but a government takeover of health, the Green New Deal –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– all government control. We're about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.\n\n12:46 HARRIS\n\nLet's talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader –\n\nPENCE\n\nWhich we’ve always done –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker knowing you didn't have enough money saved up, and now you're standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let's talk about caring about the American people. The American people who have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, we talked about the American people –\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– It is asking too much of the people that they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children.\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan, the president –\n\n13:39 PAGE\n\nNo, I’m sorry. Kamala Harris – Senator Harris, I mean. I'm sorry.\n\nHARRIS\n\nIt’s fine. I’m Kamala.\n\nPAGE\n\nNo, no, you’re Senator Harris to me. For life to get back to normal Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be vaccinated need to be vaccinated, but half of Americans now say they wouldn't take a vaccine if it was released now. If the Trump administration approves a vaccine, before after the election, should Americans take it and would you take it?\n\n14:10 HARRIS\n\nIf the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it.\n\n14:21 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence, there have been a lot of repercussions from this pandemic. In recent days, the president's diagnosis of COVID-19 has underscored the importance of the job that you hold, and that you are seeking. That's our second topic tonight, it's the role of the vice president. One of you will make history on January 20, you will be the vice president to the oldest president the United States has ever had. Donald Trump will be 74-years-old on Inauguration Day. Joe Biden will be 78-years-old. That already has raised concerns among some voters, concerns that have been sharpened by President Trump's hospitalization in recent days. Vice President Pence, have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with President Trump about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, do you think you should? You have two minutes without interruption.\n\n15:17 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, thank you. Although I would like to go back –\n\n15:20 PAGE\n\nWe should move on to the issue of the vice presidency –\n\n15:22 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you but, I would like to go back. Because the reality is that we're going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time, in unheard of time, in less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials. And we're right now producing 10s of millions of doses. So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just asked you, stop playing politics with people's lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it's just unacceptable. And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine Flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck. That they did “everything possible wrong”. And we learned from that. They left the Strategic National Stockpile empty. They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learned from it. And I think –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up –\n\n17:19 PENCE\n\n– the American people, I’m gonna say again, can be proud of what we done--\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, I’m sorry. Your time is up-- Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and, Senator, please stop undermining confidence in a vaccine.\n\n17:26 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked Vice President Pence, which is have you had a conversation, or reached an agreement with Vice President Biden, about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, and if you win the election next month, do you think you should? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n17:47 HARRIS\n\nSo let me tell you first of all, on the day I got the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable, memorable days in my life. I, you know, I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I'd be sitting here right now I know would make her proud and she must be looking down on this. You know Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system. I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman, to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. There I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then, of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I've been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world. I've traveled the world. I've met with our soldiers in our, in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share, we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump, unifying our country around our common values and principles.\n\n19:51 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. You know neither, neither President Trump nor Vice President Biden has released the sort of detailed health information that had become the modern norm until the 2016 election. And in recent days, President Trump's doctors have given misleading answers or refused to answer basic questions about his health. And my question to each of you, in turn, is, is this information voters deserve to know? Vice President Pence, would you like to go first?\n\n20:18 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, thank you. And let me, let me say on behalf of the president and the First Lady, how moved we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President. And I do believe it's emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the coronavirus. But the care the president received at Walter Reed, White House doctors, was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along, they will continue because the American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their President. And we'll continue to do that. But I'm just extremely grateful and was more than, more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support. And, Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions and genuine concern. And I also want to congratulate you, as I did on that phone call, on the historic nature of your nomination.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nI never expected to be on this stage four years ago so I know the feeling. But the reality is, we've got an election before the American people, in the midst of this challenging year, and the stakes have never been higher.\n\n21:35 PAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence. I wanna give Senator Harris a chance to respond to the same question I asked, which is do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates, and especially about presidents, especially when they're facing some kind of challenge?\n\n21:50 HARRIS\n\nAbsolutely. And that's why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly, by contrast, the President has not, both in terms of health records, but also let's look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said “You mean $750,000?”. And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt it means you owe money to somebody. And i'd be really good to know who the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president's decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you, or self interest. So, Susan, I'm glad you asked about transparency, because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He, he is honest. He is forthright. But Donald Trump on the other hand, has been about covering up everything.\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan –\n\n23:09 PENCE\n\nThank – Thanks – Thank you, Senator Harris. I want to give you a chance to respond, Vice President.\n\n23:13 PENCE\n\nWell, look, I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your public service as well.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nBut the American people have a president who is a businessman, he’s a job-creator. He’s paid 10s of millions of dollars in taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes. He's created 10s of thousands of American jobs. The president said those public reports are not accurate. And the President also released, literally, stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden, 47 years in public service, compared to President Donald Trump, who brought all of that experience four years ago--\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President –\n\nPENCE\n\n– and turned this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, unleashing American energy-\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n24:04 PENCE\n\n– fighting for free and fair trade, and all of the is on the line –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n24:08 PENCE\n\n– if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are in the White House.\n\nPAGE\n\nYou know, that's a good segue into our third topic--\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s a great segue.\n\nPAGE\n\n– which is about the economy. This has been another aspect of life for Americans that's been so affected by this coronavirus. We have a jobs crisis brewing. On Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate had declined to 7.9% in September, but the job growth had stalled, and that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry, at Disney and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking to work. Nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year, haven't been replaced. Those hardest hit include latinos, blacks and women. Senator Harris, the Biden Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy and you would pay for that new spending by raising $4 trillion in taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and create jobs. Would raising taxes for the recovery at risk? And you have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted.\n\n25:16 HARRIS\n\nThank you. On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn't be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America's economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing. Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He'll get rid of it. And what he'll do with the money is invested in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week. I don't think it ever happened. But Joe Biden will do that. He'll invest in infrastructure. It's about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you'll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we'll make sure that if you have student loan debt it's cut by $10,000. That's how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it’s about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business.\n\n27:09 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris.\n\nHARRIS\n\nYou're welcome\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, your administration has been predicting a rapid and robust recovery, but the latest economic report suggests that's not happening. Should Americans be braced for an economic comeback that is going to take not months, but a year or more? You have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted.\n\n27:27 PENCE\n\nWhen President Trump and I took office, America had gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. When Joe Biden was vice president they tried to tax, and spend, and regulate, and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes, across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue-collar, hard working Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trump's tax cuts. But America, you just heard Senator Harris tell you, on day one Joe Biden's gonna raise your taxes. It's really remarkable to think, Susan –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s not what I said.\n\nPENCE\n\n– I mean, right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes, rollback regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade, and secured $4 trillion from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, saved 50 million jobs through the paycheck protection program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a $2 trillion Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the Heartland. And Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China that when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers. Joe Biden says democracy's on the ballot. Make no mistake about it, Susan. The American economy, the American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth and opportunity –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– with four more years of President Donald Trump. 2020 economic year in the history of this country.\n\n29:36 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris?\n\n29:41 HARRIS\n\nWell, I mean, I thought we saw enough of it in last week's debate, but I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth. And the truth of the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear. He will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year –\n\nPENCE\n\nHe said he’s gonna appeal the Trump tax cuts –\n\nHARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President I’m speaking.\n\nPENCE\n\nWell –\n\n29:57 HARRIS\n\nI’m speaking.\n\n29:59 PENCE\n\n– it’d be important if you said the truth. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that he's going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every single year –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat is – That is absolutely not true –\n\nPENCE\n\n– Senator, that’s the math –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– that tax bill –\n\nPENCE\n\nIs he only gonna repeal part of the Trump tax cuts?\n\n30:19 HARRIS\n\nIf you don't mind letting me finish –\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease\n\nHARRIS\n\nWe can then have a conversation. Okay?\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease\n\nHARRIS\n\nOkay. Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who during the Great Recession was responsible for the Recovery Act that brought America back. And now the Trump Pence Administration wants to take credit when they ran when they rode the coattails of Joe Biden's success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term. Of course now the economy is a complete disaster, but Joe Biden on the one hand, did that. On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression. On the one hand you have Joe Biden, who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought health care to over 20 million Americans and protected people with pre existing conditions and what it also did is it saved those families, who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who is in court right now trying to get rid of –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections, if you have pre-existing conditions. And I just, this is very important, Susan –\n\nPAGE\n\nYes, well we need to give – We need to give Vice President –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– and it's just – He interrupted me and I'd like to just finish, please. If you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they're coming for you. If you love someone who has a pre existing condition –\n\nPENCE\n\nNonsense\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Senator Harris –\n\nPENCE\n\nThat’s nonsense\n\nHARRIS\n\n– they’re coming for you. If you are under the age of 26 on your parents coverage, they're coming for you.\n\n32:09 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, thank you.\n\nHARRIS\n\nYour welcome\n\nPAGE\n\nLet me give you a chance to respond.\n\n32:12 PENCE\n\nWell I hope we have a chance to talk about health care because Obamacare was a disaster and the American people remember it well. President Trump and I have plans to improve health care and to protect, protect pre-existing conditions for every American. But look, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your own opinion but you're not entitled to your own facts –\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s a good line\n\nPENCE\n\nYou yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked his supporter in the eye and pointed and said “I guarantee, I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels”. We have a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, Susan, that your newspaper USA TODAY said really wasn't that very different from the original Green New Deal. More taxes, more regulation, banning fracking, abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender to China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing. The V-shape recovery that's underway right now will continue with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.\n\n33:20 PAGE\n\nThank you very, very much, Vice President Pence. Once again you provided the perfect segue to a new topic, which is climate change. And Vice President Pence, I'd like to pose the first question to you. This year we've seen record-setting hurricanes in the south. Another one, Hurricane Delta is now threatening the gulf. And we have seen record-setting wildfires in the West. Do you believe, as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter and more deadly? And it made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n33:57 PENCE\n\nThank you Susan. Well first, I'm very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. And our water is among the cleanest in the world. Just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act, the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So, President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment. Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing. But the issue is, what's the cause and what do we do about it. President Trump has made it clear that we're going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They'd impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know what's remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we've done it through innovation. And we've done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThat’s not true\n\nPENCE\n\nAnd so by creating the kind of American innovation, we're actually steering toward a stronger and better environment. With regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center, and even governor Gavin Newsome from your state has agreed we've got to work on forest management. And with regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually as, as difficult as they are –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President –\n\nPENCE\n\n– there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you –\n\nPENCE\n\n– but many of the climate alarmists use hurricanes and wildfires to try and –\n\nPAGE\n\nVice President Pence, I’m sorry ,your time is up – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– sell the good of a Green New Deal. And President Trump and I are gonna always put American jobs and American workers first.\n\n36:14 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, as the Vice President mentioned, you co-sponsored the Green New Deal in Congress, but Vice President Biden said in last week's debate that he does not support the Green New Deal. But if you look at the Biden Harris campaign website it describes the Green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden Harris Administration toward the green New Deal? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n36:43 HARRIS\n\nAlright, so first of all, I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden's economic plan Moody's, which is a reputable Wall Street firm, has said will create 7 million more jobs than Donald Trump's. And part of those jobs, that will be created by Joe Biden, are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa, whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes, again, in science. I'll tell you something, Susan, I served, when I first got to the Senate, on the committee that's responsible for the environment. Do you know this administration took the word science off the website? And then took the phrase climate change off the website? This-- We have seen a pattern with this administration which is they don't believe in science. And Joe's plan is about saying we're going to deal with it, but we're also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and the question was, you know, the science is telling us this ,you know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn't know. So, let's talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we're going to invest that in renewable energy, we're going to be about the creation of millions of jobs, we will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035-- Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the climate agreement with pride.\n\n38:57 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris just said that climate change is an existential threat. Vice President Pence, do you believe that climate change poses an existential threat?\n\n39:07 PENCE\n\nAs I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We’ll follow the science, but, once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they're gonna raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that on day one he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it's essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the senator say that she's going to resubmit America to the Paris Climate Accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment. We will continue to cherish it. We've made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas and fracking. We don't need a massive, $2 trillion Green New Deal that would oppose all new mandates American businesses and American families, Joe Biden wants to retrofit 4 million--\n\n40:31 PAGE\n\nThank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\n40:32 PENCE\n\n– American business buildings. It makes no sense. It will cost jobs. President Trump –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– he’s gonna put America first. He's going to put jobs first and take care of our environment and follow the science.\n\n40:45 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nHARRIS\n\nOn the issue of jobs –\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris\n\nHARRIS\n\nLet's talk about that. You, the Vice President earlier referred to, as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment, the President's trade war with China. You lost that trade war. You lost it. What ended up happening is, because of a so called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy, because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession, because of it. And when we look at this administration has been, there are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration –\n\nPENCE\n\nSusan –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– And the American people know what I'm talking about. You know. I think about 20-year-olds, you know we have a 20-year-old, 20-something-year-old, who are coming out of high school and college right now and you're wondering, “Is there going to be a job there for me?”. We're looking at people who are trying to figure out how they're going to pay rent by the end of the month. Almost half of American renters are worried about whether they're going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration.\n\n42:10 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you just 15 seconds to respond because then I want to move on.\n\n42:15 PENCE\n\nWell, I'd love to respond. Lose the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for Communist China through over the last several decades. And, and again, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your opinion, you're not entitled to your own facts. When Joe Biden was vice president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs and President Obama said they were never coming back. He said we needed a magic wand to bring them back. In our first three years, after we cut taxes, rolled back regulation –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– unleashed American energy, this administration saw 500,000 jobs created –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– And that's exactly the kind of growth we're going to continue to see as we bring our nation through this pandemic –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\n– your Green New Deal, your massive new mandates, your Paris Climate Accord, it's gonna kill jobs this time just like it killed jobs in the last administration.\n\n43:05 HARRIS\n\nSusan, I just need to respond very briefly, please.\n\nPAGE\n\n15 seconds and then we’ll move on.\n\nHARRIS\n\nThank you. Thank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America's auto industry and you voted against it. So let's set the record straight. Thank you.\n\n43:19 PAGE\n\nI'd like to talk about China. We have, as our next topic, we have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China. It is a huge market for American agricultural goods. It’s a potential partner in dealing with climate change and North Korea. And in a video tonight, President Trump again blamed it for the coronavirus, saying “China will pay.” Vice President Pence, how would you describe our, our fundamental relationship with China? Competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You have two minutes.\n\n43:53\n\nThank you Susan. Well let me, before I leave that, let me, let me speak to voting records, if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA costs literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs going south of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA, and the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But, Senator, you said it didn't go far enough on climate change, that you put your, your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and ahead of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that. It's probably why Newsweek magazine said that, that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So, now with regard to China, Susan, first and foremost -- China is to blame for the coronavirus. And President Trump is not happy about it. He's made that very clear. He made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump, in dealing with China from the outset of this administration -- standing up to China, that had been taking advantage of America for decades -- in the wake of Joe Biden's cheerleading for China, President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know, Joe Biden opposed President Trump's decision to suspend all travel to China. He said it was hysterical, he said it was xenophobic –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up –\n\n45:56 PENCE\n\n– but President Trump has stood up to China and will continue to stand strong.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence –\n\nPENCE\n\nWe want to improve the relationship, but we're going to level the playing field and we’re going to hold China accountable for what they did to America with the coronavirus\n\n46:09 PAGE\n\nThank you. Senator Harris, I’m going to ask you the same question that I asked the Vice President. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Are we competitors, adversaries, enemies? You'll have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n46:24 HARRIS\n\nSusan, the Trump administration's perspective, and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs and America's standing. There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created, within the White House, and office that basically was just responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got away, they got rid of it.\n\n47:04 PENCE\n\nNot true.\n\n47:05 HARRIS\n\nThere was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Let's look at the job situation we mentioned before, the trade deal – the trade war, they wanted to call it – with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs, and a manufacturing recession, and the American consumer paying thousands of dollars more for goods, because of that failed war, that they called it. And let's talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm, has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold a greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, than they do Donald Trump, the President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today, because of a failure of leadership by this administration.\n\n48:26 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris, we've seen changes in the role of the United States, in terms of global leadership, over the past four years – and of course times do change. What's your definition – we've seen strains with China, of course, as the Vice President mentioned, we’ve seen strains with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere. What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020?\n\n48:52 HARRIS\n\nSo, you know Joe is – I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues, and you know, Joe, I think, he said, quite well. He says, you know, ‘Foreign policy: it might sound complicated, but really it's relationships there – just think about it as relationships. And so we know this, in our personal, professional relationships – you guys keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who have stood with you, got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are, and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Let's take for example, Russia. So, Russia – I serve on the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate. America's intelligence community told us Russia interfered in the election of the President of the United States in 2016 and playing in 2020. Christopher Ray, the director of the FBI, said the same, but Donald Trump the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American intelligence community. Look at our friends at NATO. He has walked away from agreements – you can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe, because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal, guys, we were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends and allies around the country, and because of Donald Trump's unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan, it's about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation, in addition to our great military, has been that we keep our word. But Donald Trump doesn't understand that, because he doesn't understand what it means to be honest.\n\n50:54 PAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President, you’ll have a chance to respond.\n\n50:59 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and never did. We stood strong with our allies, but we've been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, we strengthen our alliances across the Asia Pacific. And we've stood strong against those who would do us harm. You know when President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the Middle East, the size of Pennsylvania. President Trump unleashed the American military, and our armed forces destroyed the ISIS Caliphate and took down their leader al Baghdadi without one American casualty. al Baghdadi was responsible for the deaths of thousands. But notably, America's hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller, the parents of which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller's murder, were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield, along with the other few. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office presented a plan. They said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused her mercilessly before they killed her. But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month. And when Armed Forces finally went in, it was clear she’d been moved two days earlier, and her family says -- with a heart that broke the heart of every American -- that of President Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President.\n\nPENCE\n\nWe destroyed the ISIS caliphate. And you talk about reentering the Iran nuclear deal. I mean, the last administration transferred $1.8 billion to the leading state sponsor of terrorism –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President.\n\nPENCE\n\nPresident Donald Trump got us out of the deal, and when Qasim Soleimani was traveling to Baghdad, to harm two Americans, President Donald Trump took him out. And America is safer, our allies are safer and the Americans should know –\n\n53:27 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. I would like to give Senator Harris a chance to respond, but not at such great length because of course there are other topics we want to talk about.\n\nHARRIS\n\nBut I would like equal time.\n\n53:36 PENCE\n\nYes. Please go ahead.\n\n53:41 HARRIS\n\nFirst of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter's case, and I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. What happened to her is awful. And it should have never happened. And I know Joe feels the same way. And I know that President Obama feels the same way. But you mentioned Soleimani. Let’s start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq. And they suffered serious brain injuries, and you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump's, where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military, as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington Cemetery, and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, ‘What's in it for them?’ Because, of course, you know he only thinks about what's in it for him. Let's take what he said about John McCain. A great American hero. And Donald Trump says he doesn't deserve to be called a hero because he was a prisoner of war. Take – and this is, this is very important. When you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about and what they don't care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is? Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump has talked at least six times to Vladmir Putin, and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that. Joe Biden – Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation's security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris. This is such an important issue, but we have other important issues as well and I want to make sure we have a chance.\n\nPENCE\n\nI really have to respond to that. She has –\n\n56:03 PAGE\n\nFifteen seconds, because –\n\n56:07 PENCE\n\nWell, I’ve got to have more than that.\n\nPAGE\n\nI'm sure, Mr. Vice President, that you had more time that she’s had, so far –\n\n56:11 PENCE\n\nThe slanders against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd.\n\n56:18 PAGE\n\nI'm sorry, Vice President Pence –\n\n56:20 PENCE\n\nMy son is a captain in the United States Marine Corps, my son in law is deployed in the United States Navy. I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military, President Donald Trump not only respects but reveres all of those who served in our armed forces, and any suggestion otherwise it's ridiculous. Let me also say –\n\n56:47 PAGE\n\nVice President Pence. Vice President Pence. I didn’t – Vice President Pence – I did not create the rules for tonight. Your campaigns agreed to the rules for tonight’s debate,\n\nwith the Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm here to enforce them, which involves moving from one topic to another, giving roughly equal time to both of you, which is what I'm trying very hard to do. So I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is an important one, as the last topic was, and that is the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court. Senator Harris, you'll be there as a member of the committee. A confirmation would cement the court’s conservative majority, and make it likely open to more abortion restrictions, even to overturning the landmark Roe v Wade ruling. Access to abortion would then be up to the states. Vice President Pence, you're the former governor of Indiana. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do? Would you want your home state to ban all abortions? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n57:49 PENCE\n\nThank you for the question, but I'll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important key before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn't hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out on Quasem Soleimani. It's really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it's explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It's absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that's what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She's a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don't see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed to the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the “dogma of her faith lived loudly in her.” Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. Thank you, Vice President, your time is up.\n\nPENCE\n\nMy hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you Vice President.\n\n59:58 PENCE\n\n– treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States.\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris, you're the senator from and former Attorney General of California. So let me ask you a parallel question to the one I posed to the vice president. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do? Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion? And you have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n1:00:21\n\nThank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it's insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination – Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will it be, the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it's been about an election year or election time. We're literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we'll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn't be more serious. There's the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let's also look at what else is before the court. It's the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic – when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because if you contracted the virus – Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I've said it before and it bears repeating: That means that there will be no protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose their coverage. It means that if you're under the age of 26, you can’t be on your parents coverage anymore. And here's the thing. The contrast couldn't be more clear. They're trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden’s saying let’s expand coverage, let's give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let's bring down premiums, let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That's true leadership.\n\n1:02:42 PAGE\n\nYou know, you mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the President was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions and -- but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration is supporting, that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. The president says, President Trump says, that he's going to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but he has not explained how he will do that. So, tell us, specifically – how will your administration protect Americans with pre-existing conditions and give access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down.\n\n1:03:23 PENCE\n\nWell, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands on a policy for the sanctity of human life. I'm pro-life. I don't apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there's such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Jamie Kony Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? There have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don't get your way. This is a classic case of if you can't win by the rules, you're going to change the rules. Now you've refused to answer that question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\n\n1:04:58 HARRIS\n\nI'm so glad to have a little history lesson. Let's do that a little more. In 1860 –\n\n1:05:05\n\nWell, I'd like you to answer the question.\n\n1:05:06 HARRIS\n\nMr. Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking. In 1864, one of the, I think, political heroes – certainly the president, and I assume to you as well, Mr. Vice President – is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln's party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate. But honest Abe said it's not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States, and then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land. And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now. And it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime.\n\n1:06:09 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris and –\n\n1:06:11 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan. People are voting right now. They'd like to know if you and Joe Biden are gonna pack the Supreme Court of you don't get your way in this nomination.\n\n1:06:19 HARRIS\n\nLet's talk about that –\n\n1:06:21 PENCE\n\nOnce again, you gave a non-answer, Joe Biden gave a non-answer.\n\n1:06:25 HARRIS\n\nI’m answering now.\n\nPENCE\n\nThe people deserve a straight answer. And if you haven't figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. To the many people across this country: If you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden-Harris ticket come November the third and reelect President Donald Trump. We will stand by the separation powers and nine seats on the Supreme Court.\n\n1:06:51 HARRIS\n\nLet’s talk about packing the court then. Let's talk about.\n\nPENCE\n\nPlease –\n\nHARRIS\n\nYeah, I’m about to. So, the Trump-Pence administration has been – because I sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Susan, as you mentioned. And I've witnessed the appointments, for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, Courts of Appeal -- people who are purely ideological people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found to be not competent, are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the Court of Appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is Black? This is what they've been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let's have that discussion.\n\n1:07:38 PAGE\n\nAll right, thank you. Thank you, Senator. Let's go on to talk about the issue of racial justice.\n\n1:07:43 PENCE\n\nI just want the record to reflect, she never answered the question. Perhaps at the next debate Joe Biden will answer the question. And I think the American people know the answer.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. In March, Breonna Taylor a 26-year-old emergency room technician in Louisville, was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant on a narcotics investigation broke into her apartment. The police said they identified themselves. Taylor's boyfriend said he didn't hear them do that. He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer. The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment. They say they were acting in self defense. None of them have been indicted in connection with her death. Senator Harris, in the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes.\n\n1:08:32 HARRIS\n\nI don't believe so, and I've talked with Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer, and her family, and she deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse, and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what's going on out on the street, so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer. And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender – perfect strangers to each other – marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests. And I believe strongly that, first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the sight to achieve our ideals. And that's why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I'm a prosecutor. I know what I'm talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds. George Ford would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will – on the issue of criminal justice reform – get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me pose the same question to you. In the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n1:11:00 PENCE\n\nWell our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American lives, and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies. But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that reviews the evidence. And it really is remarkable, that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that in a panel grand jury, looking at all the evidence, got it all wrong. But you're entitled to your opinion, Senator. And with regard to George Floyd, there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served. But there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, was burned to the ground. By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must say this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That asJoe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats – Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room. And then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott's bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new resources. But we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement, providing public safety, and supporting our African American neighbors and all other minorities. Under President Trump's leadership –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Mr. Vice President\n\nPENCE\n\n– we will always stand with law enforcement and we'll do what we can -- we have improved the lives of African Americans. Record unemployment, record –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Mr. Vice President.\n\n1:13:18 PENCE\n\n– Fight for school choice, for –\n\n1:13:22 PAGE\n\nSenator Harris.\n\n1:13:24 HARRIS\n\nI will not sit here and be lectured by the Vice President on what it means to enforce the laws of our country. I'm the only one on this stage who has personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assaults to homicide. I'm the only one on the stage who has prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of American families. I am the only one on this stage who prosecuted for-profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans. And the reality of this is, that we are talking about an election in 27 days where last week, the President of the United States took the debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists. And –\n\nPENCE\n\nNot true.\n\nHARRIS\n\n– it wasn't like he didn't have a chance. He didn't do it, and then he doubled down. And then he said, when pressed, ‘Stand back. Stand by.’ And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump. He was – he called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He instituted as his first act a Muslim ban. He, on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed and on the other side there were neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches shouting racial epithets, anti semitic slurs. And Donald Trump, when asked about it, said there were fine people on both sides. This is who we have as the President of the United States. And America, you deserve better. Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together.\n\nPAGE\n\nSenator Harris –\n\nHARRIS\n\n– and recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all spend so much more in common than what separates us.\n\n1:15:19 PAGE\n\nVice President, I’m going to give you a minute to respond.\n\n1:15:21 PENCE\n\nThank you, Susan. I appreciate that very much. I think that's one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country. That you selectively edited, like Senator Harris did, a promise that President Trump and I, and others on our side of the aisle make. Senator Harris conveniently omitted, after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly. Your concern that he doesn't condemn neo-Nazis – President Trump has Jewish grandchildren. This is a president who respects and cherishes all of the American people. But you talk about having personally prosecuted – glad you brought up your records.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you.\n\nPENCE\n\nI really need to make this point. When you were DA in San Francisco, when you held that office, African Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of Blacks in California. You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn't lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill. The reality is, you're representing yourself. President Trump and I have fought for criminal justice, for –\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President Pence\n\nPENCE\n\n– for for educational choice and opportunities for African Americans –\n\n1:16:53 PAGE\n\nThank you, sir.\n\nPENCE\n\nAnd we'll do it for four more.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you. You know there is no more important issue than the final issue that we're going to talk about tonight, and that is the issue of the election itself.\n\n1:17:03 HARRIS\n\nListen, he attacked my record. I would like the opportunity to respond.\n\n1:17:06 PAGE\n\nLet me give you 30 seconds because we're running out of time.\n\n1:17:09 HARRIS\n\nI appreciate that. First of all, having served as the Attorney General of the State of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. It will be about not only instituting a ban on chokeholds and carotid holes.\n\nPAGE\n\nThank you.\n\nHARRIS\n\nI don't think, I would like to go through –\n\n1:17:38 PAGE\n\nThese are points that you made earlier in the hour and I want to talk about the election itself before we have to –\n\n1:17:43 HARRIS\n\nBut I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do and my record, which includes – I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full time. We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias, because yes, Joe Biden I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe. We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in reentry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward and, again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President, on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America.\n\n1:18:32 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris, and I'd like to pose the – I'd like you to respond first to the question on our final topic, the election itself. President Trump has, several times, refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If your ticket wins and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and Vice President Biden then take? What would happen next? You have two minutes.\n\n1:19:00 HARRIS\n\nSo, I'll tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition we've built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalition's of folks that you've ever seen in a presidential race. Of course we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans, in fact, seven members of President George W Bush's cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich, over 500 generals, retired generals, and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House. And so, we believe in the American people. We believe in our democracy. And here's what I'd like to say to everybody: vote. Please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can also go to Joe Biden.com. We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power, and if we use our vote, and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy, with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when again in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage – because clearly Donald Trump doesn't think he can run on a record because it's a failed record – Joe Biden said on that stage, said, ‘Hey, just please vote.’ So I'll repeat what Joe said. Please vote.\n\n1:20:58 PAGE\n\nPlease vote. Thank you, Senator. Vice President Pence, President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If Vice President Biden is declared the winner and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as Vice President? What would you personally do? You have two minutes.\n\n1:21:22 PENCE\n\nWell, Susan, first and foremost, I think we're gonna win this election. Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishments Joe Biden's been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this President's record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It's amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, we've all seen the avalanche with the -- what, what country’s been through for, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede election. So let me just say, I think we're gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, they'll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know we're going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trump's gonna be reelected for four more years.\n\n1:23:33 PAGE\n\nYou know I've, I've asked – I've written all the questions that I've asked tonight, but for the final question of the debate, I'd like to read a question that someone else wrote. The Utah Debate Commission asked students in the state to write essays about what they would like to ask. And I want to close tonight's debate with the question posed by Brecklyn Brown. She's an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah, and here's what she wrote. Quote – “When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans. When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen. When I watch the news, all I see are two candidate parties, trying to tear each other down. If our leaders can't get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along?” And then she added, “Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together” – end quote. So for each of you, in turn, I’d like you to take one minute, and respond to Brecklyn. Vice President Pence.\n\n1:24:37 PENCE\n\nBrecklyn, it's a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for your interest in in public. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that as how we could, literally, the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. And I will tell you that –don't assume that what you're saying on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. You know, I looked at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States – one very liberal, one very conservative. But what's been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. And here in America, we can disagree we can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on the stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. That's what people do in big cities and small towns all across this country, so I just want to encourage you, Brecklyn, I want to tell you that we're going to work every day to have a government as good as our people, the American people, each and every day. We love a good debate. We love a good argument. We always come together and are always there for one another. And we've especially learned that during the difficulties of this year.\n\n1:26:17 PAGE\n\nThank you, Vice President. Senator Harris, what would you say to Brecklyn.\n\n1:26:20 HARRIS\n\nFirst of all, I love to hear from our young leaders, and when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklyn, I know our future is bright, because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be – that is a sign of leadership and it's something we should all aspire to be.\n\nAnd that you know that brings me to Joe. Joe Biden – one of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president, is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier, it so troubled him and upset him, like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that, over the course of the last four years, what Brecklyn described has been happening. Joe has a long standing reputation of working across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way. And that's what he's going to do as President. Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You mean you have to know Joe's story to know that Joe has known pain, he has known suffering, and he has known love. And so, Brecklyn, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright. And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be, because we fight for each person's voice through their vote. And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work, and through, eventually, your vote. To determine the future of our country, and what its leadership looks like.\n\n1:27:58 PAGE\n\nThank you, Senator Harris, thank you, Vice President Pence, and thank you so much for being with us tonight. We want to thank, also, the University of Utah for its hospitality, and most of all our thanks to all the Americans who watched this debate tonight. Again, our best wishes for a quick recovery to President Trump, the First Lady and everyone who is battling COVID-19. The second presidential debate is next week on October 15, a town hall style debate in Miami.

Most significantly, the conference said the high-revenue sports of football and basketball would be back on Nov. 6 and Nov. 25, respectively. Other winter sports will return to action as well.\n\nThe Pac-12 and Big Ten had simultaneously announced they would postpone fall sports, most notably football, on Aug. 11, citing health concerns during the pandemic. But the SEC, ACC and Big 12 pressed on and decided to play.\n\nWhen the Big Ten changed its stance and opted to get back on the football field Oct. 24, the Pac-12 was left all alone, and there was little doubt it would resume play as well. The league's new seven-game schedule will allow its teams to be considered for the College Football Playoff. Fans won't be allowed at the conference games.\n\nNew York to review any vaccines approved by federal government\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will establish a state panel to review any vaccines that win federal approval before he will recommend the vaccines to New Yorkers. Cuomo expressed concern over bickering between President Donald Trump and the Food and Drug Administration over the standards that will be required for approval. Trump has said he might not approve more rigorous standards if the FDA attempts to enact them.\n\nCuomo said he hoped his state could become the first to become fully vaccinated. But he also said he wants to be able to assure New Yorkers the vaccines are safe.\n\n\"I'm not going to trust the federal government's opinion and I wouldn't recommend to New Yorkers based on the federal government's opinion,\" Cuomo said.\n\nGrowing concerns of a second wave in Europe\n\nBritain is reporting its highest number of new coronavirus infections in a single day, 6,632. France recorded 52 deaths and more than 16,000 new cases in a 24-hour period. Spain just went over 700,000 total cases, the first European country to reach that mark.\n\nThere are growing signs of a second wave of COVID-19 in the Old Continent, where the virus made its deepest imprint right after spreading beyond China.\n\nWhile the spike in confirmed infections can be partly attributed to increased testing, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reacted to the rise in cases across all age groups by ordering pubs and restaurants closed by 10 p.m., and he warned stricter measures may be forthcoming if transmission is not suppressed. Britain has the highest death toll in Europe, with nearly 42,000 fatalities.\n\nMichigan universities to teach remotely all year\n\nThe presidents of Michigan's three largest research universities -- the University of Michigan, Michigan State and Wayne State -- said Thursday that most students would probably taking classes online for the rest of the school year and won't return to classrooms until next fall.\n\nM. Roy Wilson of Wayne State in Detroit said the winter semester will look like the current term because the pandemic “is going to be with us for a while.”\n\nOktoberfest in the year of COVID: Yodelgrams and a reprieve for oxen\n\nOktoberfest devotees have known since April that there would be no massive festival in Munich, Germany, this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But now that the season has arrived, the lack of crowded tents filled with revelers dressed in dirndl skirts and lederhosen shouting \"prost!\" is having an impact. The loss of Oktoberfest, which had been scheduled to run from Sept. 19 through Oct. 4, is a huge hit for the Bavarian city, which last year saw 6.3 million guests drink 15.5 million pints of beer and consume 124 oxen, among other traditional foods.\n\nAll around the world, virtual fests are underway while many establishments host small parties. In the Washington, D.C., area, you can even get a \"yodelgram.\" Devils Backbone Brewing Co. says that's when a \"real-life, yodeling TikTok sensation arrives at your house, armed with Devils Backbone Oktoberfest beer and steins plus a custom yodel.\"\n\n– Morgan Hines\n\nUnited Airlines unveils passenger testing program\n\nUnited Airlines will roll out a new COVID-19 testing program for passengers beginning Oct. 15. The airline said testing at first will only be available for passengers traveling to Hawaii from San Francisco International Airport. Why Hawaii? The airline, the first in the U.S. to offer rapid testing, has more flights to the state than any other U.S. carrier, and the Aloha State's new testing requirements begin the same day as United's.\n\n\"We'll look to quickly expand customer testing to other destinations and U.S. airports later this year,\" said Toby Enqvist, the airline's chief customer officer. Airlines and trade groups have been calling on the federal government to establish a testing program and require passengers to wear masks since this summer. All major U.S. airlines now have their own mask policies in place.\n\n– Jayme Deerwester\n\nSoccer star tests positive, throws down against COVID-19\n\nGlobal soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimović has tested positive for COVID-19, AC Milan announced Thursday. The club said the Swede, one of the premier strikers of the last two decades, tested positive ahead of Thursday night's Europa League qualifying match against Bodø/Glimt. AC Milan \"has informed the relevant authorities\" and Ibrahimović is in quarantine at home, the team said in a statement. Ibrahimović's teammates and club staff have tested negative.\n\n\"Covid had the courage to challenge me,\" Ibrahimović, who scored both his team's goals in a game Monday, said in a Twitter post. \"Bad idea.\"\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\nMissouri city, a la 'Footloose,' banning musical activities after 11 p.m.\n\nA ban on \"music activities\" after 11 p.m. kicks in Friday in St. Charles, Missouri. The city has been overwhelmed with partiers denied entry to bars in St. Louis because of coronavirus restrictions. The ban has drawn mention of the 1984 movie “Footloose,” in which a small town bans dancing until a newcomer played by actor Kevin Bacon rolls into town and turns the tide.\n\n“I feel a little bit like the movie ‘Footloose,’ but that’s not what this is about,” Mayor Dan Borgmeyer told KTVI-TV. The mayor blamed rowdy crowds that have spilled into city streets, resulting in fights and creating enough concern that police presence downtown at night has tripled in recent months.\n\nTechnology ready, but fast, at-home testing still not approved for sale\n\nNearly two months after federal regulators unveiled rules for at-home coronavirus tests, no company has federal approval to sell these fast and cheap tests even though the technology is ready. No company has been cleared to sell tests directly to consumers for widespread screening – a step some believe is necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19. Gaining FDA authorization for these inexpensive, at-home tests is no easy task.\n\n“The way to get this under control is if people find out as early as possible they are infected and then quarantine from others,” said Dr. Yukari Manabe, a Johns Hopkins University professor of medicine.\n\n– Ken Alltucker and Ramon Padilla\n\nWelcome home: Grown children return to nest in pandemic economics\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic is putting pressure on many families with grown children. About two-thirds of parents say they are providing financial support to their adult children during the crisis, helping to pay for everything from groceries to health care expenses, a recent survey from Country Financial found. One in five has had their adult child move back home with them, according to the survey based on responses from more than 1,300 adults in mid-August.\n\n“This trend of adult children moving back at home was something we saw a lot of out of the Great Recession,” says Troy Frerichs, vice president of investment services at Country Financial. “Now you are seeing it happen again.”\n\n– Aimee Picchi\n\nPandemic travel collapse exposes booking industry’s secrets\n\nThe coronavirus has exposed a secret underbelly of the travel business. Many travel agencies operate Ponzi-style schemes where one traveler's deposit pays for a previous traveler's tickets and accommodations. Everything ran smoothly as long as bookings continued to roll in. The pandemic blurred the already muddy line between business ethics and fraud and has led to not just fried nerves, but official complaints and legal action. Through public records requests, USA TODAY obtained consumer complaints related to COVID-19 filed with attorneys generals and other agencies in 20 states. Scott Keyes, who runs the website Scott’s Cheap Flights, said online travel agencies often save money by providing little customer service.\n\n“If a catastrophic event happens like a worldwide pandemic,” Keyes said, “they’re really up a creek.”\n\n– Nick Penzenstadler and Josh Salman\n\nChildren may not be vaccinated until late in 2021– or beyond\n\nChildren are not included in the ongoing trials for a COVID-19 vaccine, so it's likely to be well into next year or beyond before they can get vaccinated against the coronavirus that causes the disease. The vast majority of children don't get severely ill from COVID-19, but kids can still pass on the virus – to teachers, parents, grandparents, etc. Emory University School of Medicine pediatric infectious disease specialist Dr. Evan Anderson called for a rapid expansion of clinical trials to include children, ideally providing results in time for them to be vaccinated before the 2021 school year.\n\n\"We owe it to our children not to delay moving forward with initial studies to evaluate promising vaccine candidates,\" Anderson said.\n\n– Karen Weintraub\n\nBritain considering infecting healthy volunteers to test vaccines\n\nBritain could become the world's first country to intentionally infect healthy volunteers with the coronavirus in the world’s first \"human challenge\" trial to expedite a determination on which COVID vaccines work. The Financial Times reported that the government-funded studies could be announced next week and begin in January. British government officials would only say that discussions were underway for such a trial. The BBC said no deal had been signed as of Thursday. Britain has been struggling to neutralize an uptick in cases in recent weeks. Tighter restrictions, such as closing pubs at 10 p.m., went into effect across the country Thursday.\n\nProf Peter Horby of Oxford University told the BBC such a trial was a good idea and could quickly advance knowledge of the virus.\n\n\"I think the challenge trial has the potential to save thousands of lives and really bring the world out of the pandemic sooner,\" Horby said.\n\nStudy: Coronavirus has grown more contagious\n\nResearchers at Houston Methodist Hospital say a study of the second wave of the coronavirus to sweep across the city indicates a mutation that is more contagious than the original strain. The later infections show the virus still has the crown shape that gives the virus its name, but the newer version has more of the spikes that latch onto human cells. The study, which has not yet been subject to crucial peer review, found patients infected with the variant strain had more of the virus when diagnosed than the first round of patients in the spring. There was an upside: The study showed no indication that the mutation is any more deadly than the original. Outcomes remain primarily linked to pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and obesity.\n\n“We’ve now done molecular analyses of the two waves of the pandemic and one thing that stands out is the increase in the mutated strain’s frequency over a short period of time,” Dr. James Musser, the study’s author, told the Houston Chronicle. “Clearly, this strain is very different.”\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin to resume some in-person instruction\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin Chancellor Rebecca Blank said the Madison campus will begin to reopen Saturday following a two-week lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 among undergraduate students.\n\nThe university was only one week into the school year when leaders all but shut down campus facilities, moved classes online and quarantined two of the largest dorms, which house 2,220 students in total. There will be changes. The reopening will be gradual. Not all classes will start immediately and not all will return to fully in-person instruction. Classes that require specialized equipment will still be in-person or hybrid, but others may be modified.\n\n– Devi Shastri, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nDonald Trump suggests he'll overrule FDA on COVID-19 vaccine\n\nHours after some of the administration's leading health officials offered assurances that the search for a coronavirus vaccine would be conducted free of political interference, President Donald Trump on Wednesday undercut that notion and suggested he may overrule the Federal Drug Administration. Trump, who has predicted the arrival of a vaccine before the Nov. 3 election, questioned why the FDA would set a higher standard for granting emergency authorization for a vaccine, as the agency is reportedly planning on in an effort to gain public trust.\n\nThe president said FDA guidance \"has to be approved by the White House. We may or may not approve it.'' Earlier in the day, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn addressed concerns of politics playing a role in the approval process, emphasizing that career scientists at the FDA drive decision making: \"Science will guide our decisions,'' Hahn said. \"FDA will not permit any pressure from anyone to change that.\"\n\n-- Jorge L.

In Alabama prisons, 43 inmates and two staff members have died from the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus since the pandemic began, according to prison system numbers. That ranks fourth in the country for the number of COVID-19 deaths per 10,000 inmates, according to the AP and Marshall Project data. The state previously ranked ninth. The Alabama prisons system has said most deaths, like those outside prison walls, have occurred in inmates with preexisting health conditions and older inmates. The state over the past week reported the deaths of five inmates. The youngest man was 58. Three were over age 70. Criminal justice reform advocates have called for the release of vulnerable and elderly inmates and an increase in paroles to alleviate extreme overcrowding, as well as for the mass testing of inmates.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state has received 35,100 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, state officials announced Monday. The shipment arrived Sunday night on a UPS plane, the state health department said in a statement. Officials planned to begin transporting the vaccine Monday to health care facilities across Alaska. That process will continue through Wednesday, and the state expects the first vaccinations to take place this week. Once facilities receive shipments, the vaccines could start that day for front-line health care workers, the department said. “The COVID-19 vaccine is going to help Alaskans put the worst behind us,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said. “We will begin the process of finally getting the upper hand of this pandemic and getting our lives back to normal.” The shipment includes 11,700 doses allocated by the Indian Health Service to Alaska tribes. Because of the state’s unique geography and logistical issues, Alaska received its entire initial allocation of vaccine this week, while other states are receiving shipments weekly, the statement said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: With 11,795 new COVID-19 cases reported Monday, the state notched its second-highest daily tally of new cases since the start of the pandemic as hospitalizations continue to hit record highs. The number of patients hospitalized statewide for known or suspected COVID-19 cases was at 3,677 on Sunday, a record high. The state data dashboard shows 91% of all intensive care unit beds and 91% of all inpatient beds in Arizona were in use Sunday, with 47% of ICU beds and 43% of non-ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients. A report released Nov. 19 by Arizona State University predicted that hospital capacity in the state will be exceeded in December and that, without additional public health measures, holiday gatherings are likely to cause 600 to 1,200 additional deaths from COVID-19 in Arizona by Feb. 1 beyond current-scenario death projections.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Monday began administering its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine. Five health care workers, including the state’s surgeon general, were the first to be vaccinated in a news conference at the Arkansas Health Department. Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted that the state received the frozen vials made by Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech early Monday morning and that other shipments were expected later in the day. The governor said all of those shots would go to health care workers. Health Secretary Dr. Jose Romero said the department, two hospitals and a pharmacy each received doses of the vaccine, and more were coming. “This is a major step forward,” Romero told reporters. The vaccines arrive as COVID-19 continues surging in Arkansas and much of the rest of the U.S. and world.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles County again broke a record for coronavirus hospitalizations over the weekend, and San Francisco County reported its highest number of COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began. Statewide, more than 30,000 confirmed coronavirus cases were reported Sunday, making California’s total 1,551,766. Millions of Californians in the majority of the state are under stay-at-home orders. In Los Angeles County, the nation’s most populous, more than 4,000 people were hospitalized for COVID-19, according to figures released Sunday afternoon. More than one-fifth of hospitalized patients are in intensive care units. The county’s new figures break the previous record set only the day before, with 3,850 patients in a hospital, and follow the trend of hospitalizations increasing nearly every day since Nov. 1. LA County Health Director Barbara Ferrer warned last Monday – when hospitalizations were 2,988 – that the county could see the statistic to climb to 4,000 within two weeks. It happened in six days. In San Francisco County, health officials reported 323 new cases Saturday, the highest number there yet.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis personally signed for the state’s first delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine Monday. The first vaccines will be administered to front-line health care workers at UC Health Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins. On a frigid morning in Denver, a FedEx driver delivered a box containing 975 frozen vials of the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and its German partner, BioNTech, to Colorado’s state health department laboratory. Polis eagerly signed for the package. After opening the box, he held down a tracking device for five seconds to confirm that Colorado had received the doses. A small tray of doses inside the box was then put in a freezer obtained by the state just for the vaccine. “It’s a powerful and an emotional moment to celebrate the beginning of the end of the pandemic,” said Polis, who recently contracted COVID-19 along with his partner, Marlon Reis. Colorado is expecting 46,800 does of the Pfizer vaccine through Wednesday that will be stored in freezers around the state. Polis urged hospitals receiving the first vaccines to administer them within 72 hours so that plans for the next shipments can proceed.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The first shipment of a coronavirus vaccine made its way to the state Monday: a batch of nearly 2,000 doses sent to Hartford Hospital, where more than a dozen health care workers were vaccinated. The shipment of the Pfizer vaccine is part of an initial order by the state of more than 31,000 doses from the company, which has major research operations in Groton, Connecticut. “This is the dawn of a new day. This is a time for hope. This is a historic moment,” said Jeffrey Flaks, president and chief executive officer of Hartford HealthCare. “Our physicians have described this in many ways for our country, comparable to putting a man on the moon.” Officials at Hartford HealthCare, which operates seven acute care hospitals in the state, said 15 front-line health care workers including doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists were the first people in Connecticut to receive the vaccine. Applause erupted when Dr. Ajay Kumar, executive vice president and chief clinical officer for Hartford HealthCare, received the first dose. By Dec. 21, shipments of the vaccine are expected be transported to CVS and Walgreens distribution centers and then sent to nursing homes throughout Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont has said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control is closing all nature centers within Delaware State Parks to limit the spread of COVID-19. The nature centers are closed as of Monday through Jan. 11. No in-person programming will be held at Delaware State Parks while the nature centers are closed in order to eliminate gatherings of people from different households. Delaware State Parks will instead offer independent, online programming, such as self-guided hikes, online activities and videos. The virtual programs will be posted on Delaware State Parks’ Facebook, Instagram and YouTube accounts and at the Delaware State Parks Adventure Blog and www.destateparks.com/virtualparks. The closures coincide with Gov. John Carney’s latest stay-at-home advisory, which was issued to “interrupt the dangerous winter surge of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Delaware.” The advisory strongly urges Delawareans to avoid gathering indoors with anyone from outside their households.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The George Washington University Hospital said it would begin administering doses of the coronavirus vaccine Monday – the first doses to go out in the capital region, WUSA-TV reports. The hospital said it received its first shipment of 725 doses Monday morning. That was sooner than expected, and the hospital said it wouldn’t waste any time in beginning administering them. Previously, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that five members of the DC Fire and EMS Department would be among the first to receive the vaccination in the district. Bowser said those “First Five” would be vaccinated by staff at Kaiser Permanente once the hospital group gets its first doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week. “Today, we have hope. After a long and tragic nine months, help is finally on the way,” Bowser said in a statement. “The First Five are sending a strong message about the importance of this vaccine to protect them, their families and loved ones, their patients and co-workers, and our entire city.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A 31-year-old nurse at Tampa General Hospital rolled up her left shirt sleeve Monday and became one of the first people in the state to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccination was held during a news conference at the hospital, with Gov. Ron DeSantis looking on. “Today was really a historic day,” he said. Earlier Monday, DeSantis and others watched as a FedEx truck pulled up to the hospital with the Pfizer vaccine, which was just authorized by the FDA for emergency use last week. The hospital received 3,900 vials Monday. Each vial has five doses. “This is 20,000 doses of hope,” said John Couris, president and chief executive officer of Tampa General Hospital. About a half-hour earlier in Jacksonville, Dr. Leon L. Haley Jr., the CEO of UF Health Jacksonville and dean of the University of Florida College of Medicine – Jacksonville, was vaccinated at UF Health Jacksonville. He was followed by additional doctors, nurses, a pharmacist and other health care workers in the hospital.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A school system in the metro area said Saturday that it’s shutting down in-person classes at three high schools until January because of surging coronavirus infections. School officials in Cherokee County north of Atlanta sent letters Saturday to parents of students at River Ridge, Sequoyah and Woodstock high schools, saying Monday classes would all shift online. Students will also take final exams at home, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. School officials said each school had sent home between 285 and 476 students to quarantine after more than 20 students and staff tested positive for the virus at each campus. Students begin their holiday break Dec. 21, and administrators plan to reopen classrooms Jan. 6. Scattered school closures have happened elsewhere in the state. School officials in Chatham County announced Friday that they’re closing Windsor Forest High School in Savannah to in-person classes because of coronavirus infections among school staff. It will reopen to students Jan. 11.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Corrections officials said an additional 63 inmates and six staff members have tested positive for the coronavirus at a state prison. The outbreak has left 68 inmates and 21 staff members infected with the virus at the Halawa Correctional Facility on Oahu, Hawaii News Now reports. All 936 inmates at the facility are now being tested. A lockdown has been instituted in the facility that suspended all inmate movement and blocked transfers to and from the prison. The quarantine will last for at least two weeks. “HCF immediately enacted its pandemic protocol to isolate these inmates and begin mitigation efforts,” said Max Otani, the state Department of Public Safety’s director. This is the third major outbreak at a Hawaii prison since the pandemic began. The Oahu Community Correctional Center has had 449 inmates test positive for the virus, while the number of inmates infected at the Waiawa Community Correctional Center in Waipahu has topped 200. More than 600 Hawaii inmates have also tested positive for the virus at a privately owned prison in Arizona.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little has authorized another 150 Idaho National Guard soldiers to help medical facilities battle the coronavirus. The Republican governor on Friday added the soldiers to the 100 he activated last month to help the state deal with surging infections and deaths. The 250 soldiers help with mobile testing support, facility decontamination and COVID-19 screenings. They are also helping at food banks. State officials say nearly 120,000 Idaho residents have been infected with the coronavirus, and there have been 1,151 deaths traced to COVID-19. The positivity rate for those getting tested is 20%, well above the 5% or less state officials want.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state received about 43,000 doses in its first shipment of a COVID-19 vaccine Monday as health officials reported another 103 coronavirus deaths statewide. Most of the shots will be distributed to local health care centers for health care workers, according to Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s office. The governor has said he expects Illinois to receive about 109,000 doses within weeks. Chicago officials expect about 20,000 to 25,000 of those doses to arrive in the city. “Eleven months after scientists the world over first got their hands on the genetic sequence of this virus and we are seeing the beginning of the end of this pandemic,” Pritzker said in a statement calling it a ”momentous occasion.” Illinois reported another 7,214 COVID-19 cases Monday. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Illinois has reported more than 850,000 cases. Nearly 14,400 people have died. In Chicago’s Cook County suburbs, health officials expect about 20,000 doses this week for 15 hospitals, Dr. Kiran Joshi, who heads the Cook County Department of Public Health, said during a Monday news conference.\n\nIndiana\n\nNew Albany: A southern Indiana plant is ramping up production of special coolers needed to store and distribute COVID-19 vaccines across the nation to combat the pandemic. Arizona-based Foam Fabricators has increased staffing by 20% at its New Albany plant to keep up with demand for the coolers that will be used for the vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna. That effort has involved both hiring more people and adding more hours per month, said Michael Hays, the company’s vice president. Hays told the News and Tribune that Foam Fabricators has a comprehensive plan to meet the manufacturing demand for molded expanded polystyrene containers – insulated containers with high-quality temperature control needed for storage and distribution of the vaccines. Hays said the company’s plants began production in mid-October of the coolers, which are shipped to a distribution center to be used for the vaccines. Hays said Foam Fabricators is the only company in the nation making the type of coolers that will be used for the COVID-19 vaccines. “These coolers are existing products that are being repurposed for the COVID vaccine,” he said.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: A local nonprofit launched an initiative to feed hungry neighbors when the coronavirus pandemic upended the organization’s usual business model, and now it seeks community support to continue and expand the effort in 2021. Convivium Urban Farmstead has provided 1,150 free casseroles to Dubuque residents in need in the past 12 weeks. “This became a way we solved a problem for ourselves and for the community,” Leslie Shalabi, Convivium’s co-founder, told the Telegraph Herald of Dubuque. Convivium grows its own produce for use in an on-site restaurant and during hands-on classes devoted to nutritious eating. “COVID hit, and it changed things quite a bit,” Shalabi said. The restaurant’s menu changed, and Convivium backed away from hands-on instruction to minimize health risks. However, the organization’s produce kept growing. “We had 3,000 pounds of produce,” Shalabi said. “Our challenge was how to use it up while maintaining our mission.” Convivium officials decided to launch Community Casseroles, an initiative to produce and distribute free, healthy vegetable, grain and protein-based casseroles to local residents in need.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State residents who need a place to isolate themselves after being exposed to or testing positive for the coronavirus may be able to stay for free in a hotel rented out by the state with help from the federal government. The goal of the program is to provide people who have no other place to stay with an option so they don’t spread the virus, said Devan Tucking-Strickler of the Kansas Division of Emergency Management in Topeka. The state is operating hotels in the Kansas City area as well as in Liberal, Dodge City, Salina, Emporia and Lawrence. Tucking-Strickler told The Kansas City Star that she didn’t know how much the state has spent so far on the rooms but that renting out an entire hotel costs roughly $3,000 a day at each site. The Federal Emergency Management Agency helps pay for the rooms. Since the program began in April, about 40 to 50 people a week have typically used the rooms statewide, but lately the occupancy rate has doubled. “Every time I think we’ve had a peak, it blows my mind again. I think right now we’re headed up again, from what I’m looking at,” Tucking-Strickler said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer at University of Louisville Health, became the first person in the state to receive a dose of the new COVID-19 vaccine Monday. Gov. Andy Beshear was on hand to watch as Smith, who is a trauma surgeon, plus two nurses and two other doctors prepared to receive the vaccine that had arrived at U of L about an hour earlier. “Today, for the very first time, we are vaccinating Kentuckians against this virus,” Beshear said. “This is truly a great day in the commonwealth.” Smith said he hopes people will be willing to take the vaccine as it becomes available. “I fully believe this is a safe and effective vaccine,” he said. “I volunteered to go first because of that.” The vaccine arrived at U of L Hospital less than 24 hours after shipments of the drug hailed as a medical miracle touched down at the UPS Worldport Hub at Muhammad Ali International Airport. The long-awaited vaccine produced by Pfizer/BioNTech, the first to get emergency federal authorization, rolled up to U of L Health about 9:40 a.m., with several of the first health workers who volunteered to get the vaccine waiting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state administered its first coronavirus vaccines Monday to health care workers at a New Orleans-area hospital. A livestream video from Ochsner Health’s Jefferson Parish medical center showed the Pfizer shots being administered to workers who regularly encounter COVID-19 patients. “This is huge,” Dr. Katherine Baumgarten said. “It really is a big moment in time. We’ve been waiting a long time for the vaccine to be here. We’ve seen a lot of people that have been sick. People that have died. People that have been in our hospital. Our colleagues.” Dr. Leonardo Seoane, chief academic officer for Ochsner Health, was one of the first employees to get vaccinated. Acknowledging concerns in some minority communities about the vaccine, the Cuban American doctor called it “a privilege” to receive his shot and urged “all of my Hispanic brothers and sisters to do it. It’s OK.” Mia Yepez, an African American nurse who works in a COVID-19 unit, also acknowledged the importance of representing the Black community in getting the vaccine and alluded to the toll the virus has taken on family connections, saying: “We want to reunite with our families as well.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The pandemic seems to be making legislating costly for taxpayers. The session in which lawmakers were sworn in at the Augusta Civic Center cost just over $145,000, including tablets for lawmakers, other technology, lunches and rent for the space that offered more room for social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The cost going forward will be $4,025 a day for rent. The Legislature has no standing contract to continue using the space, but the auditorium is set up for the lawmakers’ return next month, the civic center’s director, Earl Kingsbury, told the Portland Press Herald. The civic center will go unused if it isn’t utilized for legislators because of the state’s cap on gatherings of 50 people, he said. In the first year of the previous Legislature, lawmakers held floor sessions in the Statehouse on 57 days. The cost to taxpayers will be about $229,000 if lawmakers gather that many days at the civic center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Open enrollment ends Tuesday for the state’s health exchange, the online health insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act. The Baltimore Sun reports officials expect extra interest in the insurance, which is for next year, because the coverage has been serving as a health care lifeline to many people who lost employer-related coverage during the coronavirus pandemic. About 80,000 people signed up for immediate coverage during a special enrollment period that started in mid-March on the Maryland Heath Exchange. For the insurance beginning in January, the exchange is offering plans from three insurers: CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente and UnitedHealthcare, which returned to the marketplace for next year after departing a few years ago. Exchange officials say most people are eligible for subsidies to pay premiums, and others qualify for free coverage through Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income residents.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Boston Medical Center said it received its first shipment of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine Monday. Jenny Eriksen Leary, a hospital spokeswoman, said the center received 1,950 doses of the vaccine and would start administering them Wednesday. She said front-line health care workers, including doctors and nurses in the intensive care unit, emergency department and patient floors that treat COVID-19 patients, will be among the first to receive the doses. Employees from environmental and support services, as well as other positions that work in areas with patients who have tested positive for the virus, will also be vaccinated first, Leary said. Police, firefighters, emergency responders and prison inmates are among those who will eventually be targeted in the state’s first phase of vaccine distribution. Other Boston-area hospitals are also expecting deliveries early this week. Tufts Medical Center, also in Boston, said it expects to receive its first shipment of the vaccine Tuesday, as does Mass General Brigham, which operates 12 hospitals in the region.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: County and city leaders are lining up sites for vaccination clinics with hopes that mass immunizations will bring about the end of the pandemic. The city has selected the TCF Center’s parking garage as a primary site for drive-up COVID-19 vaccinations. Mayor Mike Duggan has said he hopes to establish multiple testing sites set up in large parking areas surrounding the city’s arenas with a plan to inoculate as many as 5,000 people a day once there is enough supply of the vaccine. The city also has partnered with Olympia Entertainment, with plans to use one of its parking garages to give coronavirus immunizations. The city hasn’t decided whether it will limit vaccinations at TCF Center and the Olympia parking garage to residents, said Detroit’s Chief Operating Officer Hakim Berry. Because severe allergic reactions have been seen rarely in some people who get the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, the city plans to have people who use the drive-up vaccination sites wait following their shots to ensure there are no problems, Berry said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Minneapolis VA Medical Center received the state’s first shipment of the COVID-19 vaccine Monday, though it wasn’t immediately clear when vaccinations would begin. “This is the day we’ve all been waiting for,” said Gov. Tim Walz, who was at the hospital when the shipment arrived, according to the Star Tribune. Other Minnesota hospital systems expected to receive their initial shipments in the next day or two. “We are very excited to provide a vaccine that has the potential to help get COVID-19 under control when used alongside public health measures such as masking, physical distancing and frequent handwashing,” said Patrick Kelly, director of the Minneapolis VA. Meanwhile, a group called ReOpen Minnesota said more than 200 business owners are committing to reopening this week in defiance of Walz’s executive order that closed bars and restaurants to in-person dining in an effort to curb the coronavirus’ spread. Walz’s four-week closure is set to expire Friday. State health officials on Sunday temporarily suspended the liquor license of one restaurant, Boardwark Bar & Grill in East Grand Forks, days after a Polk County court closed the establishment to in-person dining.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs and State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers were among the first in Mississippi to receive a recently approved COVID-19 vaccine, getting the shots during a news conference Monday. Dobbs, Byers and other health officials were given pharmaceutical company Pfizer's vaccine, which already is being distributed to hundreds of providers in the state. Dobbs said two medical centers in the state have already received their allocations of the vaccine and will be targeting their workers this week. More facilities will receive their allocations Tuesday and Wednesday. Although critical health care workers will be the first to be eligible to receive the vaccinations in Mississippi, they are not mandatory. Dobbs said Friday that he does not anticipate a state mandate requiring the vaccination, but there is a chance private companies may require them as a condition of employment. Byers said the health department hopes to be able to expand vaccination efforts to long-term care facilities once more vaccines are made available.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Health care workers in both of the state’s urban areas received doses of the coronavirus vaccine Monday afternoon – the first people in Missouri other than clinical trial participants to be vaccinated. Thousands of other medical workers across the state will soon follow now that vaccinations have begun at Truman Medical Centers/University Health in Kansas City and at the Mercy hospital system in the St. Louis area. Front-line medical workers such as those who work in emergency rooms and COVID-19 units are the first to get the vaccine at Truman. “This is the light at the end of the tunnel,” Dr. Mark Steele, Truman’s executive chief clinical officer, said in a statement. “But it’s a very long tunnel. And so while the vaccine has arrived, we urge the public to continue to wear masks and practice social distancing.” At Mercy Hospital South in St. Louis County, infectious disease specialist and chief medical officer Dr. Aamina Akhtar was the first to get a vaccination. She told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch it felt “just like my flu shot.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A hospital in the city was the state’s first to receive a shipment of the COVID-19 vaccine Monday. The first doses will go to the hospital’s front-line staff, St. Vincent Healthcare Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Bush said in a statement. “We will prioritize administration of the vaccine in accordance with federal and state-approved guidelines. Ultimately, our goal will be to vaccinate as many of our health care workers as possible,” Bush said. Ten health care facilities in Montana’s seven largest communities are set to receive a total of 9,750 doses this week of the COVID-19 vaccine produced by drug company Pfizer.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state received its first vaccine shipment Monday and expects to get more than 100,000 doses this month to treat front-line health care workers, state officials said. Dr. Gary Anthone, Nebraska’s chief medical officer, said the initial shipments had arrived at two hospitals as of mid-morning. Nebraska’s distribution plan calls for the first vaccine doses to go to front-line health workers and other key professions, including meatpacking workers and teachers. Gov. Pete Ricketts said the general public likely won’t be eligible until April. CHI Health Vice President of Pharmacy Mike Tiesi said the first shipment of four boxes of the vaccine arrived at CHI Health Creighton University Medical Center - Bergan Mercy hospital in Omaha on Monday morning. “This is the hope we have been looking for, waiting for,” Tiesi said Monday. “I can’t wait until this gets into the hands – or the arms – of the general public later this spring.” Officials at Bryan Health in Lincoln said they also received their first shipment Monday and planned to start vaccinating employees later in the day.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Tightened restrictions on businesses and gatherings implemented in late November will remain in effect until at least Jan. 15, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Sunday. In a frank and somber address, the Democratic governor said he understood that limiting capacity for businesses including restaurants, casinos, gyms and bars was “devastating to many Nevadans who just want to go back to normal.” But the measures were needed to “bridge” the state to the time at which a vaccine can be widely distributed, he said. “With the combination of the extension, the protocols that are still in place and the vaccines that are coming, we’re hopeful we’ll be in a better place by the time this would expire,” Sisolak said. The governor said he understood criticisms from both devastated business owners and people who monitor the trends and wonder why the record-setting surge hasn’t prompted him to shut down casinos. He reiterated the difficult balancing act required to keep Nevada workers and families afloat while also containing the spread of the virus and said he may adjust restrictions based on the trajectory of the virus over the next month.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A high-ranking Republican in the state House of Representatives said she has contracted COVID-19, less than a week after the House speaker died of the disease. Kimberly Rice, of Hudson, said on Facebook that she is “feeling horrible” and struggling to breathe but vowed to beat the virus. “This has been one of the toughest weeks I think I’ve ever had,” she wrote in a post Saturday. Rice was recently appointed to one of the leading positions in the House. Her announcement follows the unexpected death of Dick Hinch, who was sworn in Dec. 2 as leader of the state’s 400-member, Republican-led Legislature. A medical examiner ruled that he died of COVID-19. More than a quarter of House members, most of them Democrats, skipped the swearing-in ceremony after learning the day before that several Republican lawmakers had tested positive for the virus after attending a Nov. 20 indoor meeting. Rice did not say where she may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The governor says health care workers will begin receiving vaccinations for the coronavirus this week. Gov. Phil Murphy told ABC’s “This Week” that he will be at University Hospital in Newark on Tuesday for the first COVID-19 vaccinations. He said the bulk of the 76,000 doses constituting the first batch of the Pfizer vaccine will go to health care workers, with some going to residents and staff at long-term care homes. The governor said he believes that by April or May, everyone in the state will have access to one of the vaccines. He’s urging people not to relax efforts to stem the spread of the virus, especially limiting holiday celebrations to immediate family. “For all the good news … the next number of weeks are going to be hell, I fear. So we’re begging people to please, please, please don’t let your guard down, even when you’re in private settings,” the Democratic governor said, adding that 60% to 80% of transmission is now believed to be occurring in such settings.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The first coronavirus vaccines arrived in the state Monday as hospitals prepared to distribute doses to front-line health care workers. State officials said shipments arrived at the New Mexico Department of Health’s warehouse and at a hospital in Santa Fe, where those workers at high to medium risk would be vaccinated later in the day. In all, New Mexico will get 17,550 doses as part of the first distribution wave, and hospital officials expressed confidence that there would be enough doses for all employees who want to be inoculated. The shipments came as new COVID-19 cases have decreased but hospitalizations and deaths remain high. On Sunday, New Mexico tied its previous record of 44 for the number of coronavirus-related deaths reported in a single day. The statewide death toll is nearing 2,000, while the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began is just shy of 120,000.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The storied 21 Club in midtown Manhattan, a favorite of celebrities and the power elite for nine decades, is closing indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the owners are optimistic about reopening at some point. The restaurant’s owners filed notice about the closing with the city Wednesday, saying all 148 employees will be terminated March 9. Indoor dining at New York City restaurants is banned again starting Monday in an effort to halt a resurgence of the virus, but takeout and outdoor dining will still be allowed. The restaurant has been closed since March during the first wave of the pandemic, when indoor dining was also prohibited. The 21 Club was a favorite dining place of presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s day. Shortly after the 2016 election, then-President-elect Donald Trump broke protocol by leaving his Trump Tower residence without taking along his press contingent to eat at the restaurant. John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway and Frank Sinatra had favorite tables at 21, and Humphrey Bogart proposed to Lauren Bacall there. It appeared in films ranging from the 1950 Bette Davis classic “All About Eve” to 1987’s “Wall Street.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians won’t implement Gov. Roy Cooper’s new executive order on virus restrictions. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports the tribe’s Principal Chief Richard Sneed announced Friday that the tribe won’t adopt Cooper’s latest order at the Qualla Boundary in the westernmost corner of the state. Sneed wrote in a statement on Facebook that he has worked with tribal public health officials to enact social distancing measures to protect tribal citizens and guests while balancing the financial position of the community. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians had reported a total of 652 COVID-19 cases as of Thursday, 58 of which are active. Health officials said just two people were hospitalized. The tribe slowly began to reopen businesses in May, including its two casinos. Cooper’s order went into effect at 10 p.m. Friday. Under the modified stay-at-home order, alcohol sales are banned after 9 p.m., and most businesses must close by 10 p.m. Grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations are an exception.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state received its first doses of a coronavirus vaccine Monday and set about getting it to workers at a local hospital who have been treating COVID-19 patients. A box of 2,925 doses of the Pfizer vaccine packed in dry ice arrived at Sanford Health just before 7 a.m., a moment the organization’s head of pharmacy said created “a tremendous amount of joy and happiness.” The hospital was to begin administering the vaccine Monday afternoon. “It is definitely like Christmas came early,” said Jesse Breidenbach, Sanford’s senior executive director of pharmacy. “It’s really hard to describe the significance. So much planning went into this.” Dr. Avish Nagpal, an infectious disease specialist at Sanford, was scheduled to get the first shot. North Dakota has been at the focal point of infections since the virus began sweeping the Plains in the summer. The state for many weeks led the country in the number of cases in relation to population, and its death toll is fourth in the nation per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. While the state has seen a recent decline in cases, Breidenbach said it’s refreshing to have the medicine that will “fight directly” against the virus.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Front-line health workers caring for COVID-19 patients at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center lined up Monday for shots of the first vaccine built to fight the new coronavirus. The first recipients were cardiac critical care nurses. UCMC and the Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University received the first shipments of 975 doses each of the vaccine, developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. On Tuesday, eight more hospitals across Ohio will receive 975 doses each. Another 88,725 doses were expected to ship for Walgreens and CVS Pharmacies across the state to distribute beginning Dec. 21 to residents and staff at Ohio’s nursing homes. Gov. Mike DeWine and his wife, Fran, stood outside the Wexner Medical Center on Monday morning to await the vaccine delivery. “It’s a very, very exciting day for Ohio. It starts the process of the end,” DeWine said. “This is the day we have been waiting for.” Just before noon, the first needle hit the left deltoid muscle of registered nurse Katie Walz, who works in the cardiovascular intensive care unit at UCMC.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The first shipment of a coronavirus vaccine to Oklahoma arrived Monday, state officials said. State health commissioner Dr. Lance Frye has said about 33,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were expected in the initial shipment. Front-line health care workers will be the first to receive vaccinations, according to plans developed by the state Department of Health. Long-term care providers and residents, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, and pharmacy staff who will administer the vaccine in long-term care facilities are also to be among the first inoculated. More of the vaccine will arrive each week. And later this week, the FDA will decide whether to green-light the world’s second rigorously studied COVID-19 vaccine, made by Moderna Inc. Frye has said about 166,000 vaccine doses are expected in Oklahoma by the end of the month. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in Oklahoma is little changed, from 3,030.7 new cases per day Nov. 29 to 3,026 on Sunday. The rolling average of daily deaths in the state increased from from 14.6 per day to 24 during the same time frame.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Saturday, adding 9,596 new cases. That’s down 10.6% from the previous week’s toll of 10,737 new cases. Oregon ranked No. 47 among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. The share of test results that came back positive was 7.8% in the latest week, compared with 6.5% in the week before, according to the network’s analysis of COVID Tracking Project data. In the latest week, 123,261 tests were administered; a week earlier, that figure was 165,081. Experts say it is important to look at the share of tests that come back positive, not just case counts, to get a better idea of whether the rate of new infections is changing or if differences in testing are playing a role. In the week ending Saturday, 123 people with COVID-19 died in Oregon. In the previous week, 131 people died.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The Philadelphia Flower Show, which bills itself as “the nation’s largest and longest-running horticultural event,” will move outside next year for the first time in its nearly 200-year history because of the coronavirus pandemic. The 2021 event will take place in FDR Park in south Philadelphia instead of downtown’s Pennsylvania Convention Center, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society said recently. The show attracted 250,000 visitors in 2019. The show is scheduled for June 5-13, but organizers are worried there is no definitive timetable for the widespread availability of a vaccine to curb the virus, which has seen recent spikes in the city. “We are working closely with our colleagues at Philadelphia Parks and Recreation and a host of planning experts including the Department of Public Health in Philadelphia to develop the Flower Show into a safe, beautiful, and extraordinary outdoor experience for everyone,” the society said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A hospital doctor became the first person in the state to receive a coronavirus vaccine Monday. Dr. Christian Arbelaez, a physician at Rhode Island Hospital, was the first in line for a shot of the vaccine developed by Pfizer. He said he was “filled with adrenaline and happiness” and thankful for scientists who developed the medication. “I’m excited for all of us to be able to return back to a normal life and see our loved ones,” Arbelaez told reporters. Rhode Island Hospital was among a number of hospitals in the state that received shipments of the drug Monday, following emergency authorization last week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Lifespan, the hospital chain that oversees Rhode Island Hospital, said it received about 3,000 doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for use in its facilities. The organization said it would start administering it to those at highest risk, including providers and staff who have direct contact with coronavirus patients or infectious fluids or materials.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Some front-line health care workers received vaccinations for COVID-19 on Monday as the state looks to quickly distribute its first shipments of the vaccine. The Department of Health and Environmental Control said it received its first allocation of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine Monday. The agency anticipates nearly 43,000 doses to arrive by Wednesday, with an expected 200,000 to 300,000 doses by the end of the year. Critical health care workers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities will be first in line to receive the vaccine. “Our frontline healthcare workers have sacrificed so much for our people this year. Now, we’ve received the first shipments of the COVID-19 vaccine and medical professionals across the state will begin receiving doses soon,” Gov. Henry McMaster tweeted Monday. “We are witnessing American ingenuity at its finest!” By Monday morning, Conway Medical Center in Horry County was already vaccinating workers. The Horry County hospital has received 975 doses, and about 100 employees have already volunteered for the vaccine there, WPDE-TV reports.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Another state lawmaker has tested positive for the coronavirus after attending Gov. Kristi Noem’s budget address last week and visiting the governor’s mansion. Sen. Reynold Nesiba said he was tested for the virus Friday and got the positive results Saturday. The 54-year-old Sioux Falls Democrat said he has experienced minor coronavirus symptoms, KSFY-TV reports. Nesiba said he suspected he contracted the virus while attending a committee meeting last Monday or during the budget address on the House floor Tuesday. He said he always wore a mask in the Capitol except when he was in his office. Sen. Helene Duhamel, a Republican from Rapid City, became ill and tested positive for the virus last week. She, too, attended the budget address and event at the governor’s mansion. The 58-year-old Rapid City Republican posed with Noem and other lawmakers at the Capitol, and none wore masks. The Legislature is scheduled to convene Jan. 12. Several lawmakers have reported bouts with the coronavirus, including Rep. Bob Glanzer, who was among the first in the state to die from the virus in April.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials say the first shipments of COVID-19 vaccine won’t arrive at hospitals until Thursday, days after some facilities hoped to begin vaccinations, as Tennessee falls behind its counterparts in a race to protect health care workers from the virus. The Tennessee Department of Health announced the very first allotment of Pfizer’s two-dose vaccine – an early shipment of 975 doses – arrived Monday and will be held in reserve as a “backup supply.” The state’s primary supply of about 56,000 more doses will ship Wednesday and arrive at “28 sites covering 74 Tennessee hospitals” on Thursday, according to a news release from the health department. Many hospitals in the capital area and across the state, though, were prepared to begin administering the vaccine Tuesday, in hopes they could hit the milestone earlier.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine began arriving Monday. The Texas Department of State Health Services said 19,500 doses of the vaccine were headed to four sites in the state: MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Methodist Dallas Medical Center, Wellness 360 at UT Health San Antonio and UT Health Austin’s Dell Medical School. Methodist Health System began administering vaccinations about 10:10 a.m. Monday, with the first shot going to an environmental services employee who cleans the emergency room at Methodist Dallas, spokesman Ryan Owens said. Another 75,000 doses of the vaccine were scheduled to be delivered Tuesday to 19 sites in Texas, state officials said, in the largest vaccination campaign in U.S. history. UT Health Austin-Dell Medical School will vaccinate more than 2,900 health care providers, including faculty, residents and medical students, over the next 10 days, said Amy Young, chief clinical officer at the teaching hospital. “Part of the reason this is so exciting is that this is our community and the world’s first step to combating this virus going forward,” Young said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Student scores in the city’s elementary schools are down while youngsters attend school online amid the coronavirus pandemic. The percentage of students scoring below grade level in one or more subjects is up from 23% in 2019 to 32% this year, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Students scored lowest for reading and writing, on which about 40% of elementary kids are now scoring below standard. Student proficiency fell the most in science, however. Sixth graders scored worst as a group. Similar declines during the pandemic have occurred across districts in Salt Lake County including Granite School District, where students may attend school either in person or online. Most failing students in Granite School District had chosen to take virtual courses. Salt Lake City is the only district in the state to require all students to stay home for instruction this fall. Junior high and high school students in Salt Lake City have received about twice as many F grades so far this academic year. Elementary students, who are graded somewhat differently than older students, saw their rate triple.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Johnsbury: The COVID-19 pandemic will be preventing firefighters and others in the area from delivering boxes of toys and food to people in parts of the Northeast Kingdom. St. Johnsbury Fire Capt. Mike Pelow told the Caledonian Record the pandemic means the normal gathering of volunteers in the firehouse to load trucks can’t happen. Rather than having face-to-face doorstep greetings between recipients and people delivering the gift boxes, most of the local people in need of toys or food items will have to pick them up. Details on how people can pick up the boxes vary by community. People must register to receive the packages. Registrations will be accepted through Dec. 18 by the St. Johnsbury Fire Department.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The state’s newest restrictions to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus have taken effect. The Virginian-Pilot reports the new rules include curbing late-night activities and gatherings of large groups. Gov. Ralph Northam’s order limits social gatherings to no more than 10 people. The limit had been 25 people previously. The order also expands mask requirements. Anyone over age 5 needs to wear one anytime they are outside their home and unable to stay at least 6 feet from others. There is also a curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. The curfew does not apply to people who are working or for other specified reasons, which could include exercising or “taking care of individuals or animals.” Restaurants also must close by midnight and stop selling alcohol by 10 p.m. The restrictions are in place until Jan. 31. Violating them could result in a Class 1 misdemeanor charge, which carries up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The COVID-19 vaccine has begun arriving in the state, which saw the nation’s first confirmed case of the respiratory illness and its first deadly outbreak at a nursing home, and authorities are getting shots ready for people in high-risk categories who will be eligible to receive it in the first distribution phase. About 3,900 doses of the Pfizer vaccine arrived at UW Medical Center early Monday morning. The vaccine delivery to UW Medical center was among the first in the state, a day after Gov. Jay Inslee said the vaccine received approval by a Western states review board. Federal officials had previously OK’d the Pfizer shots. Inslee said vaccinations would begin Tuesday. The Department of Health said it expects to get 62,400 doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week, which will be distributed to 17 sites in 13 counties. By the end of December, the state expects to get another 222,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. And, if a vaccine developed by Moderna gets authorized, the state said it should get about 183,800 doses of that offering by the end of December\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said he would get a coronavirus shot Monday as the first vaccine doses arrived. He said he would receive a shot before cameras Monday afternoon, which would make him one of the first top elected officials in the country to get vaccinated. Officials said they want to demonstrate their confidence in the vaccine. “I’m all in,” the 69-year-old Justice said at a news conference. “I want all West Virginians to know that I have all the faith that I can possibly have that this vaccine will work and that this vaccine is safe.” It could be months before the general public has access to a vaccine. Justice has emphasized the need to get older residents vaccinated first. “We’re going to move at light speed to get you vaccinated,” Justice said, urging people to keep wearing masks. A record 130 people died from the virus last week in West Virginia, up 15.5% from the previous week. The state’s number of total deaths, 978, has doubled since early November.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The first Wisconsinites were inoculated against COVID-19 on Monday with the vaccine made by Pfizer and the German biotechnology firm BioNTech. UW Health in Madison received its initial shipment of 3,900 doses and expected to vaccinate only five to 10 of its employees on the first day, according to Matthew Anderson, UW Health’s senior medical director primary care. As the hospital receives more doses, Anderson said he expects to ramp up vaccinations to about 400 or 500 a day. Wisconsin expects to receive 49,725 doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week. Soon after, the state should receive about 101,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine made by Moderna as long as that company receives emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “This is the most significant public health undertaking of our lifetime,” said Julie Willems Van Dijk, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Almost one-quarter of the people in the state’s correctional system have tested positive for the coronavirus, Wyoming’s new corrections director said. So far, no one in the system has died of the COVID-19 illness, Corrections Director Dan Shannon told the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee on Friday. Twenty percent of corrections institution staff have also tested positive, and 33% have had to isolate because they tested positive or had other known exposure, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Shannon provided a summary of his department’s steps taken in response to the pandemic: halting visitations, implementing medical screenings for staff, undergoing constant sanitation, and enforcing mask use for staff and inmates. Shannon became the department’s director in October. “If there is a bright outcome on the horizon, it’s our department’s performance, actually,” he said. “It has been exceptional compared to our surrounding states, such as Montana and Utah.” Wyoming is among six states with no reported COVID-19 prison-system deaths.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/23/governors-vaccinated-christmas-precautions-medical-worker-shortage-news-around-states/115208798/", "title": "Governors vaccinated, Christmas precautions, medical worker ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Gov. Kay Ivey became one of the first governors on Monday to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, bidding to build public confidence in the vaccinations that will have to be widely administered to ease the pandemic. “We want to send a clear message to all Alabamians that we can have confidence in this vaccine and its effectiveness. I want to assure people it is a safe thing to do and if everybody will take the vaccine voluntarily we’ll have good strong immunity and it will stop COVID-19,” Ivey said at a news conference. She spoke after getting the first of the two-shot Pfizer vaccine at Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery. State Health Officer Scott Harris and State Chief Medical Officer Mary McIntyre also received the vaccine. The 76-year-old Republican governor, a lung cancer survivor, said she had no hesitation about taking the vaccine and urged others to take it as it becomes available. “Shoot, a sore arm for a few days is a lot better than three months on a ventilator,” Ivey said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A mask mandate in Juneau has been extended for at least six months. The ordinance passed by the City and Borough of Juneau Assembly upholds the requirement for masks to be worn in all indoor public settings and outdoors when within 6 feet of other people. Alaska is one of 12 states without a statewide mask mandate. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has said that although he acknowledged the efficacy of masks, which has been corroborated by studies from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization, the issue is best delegated to local governments. But many local officials in the state have said they do not have the power to implement mask mandates or that they would let businesses decide for themselves. In Juneau, where a mask mandate was imposed when the state was experiencing roughly 10% of the cases it has reported in December, some business owners said they have embraced the policy change.\n\nArizona\n\nWindow Rock: The Navajo Nation reported 158 new coronavirus cases on Monday and two more deaths from COVID-19. The latest figures from the Navajo Department of Health bring the total number of cases on the reservation that extends into Arizona, New Mexico and Utah to 21,177. The Navajo Nation has reported 748 deaths since the pandemic hit. Tribal officials are urging residents of the vast reservation to stay vigilant to help stop the spread of the coronavirus amid the holiday season when families usually gather to celebrate. “We saw a spike in new COVID-19 cases following Thanksgiving, so we want to avoid that happening again,” said Navajo President Jonathan Nez. He encouraged everyone to spend Christmas with only the people in their household. A stay-at-home order is in effect until Dec. 28, along with a weekend lockdown where business hours are limited. The tribe also requires masks to be worn in public.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas received more doses Monday of coronavirus vaccines as the number of virus-related deaths continued to mount in the state, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said.The state reported 58 deaths from COVID-19 on Monday, though about one-third of those were delayed reports, Hutchinson said. The state saw 1,457 new cases of the virus, and more than 1,000 people remained hospitalized. Also Monday, Arkansas began receiving shipments of the newly approved coronavirus vaccine from Moderna, with 5,900 doses and additional shipments planned for Tuesday and Wednesday, Hutchinson said. The state also received 18,575 doses of Pfizer’s vaccine. “While this news provides hope for many, it is a continued concern to see the loss of 58 additional Arkansans … We must steel our resolve to take every precaution to keep everyone safe,” Hutchinson said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Much of California has exhausted its usual ability to staff intensive care beds, and the nation’s most populated state is desperately searching for 3,000 temporary medical workers to meet demand during a recent surge of coronavirus cases. State officials are reaching out to foreign partners in places like Australia and Taiwan amid a shortage of temporary medical workers in the U.S., particularly nurses trained in critical care. California hospitals typically turn to staffing agencies during flu season, when they rely on travel nurses to meet patient care needs. It is the only state in the nation with strict nurse-to-patient ratios requiring hospitals to provide one nurse for every two patients in intensive care and one nurse for every four patients in emergency rooms, for example. However, those ratio requirements are being waived at many hospitals as virus cases surge. But the pool of available travel nurses is drying up as demand for them jumped to 44% over the last month, with California, Texas, Florida, New York and Minnesota requesting the most extra staff, according to San Diego-based health care staffing firm Aya Healthcare. It is one of two companies contracted by California to fulfill hospitals’ staffing requests.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Lawmakers will pause their upcoming new legislative session soon after convening in January as they wait for COVID-19 cases to subside, Democratic leaders said Monday. Lawmakers will begin the new session Jan. 13 and address any urgent business and required actions, like swearing in new members, as quickly as possible before temporarily going into recess, Senate President Leroy Garcia, incoming House Speaker Alec Garnett and others leaders said in a joint announcement. The tentative plan is to reconvene Feb. 16 when leaders hope the peak of the coronavirus pandemic will have subsided and there will be less of a health risk for those at the state Capitol. However, they said that lawmakers would resume work earlier that if there is an emergency that requires immediate attention. Earlier this month, lawmakers wrapped up a short special session to approve assistance to restaurants and food pantries struggling to keep their doors open during the pandemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The second approved vaccine to fight COVID-19 began arriving in Connecticut on Monday as a state advisory panel met to discuss who gets vaccinated next. Workers at Hartford Hospital began unloading 8,800 doses of the Moderna vaccine shortly after 10:30 a.m. to the applause of health care workers. Critical care nurse Mandy Delgado was the first at the hospital to get a Moderna shot, saying she was hopeful vaccinations will lead to fewer patients being admitted with the virus. “Working in critical care, I’ve been exhausted, overwhelmed, seeing patients come in needing more oxygen and able to talk and progressively getting worse, then actually dying, and families not being there,” she said. Gov. Ned Lamont said the state expects to receive 63,300 doses of the Moderna vaccine this week, as well as 24,375 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. That is in addition to the 31,200 doses of the Pfizer vaccine the state received last week, Lamont said. The doses arriving this week are targeted for front-line health care workers and those in nursing homes.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Those who plan to attend Mass on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day in one of the 74 Catholic parishes or mission churches in Delaware or Maryland’s Eastern Shore are urged to check their parish’s website or bulletin before heading out, as some are requiring advanced reservations in order to comply with state mandated attendance limitations because of the recent uptick in area COVID-19 cases. “We want to avoid having to turn people away at the door,” said the Most Reverend W. Francis Malooly, bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Wilmington. “Parishes are following government guidelines to make sure everyone stays safe and healthy during Christmas and beyond. Limiting attendance, social distancing, wearing masks and other requirements will be in place to assure that we will all be around when our Christmas Masses are once again standing room only.” The dispensation from the obligation to attend Sunday and Holy Day Masses that Malooly instituted in March remains in place in the Diocese of Wilmington. Many parishes are livestreaming or posting prerecorded Masses on their YouTube, Facebook or web pages. Catholics are encouraged to check their parish website or bulletin to find out if and when their Christmas Mass will be available online. Christmas Eve Mass with Malooly will be livestreamed from the Cathedral of Saint Peter in Wilmington at 2 p.m. Wednesday. Viewers can watch it live or recorded at youtube.com/dioceseofwilm.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Dr. Ankoor Shah, interim principal deputy director of DC Health, said the District is expecting to get 12,600 doses of the Moderna vaccine and 4,700 more doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week, WUSA-TV reported. D.C. will also be getting more than 16,000 additional doses of vaccine through an agreement with Maryland and Virginia to help vaccinate DC health care workers who live in those states. Shah said the District was allocated vaccine doses from the federal government based on its population, not on the size of its health care workforce, which has put it below where it needs to be. “We are getting less than what we deserve, and that is a simple fact,” Shah said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:A former Florida Department of Health employee sued the state on Monday over a search warrant executed on her house after investigators said they identified a message sent from a computer at the address to health department employees. Rebekah Jones, who was fired in May for insubordination after repeatedly violating department policy about communicating with the media, helped create the state’s coronavirus dashboard. She contended that she was fired for not falsifying data. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement served the search warrant earlier this month. Jones posted a 31-second video of officers entering her home, and the department later released more than 20 minutes of bodycam video that showed she refused to respond to phone calls and knocks on her door. The message that led to the search warrant implored employees still at the Health Department “to speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don’t have to be a part of this. Be a hero.” Jones has had several run-ins with law enforcement over personal issues, but has gained international attention by disputing Florida’s COVID-19 statistics. She was paid almost $48,000 a year as a Department of Health employee, but since May has raised nearly $260,000 on a GoFundMe account after criticizing Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. No charges have been filed in the investigation.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta:Georgia K-12 public schools have the option not to count year-end tests toward students’ final grades this year because of schooling hardships from the COVID-19 pandemic following a vote Monday by the state Board of Education. State law requires scores on the annual Georgia Milestones tests to account for 20% of the cumulative grades for most of the state’s public-school students, from the third grade up to their senior year of high school. But this year, the Milestones scores can be counted essentially zero after State School Superintendent Richard Woods won approval for his proposal to water down the tests so students and teachers can have some relief as they continue working through tremendous challenges due to the virus. School districts now have leeway to recalculate final course grades for the fall semester and count the tests as 0.01% if they want, a state Department of Education spokesperson confirmed. The same 0.01% weight can also apply for year-end tests in the upcoming spring semester.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii’s rural island of Kauai had only 61 known coronavirus cases from March through September. But after Oct. 15, when the state launched a pretravel testing program to reignite its decimated tourism economy, Kauai had at least 84 new cases in the ensuing seven weeks. The surge seeded community transmission and led to the island’s first – and so far only – COVID-19 death: Ron Clark, who worked for decades as a tour driver. Despite Hawaii’s cautious effort at reopening that allowed travelers who tested negative for COVID-19 before they flew to the state to sidestep quarantine rules, the Kauai spike illustrates the difficulty of preserving public health – even on an isolated island – when economic recovery relies on travel. Kauai officials have decided the cost of vacationing in paradise, for now, is too high. Clark got COVID-19 in November and died about 10 days later. The day after Clark’s death, Kauai officials said they would opt out of the state’s testing program and require visitors to again quarantine for two weeks whether they test negative for COVID-19 before arriving. Kauai officials say the single-test scheme did not do enough to protect the people who live there. With only nine ICU beds and 14 ventilators, the island’s health care system could quickly become overwhelmed by a large outbreak, said Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami. After the Kauai surge, the state Department of Health traced most of the island’s October and November cases to returning residents and tourists who brought the virus in despite the pre-flight testing program.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Life could be back to normal in about four months with coronavirus vaccinations now being administered, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican late last week said health care workers and long-term care facility residents should have their vaccinations by the end of January. He said the next wave of vaccinations to essential workers such as firefighters and police could be done by June. But he said it will be longer than that before everyone who wants a vaccination can get one. “With the vaccines coming, we are maybe 120 days away from, for the most part, life back to normal,” Little said, the Post Register reported. “And it will be longer than that before everyone gets vaccinated.” About 3,500 people have been vaccinated since the initial shots started last week. Little said he expects vaccinations to pick up in the coming weeks as federal authorities have now approved two different vaccinations. “It’s going to be my responsibility to help make the point, and have our public health officials make the case to people to choose to get that vaccine,” Little said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An Illinois woman who ordered flags for her grandmother’s garden got a surprise when the package arrived – someone’s apparent coronavirus test specimen. Andrea Ellis was wrapping Christmas gifts at her aunt’s house in East Moline, in northwestern Illinois, when she opened a padded envelope containing the flags she ordered weeks ago from the department store chain Kohl’s, according to The Quad City Times. “I pulled out the flags and I told my aunt, ‘Look how cute these are,’ ” she said. “I pulled out the packing slip and then noticed something deeper inside the envelope and pulled that out. It was a biohazard bag containing someone’s COVID-19 test specimen.” Ellis, who didn’t immediately reply to a phone message from the Associated Press, called the police, who referred the issue to the county health department, according to East Moline police Chief Jeff Ramsey. Janet Hill, the chief operating officer at the Rock Island County Health Department, told the AP that she picked up the biohazard bag over the weekend and that it appeared to contain a used nasal swab and identifying information of a person from Virginia. She said she was figuring out what to do next, including contacting health officials in Virginia and trying to determine if the specimen was still viable. Wisconsin-based Kohl’s issued a statement apologizing for “this very unusual and inexplicable experience” and saying the package was sent from an “outside direct ship vendor” and not directly from the retail chain. The company said it launched its own investigation, but it declined to give further details, including the name of the vendor.\n\nIndiana\n\nKokomo: Fiat Chrysler has pushed back the reopening of a shuttered Indiana factory until late 2021, blaming delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Company officials had announced in March a $400 million plan to convert a Kokomo transmission factory so that it could begin engine production within the first three months of 2021. That reopening has been delayed until 2021’s last quarter, in part because of the company’s eight-week shutdown earlier this year, Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman Jodi Tinson told the Kokomo Tribune. Older equipment has been removed from the factory and interior walls and offices torn down as part of the conversion project, Tinson said. Steel is being raised to add a 30,000-square-foot addition to provide more manufacturing space. Fiat Chrysler said it plans to make the factory into the U.S. production site for the Global Medium Engine Turbo 4 for Jeep Wranglers and Cherokees, which is now built in Italy. Officials said the project would retain about 1,000 jobs and add nearly 200, bringing the total Fiat Chrysler workforce at its Kokomo-area factories to more than 8,000.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Iowans are heading into the winter holidays with few restrictions on gathering or social activities despite significant numbers of recent COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations in the state. The state Health Department on Monday reported 600 new confirmed cases of the disease caused by the coronavirus but no new deaths from it, though fewer tests were conducted in the past few days and there was a delay in the reporting of deaths. The state reported 138 deaths on Sunday after listing none in the previous two days. Public health officials revised the state’s method of calculating deaths earlier this month and said the new system would likely delay the reporting of COVID-19 deaths by up to a week. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in Iowa has risen slightly, from nearly 44 per day in the two weeks that ended Dec. 5 to nearly 46 per day during the two weeks that ended Dec. 19, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kansas will need far more doses of coronavirus vaccines than it’s set to receive in the coming days to start giving shots to all residents 75 or older, officials at a major health care system said as the state reported its worst seven-day spike in COVID-19 deaths of the pandemic. State officials expect Kansas’ 49,000 doses of a vaccine made by Moderna set to arrive this week to go to local health departments and community health care centers, so that they can vaccine health care workers, said Ashley Jones-Wisner, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The state’s first vaccine shipments last week, 23,750 doses made by Pfizer, went to hospitals for at-risk health care workers. The state’s vaccine distribution plan calls for vaccines first to go to health care workers, workers in nursing homes and nursing home residents, though Jones-Wisner said another shipment of Pfizer’s vaccines, expected to be 17,550 doses, will be used to start those shots. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses. “Somebody’s going to feel left out, because there’s not enough,” said Dr. Steve Stites, the chief medical officer for the University of Kansas Health System. “We just have to have a lot more of the vaccine.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Together with top state lawmakers, Gov. Andy Beshear and first lady Britainy Beshear received COVID-19 vaccinations Tuesday. The Democratic governor thanked the top two Republican legislative leaders, House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers, for joining him in “setting the right example for the people of Kentucky.” The head of the Kentucky National Guard, the lieutenant governor and state police commissioner will receive vaccines on Wednesday, Beshear said. “As more quantities become available, we will be providing them to more officeholders and or critical physicians,” he said. “Again, we’re doing this in a way that preserves 99.99% of these for front-line workers and for long-term care but builds confidence as we go.” About 7,000 Kentuckians, the vast majority of them health care workers in hospitals, have been vaccinated since Dec. 14.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Louisiana Supreme Court on Monday sent a legal feud between Gov. John Bel Edwards and House Republicans over coronavirus restrictions back to district court, saying the judge ruled too quickly that the state law the GOP used to try to nullify the restrictions was unconstitutional. The justices wrote in their opinion that Baton Rouge Judge William Morvant should have held a full hearing on other issues raised in the lawsuit over the Democratic governor’s statewide mask mandate, business restrictions and crowd size limits aimed at fighting the spread of COVID-19. “We find the district court acted prematurely in reaching the issue of constitutionality,” the justices wrote. The high court’s decision requires Morvant to hold another hearing in the case. The Edwards administration intends to continue enforcing its COVID-19 rules while the case is pending. The governor has since issued tougher restrictions than those that drew objections from House Republicans, as Louisiana sees a spike in coronavirus cases.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The bishop of Maine’s Roman Catholic diocese called on Catholics in the state to observe social distancing and other precautions this Christmas. Bishop Robert Deeley said 2020 is a year for “a different Christmas” because of the coronavirus pandemic. He said he plans to stay home and celebrate livestreamed Masses on Christmas morning at midnight and 10 a.m. this year. Deeley said it’s a good year to “put more lights up outside the house but bring less people into the house.” He also encouraged the use of facial coverings in any gatherings that involve people from different households. Deeley previously called on the state’s Catholics to use the coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available to them\n\nMaryland\n\nWilliamsport:The town has announced plans to line Byron Memorial Park with luminarias Saturday night to honor those who have died from COVID-19 and those who have contracted the disease, as well as others who have been impacted by the pandemic. Williamsport Main Street Manager Kathyrn Gratton said in a news release that living through 2020 has been challenging but strength has been found in those challenges. The luminarias that will placed throughout the park will be meant to shine a light on that strength, Gratton said. The event, made possible by a partnership between the town and the Williamsport Lions Club, will involve the lighting of the luminarias starting at dusk, according to the release. The luminarias will remain lit through the night and will coincide with ongoing holiday displays in the park. The event is also meant to honor the business community, all first responders who have been on the front line in the pandemic and the community as a whole, according to the release. Those coming to the park to view the lights are being asked to practice safe measures such as social distancing and use of masks. For those who wish to remain home, a Facebook Live video will be shown on the Town of Williamsport and Main Street Williamsport Facebook pages.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art has temporarily closed again in response to the latest statewide spike in COVID-19 cases. The closure that began Monday is precautionary, Alexandra Kennedy, executive director of the museum told The Daily Hampshire Gazette. Staff will continue to go into the museum on an as-needed basis and the museum’s bookshop will offer curbside service, she said. “We are hoping we can reopen to visitors early in the new year,” Kennedy wrote in an email. Museum officials said they will monitor state health data and reopen as soon it’s safe for staff, visitors and the community. Everyone who has purchased advanced tickets will be issued a refund. The museum closed in March at the start of the pandemic and reopened in August with strict protocols in place, including advanced registration for most visits and limited capacity.\n\nMichigan\n\nDeWitt Township:Hundreds of toys were distributed Tuesday in honor of a Lansing-area police officer who died of COVID-19. The toys were donated to DeWitt Township by the First Responders Children’s Foundation, the Lansing State Journal reported. Sgt. Bill Darnell died in November at a time when COVID-19 was having a major impact on the community of 15,000 people, north of Lansing. The DeWitt Township police department had to close for a week and get help from other police agencies because of the virus. “We want to get these (toys) to kids and families who need them, who want them,” said Police Chief Mike Gute. “We just want to do a good thing in honor and memory of Bill.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials are encouraging high school students who lost their jobs because of the pandemic to apply for unemployment assistance, hoping to get the help to more people who might not be aware of a recent state Court of Appeals ruling that made them eligible. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and other state officials held a virtual roundtable with several youth activists on Monday to get high school workers across the state who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic to apply for an estimated $14 million to $28 million in unemployment insurance funds provided by the federal CARES Act, for which they are now eligible. “Those first few months were extremely challenging for my family and if I had been allowed benefits at the time, it would have taken an immense amount of stress off of my shoulders,” said Rahma Farah, a 17-year-old high school student from south Minneapolis and one of the teens who helped with the effort.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state surpassed its previous record for the highest number of coronavirus deaths reported in a day Tuesday with 79. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said the state is on track to surpass 1,000 deaths in the month. Close to 4,500 people with the coronavirus have died in Mississippi since the start of the pandemic, according to the state Department of Health. “We’re all going to suffer,” Dobbs said during a virtual briefing Tuesday. “I think more and more people are seeing the impact on our families from personal experience.” The 79 deaths were reported as of Monday night. Fifty-six of the people died at different times within the last 10 days and were identified as coronavirus-related fatalities later using death certificates, according to the Department of Health. Dobbs, the state’s top health official, said he could not share the names of the dead because of privacy laws. But he took a moment at the start Tuesday’s briefing to honor some of those 79 who died. He listed individuals by age, sex and race: A Black woman in her late 30s, an 84-year-old white man and a 52-year-old Black man among them. “These are people, but for COVID, would be with us for next Christmas,” Dobbs said. “These are people who didn’t have to die.”\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: CVS Health said it plans to administer about 100,000 coronavirus vaccinations next week at Missouri long-term care facilities as the vaccination roll-out expands beyond health care workers, the company said Monday. The pharmacy chain will vaccinate residents and staff at more than 40,000 long-term care facilities across the U.S. The first of those vaccinations have begun, but Missouri facilities will see their first vaccinations starting Monday, CVS Health spokesman Charlie Rice-Minoso said. CVS and its competitor, Walgreens, are facilitating the inoculations at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Walgreens didn’t immediately reply to a Monday email seeking further information about that company’s plan in Missouri.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov.-elect Greg Gianforte signaled he won’t continue a statewide mask mandate in place since July, though he said he plans to wear a mask himself and get vaccinated against COVID-19. If Gianforte, a Republican, reverses outgoing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock’s mask order, Montana will be just the second state after Mississippi to lift its mandate. Thirty-eight states now have statewide mandates. “I trust Montanans with their health and the health of their loved ones,” Gianforte said in a recent interview with KHN. “The state has a role in clearly communicating the risks of who is most vulnerable, what the potential consequences are, but then I do trust Montanans to make the right decisions for themselves and their family.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said masks help prevent transmission of COVID-19. At least one study has found that states with mask requirements have had slower COVID growth rates compared with those without mandates. “We’re going to encourage people to wear masks,” Gianforte said. “I’m personally going to lead by example, wearing a mask in the Capitol.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials said it’s important to remain vigilant about social distancing to limit the spread of the coronavirus, even though vaccines have started to be administered and the state’s virus numbers have improved recently. Douglas County Health Director Adi Pour said the arrival of vaccines this month offers hope, but it will be some time before enough people have been vaccinated to make a difference in the pandemic. “Until 60% to 70% of the community is vaccinated, you still need to wear the mask, you still need to have social distancing, you still need to take all of those precautions,” Pour said. Over the past several weeks, the virus numbers have been improving in Nebraska. The rate of people being infected with the virus went from the fifth-highest in the nation early this month to the 29th-highest rate on Monday. The state said the number of people hospitalized with the virus remained unchanged Monday at 582. That is significantly lower than the peak of 987 set on Nov. 20 although it is still more than 2.5 times higher than it was on Oct. 1.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada is open for visitors with precautions in place, tourism and coronavirus response leaders said Monday, despite a weekend where the state passed the 200,000 mark in known COVID-19 infections and totaled 73 new deaths. In Las Vegas, where New Year’s fireworks that typically draw 300,000 people to the resort-lined Strip have been canceled, casinos are “open within the limits of the capacity determined by the governor,” Nevada tourism promotions chief Brenda Scolari said in a media call with state COVID-19 response leaders. Gov. Steve Sisolak in November tightened occupancy limits for restaurants, bars, casino floors and gyms, and set capacity at 25% for many businesses in a bid to stop a surge of coronavirus cases that are driving up hospitalizations. “We are very much promoting that properties in Las Vegas are acting with safety of visitors in mind and have every measure in place that’s necessary to make New Year’s Eve safe and memorable,” Scolari said. But a handful of Las Vegas Strip resorts have announced midweek closures because of a lack of demand. The Mirage said that starting in January, it will only be open from noon on Thursdays through noon on Mondays. Although some casino-resorts have only announced weekday closures for hotel reservations, the Mirage plans weekday closures of all of its operations, including its casino floor, restaurants and volcano show out front that erupts four times a night.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: New Hampshire’s largest art museum has closed until at least mid-January because of the coronavirus pandemic. Officials at the Currier Museum of Art said they will reopen the museum when COVID-19 infection rates start to decrease, and noted that many museums across New England have taken similar steps. “Our region has recently experienced an alarming spike in cases and the Currier Museum is doing all it can to contain the spread of COVID-19 and avoid burdening local health resources,” officials said. In the meantime, the museum will expand its online programs, including the family-friendly “Noon Year’s Eve” event.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton:The Murphy administration defended itself Monday and seemed to shift some blame to the federal government after missing a deadline to start vaccinating staff and residents of nursing homes this week against COVID-19. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy dismissed a top Republican's call for Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli to resign over the delay, saying \"the last thing we need is people who don't know what they're talking about from the cheap seats.\" Murphy did not say where the responsibility lies for the Department of Health's failure to submit the required paperwork to the federal government in time to begin vaccinating staff and residents in the locations hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, he urged patience and understanding as his administration rolls out a vaccine that was developed in record time and on a massive scale. \"This is not an easy, straight-line process,\" Murphy said. \"It is one of the most ambitious federal government initiatives ever undertaken, and folks have to understand that.\" The Department of Health missed by a day a federal deadline that would have allowed the pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens to begin vaccinating in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities Monday. In order to start vaccinating, the agency needed to submit information on more than 650 long-term care facilities throughout the state by Dec. 7. Now the vaccines should start being distributed Dec. 28.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Health officials said Tuesday they are hoping to boost the number of people getting tested for COVID-19 through a new program that will provide free, at-home test kits to anyone who requests one. Through a partnership with Vault Medical Services, the saliva tests can be ordered online. All that’s needed is an internet connection, an email address and photo identification. State officials acknowledged the lack of broadband access across New Mexico and said the new at-home option expands what they described as one of the most wide-reaching testing programs in the nation. The state Health Department has been operating in-person testing locations in every county since early in the pandemic, including in spots that have connectivity issues. The state is now averaging more than 14,000 tests a day and that’s expected to grow with the new program. In all, more than 1.8 million tests have been done since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The city’s public school system will conduct special social, emotional and academic behavioral screenings next year for students in 27 neighborhood hard hit by the coronavirus, officials said. Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza said the screenings, beginning in September, will allow educators to get a jump-start on treating mental health issues related to the virus or the disruption of schooling that might linger into adulthood. The city is hiring 150 additional social workers for the effort and will expand a partnership between schools and the city’s public hospital system. Carranza said he would like to bring such services to all city schools, but can’t afford it without outside funding. Mayor Bill de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, heads up the city’s mental health initiatives. She described the new screenings as an important extension of a child’s annual pediatric exam.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper signed an executive order Monday making it easier for businesses to sell alcohol without customers having to show up in person for their purchase. The order, in effect through the end of January, lets restaurants, hotels, clubs, bars and some distilleries holding certain permits from the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission to sell alcoholic products for delivery or curbside pickup. The move is intended to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. “This order will help people avoid settings that can contribute to increased viral spread while giving restaurants and bars a financial boost that they need right now,” Cooper said in a statement. “With cases and hospitalizations high around the country, let’s all do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19 while supporting local, small businesses safely.” The 10-member Council of State approved Cooper’s action. Members include the Democratic governor and several other statewide elected officials.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum signed an amended executive order that paved the way for bars and restaurants in North Dakota to return to regular hours of operation on Tuesday, as the active number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have declined in the state. The food service establishments had been closed to in-person service between 10 a.m. and 4 a.m. since Nov. 16. The order Burgum signed Monday allows them to return to normal hours, consistent with any local requirements. But to keep the virus in check, the bars and restaurants must follow other state and local rules, including limiting capacity to 50% and allowing no more than 150 people inside until Jan. 8. Social distancing, mask wearing and other precautions also remain in place. A state order requiring masks to be worn in indoor businesses, indoor public settings and outdoor public settings where physical distancing isn’t possible remains in effect until Jan. 18. Banquet, ballroom and event venues also remain limited to 25% percent of maximum occupancy until Jan. 8.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:From TV commercials to a new mailing of masks to seniors, spending on a state public awareness campaign to persuade residents to play it safe in dealing with the coronavirus now totals more than $24 million. The state aging and health departments in recent days began a $13.5 million program to mail masks and COVID-19 precaution information to more than 2 million Ohioans age 65 and older. Including a new spot last week featuring four of the front-line nurses tending to virus patients, the Ohio Department of Health had spent $8.3 million with federal aid to produce and air an ongoing series of TV commercials counseling COVID caution.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: CVS Health said it plans to begin administering vaccines to more than 27,000 patients at 176 skilled nursing and assisted living facilities across Oklahoma. Those workers are in the first phase of the state’s vaccine distribution plan. More than one-third of the COVID-19 deaths in Oklahoma, or about 685 people, have been residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities, according to the most recent data from the State Department of Health. Oklahoma health officials reported 2,596 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Monday and six additional deaths, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 263,434 and the statewide death toll to 2,218.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:As protesters and police clashed outside, lawmakers met in a special session Monday to pass measures to deal with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s the third time lawmakers have met for an emergency session in what has been an extraordinary year, marked by the pandemic, widespread protests and blistering wildfires. Lawmakers extended a statewide ban on evicting renters until the end of June, narrowly managing to stave off a major crisis for thousands of Oregon renters. Between 27,700 and 56,100 Oregon households risk getting evicted on Jan. 1, the day after the current moratorium ends, according to a legislative analysis that cited data from the National Council of State Housing Agencies. “Now more than ever, preventing evictions is an investment in the well-being of every Oregonian,” said Rep. Julie Fahey, D-Eugene, who carried the bill on the floor. Rep. Mark Meek, D-Clackamas County, said that although he supported extending the state’s moratorium on evictions, he didn’t support the bill, which he said doesn’t provide “meaningful relief to housing providers” through a fund set up to compensate landlords.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf on Tuesday delivered a mixed review of Congress’ newly passed pandemic relief package, as Philadelphia extended its coronavirus restrictions affecting indoor dining, in-person instruction at colleges and other activities. Wolf, a Democrat, said the $900 billion in federal aid package will provide vital support for people, small businesses and efforts to fight the virus. But, he said, it lacked direct aid to state and local governments trying to prop up crucial services, and more aid is needed for a hard-hit service industry – such as restaurants and bars – and in direct payments to individuals and families. The bill would establish a temporary $300-per-week supplemental jobless benefit and a $600 direct payment to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, plus money for schools, health care providers and renters facing eviction. In Philadelphia, city officials extended restrictions on indoor dining, indoor events, theaters, casinos, colleges and indoor organized sports for two more weeks, through Jan. 15. Museums, outdoor sports, gyms, in-person instruction in high schools and outdoor catered events can resume Jan. 4, with capacity limitations, unless state restrictions set to expire that day are extended by Wolf, city officials said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Providence Public Schools and its food vendor are making sure the city’s children don’t go hungry over the holidays amid the pandemic. The schools and Sodexo on Tuesday as part of the grab-and-go program are offering students 13 days’ worth of meals, enough to cover the holiday break, at its eight meal sites across the city. The grab-and-go meal sites will not be active during the break. The Home for the Holiday meal pack includes a turkey or pork roast, potatoes, mandarin oranges, macaroni and cheese, cereal, milk, juice and other items. Parents and guardians may pick up a student’s meal pack, provided they have the student’s school ID number.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s health board selected a retired military doctor to head the state’s health and environmental department, which has been overseeing South Carolina’s coronavirus response. The Department of Health and Environmental Control board unanimously voted Tuesday to hire Dr. Edward Simmer, who previously oversaw civilian medical and dental care for the Defense Health Agency in Virginia and served three decades in the Navy. The board-certified psychiatrist also holds a master’s degree in public health.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Monument Health, the largest hospital system in the western part of South Dakota, began administering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to hospital workers and staff at long-term care facilities in several locations. Meanwhile, the largest hospital systems in the eastern part of the state planned to distribute the vaccine in the coming days. The state’s distribution plan calls for medical workers in hospitals and long-term care facilities to receive the vaccine first, followed by residents of long-term care facilities. The Department of Health reported that 7,844 people have received the first dose of the vaccine manufactured by Pfizer and expects to receive enough doses of the Moderna vaccine for 14,600 people.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Democratic U.S. Rep. London Lamar said Tennessee is “setting a world example of how to kill people during a pandemic” by not requiring masks and other measures. Dr. Jason Martin of a physician’s group said Gov. Bill Lee has “betrayed your oath and abandoned the people you were elected to serve,” and has rebutted Lee’s contention that there’s argument and dissention about “what’s the right tactic” among health professionals. The president of the Tennessee Medical Association, Dr. Kevin Smith, said his group hasn’t heard from any of its 9,000-plus physician members who oppose mask requirements now. The association is calling for mask mandates in counties that top 10 new cases per 100,000 people a day – currently, the whole state, since the best county was eight times worse in the last week, Smith said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday joined the ranks of governors receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in hopes of assuring the public that the inoculations are safe. Abbott, a Republican, said after getting the vaccine at a hospital in the state capital that federal health officials have urged governors to set an example. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey also received the first dose this week, and other governors have said they will wait. A resurgence of the virus in Texas has put the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients back over 10,000 for only the second time during the pandemic. Nearly 11,000 people were hospitalized in July during a deadly summer outbreak. Abbott has said he won’t impose new lockdown measures as cases climb.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Thirty-seven of the 128 deaths of southwestern Utah residents attributed to COVID-19 have come since Dec. 1, making it the deadliest month since the pandemic began, according to new state figures released Monday. Two more deaths were added to the count Monday, including a Washington County man between the ages of 45 and 64 and another between the ages of 65 and 84. The numbers have accelerated in recent weeks. There were a total of 57 deaths by the end of October, and then 35 in November before the increase in December. In addition, another 40 people were hospitalized with the disease as of Monday, according to the Southwest Utah Public Health Department.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott said he is relaxing restrictions on gatherings over the holidays to allow two trusted households to gather as Vermont’s coronavirus case numbers have stabilized, although they are still higher than the administration would like to see. “It’s been a little over a month since we took significant steps to slow the rising spread of the virus. And it’s clearly working,” Scott said. The state has seen several days of fewer than 100 cases, which is still high but shows vast improvement, he said. Gathering with only one trusted household will be allowed from Wednesday to Jan. 2, with other stringent measures still in place, Scott said. Gathering with more than one trusted household on different days is not permitted, he said. And if one of the two households is from out of state, everyone must quarantine for seven days and get a negative test or quarantine for 14 days afterward, he said. Scott also announced that residents can participate in outdoor recreation with others outside of their households provided that they can physically distance and wear a mask. Starting Friday, school-based and youth recreational sports teams may begin practices with skills, strength and conditioning drills with no contact and physically distancing and mask-wearing at all times.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials announced a temporary policy change Tuesday that will provide about $200 million in payroll tax relief next year to Virginia businesses that laid off workers amid the pandemic. Under an executive order from Gov. Ralph Northam, the Virginia Employment Commission won’t be counting layoffs that took place in April, May or June against businesses when calculating unemployment insurance tax rates for 2021, Northam’s office announced. Without the change to what’s called the experience tax, about 10,000 more businesses than last year would have had to pay the full amount of about $600 per year per employee, according to Megan Healy, Northam’s chief workforce development advisor. She said the tax relief will be offset by about $210 million in federal stimulus money that lawmakers directed to the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund during the special session. Nicole Riley, Virginia state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, said Northam’s decision would relieve some of the financial pressure on employers and ultimately make it easier for them to put people back to work.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee has announced new travel restrictions for people arriving from the United Kingdom and South Africa where a new and seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus is circulating. Inslee said Monday he would issue a proclamation requiring passengers who arrive from the United Kingdom and South Africa to quarantine for 14 days, including passengers who have arrived from those countries in the past few days. It also encourages those people to get tested for the virus. “Today’s action is a commonsense public health measure and … is another attempt to keep Washingtonians safe,” Inslee said. The quarantine measures are precautionary and meant to stem a possible surge in cases that could overwhelm hospitals, he said. The quarantine is mandatory and although it’s legally enforceable, Inslee said no one will be taken into custody over it. Dozens of countries have restricted travel from Britain in recent days because of the new strain. Inslee said he wasn’t aware of other states issuing restrictions. British Airways canceled the only nonstop flight from London to Seattle on Monday, according to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport spokesperson Perry Cooper, but he said the reason behind it wasn’t immediately known.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state reported a single-day record of 42 deaths linked to the coronavirus on Tuesday, with victims ranging in age from 48 to 100. The state reported 787 confirmed coronavirus cases, down from a high of 1,257 last week. There are 22,864 active cases in the state. West Virginia has received nearly 21,100 doses of a coronavirus vaccine so far, administering more than 15,900. Gov. Jim Justice said Monday a combined 44,300 doses of vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech will arrive this week. Officials expect to administer doses at all nursing homes and long-term care centers by the end of the month.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin System paid out nearly $70 million in coronavirus-related refunds to students in the last year, according to a report released Tuesday. The Legislative Audit Bureau released findings that show the system paid out $68.5 million in housing and food service refunds to students after campuses closed in March as the pandemic was taking hold in Wisconsin. The report didn’t say how much the system might have saved by closing down dorms and food services. State Auditor Joe Chrisman didn’t respond to a message seeking further information. Auditors also found that the Board of Regents approved reductions in other student fees at four two-year schools and at UW-Milwaukee heading into the fall semester to reflect a lack of athletics and performing arts programming. Student fees support both areas. The fee reductions ranged from $36 per student at UW-Milwaukee’s Waukesha branch to $187 per student at UW-Milwaukee. The report went on to say that the system received $94.2 million in federal pandemic relief funds. Half of that money had to go for financial aid for students for pandemic-related expenses; the rest had to be used to cover changes in instruction delivery or student aid.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The 70 new confirmed COVID-19 cases recorded in Campbell County on Monday afternoon pushed its total to 3,646 since the pandemic began, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. Campbell County Memorial Hospital continues to feel the strain of its resources as its COVID-19 hospitalizations remain high, despite a noticeable decrease at other hospitals throughout the state, the Gillette News Record reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/10/lobster-costs-roll-higher-beach-rentals-sell-skiing-ramps-news-around-states/116926698/", "title": "Lobster costs roll higher, beach rentals sell out: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Police Chief Ernest Finley has resigned after more than six years, with the mayor saying change was needed. The departure of Finley, who came to the capital city after nearly three decades with the Atlanta Police Department, was announced by Mayor Steven Reed on Tuesday. Montgomery has fared better than other cities its size as rates of violent crime rise nationwide, Reed said, and it didn’t suffer damage during civil unrest last year following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Still, he said, “the situation and circumstances” have changed since Finley began in 2015. “I feel it is in the best interest of the men and women of the Montgomery Police Department, as well as the residents of Montgomery, to make a change in leadership,” Reed said in a statement. Finley, who was hired before Reed took office in the city of about 200,000, has not commented publicly on his departure.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy has signed legislation aimed at protecting the graves of Unangax people sent to internment camps in southeast Alaska during World War II. “We want their descendants to know it’s not been forgotten,” Dunleavy said at Tuesday’s bill signing. The measure expands the boundaries of Funter Bay State Marine Park to include the Admiralty Island cemetery site and directs that management of the area include protection of the cemetery. The cemetery holds the graves of people who died at Funter Bay during World War II. The U.S. government forced people from their homes in the Aleutian Islands more than 1,000 miles away to internment camps after Japanese troops invaded. According to the National Park Service, many of those taken from their homes were only allowed a suitcase to bring with them. Conditions at the relocation sites were poor, and medical care was “often nonexistent,” according to the agency, which has said 32 people died at the Funter Bay camp. Martin Stepetin Sr., whose grandparents were among those relocated, pushed for protections for the cemetery site, the Juneau Empire reports. He said it felt like a weight had been lifted off him with the bill becoming law.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Citing “significant” concerns, state health officials have barred Phoenix-based Embry Health from ordering more COVID-19 vaccine doses. Among the state’s concerns is the possibility that Embry Health may have administered as many as 370 expired doses, Arizona Department of Health Services spokesperson Steve Elliott confirmed Monday in an email – a contention officials with Embry Health dispute. The provider never administered any expired doses, “not accidentally, and certainly not purposefully,” Embry Health consultant and spokesperson Kevin DeMenna said Tuesday afternoon, adding that patient safety at Embry Health has not been affected. “We needed to do a better job of inputting the data,” DeMenna said. Embry Health has been active throughout the pandemic doing both coronavirus testing and vaccinations, though for now, it “has largely just stopped vaccinating,” he said. Expired doses are not the only problem the state raised with Embry Health. Another is the people the company has used to administer COVID-19 vaccines – state health officials say Embry is using staff who are “not permitted by state or federal regulation to administer vaccine,” such as phlebotomists rather than physicians or nurses.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state no longer requires students exposed to the coronavirus to quarantine so long as they’re fully vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced Tuesday. The Republican governor said the new quarantine policy aligns with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or their only shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. About 40% of Arkansas’ population has received at least one dose of a vaccine, and nearly 32% are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Hutchinson announced the change as the state saw a jump in its coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. The state reported 231 new cases, bringing its total since the pandemic began to 342,726. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations increased by 29 to 204. Arkansas’ COVID-19 deaths rose by three to 5,852 since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The sheriff of Los Angeles County dispatched deputies Tuesday to Venice Beach to assess the homelessness problem, a day after he called out city officials for failing to adequately address the growing number of people sleeping outdoors along the famous strand. Venice is the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Police Department, not the sheriff’s department. But Sheriff Alex Villanueva said he was moved to act because of “the failures of local politicians in regard to the homelessness crisis.” He tweeted Monday that he was sending his department’s Homeless Outreach Services Team to the beach, where encampments have proliferated along the popular boardwalk and in surrounding neighborhoods. The sheriff said the goal was to clear the area of homeless encampments by July 4. “What we saw was human misery,” Lt. Geff Deedrick, head of the sheriff’s team, told KNBC-TV. Villaneuva told CBS 2 News that he was not trying to start a turf battle but simply trying to help. City Councilman Mike Bonin, who represents the district that includes the area, accused Villanueva of making political hay out of a serious problem. “He didn’t call to offer services or housing, which would help,” Bonin said in a tweet Tuesday. “He went on a PR blitz, promising his own notorious brand of justice.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Ski areas experienced a strong rebound this winter despite public health restrictions put in place amid the coronavirus pandemic. Skier visits to U.S. resorts totaled 59 million for the season, the fifth-best on record, according to the Colorado-based National Ski Areas Association. “What a year it has been,” said Kelly Pawlak, association president and CEO. “From utter uncertainty to a top-10 season in terms of participation, it shows the wide spectrum that our industry bridged this year.” Resorts across the country were forced to close in spring 2020, and many mountain communities were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 early in the pandemic. The U.S. ski industry lost at least $2 billion that winter, and skier visits fell 14% compared with the 2018-19 season. But about seven months later, chairlifts started turning again, and guests embraced a new normal while skiing and snowboarding. They wore masks, rode lifts only with their groups and stood 6 feet apart in lines, or about the length of a typical ski. There was no dine-in service and no large gatherings for apres-ski drinks. Katherine Fuller, a spokeswoman for Colorado’s Arapahoe Basin ski area, said the most recent season was “definitely a hard one for all of us ... but people wanted to ski and ride, and it felt kind of at times like one of the few things you could do because it was all outside.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: With the state House poised to take up a long-awaited bill that would legalize recreational marijuana for adults, the chamber’s Republican leader on Tuesday called for an investigation into how language was tucked into the legislation that could have intentionally benefited at least one individual. House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said the closed-door process that led to the massive, nearly 300-page bill is “tainted,” and the House should not proceed with a vote during the remaining hours of the regular General Assembly session, which was set to adjourn at midnight Wednesday. The bill narrowly passed the Senate early Tuesday after the contentious provision was stripped. “It is so tarnished that the House of Representatives should not be taking up this bill,” Candelora said. “And frankly, there should be an investigation in the governor’s office and in the Democrats offices on how this provision came to be.” Candelora predicted if the Democrats who control the General Assembly decide to bring out the cannabis bill, the debate could last 12 hours, eating up valuable time on the final day of the regular legislative session.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Many rental agencies in beach areas are almost completely booked – if not sold out – for the summer. “More units are booked for the duration of the summer than, I think, ever before,” said Grace Masten, broker owner of Sea Grace at North Beach, Realtors. With high demand sweeping the coast and a summer energized by eager vacationers and increased vaccination rates, renters looking to score a last-minute stay might expect to pay more or settle for a place farther from the beach this year. Stuck at home last year and possibly bummed out by canceled summer plans, many people booked their summer 2021 vacations earlier than usual. Typically, rental agencies will see bookings come in over the December holidays, Masten said, but rentals were starting to fill up as early as September, October and November, when much of the country remained closed. “I think if people thought back in September, October that they’d be flying to other resort areas, maybe that would be a little different,” Masten said. “But not really knowing what the future was holding at that point, I think they just made the reservations thinking, ‘You know what, let’s stay close to home.’ ” Other renters have taken advantage of flexible work-from-home schedules to take longer vacations or move their home office to a beach rental.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Fewer people are riding Metro than before the pandemic, even as many restrictions are being lifted, but the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s board is considering new ways to boost the transit system’s recovery, WUSA-TV reports. Potential solutions include more frequent all-day service, decreasing wait times to 12 minutes or less on six rail lines and 20 bus lines, and extending rail service to midnight seven days a week this summer, and lowering ticket prices. According to the Washington Post, officials are considering $2 flat rates during weekends and reducing prices for low-income riders. Early in the pandemic, Metro was forced to close stations and reduce hours as ridership on public transit plummeted. The new concepts are meant to address ridership and equity. The board is expected to vote on the ideas Thursday.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: The state reversed itself Wednesday and said a downtown bridge can be decorated in rainbow lights to celebrate gay rights, one day after it had ordered them doused. Taryn Fenske, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis, said she didn’t know why the Florida Department of Transportation had ordered the state-owned Acosta Bridge returned to its normal blue lighting Tuesday night, but the rainbow colors would be back Wednesday night. The Jacksonville Transportation Authority had planned to use rainbow lighting on the Acosta throughout the week in honor of Pride Month, which commemorates the struggle for gay rights. The state has allowed numerous celebratory lighting displays on the bridge to honor patriotic holidays, celebrate the Jacksonville Jaguars football team and raise disease awareness. It had been the second time this month the state rejected a rainbow lighting display for a bridge. “The bottom line is, (the rainbow) lights will be back” on the Acosta, Fenske said. The state transportation department said Tuesday that its original decision to shut off the rainbow lights was not motivated by anti-gay animus but regulations violated by the display. It said the Jacksonville authority’s permit for lighting the Acosta requires it to maintain a certain color scheme unless it receives state permission for a temporary change.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Black church leaders in the state vowed Tuesday to keep up their fight for federal voting rights legislation, with one pastor urging President Joe Biden to use his bully pulpit and strike deals with lawmakers to get the bills passed. “We need you to utilize every ounce of influence that you have,” Pastor Lee May, head of the Transforming Faith Church in Decatur, said in a plea to Biden at a rally outside the state Capitol in Atlanta. “We need you to not just say what you’re for but to do something about it.” Martin Luther King Jr.’s daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, said the “crown” of her father’s work – the 1965 Voting Rights Act – was under attack. Republican lawmakers in Georgia and other states have approved a slew of new restrictions on voting that experts have blasted as the greatest assault on voting rights in a generation. But a bill in Congress that Democrats view as an antidote to those state measures appears doomed in the narrowly divided Senate. Democrat Joe Manchin over the weekend expressed opposition to it and any effort to end the 60-vote requirement to break a filibuster in the chamber. “I call upon my brothers and sisters of the U.S. Senate to not allow filibuster to become your stumbling block to do what is just and what is right,” King said.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A Maui resident has launched the only Hawaii-based, locally owned ride-share company in the state, officials say. Holoholo CEO Cecil Morton, who’s been in the transportation business for 20 years as owner of SpeediShuttle, told The Maui News his daughter came up with the name, which means “let’s go cruising.” “I just fell in love with the name,” Morton said. “And because we’re all about the community as well as welcoming visitors, I want them to love to use a local brand and support the community in that fashion because there is, of course, a movement these days to support local.” Holoholo – operating on Maui, Lanai, Oahu, Hawaii Island and Kauai – includes a community of drivers and vehicles that riders can request from their smartphones, viewing costs upfront and paying online. Transportation options are in high demand on the islands because of an increase in tourism at a time when many rental car companies have limited availability as a result of shipping their vehicles off the island during the coronavirus pandemic, The Maui News reports. There is already a growing demand for Holoholo from riders and drivers. “Maui requires a good roster of drivers, a big roster, in order to supply the demands, which pre-pandemic there were 200,000 visitors a month,” Morton said.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: State health officials say the number of newly confirmed coronavirus cases continues to drop, and the vast majority of the infections are occurring in unvaccinated people. Idaho has reported fewer than 200 new cases most days this month, the Post Register reports. In January, the state’s daily average of new cases was closer to 700 daily. “More than 90% of all cases have no record of being vaccinated that we know of,” one of Idaho’s top public health researchers, Dr. Kathryn Turner, said during an Idaho Department of Health and Welfare news conference Tuesday. The rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has also dropped, declining 83% between January and May, said the state’s public health administrator, Elke Shaw-Tulloch. The drop in hospitalizations was particularly noteworthy for people ages 65 and up, who have the highest vaccination rate of all age groups in the state. But Idaho’s vaccination rates continue lagging behind national rates. Just 49% of all Idaho adults have been vaccinated, compared to more than 63% of adults nationally. Vaccinating 70% of all Idaho adults is probably the best-case scenario, state-paid pollsters recently concluded. It may take until late fall to reach that goal, Shaw-Tulloch said. “But it just depends on people’s personal actions,” Shaw-Tulloch said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum will mark Juneteenth – the holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States – by displaying a rare signed copy of the Emancipation Proclamation. The copy of the proclamation that’s signed by Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward will be displayed between June 15 and July 6. The original document is kept in the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Juneteenth – also known as Emancipation Day and Freedom Day – falls on June 19. On that day in 1865, more than two years after Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War, enslaved Blacks in Galveston, Texas, were freed with the arrival of federal troops. Though slavery was not considered fully abolished until the 13th Amendment six months later, Juneteenth has come to symbolize the end of slavery. In May, Illinois became one of several states to make it a state holiday. When the proclamation is displayed in the Treasures Gallery, windows along one side of the museum will feature a display about the history of Black Americans and their fight for full citizenship. The display includes a timeline running from 1787 to 2021, covering slavery in Illinois, a supposedly free state, a riot that targeted Blacks in Springfield, and the first Juneteenth celebration in the city.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A complaint filed with the Department of Homeland Security Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties claims immigrants’ lives are at risk in custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a county jail due to the lack of precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The National Immigrant Justice Center filed the complaint May 28 on behalf of two immigrant women in ICE custody at Clay County Jail in Brazil, Indiana. The complaint seeks an investigation into COVID-19 conditions at the jail. It alleges that immigrants who are tested for the coronavirus are not given their test results; that if they test positive, they are not given medication for pain; and that detainees are not given face masks or hand soap. Guards often don’t wear masks, and there are few to no social distancing measures in place, the complaint also alleges. “ICE continues to put their lives – and those of others detained at the jail – at risk by detaining people in the close quarters where social distancing is largely impossible,” the complaint says, “and withholding information regarding how those in custody can obtain COVID-19 testing.” In a statement, ICE public affairs officer Alethea Smock said testing complies with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State traffic enforcement officials vowed Tuesday to crack down on motorists speeding, driving while drunk or distracted by cellphones in an effort to slow the rising traffic fatality rate. Iowa State Patrol Col. Nathan Fulk said officers have recently reported some of the most dangerous driving behaviors in the 85-year history of the patrol. He said excessive speed and impaired driving skyrocketed last year, pushing traffic fatalities higher than the previous year even as the pandemic reduced traffic volume by 12%. State officials reported nearly 1,500 citations written last year for speeds of 100 mph or more. The 119 fatalities so far this year are ahead of last year’s pace, and officials note traffic deaths often rise in the summer. In response, law enforcement will increase the presence of officers on roads through Saturday, looking for seatbelt violations, impaired driving, excessive speed and distracted driving. A task force of state and local law enforcement and transportation officials has been studying factors behind the increasing traffic fatalities. The group has recommended stepped-up enforcement, education for drivers to reinforce safe driving habits, and a study of road safety issues that could cause problems. The goal is to get traffic fatalities below 300 this year, something that hasn’t occurred in Iowa since 1925.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Hiring enough lifeguards to staff the city’s six public swimming pools has proved impossible in a pandemic year. “Usually I’m about 80% staffed by February,” said Brian Hill, Wichita’s aquatics director. “This year, I was about 10% staffed.” Lifeguarding took a hit last summer, with most gyms, water parks and community pools closed. Students who would normally work as guards took the summer off or found other jobs. Training classes were canceled. So were junior lifeguard programs for 11- to 14-year-olds. “That’s our pipeline,” Hill said. “In a lot of ways, we were kind of starting this summer from scratch.” In Johnson County, Roeland Park’s pool is open for limited hours because there aren’t enough guards. Prairie Village cut back its pool hours this summer amid the shortage. So will the city of Shawnee in Johnson County. “So much of it is kids growing up going to the pool every day,” said Joe Hutchinson, a high school swim coach who manages a private pool in east Wichita. “They see their older friends who are lifeguards, and they say, ‘I want to do that next summer,’ and then they start getting ready for that job and getting certified. Since there wasn’t the opportunity to see your friends be lifeguards last summer that new wave of lifeguards that normally fills in those empty spots just isn’t there.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Louisville Metro Police have cut the number of detectives assigned to investigate domestic violence cases – even as case numbers have climbed during the pandemic. Officials say officer shortages and rampant gun violence are to blame. The department “recently” implemented changes, it confirmed, including moving three sworn officers from the unit to assist patrol officers; looking to hire three retired investigators as civilians to work domestic violence cases; and hiring four more Victim Services Unit specialists to focus on domestic violence cases. Critics say the changes create a “real risk of victims falling through the cracks.” The numbers show that domestic violence is only getting worse in the city. As of June 2, LMPD records show the department has handled 1,853 fourth-degree assault offenses this year, a charge that stems from domestic violence incidents. That’s a 12.4% increase from the same time frame last year. Advocates and prosecutors have called on police Chief Erika Shields to reconsider the move, describing it as “counterintuitive” and potentially putting victims at greater risk. Jefferson County Attorney Mike O’Connell said in a May 26 letter he was “saddened” and warned reorganizing the domestic violence team at LMPD could hinder his staff’s ability to bring cases to court.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Lawmakers gave final passage Tuesday to a proposal requiring doctors to suggest to women taking the abortion pill that the drug-induced effort to terminate a pregnancy could be stopped midway through the process, a scientifically questionable claim. With a 69-25 vote, the state House agreed to a heavy Senate rewrite of the proposal and sent it to the governor’s desk. Passage came over objections from opponents who said the legislation pushed by anti-abortion organizations could provide inaccurate, possibly dangerous information to women. The bill by Rep. Beryl Amedee, R-Houma, is the latest in a long string of anti-abortion measures passed by Louisiana lawmakers seeking to lessen access to the procedure and to try to discourage women from seeking it. The nonsurgical medication abortion, which works during the first nine weeks of pregnancy, involves swallowing mifepristone, which causes an embryo to detach from the uterine wall. A second pill, misoprostol, is used two days later to cause contractions and push the embryo out of the uterus. Amedee’s legislation would require a doctor dispensing the two pills to provide a statement to the woman seeking the drug-induced abortion that says there may be “options available to assist you in continuing your pregnancy.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Summer weather has arrived, and New England tourists are hungry for a lobster roll or a whole cooked lobster – but they’re going to have to pay up. Lobster is more expensive than usual this season due to a limited supply, high demand and the reopening of the economy as the nation begins to move past the coronavirus pandemic. Consumers are headed back to seafood restaurants and markets for the first time in months, and the lobsters there to greet them are at a premium. Some Maine stores charged $17 or $18 per pound for live lobster in May – about twice the price from a year prior. Prices are lingering in the $13 or $14 range this month. Lobster is usually expensive in late spring, but this season has seen prices that are higher than typical. The wholesale price for live, 1.25-pound lobsters in the New England market was $9.01 per pound May 1, business publisher Urner Barry reported. That was about $2.70 per pound more than the previous May 1 and the highest price for that date in at least five years, the company reported. The high lobster prices are an indicator that customers are looking to get back out to restaurants and that high-end seafood is in high demand, said John Sackton, an industry analyst and founder of SeafoodNews.com.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: A June tradition of graduating high schoolers from across the region flocking to the beach was limited by the pandemic in 2020, but this year, businesses are open, and the community is braced for the huge influx of teenagers getting their first taste of freedom from adult supervision. The celebration in Ocean City, one of the prime destinations for recent grads from the Mid-Atlantic, is a double-edged sword for the city. On the one hand, so-called Senior Week – more like a month – marks the beginning of the tourist season, upon which the city relies for its economic survival. On the other, it is an invasion of thousands of 18-year-old kids hyped up on hormones and hubris that comes with believing in youthful invincibility. Last year’s Senior Week had attracted much smaller crowds than usual, with the COVID-19 pandemic still ramping up and restrictions on businesses in place. This year, seating limits in bars and restaurants have been lifted, along with mask orders for those outside. Inside, those who have been vaccinated may go maskless, according to a directive issued recently by the governor’s office. “We are expecting a big crowd because of pent-up demand,” said Steve Pastusak, chair of the city’s tourism advisory board. “They’re going to be coming out in full force, doing things they couldn’t do last year.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Cape Cod Foundation is holding a virtual forum next week to address the lingering mental health needs of area residents even as the COVID-19 pandemic ebbs. “Mental and Behavioral Health Across Cape Cod” is scheduled for June 17. “For many, social isolation, feelings of uncertainty, emotional and physical loss, and the inability to access care have increased over the past year due to the pandemic,” Kristin O’Malley, president and CEO of the Cape Cod Foundation, said in a release. “In addition, unemployment, loss of housing, and food insecurity have added to the psychological burden of residents across every age and demographic, especially our most vulnerable populations.” Sign-ups are at the foundation’s website.\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Huron: A popular firework show could return a year after it was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. A notice to proceed with the show has been authorized as part of the Blue Water Festival, according to city manager James Freed. The total cost for Port Huron’s firework show is about $8,600. A $5,000 grant from the DTE Foundation for Blue Water Festival 2020 will be used. The city is looking to raise funds to pay the remaining costs. The festival is expected to be held in July. “I think after such a rough and tough year our residents, families and kids deserve to see a terrific fireworks’ show over our beautiful, vibrant and resilient city,” Freed said Wednesday in a release. “Fireworks shows were one of my fondest memories as a kid. We want this generation of kids to have those same memories.” Port Huron had prepaid half of the cost of last year’s firework show before it was canceled.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: City crews returned early Tuesday to an intersection where a memorial to George Floyd was assembled after his death last year and worked to reopen it to traffic by removing debris and makeshift barriers, only to have activists barricade the area again. Workers using front-end loaders and brooms arrived just before 5 a.m. and cleared the intersection where Floyd was killed, informally known as George Floyd Square, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. The intersection has been closed to traffic since Floyd’s death May 25, 2020, and some residents and businesses have expressed frustration that it has been closed for so long. Last Thursday, city crews removed concrete barriers that blocked traffic at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, but community activists quickly put up makeshift barriers and resumed chanting the name of the Black man whose killing galvanized the racial justice movement. As soon as workers left the area Tuesday, activists moved back in. Mayor Jacob Frey and other city leaders pledged to reopen the intersection, but activist leaders have said they won’t step aside unless the city meets their 24 demands. Among them: recall the county prosecutor, fire the head of the state’s criminal investigative agency, and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on programs to create jobs, combat racism and support affordable housing.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: Actor Morgan Freeman and a criminal justice professor at the University of Mississippi are donating $1 million to the university to establish a Center for Evidence-Based Policing and Reform, the university announced Tuesday. The center created with the donation from Freeman and professor Linda Keena will be the only one of its kind in Mississippi and one of only a few in the nation, the university said in its news release. The university’s Department of Criminal Justice and Legal Studies said the center eventually will train police from Mississippi and around the country. It will include training on how police can better engage the community in crime prevention. “Look at the past year in our country – that sums it up,” Freeman said in the news release. “It’s time we are equipping police officers with training and ensuring ‘law enforcement’ is not defined only as a gun and a stick. Policing should be about that phrase ‘To Serve’ found on most law enforcement vehicles.” University leaders plan to build relationships and share data with policing agencies, according to the release. And they plan to use the data to enhance the preparation of students in criminal justice.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A federal appeals court panel on Wednesday blocked the state from enforcing a sweeping abortion law that bans the procedure at or after eight weeks of pregnancy. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis heard arguments in September in the legal battle over the 2019 law. The measure also would prohibit a woman from having an abortion because the fetus has Down syndrome. Yamelsie Rodríguez, president and CEO of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, called the ruling “a critical victory for Missourians.” “For now, we celebrate our continued ability to provide safe, legal abortion at the last remaining clinic in Missouri,” Rodriguez said in a statement. Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement that his son, Stephen, who has a rare genetic condition, autism and epilepsy, “has shown me the inherent beauty and dignity in all life, especially those with special needs. While we’re disappointed in the 8th Circuit’s decision, their decision does provide an avenue for this case to be heard by the Supreme Court, and we plan to seek review in the Supreme Court.” The lawsuit was filed by Reproductive Health Services, which operates the St. Louis abortion clinic, and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A man has been given a six-month suspended jail sentence for submitting a voter registration application under the name Miguel Raton, a rough Spanish translation of Mickey Mouse. Michael Winters of Gallatin County pleaded guilty Tuesday to falsifying information on voter registration application in early 2020, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. District Judge Peter Ohman also fined Winters $250 and ordered him to complete 100 hours of community service. “This was a serious offense, and, obviously, with all that’s going on with elections now and election integrity, this is something that is obviously front and center,” Ohman said Tuesday. But “really what happened here is it demonstrated that the system does work.” Someone who filed a complaint against Winters with the U.S. Election Assistance Commission in June 2020 told investigators Winters had talked about how easy it would be to commit voter fraud. Winters received ballots for two elections under the name of Miguel Raton. Elections officials say he did not vote in either of them. Winters told an FBI agent he pinned the ballots to the wall of his shop as “trophies.” The agent took the ballots.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: State regulators have fined Sprint $50,000 for overcharging all its cellphone customers in the city for several years. The Nebraska Public Service Commission said the overcharges to help pay for 911 emergency services affected more than 77,000 Sprint customers and added up to more than $296,000. Regulators said Sprint charged 50 cents per month for every active phone line when it was supposed to be charging 45 cents per month for the 911 surcharge. Regulators said Sprint also mislabeled the 911 fee as “Omaha City Tax” on customer statements, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Commissioner Crystal Rhoades said the fine is “sending a message that carriers need to be more responsible to the consumer and that such blatant errors will not be tolerated.” Sprint has already issued a credit to current customers who were affected, and it is in the process of sending refund checks to former customers who closed their accounts.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Reno-Sparks area posted a record high for taxable room revenue amid a bounce back in domestic travel as tourism continued its steady recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The $32.4 million in room tax revenue was the “best ever” recorded for the month of April, according to the Reno-Sparks Convention and Visitors Authority. The previous record for April was set in 2019, just before the pandemic, when Washoe County posted $32.2 million in taxable room revenue. The numbers include Reno, Sparks and Incline Village at Lake Tahoe. “The April data is in alignment with national studies showing pent-up travel demand, and consumer sentiment suggests that Reno Tahoe has the outdoor amenities and active nightlife that travelers are craving right now,” said Charles Harris, RSCVA president and CEO. Washoe County managed to beat the previous record for room tax despite its number of cash-occupied rooms – also known as room nights in the travel industry – being down from two years ago. The 243,986 room night numbers were down by 11.4% from the 275,513 seen two years ago. Instead, Washoe managed to make up the difference through an increase in room rates. The average daily rate in April was $132.80, up 13.5% from $116.97 two years ago.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The U.S. Marshals Service in New Hampshire will be the first in the country to incorporate body-worn cameras into deputy marshals’ uniforms. The Axon Body 3 cameras will arrive in Concord by the end of the summer, WMUR-TV reports. U.S. Marshal Nick Willard said he has been vocal about the need for body cameras. “In my time in service, I have often talked about police transparency,” he said. “I have often talked about the need of body-worn cameras. I have felt the necessity of body-worn cameras.” Willard said he wishes deputies were equipped with cameras last week when six deputies were shot at in Manchester while attempting to serve a warrant. He said he has not encountered resistance from deputies. “They expose bad cops, but they validate good cops,” he said. “They expose bad work, but they validate good work.” Willard added the cameras sometimes change the demeanor of a suspect and can help deescalate a situation. “Now they know they are on a body-worn camera, it may change their behavior,” he said. “They may be less aggressive because it could be used against them in court.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Reinfections, hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 among fully vaccinated residents were all extremely rare over the first four months of the vaccination campaign, according to a study released Wednesday. Only 0.06% of fully vaccinated New Jerseyans became infected, the state health department study shows. That represents 1,319 “breakthrough cases” among more than 2.2 million fully vaccinated people from Dec. 15 to April 23. “The vaccines we have are not perfect, but they’re pretty close,” Dr. Ed Lifshitz, the state health department’s medical director, said at a briefing. “They’re literally lifesavers.” Of those breakthrough cases, 14 died, but only seven of the deaths were attributed to the coronavirus. In addition, 92 people with breakthrough cases were hospitalized, but only 30 of them were because of COVID-19, Lifshitz said. All of the hospitalizations and deaths were among people 50 and older. Half the deaths were in those 80 years and older, he said. The study “demonstrates overwhelmingly that vaccines work,” state Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. Another study by two researchers at the state’s largest hospital network – Hackensack Meridian Health – found 138 coronavirus cases among 26,000 of its fully vaccinated workers, she said. None became seriously ill.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: In the next academic year, the state’s lottery scholarship program will cover full tuition for eligible in-state students at public and tribal colleges and universities for the first time since 2015, the state Higher Education Department announced. The program will be funded at $63.5 million in the 2021-22 fiscal year, a 30% increase, with the additional money coming from several sources, officials said last week. The scholarships paid full tuition for eligible students from 1996 to 2015 before the program was reduced to levels as low as 60% due to circumstances that included rising tuition rates. For the coming year, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appropriated $15.5 million to shore up the scholarships, while $37 million will come from projected lottery ticket sales. The rest of the money will be carried over from last year, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. “This is what is needed at the tail end of a pandemic,” Higher Education Secretary Stephanie Rodriguez said. Officials are discussing ways to keep the scholarship at the 100% mark beyond next year, Rodriguez said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: With the legislative session almost over, restaurants are urging state lawmakers to make their ability to sell alcohol with takeout orders permanent. Currently, the sales are allowed through monthly extensions of an executive order by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The latest one runs through July 4, and it’s unclear whether it would be extended thereafter. Restaurants said offering take-out drinks was a boost to their businesses during the pandemic, when most went months without in-person dining. And even as they’ve reopened as the coronavirus wanes, carry-out drinks remain a popular option for diners. “The ability to sell one or two drinks to a customer to go home with their meal allowed diners to replicate the restaurant experience at home, increased servers’ check averages leading to higher tips and provided valuable revenue to struggling businesses,” the Empire State Restaurant & Tavern Association said in a memo in support of the bill. Whether the bill, which has been moving through the legislative committee process, will become law is uncertain. The measure is being opposed by the powerful liquor store industry, which has raised concerns about allowing carry-out sales permanently could cut into its revenue.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The city has committed $2.1million toward funding reparations, an initiative it began last summer when it joined a number of U.S. cities that have voted to address their histories of racism and discrimination. The Asheville City Council approved a budget amendment Tuesday to pull the money from city land purchased in the 1970s as part of urban renewal programs that took apart Black communities. The council also adopted a proclamation declaring June 19 as Juneteenth, the date that marks the end of slavery in the U.S. “We must collectively strive to close gaps of immeasurable distance between us and affirm the promise of the Declaration of Independence that all people have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Mayor Esther Manheimer said, reading the proclamation. Asheville passed its historic reparations in July 2020, apologizing for the city’s role in slavery, discrimination and denial of liberties to Black residents. The city manager was directed to establish a process for gathering recommendations to address the creation of generational wealth and economic mobility and opportunity in the Black community. The City Council has said the reparations do not require direct payments but would mandate investments in areas where Black residents face disparities.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: City leaders have killed a proposal to allow chickens within city limits. The Bismarck Tribune reports the City Commission denied a request Tuesday from the city Planning and Zoning Commission to hold a public hearing on a potential ordinance that would have allowed residents to keep up to four chickens. Mark Splonskowski was the only commissioner who supported holding a hearing. He said other cities allow chickens. “If it’s not intrinsically evil, why not give it a try?” he asked his fellow board members. But Commissioner Steve Marquardt said he was concerned about disposal of chicken feces and the cost of building city coops to house chickens that escape from their owners. He said commissioners had received emails from residents opposing the ordinance. “I think the city of Bismarck needs a lot of things,” Marquardt said. “But chickens are not one of them.” Mayor Steve Bakken said he had liability concerns. His dogs are trained to hunt birds, he said, and putting chickens next door to dogs could pose problems and lead to nuisance complaints.\n\nOhio\n\nHudson: A retired U.S. Army officer whose speech about freed Black slaves honoring fallen Civil War soldiers was censored by organizers of a Memorial Day ceremony will get another chance to deliver it. The American Legion Department of Ohio said it has invited retired Army Lt. Col. Barnard Kemter to speak next week at the organization’s Buckeye Boys State, an annual gathering that teaches young men about government. Kemter was speaking at a Memorial Day event hosted by a local American Legion post in northeastern Ohio when his microphone was turned off as he talked about the role Black people played in how Memorial Day began. Two of the event’s organizers later resigned under pressure after Ohio American Legion officials said the decision censoring the speech was premeditated and planned. The organizers of the ceremony in Hudson initially defended their decision, saying the section of the speech that was silenced was not relevant to the program’s theme of honoring the city’s veterans. The Ohio American Legion has temporarily suspended the post. A meeting is planned later this month to discuss its future.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Inmates began receiving special computer tablets this week as part of a Department of Corrections plan to provide secure tablets to everyone incarcerated in state prisons. The devices, specially designed by prisons communications company Securus Technologies, will include free content such as prison policies, access to a law library, some books, and educational and self-help materials. Inmates can also pay to receive music, movies, games and television programs, as well as to send and receive messages, including video messages, to and from their families. The tablets do not have unrestricted access to the internet. Usually, inmates wanting to receive educational or vocational training must be escorted to a classroom or program location. But inmates can now receive those services directly on the tablets, said Mike Carpenter, chief of technical services and operations at the Corrections Department. “The education and programming, that’s huge for us,” Carpenter said. On Tuesday, North Fork Correctional Center inmate Byron Robinson, who has been incarcerated since 2005 – the same year YouTube was founded – said the tablet was totally new to him. “I’ve never even touched one of these things until today,” Robinson said. “It’s mindboggling, really, how much this thing can do.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Legislature has approved changes to the lyrics of the state song to remove racist language and make the lyrics more inclusive. House Concurrent Resolution 11, approved Monday by a vote of 47-6, modifies the lyrics, while keeping the same music of “Oregon, My Oregon.” If reflects the “significant cultural, historical, economic and societal evolution in Oregon” since the state song was adopted in 1927, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The first verse, which referred to Oregon as “conquered and held by free men; fairest and the best,” was replaced with new lyrics emphasizing Oregon’s natural beauty and “rolling rivers.” There are other small changes throughout. In 1919, the Society of Oregon Composers held a contest for poets to submit their compositions “in which the beauties and the merits of the state are extolled,” according to an Oregonian article at the time. The winning entry was written by judge and former state representative J.A. Buchanan of Astoria. Henry Bernard Murtagh composed the music. The new lyrics were proposed by Beaverton resident Amy Shapiro, who said she first hesitated to sing it with her students when she worked as a music teacher and choir director at Portland Jewish Academy 30 years ago.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: For all the love Wawa has gotten thanks to the HBO hit TV show “Mare of Easttown,” the popular convenience store chain is giving a little back. To celebrate its newest store opening in Delaware County – where the Kate Winslet-led crime drama is set – Wawa is dedicating Thursday as “Mare of Easttown Day,” an homage to the show that introduced the world to the coffee and hoagies Pennsylvanians have loved for years. Customers of the relocated Upper Darby store will get to enjoy that coffee Thursday free of charge, and the first 100 customers will get a “Wawa Delco” T-shirt. British actress Winslet plays Mare Sheehan, a detective sergeant in Easttown – a fictional town just outside Philadelphia – who is investigating the murder of a teen mother while looking into the disappearance of another young girl. As Mare, the Oscar winner eats hoagies and drinks Wawa coffee, all in a close-to-perfect Delco accent. To turn into Mare, Winslet worked alongside Chester County Detective Christine Bleiler, who also served as a police technical adviser on the drama. Bleiler will be at the Wawa store Thursday ordering the very first limited-edition “Mare of Easttown Spicy Cheesesteak,” which the store called a nod to how spicy the show is. Local police and fire officials will also be honored at the event, and Wawa will donate money each to the charities of their choice, as well as $10,000 to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: Salve Regina University will require students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning to campus next fall. The Catholic school in Newport announced Tuesday that all students, faculty and staff will be required to submit proof of immunization to the school no later than Aug. 1. Salve Regina joins Brown University, the University of Rhode Island, Providence College and several other schools in the state that will require students to be inoculated before participating in on-campus classes and activities in the fall. “We did not arrive at this decision lightly,” the school posted on its website. “In reviewing the American College Health Association and CDC recommendations for higher education institutions and in discussion with state health officials, it became clear that this additional safeguard was required to more fully protect our Salve Regina community and those with whom our members interact.” People with valid medical or religious reasons for not receiving the vaccine may request an exemption, the school said. Salve Regina has about 2,700 students.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state House on Wednesday put its final touches on a nearly $11 billion budget, spending more money than anticipated after the economic problems from the COVID-19 pandemic weren’t as bad as feared. The spending plan for the year starting in July includes raises for teachers, law enforcement officers and nearly every state employee. It fixes buildings at colleges and helps art centers and festivals hurt by social distancing. But it won’t include – at least for now – million-dollar drawings for people vaccinated against COVID-19. Nor it will have a $1,200 pandemic bonus for state employees making less than $50,000. House members took time during Tuesday’s debate to add a provision to the budget keeping public schools from requiring masks. And they put in a ban on colleges requiring students to take coronavirus tests or only allowing students who have been vaccinated to forgo masks. The Senate decided Tuesday that it would not agree with the House changes to the budget, so a conference committee will meet next week to finalize the plan. House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford, D-Columbia, removed a proposal to offer a $1 million prize for vaccinated residents and said he will bring it back up later using federal pandemic aid. The House did agree to a 3% raise for state employees, an increase over the 2% offered in the Senate’s budget.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state health department has reclassified several hundred COVID-19 hospitalizations, reducing the number of patients who have been reported as having received hospital care for the disease caused by the coronavirus. That, in turn, has reduced the overall case hospitalization rate to below 6%, a big shift. In the early weeks of the pandemic, 1 out of every 10 cases resulted in a patient receiving hospital care. But as health providers got better at treating the disease, fewer people ended up in the hospital. Besides falling hospital rates, South Dakota has also seen a sharp reduction in the number of serious illnesses caused by COVID-19. For the first time in months, the number of people who were receiving intensive care fell to the single digits this week. As of Tuesday, only six COVID-19 patients in the entire state were occupying an intensive care unit bed. Meanwhile, the state has gone nearly two weeks without recording a new coronavirus death among its long-term care residents. By almost every measure, the pandemic in South Dakota has relented. The seven-day average for new cases is at its lowest since the opening weeks of the disease hitting the state in March 2020.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Rhodes College students will go back to in-person learning for the fall semester, but for those without their COVID-19 shots, it will cost them. Rhodes sent an email to students Tuesday saying the liberal arts college will charge unvaccinated students a $1,500 health and safety fee per semester to cover the costs of mandatory coronavirus testing. “Aligned with our long-standing practice and policy requiring health forms and vaccinations, the college fully intends to require the COVID-19 vaccination immediately upon FDA approval,” the email said. “This will be required for students, faculty, staff, vendors and campus partners.” Until the vaccines get official approval from the Food and Drug Administration, the college strongly recommends full inoculation for anyone who goes to campus, and flu vaccines are required for the fall. Those who do not get vaccines must pay the fee to cover the costs of the student’s weekly virus testing. Vice President for Student Life Meghan Harte Weyant, who also leads health and safety efforts, said the college invested in weekly asymptomatic testing for the spring semester, which led to a safer campus. Students can submit requests for medical or religious vaccine exemptions to Student Accessibility Services by Aug. 2.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Despite experts who say the state’s power grid remains vulnerable, Gov. Greg Abbott declared Tuesday that new reforms “fix all of the flaws” that caused February’s deadly winter blackout that left more than 4 million people without power in subfreezing weather. He was joined by fellow Republicans who defended it as a good deal for consumers, even though they gave no direct financial relief to families who were stuck with high energy bills or lost income as the lights and heat stayed off for days. Signing into law two sweeping overhauls in response to one of the largest power outages in U.S. history, Abbott asserted he and the GOP-controlled Legislature had delivered following one of the worst crises in his six years as governor. But even members of his own party say there is work still to be done. More than 4 million people lost power when temperatures plunged into single digits, icing power generators and buckling the state’s electric grid. State officials say they have confirmed at least 151 deaths blamed on the freeze and resulting outages, but the real toll is believed to be higher. “Bottom line is that everything that needed to be done was done to fix the power grid in Texas,” Abbott said. Energy experts disagree, saying that although lawmakers made significant changes that include mandates to “weatherize” power plants for extreme temperatures and new processes to avert communication failures, the reforms do not go far enough to assure a similar catastrophe won’t happen again.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A committee created to consider a name change for Dixie State University voted Monday to choose a replacement that does not include the regional term many consider offensive because of its association with the Deep South and slavery. Dixie State University has been studying the impact of changing its name for nearly a year following a national outcry against racial injustice after the death of George Floyd. While several hurdles remain, the committee’s decision makes it likely that whatever name is ultimately recommended to the Legislature will not include the controversial term that has spurred months of protest and debate. The University Board of Trustees formed a committee in March to review options for the institution’s name under a process outlined in a bill Gov. Spencer Cox signed earlier this year. The committee collected feedback from a public survey, as well as students, university employees and community members before voting to ditch the Dixie name. The committee will reconvene next week to discuss specific names that performed well in focus groups and then choose one to recommend to the university’s Board of Trustees later this month. The name will then go to the Utah Board of Higher Education, which has until Nov. 1 to vote on whether to recommend the name to a legislative committee.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state’s congressional delegation has sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to work with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to allow additional travel between the United States and Canada. In the letter, dated Monday, Sens. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders, an independent, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Welch also urged the president to work with Trudeau toward fully reopening the international border, which has been closed to most nonessential travel since March 2020. “Families throughout Vermont, especially those in our border communities, have gone well over a year without seeing loved ones across the border,” the letter said. “While negative economic and health impacts of this global pandemic are far from over, enabling more people to reconnect, work, and resume daily routines when it is safe to do so will go a long way to addressing these dual crises.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Terry McAuliffe, a longtime fixture of Democratic politics, handily won his party’s nomination for governor in his quest for a second term, setting up what’s expected to be a hotly contested general election against a wealthy businessman and political newcomer, GOP nominee Glenn Youngkin. In his victory speech Tuesday night, McAuliffe made the case that Youngkin is too conservative for a state that’s long been trending blue. “Let me be crystal clear: Glenn Youngkin is not a reasonable Republican,” said McAuliffe, who defeated four challengers to win the primary. Youngkin shot back, describing Virginia as a state that over the past two Democratic governorships has gotten less safe and more expensive while not offering enough economic opportunities. “We need a new kind of leader to bring a new day to Virginia,” Youngkin said in a statement. A longtime Democratic Party fundraiser and a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton, McAuliffe held office from 2014 to 2018. Like all Virginia governors, he was prohibited from seeking a consecutive term. He jumped into the race in December after deciding in 2019 against a run for president. Virginia is the only state in the nation with an open race for governor this year, and the contest is expected to draw outsized national attention.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A collection agency must return about $475,000 it collected improperly from up to 5,000 consumers after state Attorney General Bob Ferguson prevailed in a lawsuit alleging unlawful debt-collection practices. Ferguson’s office says Machol & Johannes must also forgive as much as $250,000 in fees and costs for hundreds of people and pay $414,000 to the attorney general’s office to cover investigation costs, The Seattle Times reports. Ferguson filed the lawsuit against Denver-based Machol & Johannes in King County Superior Court in 2020, after a King County Superior Court judge notified his office that the company had filed improper wage-garnishment applications. The agency violated Washington’s Consumer Protection Act and Collection Agency Act by unlawfully assessing fees and failing to provide consumers with information about legally required garnishment exemptions, according to the lawsuit. Machol & Johannes did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the newspaper. Eligible consumers do not need to contact the Attorney General’s Office or Machol & Johannes to receive restitution or debt relief. Refunds and relief of costs and fees will be determined by data contained in Machol & Johannes’ records.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s coal mine cleanup fund has no known backup plan if it goes insolvent, according to a new legislative audit. The report released Monday said that mine reclamation program within the state’s Department of Environmental Protection is at risk of insolvency due to the risk of bond revenues not raising enough to guarantee the fund’s future. Among several recommendations, the auditor calls on the department to not approve applications for permit renewals for companies that have not paid taxes for the special reclamation fund. Its review found that 70 mining companies that filed coal reclamation tax returns were delinquent on $5.3 million in total funds. Reclamation of shuttered coal mine sites is crucial to preventing environmental pollution and returning the land to its habitat. Contaminants can seep into waterways and harm wildlife if not properly handled after a mine closes. “West Virginia’s coal mining reclamation program will continue to require hundreds of millions of dollars to reclaim permit sites in accordance with federal regulations,” the audit said. “The program has no known contingency plans if the reclamation funds were to become insolvent.” Insolvency could also pose a dramatic hit to the state budget, and mismanagement of the funds could lead to federal control over the program, according to the audit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: With progress stalled, the state is relaunching a multimedia public awareness campaign to encourage COVID-19 vaccinations. State health officials announced Tuesday that the “You Stop the Spread” campaign will ramp up with more ads on television, radio, billboards, transit, newspapers and social media platforms. Some ads will feature leaders of groups that in April received $6.2 million in grants to boost vaccinations among marginalized or underserved populations. Julie Willems Van Dijk, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said the ads will also address myths about the vaccines, such as that they alter people’s DNA, cause infertility or make people get COVID-19. Racial and geographic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination persist, with the statewide rate about 45% lower among Blacks than whites. In addition to the multimedia campaign, the state health department is working with medical providers, community groups and health departments to keep providing a variety of immunization opportunities, Willems Van Dijk said. Thirteen states reportedly have already reached President Joe Biden’s goal of 70% by July 4, but Wisconsin likely won’t get there until mid-July, Willems Van Dijk said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A legislative committee has voted to pursue legislation that would significantly change the way statewide elections are run as early as next year, including a bill that would create a ranked-choice system and another bill that would institute an open primary. The Legislature’s Joint Committee on Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivision voted Monday to draft the two bills after initially discussing legislation that would require a runoff if a candidate did not receive a certain portion of the vote, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. But many were unsure if that approach would be feasible by next year’s election. The effort to change the primary elections is gaining support because of the effort to unseat Republican Rep. Liz Cheney and the size of the last gubernatorial election. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon received less than 50% of the vote during the 2018 election but won after several candidates split the electorate. Critics worry about a similar result in the Republican House primary, which already has nine candidates. “Liz Cheney’s vote to hold the president accountable for his actions has really been the catalyst for Wyoming to say, ‘We need to address this issue as immediately as possible,’ ” said Republican state Rep. Dan Zwonitzer, who also is chair of the committee.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/10/12/iowa-city-council-candidates-answer-questions-2021-election/6034170001/", "title": "Iowa City Council candidates answer 5 questions before 2021 election", "text": "Four candidates are running for three seats on Iowa City Council in the Nov. 2 election.\n\nThree of the candidates — Iowa City Mayor Bruce Teague, Megan Alter and Jason Glass — are running for two at-large seats on city council. Shawn Harmsen is the only candidate running for the open District B seat.\n\nThe Press-Citizen sent five questions to each of the candidates and asked them to respond in 150 words or less.

Johnson County’s vaccination rate has stalled at/around 60% while the COVID-19 Delta variant still ravages most of Iowa. What can the city do, if anything, to continue combatting COVID-19 while the University of Iowa and the state government put up impediments to the city doing so?\n\nThe Mayor’s mask mandate is saving lives, just as it did before vaccines were available. I would like to see additional PPE made available again for businesses and restaurants, provided free of charge to these businesses so in turn they can be offered to patrons. The City’s approval of all-weather permitting for restaurants and activities in the downtown area, where many people congregate, is also a smart move. Sadly, the City is up against a struggle since the University refuses to implement its right to enforce a mask mandate for its faculty, staff, and students. Especially as we head into colder weather with new variants in full force, there should be action-focused discussions between the University and the City to mitigate the spread of this deadly disease. Without a collaborative focus on public health between UI and the City, Iowa City is limited to the mandate it has already set.\n\n2. With the cost of rental units in Iowa City rising, what should the city do to keep rental costs of units currently existing in the city (not new development) down and prevent residents from moving away, being displaced or even evicted?\n\nThe City does not have rent control in its tool kit, so it has little ability to keep rental costs of units down since the market dictates rents. To attract and retain Iowa City residents, we need to focus on providing a range of affordable options, especially units for <30% AMI; we also must provide first time home buyers with affordable options. Form based code zoning can offer ways to create access to that missing market. As we continue to face economic consequences of COVID, the continuation of state and federal rental assistance programs and groups devoted to helping renters avoid eviction like Shelter House, Iowa Finance Authority, and Iowa Legal Aid is currently fast and effective in keeping people in their homes. The City should support these programs with ARPA funds and also help the residents most at risk of being displaced (i.e. Forest View.)\n\n3. The city has a lot of initiatives to fight climate change and push for clean energy for city-owned property. What new initiatives would you propose the city do to encourage residents to take action on their own?\n\nIowa City offers a GRIP (General Rehab and Improvement Program) which offers loans for home improvements at very low rates. This program should offer more green improvements on the eligibility list, particularly solar panel installation. To encourage residents to take individual action, the City must model the way. Bicycling has long been part of the City’s strategic plan but until there was substantial infrastructure provided (bike lanes, bicycle repair stations throughout the city), residents did not bike as much. The City has also made recycling easier for homeowners; it would be incredibly beneficial to get recycling containers on premises for renters. The City website has a host of information about climate action, but it gets little traffic. I favor fostering a permanent “did you know?” information campaign in ways that are visible and not necessarily climate-related: fairs, festival, murals. The point is to embed awareness into people’s everyday lives.\n\n4. While the city waits for the TRC’s recommendations to address racism and inequality, what are your own thoughts on what the city needs to do to actually make changes to the system and improve people’s lives beyond performative activism?\n\nMy entire campaign addresses equity concerns that impact people every day. Simply, we must focus on fixing everyday economic and community needs because they are equity issues. I am committed to bringing sustainable retail to the South District and the adjacent IC Marketplace. Currently there is nowhere to buy soft goods or even to eat at a sit-down restaurant. For those of us in the SD, traveling across town or to Coralville is time consuming under the best of circumstances. It is incredibly challenging for those relying on public transportation. The lack of affordable quality childcare is frankly an unaddressed crisis that impacts the entire community--in every sector--but it is most acutely felt by women and families of color, health care workers, the immigrant community, and essential workers. Finding solutions for childcare will be one of the most effective ways to create access to greater opportunities for more people.\n\n5. What initiatives would you propose to drive economic growth in the city to help businesses recover from the pandemic? Would adding a SSMID in the South District be a part of these plans?\n\nI have been advocating for improving economic districts throughout Iowa City in ways that are right for each area and which also strengthen Iowa City’s tax base overall. I believe the City will be better for creating additional retail and revenue pockets. On the Northside, turning the one-way on Market street into a two-way street will help provide easier and more access to the retail district. Increasing opportunities for entrepreneurs and small business owners through business incubation labs, access to current business leaders, and start-up grants will kickstart and help sustain economic growth. While the look of economic development may be changing (fewer big box stores), consumer need is still there. I favor smaller retail fronts and this is also why I strongly advocate for the South District SSMID, which will open avenues for smaller retail options. The success of the Downtown District’s SSMID shows what buy-in from property owners can achieve.\n\nMore:Meet the 6 candidates vying for 4 seats on the Iowa City school board\n\nJason Glass\n\n1. Johnson County’s vaccination rate has stalled at/around 60% while the COVID-19 Delta variant still ravages most of Iowa. What can the city do, if anything, to continue combatting COVID-19 while the University of Iowa and the state government put up impediments to the city doing so?\n\nThough Johnson County vaccinations rates have leveled off, I’m encouraged that the rate of residents age 26+ is nearly 85% and age 12+ is nearly 75% according to Johnson County Public Health as of September 9th (so they are almost certainly higher now). I’m proud that we are leading the state. On other actions, we obviously can’t control the university or state government. That is no excuse to give up. We have instituted a mask mandate that stands and has not been challenged in court after a month. Employers are increasingly requiring vaccines as a condition of employment. It appears ages 5-12 will be eligible soon, which will boost our overall percentage considerably. We must continue to be diligent in all the ways we already know to limit spread and encourage those in our individual circles who are vaccine hesitant to reconsider.\n\n2. With the cost of rental units in Iowa City rising, what should the city do to keep rental costs of units currently existing in the city (not new development) down and prevent residents from moving away, being displaced or even evicted?\n\nWe are a growing city that people want to live in, and demand for housing has outpaced supply. We have denied good projects that would increase that supply to our detriment.\n\nThe city needs to continue the millions in spending that take advantage of Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), which is then multiplied by other sources. I have publicly supported using American Rescue Plan funds for direct payments to Excluded Workers that will help them with rent. I hope Johnson County continues to bolster their rent assistance program as well.\n\nFrom my experience with the Affordable Housing Network in Cedar Rapids, I’ve learned that housing insecurity is about more than just affordability. We also need a holistic approach, surrounding people with mental health and substance abuse treatment, childcare and family support, removing barriers to employment. I have done this work. I will bring this experience to council.\n\n3. The city has a lot of initiatives to fight climate change and push for clean energy for city-owned property. What new initiatives would you propose the city do to encourage residents to take action on their own?\n\nWe are blessed in Iowa City that we have the will and resources (that many cities do not) to invest in climate change initiatives including clean energy. That will and commitment means that we have residents that make climate and clean energy a priority and are doing a lot already. And though there are city plans, we have also missed opportunities. The Mid-American solar farm project for instance, is one that I would have supported on council.\n\nI’m in favor of incentives to help residents make their homes more energy efficient, particularly those with lower incomes and in older homes. This both decreases their expenses (improving affordability) and reduces energy consumption. These programs exist, but we could accelerate them as a potential use for the some of the American Rescue Plan funds.\n\n4. While the city waits for the TRC’s recommendations to address racism and inequality, what are your own thoughts on what the city needs to do to actually make changes to the system and improve people’s lives beyond performative activism?\n\nI’ve had many conversations with TRC members and I support their mission of elevating voices that have not been heard. I look forward to the recommendations that come from it. Iowa City has done, and continues to do, considerable work on systemic changes in addition to forming the TRC. We added mental health resources through the Guidelink Center and in ICPD staff. We de-emphasized non-safety related traffic stops. The Preliminary Plan to Restructure the Police notes several other actions the city has taken. There is more to be done, but we have not stood still.\n\nWe ask police to do too much. We pass nuisance laws that should not be their priority to enforce. Underlying the debates about equipment, is a distrust by many residents of the police. Community policing is essential to build trust between officers and their neighbors. I’m open to additional ways to accomplish that.\n\n5. What initiatives would you propose to drive economic growth in the city to help businesses recover from the pandemic? Would adding a SSMID in the South District be a part of these plans?\n\nI fully support a SSMID in South District and am glad that the IC Downtown District is supportive of it. There is a lot of economic potential in that area. South District, and IC overall, needs to be a place where people want to invest, not just their capital, but their time and energy and dedication. City government needs to regularly ask itself how we are enabling a trusting environment. We need to create a safe, stable, consistent, and predicable atmosphere so that people can make long term plans with less risk and more confidence.\n\nWe have innovative and resilient people operating our businesses, both existing and future entrepreneurial projects. They are the best people to answer how the city can support them. I want to ensure that city elected officials and staff are listening to what those needs are and stand ready to partner, prioritize, and problem solve.\n\nMore:Could Coralville Lake disappear? Here's what's being done to try and save the man-made reservoir.\n\nBruce Teague\n\n1. Johnson County’s vaccination rate has stalled at/around 60% while the COVID-19 Delta variant still ravages most of Iowa. What can the city do, if anything, to continue combatting COVID-19 while the University of Iowa and the state government put up impediments to the city doing so?\n\nThere is very little power that we have at the municipal level regarding vaccines. I am proud that Iowa City continues to show higher vaccination rates than the rest of the state, it’s a testament to the people of this community that we understand the science and we have compassion for our fellow man. We will keep advocating as best we can to all groups that these vaccines are effective and truly a miraculous feat of American ingenuity to have been developed so quickly.\n\n2. With the cost of rental units in Iowa City rising, what should the city do to keep rental costs of units currently existing in the city (not new development) down and prevent residents from moving away, being displaced or even evicted?\n\nBecause of state law, we have very little power to lower the price of existing rentals owned by private landlords. Other cities use rent control, for example, and that is not an option in Iowa.\n\nWhat we can do is invest more public money in reducing the amount that low-income households pay for monthly rent. There are a number of strategies that can accomplish this, including locally-funded subsidies or providing loans to affordable housing providers who want to buy existing properties. I’m looking forward to an ambitious Affordable Housing Plan that guides this work.\n\nWe also need to continue the investments in eviction prevention and utility forgiveness that the city implemented in response to COVID. Keeping people safely housed is always a public health priority.\n\n3. The city has a lot of initiatives to fight climate change and push for clean energy for city-owned property. What new initiatives would you propose the city do to encourage residents to take action on their own?\n\nThis is another area where our community members already show such leadership on. You see such a high number of hybrid and electric vehicles on our streets, people utilizing bikes and public transit. The Johnson County Solar energy initiatives have been helpful. We need to keep encouraging and recognizing these attitudes and behaviors and should be open to supporting creative ideas that further encourage these behaviors. We need to keep working with the state and our utility partners on creative incentives and lead by example as a city and with our own homes and properties as council members. Where we may have policies that restrict positive efforts, we need to address those quickly.\n\n4. While the city waits for the TRC’s recommendations to address racism and inequality, what are your own thoughts on what the city needs to do to actually make changes to the system and improve people’s lives beyond performative activism?\n\nI live as a member of the Iowa City community and a member of the Black Community and the Gay Community and know firsthand that while Iowa City is a very kind and loving place, there is much work to be done before we can truly say we have equality for all. Our city staff, including and especially our police department, strives to improve every aspect of how we engage with people of color. There is no quick fix, no magic solution, it takes a true desire to see each other as equal, an understanding that things haven’t been right. No one committee or group can fix this. But as a person of faith, I believe that we can and will continue to improve and Iowa City can be seen as the model for what a community can be when it has the courage and compassion to make the changes necessary.\n\n5. What initiatives would you propose to drive economic growth in the city to help businesses recover from the pandemic? Would adding a SSMID in the South District be a part of these plans?\n\nThe city has invested already in economic recovery for households and businesses, and we’ll be doing more of that with our American Rescue Plan allocation. My main focus will continue to be on getting Iowa City families back on their feet. We’ll also look at small businesses, especially BIPOC-led businesses, who were left out of federal relief for businesses.\n\nAs for a SSMID, I fully support the South District businesses in deciding whether they want to invest more resources in creating their path forward together. I’ll do whatever I can to support commercial opportunities that strengthen that area for everyone in the neighborhood.\n\nMore:'It shows what we stand for': How Iowa schools responded to new law requiring flags in classrooms\n\nShawn Harmsen\n\n1. Johnson County’s vaccination rate has stalled at/around 60% while the COVID-19 Delta variant still ravages most of Iowa. What can the city do, if anything, to continue combatting COVID-19 while the University of Iowa and the state government put up impediments to the city doing so?\n\nWe are still in the middle of this pandemic and in addition to the moral duty to save lives, the other impacts of the pandemic can be felt in everything from the ability of the local economy to recover to the ability of too many Iowa City families to be able to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table.\n\nFrankly, the city needs to do all it can and push the envelope against the unwise restrictions pushed upon us by our current state leaders. I applaud the mayor’s extension of the mask mandate and the kind of leadership he and the council have shown in this measure. One only has to go grocery shopping at a story in Iowa City and then at a similar store in one of our nearby neighbors lacking a mask mandate to see the difference in mask wearing.\n\n2. With the cost of rental units in Iowa City rising, what should the city do to keep rental costs of units currently existing in the city (not new development) down and prevent residents from moving away, being displaced or even evicted?\n\nAs you know, once again state law limits what local governments can do with things like rent control. But that doesn’t mean we can’t help our residents. Short term, we need to make sure recovery funds and similar programs are helping keep people in their homes, and partnering and supporting groups who are helping with these efforts. Longer term, we need to look at ways we might be able to partner with or support efforts by nonprofit groups to protect existing affordable housing stock in the city, in effect expanding beyond the city’s current limit of housing units it can own and operate.\n\n3. The city has a lot of initiatives to fight climate change and push for clean energy for city-owned property. What new initiatives would you propose the city do to encourage residents to take action on their own?\n\nAs crucially important as it is for all of us to pull together on fighting climate change, a substantial body of data suggests we should be looking at large carbon emission sources, from manufacturing and large institutions to the city itself. For example, in the near future Iowa City will have its first electric buses come online. The city should be working toward this conversion away from fossil fuels in its bus and other fleet vehicles, while pursuing green energy like solar and wind to help provide the charge for those vehicles. Depending on what happens in Washington D.C. with President Biden’s agendas on infrastructure and renewable energy, the city should also be watching closely to tap into federal programs that could help make residents, businesses, and the city government more green and sustainable.\n\nBottom line, this is an urgent issue and one we can’t afford to ignore.\n\n4. While the city waits for the TRC’s recommendations to address racism and inequality, what are your own thoughts on what the city needs to do to actually make changes to the system and improve people’s lives beyond performative activism?\n\nIn terms of city policy, it makes sense to craft that with the input of groups like TRC, BVP, and the BIPOC people who live the reality of living under structural racism every day of their lives. I see my role on council as an extension of what I have already been doing in the community — when there is an opportunity to roll up the sleeves and do some anti-racist work then it’s time to get to it.\n\nFor example, one of the many manifestations of structural racism is the lack of BIPOC representation where decisions are made. I was honored to be part of the teams who worked behind the scenes to stand with some amazing women of color who are now serving on local city councils and the county board.\n\nIt’s not about me, but what’s best for our entire, diverse, community.\n\n5. What initiatives would you propose to drive economic growth in the city to help businesses recover from the pandemic? Would adding a SSMID in the South District be a part of these plans?\n\nAll our efforts to strive toward economic recovery are going to be like striding with a broken foot while we are still fighting the pandemic. In addition to all the other ways COVID hoaxers, anti-vaxxers, and anti-maskers hurt the human beings around them by promoting the spread of the disease, they are also hurting the economy.\n\nLonger term, we can look at projects which stabilize and increase our affordable housing stock, make transportation more accessible and affordable, and promote living wages.\n\nThe more I learn about the SSMID proposal in the South District the more it seems like a powerful tool for folks in that district to pool resources and develop growth in a way that is hyperlocal and hopefully responsive to the particular needs of the area. This feels like a win for our community.\n\nMore:U.S. Rep.

Trump Jr. vowed that the GOP will fight, with their voices and their vote this fall.\n\nTrump Jr., the former president’s eldest son, also compared Trump’s reaction after getting shot in the right ear during the assassination attempt on America’s spirit: “When he stood up with blood on his face, and the flag on his back, the world saw a spirit that could never be broken,” Trump Jr. said. “And that is the true spirit of America.”\n\nAt the beginning of his speech, Trump Jr. honored firefighter Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the shooting at Trump’s rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.\n\n− Rebecca Morin\n\nKai Trump, Donald Trump's 17-year-old granddaughter, addresses RNC\n\nKai Trump, Donald Trump’s 17-year-old granddaughter, told convention attendees that she sees a side of her grandfather that most people don’t see.\n\n“He calls me during the middle of the school day to ask how my golf game is going and tells me all about his… even when he's going through all these court cases, he always asks me how I'm doing.

Vance’s religious background sway Catholic voters?\n\nReligion experts told USA TODAY it is unlikely Vance’s religious background will sway Catholic voters as he seeks to shore up support for the Republican ticket.\n\n“People are already pretty committed to their positions. And JD Vance being Catholic or not Catholic is really, I don't think going to change anything,” said Cristina Traina, the Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J. Chair of Catholic Theology at Fordham University.\n\nVance’s selection as Trump’s running mate was unsurprising to Chris Devine, a political science professor at the University of Dayton, a Catholic university in Vance’s home state of Ohio. But it’s because of Vance’s loyalty to Trump, not his religion, that Devine believed he was added to the ticket.\n\nDevine co-authored the 2020 book, “Do Running Mates Matter? The Influence of Vice Presidential Candidates in Presidential Elections” alongside Kyle Kopko. The duo’s research suggested Catholic vice presidential nominees did not move the needle among Catholic voters in past elections.\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi and BrieAnna Frank\n\nTrump pollster says New Jersey, Virginia, Minnesota in play\n\nTrump campaign pollster John McLaughlin said during an interview on CNN Wednesday that he believes the possibility of traditionally blue states like New Jersey, Minnesota and Virginia voting for Trump is “very real” this election.\n\nIn Virginia, for instance, McLaughlin pointed to internal polling showing Trump performing well with African American voters and military service members.\n\n“We leading in the battleground states. We're leading in the national polls. We never saw that in 2016,” McLaughlin said.\n\nA recent Cook Political Report aggregate of national polls found Trump leading Joe Biden 47% to 45%.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nJD Vance speech to highlight is childhood, upbringing\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance will recount his journey from poverty to the vice presidential nomination during his primetime speech at the Republican National Convention tonight.\n\nVance is expected to share how he grew up with a mother addicted to drugs and no constant father figure in his life, according to a source familiar with his prepared remarks. That story is outlined in his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” which thrust Vance into the national spotlight during the 2016 election cycle.\n\nVance will share how his upbringing informed his views on key campaign issues, including trade, immigration and the fentanyl crisis, the source said.\n\nIn announcing his running mate, Donald Trump said the senator will help his campaign reach Rust Belt voters, particularly in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\n— Haley BeMiller\n\nWho is speaking tonight at the RNC? The Day 3 speaker list\n\nWednesday night’s lineup of speakers at the RNC includes longtime Trump allies, U.S. House members, passed up VP picks and everyday Americans. The most anticipated speech of the night will come from Trump’s running mate, JD Vance.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the top speakers:\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, GOP vice presidential nominee\n\nDonald Trump Jr.\n\nKellyanne Conway, former counselor to Trump during his presidency\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum\n\nNewt Gingrich, former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nHere's more on the Wednesday lineup.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nPeter Navarro slated to speak hours after release from prison\n\nDonald Trump’s former adviser Peter Navarro will speak at the RNC on Wednesday just hours after he completed a federal prison sentence. Navarro was convicted on two charges of contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas from the House committee that investigated the Capitol attack of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump’s newly announced running mate, JD Vance, is also expected to take the stage Wednesday. The former presidents 17-year-old granddaughter, Kai Trump, also announced on Instagram that she will speak tonight.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nJD Vance, Trump's new running mate, makes the rounds at GOP convention\n\nLike previous vice presidential nominees, Ohio Sen. JD Vance is making the traditional rounds at the Republican National Convention, including interviews and meetings with prominent people.\n\nOne such meeting comes Thursday, when Vance meets with fellow Republican senators in a closed session sponsored by the \"Senate Opportunity Fund.\"\n\nVance also has an important appointment tonight: His acceptance speech.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nIs JD Vance now the Republican front-runner for 2028?\n\nWith his ascension to the 2024 presidential ticket as Donald Trump’s running mate, U.S. Sen. JD Vance has vaulted into the role of heir-apparent of the MAGA movement and become instant White House contender for 2028.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. said the nomination means there’s “a very high chance” Vance could become president in 2028 if he and Trump win in November.\n\n“(Vance is) the one guy in that movement that’s a current politician that’s out there that actually, really speaks sort of to the ‘America First’ people,” he said at an event hosted by Axios Tuesday. “It isn’t like we’ll be right back to the establishment. … That’s where our base is. That’s where the Republican Party is.”\n\n— Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nIn a redefined GOP, populism and a new coalition\n\nIt's his party.\n\nDonald Trump's takeover of the GOP has been on full display at the Republican National Convention — an even more complete transformation than at the two previous conventions that nominated him and propelled him to four years in the White House.\n\nWith a big win in 2016 and a volatile loss in 2020, Trump has managed to replace Ronald Reagan as the party's touchstone, excised the Bush dynasty that had been a political power and launched two presidencies, and pummeled the ranks of moderate Republicans into flight or silence.\n\nRead more on Trump's takeover of the Republican Party.\n\n— Susan Page\n\nWho is Lara Trump? RNC co-chair delivers Day 2 finale\n\nLara Trump is co-chair of the Republican National Committee and Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law. She delivered the final speech of Day 2 at the RNC on Tuesday, describing Trump as “exactly what this country needs right now.”\n\nShe became co-chair of the RNC in March after serving as an adviser to Trump’s 2020 campaign. Lara Trump is married to Trump’s third son, Eric.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nHaley, DeSantis promote GOP unity\n\nAt one time Republicans Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley were doing all they could to warn primary voters that Donald Trump couldn't win the 2024 presidential election.\n\nBut millions of ballots and an attempted assassination has changed all that.\n\nThe two affirmed Trump's perch on the party's mountaintop and further solidified this week's presentation that conservatives are closing ranks as Democrats remain divided over President Joe Biden's nomination.\n\n\"President Trump asked me to speak to this convention in the name of unity,\" Haley told delegates. \"It was a gracious invitation and I was happy to accept.\"\n\nDon't miss our key RNC Day 2 takeaways.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nKamala Harris calls JD Vance a ‘rubber stamp’ for Trump’s agenda\n\nVice President Kamala Harris slammed former President Donald Trump’s new running mate, JD Vance, describing him as a “rubber stamp” for Trump’s “extreme agenda,” in a video published on Wednesday.\n\n“Make no mistake: JD Vance will be loyal only to Trump, not to our country,” Harris said in her 45-second-long, direct-to-camera address. She criticized Vance for supporting Trump’s efforts to undermine the 2020 election, national abortion restrictions and voting against IVF protections in the Senate.\n\nHarris and Vance spoke over the phone on Tuesday. The pair are widely anticipated to face off against one another in a debate later this year, but have yet to agree on a host or a date.\n\n— Karissa Waddick\n\nWhy Republicans see a chance to flip the rhetorical script on Biden\n\nAfter Saturday's shooting at a Donald Trump rally, Republicans have accused Democrats and President Joe Biden of trafficking in dangerous rhetoric.\n\nTired of Democrats calling them autocrats, dismissing their policies as a threat to democracy and being blamed for violent political rhetoric, Republicans see a chance to flip the script on Biden and his main campaign message.\n\n— Sarah D. Wire\n\nWhat happened on Day 2 of the Republican National Convention\n\nWhile the second day of the RNC focused on immigration and border security, the other theme was unity.\n\nNikki Haley, who ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary and received a mixed response when she entered the stage, threw her support to the former president. Haley previously was not scheduled to speak at the convention and often criticized Trump on the campaign trail.\n\n“Donald Trump has my strong endorsement. Period,” she said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy also spoke Tuesday night where they advocated for a Trump presidency.\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nMake America Strong Once Again: What does Wednesday’s RNC theme mean?\n\nDay 3 of the Republican National Convention is “Make America Strong Once Again,” and will focus on foreign policy, border security and the United States standing on the world stage.\n\nUSA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network have around 60 journalists on the ground in Milwaukee and you can follow along with our live blog for updates throughout the day.\n\n— Rebecca Morin\n\nWho is Trump's VP pick JD Vance?\n\nJD Vance, 39, is a first-term senator from Ohio, who skyrocketed to fame after publishing his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\nVance was first elected to the Senate in 2022 with no prior political experience, but he had widespread name recognition in light of his bestselling book. “Hillbilly Elegy,” later turned into a Netflix feature film, detailed Vance’s journey from a childhood riddled with abuse to a Yale Law School degree that opened doors for him in Silicon Valley.\n\nWhile Vance was previously critical of Trump, at one point comparing him to an opioid and saying he could be “America’s Hitler,” he changed his tune ahead of his 2022 Senate race. Since then, Vance has become a loyal ally to Trump. He is also close with one of Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr.\n\n— Haley BeMiller and Riley Beggin", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/readers/2024/04/16/tcpalm-readers-sound-off-on-three-corners-polluted-water-and-more/73291039007/", "title": "TCPalm readers sound off on Three Corners, polluted water and more.", "text": "TCPALM/Treasure Coast Newspapers\n\nRecreational marijuana will impact bystanders near users\n\nGreat! Just what we need, more stoned imbeciles not understanding a law and more instances of law enforcement not enforcing it. Recreational weed.\n\nI am not a Ron DeSantis fan. However, on this issue, I agree. As a non-user with a wife who could potentially have a fatal allergic reaction to smoke from marijuana, I do not want to smell it everywhere.\n\nSure, the current law states that medical marijuana is to be used only in the home. Been to certain bars lately? How about events in Sebastian where stoners pass joints openly in parks in front of local police who ignore it?\n\nSmoke it in a bar and cost the owner their license? Felony for doing it in a park? Never enforced. However, when we have politely asked someone using a vape pen to at least warn us so we can take a walk away and not risk my wife's life, we get screamed at for her being a \"freak that should live in a bubble.\"\n\nPerhaps the state can use this as a true revenue enhancement stream. Mandatory civil penalties for imbibing in a prohibited area that are onerous. Maybe a minimum $500 ticket, split between municipality writing the ticket and the state?\n\nNo problem if you use it in your home. Just keep your windows closed. Secondhand smoke kills.\n\nOf course, the users will reference alcohol. Hmm? Last time I looked and researched, you having a beer standing next to me does not affect my health as it stays in you. Your rights are limited, they end when they affect someone else.\n\nJeff Hamilton, Sebastian\n\nTrump is taking Christians for a ride\n\nP.T. Barnum is credited with saying: “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Maureen Dowd noted we’re living in “a new golden age of the grift. Cons thrive in times of transition and fast change.”\n\nAs Americans feel the ground beneath their feet shake because of the world’s cauldron of chaos and confusion, they grasp at air, putting their faith in a snake-oil salesman trussed up in red, white and blue while holding a fist full of dollars in one hand and a perversion of the Bible in the other. Yes, Donald Trump is shameless enough to commercialize the seminal text of Christendom.\n\nTrump and his scurrilous campaign advisers have made a mockery of Christianity by portraying him as some kind of martyr: “I am being indicted for you.” Incredibly, he claims to be God’s messenger and “a shepherd to mankind.” Actually, this makes sense to thoughtful individuals. He considers his fanatical flock a herd of mindless sheep ripe for fleecing ($399 gold sneakers, anyone?).\n\nDowd wrote: “He is a miserable human who cheated on his wives, cheats at golf, cheats at politics, incites violence, targets judges and their families, and looked on, pleased, as thugs threatened to hang his … vice president.” As Keri Hilson said: “We live in such a gullible world. Anything that’s posted … is taken as truth.”\n\nIn the eponymous novel, Elmer Gantry is described by Sinclair Lewis as a corrupt, power-hungry, narcissistic, womanizing preacher having “got everything from the church … except any longing whatever for decency and kindness and reason.” This could be a description of Donald Trump.\n\nChris Quinn, editor of Cleveland’s The Plain Dealer, said on MSNBC’s “Dateline: White House” telecast recently: “There aren’t two sides to facts.”\n\nAvoid Trump’s specious grifts.\n\nCray Little, Vero Beach\n\nNo safe substitute for keeping hands on steering wheel\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission needs to restrict advertisers from stating or promoting \"hands-free driving.\" Cars today have made important advances in alerting drivers to potential hazards, such as lane departures and stopped traffic.\n\nBut those features in newer cars cannot be promoted as a replacement for keeping your hands on the wheel. I urge everyone to contact their elected officials and demand that the FTC take action.\n\nSharon McGinns, Stuart\n\nNo gray areas on abortion amendment\n\nAs Floridians decide on Amendment 4, the main question and issue is being avoided by those promoting it. The central question is: \"What are the unborn?\" The biological fact is, at conception, a new, unique, whole, living, individual human being is present.\n\nReason tells us that newborns are truly innocent. They made no choices. They had no say in their presence, or their state of need. They are exactly where they should be, doing exactly what they should be doing, based on who and what they are.\n\nThey are defenseless, depending solely on their mothers, who are responsible for them by any definition of that word.\n\nAbortion is the intentional killing of this human being. That is its sole purpose.\n\nIntentionally killing another innocent human being is a moral wrong. Abortion is a moral wrong. Yet Amendment 4 would attempt to make this a right. There can be no right to do something so horribly wrong.\n\nThe deceptive language of the amendment seeks to make this about anything other than what it is.\n\nWomen facing unplanned pregnancies are told it is a right to kill their own children. They are told they cannot succeed in life, unless they can do this. These precious women need hope and love and support. They need to be shown they can be mothers.\n\nThis amendment will victimize these women, taking advantage of their crises, and leaving brokenness in its wake. The people ultimately promoting this will profit from this human brokenness.\n\nHumans will die. Women and men will be left broken and wounded. And none of it is necessary.\n\nVote no on Amendment 4. If you are pro-life, you must be proactive. You must equip yourself to speak for life. There is no neutral.\n\nKevin Pierce, Port St. Lucie\n\nBiden's bad on spending, immigration\n\nI consider myself to be a person with common sense. I read letters to the editor in every issue of this publication. It blows my mind that people consistently write opinions that defend what Joe Biden has done for our country.\n\nI have children in their twenties who can only hope to one day be able to own their own homes and be able to afford children of their own. Spend more money is his answer to every issue that comes up.\n\nThe final straw for me is his claim that he wants to fight the immigration crisis at our southern border but needs the money to do it. He weakened our border the day he took office with the stroke of his pen, undoing what Donald Trump had used to make our border as secure as it had been in years.\n\nHe has the power to reverse the crisis he created at the border by using that same pen, but instead wants to burden our children and grandchildren with mountains of needless debt.\n\nJim Wilson, Port St. Lucie\n\nImagine giving residents freedom to pick Three Corners plan\n\nJohn Lennon well said it: “Imagine.\" Maybe that is just what we should do. Imagine, if the ultimate fate of the Three Corners site was not determined by several profit-seeking outside developers. Imagine, if several verbose, non-city resident columnists fostered ultimate determination directly by city residents. Imagine.\n\nIn this era of electronic data-gathering capability, a determination of direction can be made in an ultimate and direct survey that gets to the core of what matters, by true residents of our city. A survey that results in direct input by the people that will be directly affected by the ultimate decision and not those outsiders/columnists with their own financial/personal agendas.\n\nFurther, the input of those organizations servicing critical community and social needs should be solicited. Yes, those organizations that struggle to service and support the not-so-financially endowed, the aged, the disabled, the homeless, those families struggling to find affordable housing, etc.\n\nDo we really need more commercialization? Why? To clog our roads more? To get further outcry from the “we need more parking” crowd? To further overwhelm our medical facilities? To further drive up our living costs? Just what is the underlying driving force for more commercialization? Am I the only one missing something here?\n\nBottom line: Imagine if our leadership directed its search for our future direction, based on input from all of our city residents. Mr. Lennon was not only speaking to a past generation, his words are even more important in today's times. For us. Now.\n\nRay Grochowski, Vero Beach\n\nDeSantis shouldn't be meddling in school board politics\n\nThank you to Larry Reisman for expressing the sentiments of many and questioning Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointments, particularly that of Kevin McDonald to our school board. Both McDonald and David Dyer may have excellent qualifications, but that decision should be left to Indian River County voters in November.\n\nMr. Barefoot should have received the courtesy of a reply to his resignation.\n\nAs a retired educator, I have strong feelings that the school board should be nonpartisan. Barefoot and Peggy Jones have been targeted by DeSantis because they stood steadfast in their choice to do what is best for our students and staff during the pandemic.\n\nHow they can be portrayed as “failing to protect students from woke ideology” seems far from the truth if voters look at their history and records. Barefoot and Jones both have conservative, Republican histories.\n\nJones switched her party affiliation to \"no party affiliation\" to affirm her belief that the school board should be nonpartisan. She is an esteemed educator who understands our local schools and has worked well with Superintendent David Moore to put the district on an upswing.\n\nThere is still work to be done, and I hope that Jones will be allowed to continue by the choice of Indian River County voters who examine her qualifications rather than letting political influence from Tallahassee sway their votes.\n\nMcDonald now has the benefit of being an “incumbent.” I, for one, will be paying close attention over the next few months before the election. Let’s make the choice belong to the voters of Indian River County and not Tallahassee.\n\nPatty Garrard, Vero Beach\n\nWhen is relief coming from polluted water woes?\n\nAre we the new Love Canal? Thanks to the frequent discharges of polluted waters from Lake Okeechobee, Martin County and Lee County share the dubious distinction of being recipients of nasty waters that, as we all know, should be going south instead of east and west.\n\nAnd, like Love Canal, the problem is ongoing for years and years. Unlike Love Canal, we have not been officially treated as an environmental disaster. But we are still waiting and hoping. Army Corps of Engineers, South Florida Water Management District, Gov. Ron DeSantis and President Joe Biden ... how much longer will it be?\n\nBarbara Birdsey, Hobe Sound\n\nBiden can't be trusted to protect health care benefits\n\n“The Lord giveth with one hand and taketh away with the other.” This famous biblical quote has been illustrated many times throughout history. In the following case, it has relevance regarding President Joe Biden's administration's health care.\n\nTCPalm prints multiple articles promoting Biden’s positive healthcare policies. Yet a few Big Pharma superficial cuts involve sleight of hand. Simultaneously, Biden is cutting Medicare Advantage.\n\nThe Biden administration will cut base payments for Medicare Advantage plans by an average of 0.16 percent, despite pressure from Republicans and healthcare experts.\n\nBiden’s move would impact more than half of Medicare enrollees. Many American seniors now look to Medicare Advantage for their healthcare needs. American seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage could see their supplemental benefits or reduced cost-sharing increased by $33 a month in 2025, according to experts.\n\nChris Meekins, an analyst, said: “President Biden’s team is gambling that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries won’t realize before the election the benefits Biden’s team is causing them to lose come January 2025.”\n\nBiden may have forgotten that he sponsored a bill in 1975, when he was a senator from Delaware, that would have sunset and subsequently required review and reauthorization — or not — of federal programs, which reportedly included Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIt’s sad when the entire senior population is at risk. Former President Trump pledges to never negatively touch Social Security or Medicare.\n\nBiden's past pattern of decisions and policies reveal the opposite.\n\nPeter Degen, Port St. Lucie", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/09/09/9-11-20th-anniversary-shanksville-pa-flight-93/5776933001/", "title": "9/11 20th anniversary: Shanksville PA a town divided", "text": "SHANKSVILLE, Pa. – It is late, and Karl Glessner calls his wife. He says: I’m up at the fire hall. There’s a journalist here. He’s writing a story about 9/11. I really think you should talk to him.\n\nKarl looks at me. The journalist. I cannot hear Donna Glessner’s words, only her tone. Every sentence ends in a downward cadence. I know her answer is no. I understand. How many times can a person give and give and receive nothing in return?\n\n. . .\n\nThe terrorists drove United Flight 93 into the field at 563 miles an hour. The plane hit so hard, the ground swallowed it up. Then the FBI came, and the ATF, and the NTSB, and every other agency with a shred of jurisdiction. Thousands of people. FBI agents sat on their knees and combed the ground with their fingers. They excavated the crater down 40 feet. They removed every scrap of steel, every piece of flesh.\n\nThey tore this place apart.\n\nThen they paved it over with dirt.\n\nThen they left. The place was a jumble. It made no sense. At the top of the hill sat a junkyard. At the bottom lay two muddy ponds, remnants from an old strip mine. The crash site lay in between, just a field with no signs to mark it. Tourists came. They drove from Maine, from Virginia, from Oregon and Guatemala. They came to mourn, but they didn’t know where to look. Some prayed at the ponds, believing the plane crashed there. Others prayed at the junkyard, mistaking the broken cars for scraps of a Boeing 757.\n\nDonna Glessner decided: This is wrong. It was Sunday, and the pews of Shanksville United Methodist Church were full. Donna stood up. We must go up there, she said. Outsiders are coming, they are lost, and we must help them. That place needs a human presence.\n\nFour months after the attack, she led the first group of townspeople up the hill. Donna created a schedule, assigned each volunteer to a different time slot. That way, whenever tourists arrived, they’d meet a local guide. Nobody knew much back then, so volunteers kept it short. United Flight 93 left Newark for San Francisco at 8:42 a.m. It carried 33 passengers, seven crew, four terrorists, and 11,000 gallons of jet fuel. The terrorists took control over Cleveland. They crashed here, in a field, 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, on course for Washington, D.C.\n\nVolunteers received a three-ring binder with pictures to help visitors get their bearings. Some nights the binder wasn’t enough. It was so cold that first winter, so dark. Volunteers cradled the photo album against the steering wheel. They spun their cars around to aim downhill, marking the site of the crash with their headlights.\n\n“It was pitch black,” says Sally Ware, 71, one of Donna’s original volunteers. “There were no lights. The whole car would shake because it gets real windy up there. So I let strangers get in the car with me. I did! Ha-ha! Because you hate for them to miss it if they came all that way.”\n\nOn top of the World Trade Center, a restaurant served as a 'little UN':How people still feel its legacy today\n\nDonna kept giving. She co-chaired the commission to design a permanent federal memorial. She flew to Oklahoma City and San Francisco to see how other people remember their tragedies. She joined the oral history team, helping to collect nearly 900 interviews with FBI agents, air traffic controllers and relatives of the dead.\n\nDonna gave, and she received. She watched a beautiful memorial rise from the dusty hill. She met visitors at the crash site. They cried together. They shared the communion of pain.\n\nOther people came to take. Journalists came. They wanted Donna’s tears, every impolite detail. Where did she stand when the plane came down? Did she feel the earth shudder? Did she see the horrible things? They took Donna’s sadness. Consumed it. They used it to write their stories, then they never came back. Politicians came. Mike Pence. Joe Biden came three times. Did they look out the black windows of their black SUVs? Did they notice Shanksville’s broken sidewalks, whole sections reverting to grass? Did they fix them? No. The sidewalks look worse than ever, an embarrassment to the town.\n\nDonna Glessner still gives. She gives a lot. But over the last 20 years she’s learned: Only give to people who give back. No more freebies. No more posing for pictures with politicians — Donna seeks neither fame nor credit.\n\nNo more tears for greedy journalists.\n\nKarl Glessner hangs up the phone.\n\n“Donna says she’s done,” he tells me. “No more interviews.”\n\n. . .\n\nShanksville is home to 224 people, 100 houses, three churches, one convenience store, and the most important event of the 21st Century.\n\nThe town occupies a westerly bend in the Stonycreek River, folded into the bottomlands of high country. From Main Street, all roads lead uphill. For miles in every direction, the corn farmers and coal miners and bank managers who live in the hills depend on a system of reciprocity, a system rooted in the institutions of town. They send their kids to the consolidated school, where teachers know their students’ families five generations back. Families from town attend the United Methodist Church or St. Mark Lutheran, the old brick churches on Main Street, but families from the country stick to the Assembly of God, the newest church in town, built in 1961.\n\nWhen a barn burns, or when a tourist flips his four-wheeler at the ATV park up in Central City, everyone knows to call Shanksville’s fire department. Its volunteers are fast, well-trained and, thanks in part to donations after September 11, extraordinarily well equipped.\n\n“On 9/11, the state troopers came with the clothes on their backs. They didn’t have toothbrushes,” says Judi Baeckel, who lives across from Snida’s Corner Store, Shanksville’s geographic and emotional heart. “People were donating stuff, not just from here in Somerset County, but clear from Pittsburgh. So we all went to the fire hall to organize the stuff. We loaded it into trucks and took it up to the site. Sweatshirts and coats, too. Because it did get cold up there at night.”\n\nFor weeks, this little town supplied a city’s worth of government employees. Shanksville firefighters drove food, coffee and firewood up to the site three times a night. The effort made this western Pennsylvania town famous. Twenty years later, those institutions of reciprocity still function.\n\nBut they are frayed. The school is down to 280 students, half its enrollment from 2001. If it shrinks any further, people worry, another consolidation may be in order.\n\nThe photo of a grieving 9/11 son was unforgettable:20 years on, he recalls his mom's sacrifice\n\nDonna Glessner made her plea for volunteers to a packed church. Back then, every pastor lived in town. These days, sermons in all three churches attract about 15 people each, says Sylvia Baker, who led the Assembly of God from 1993 until she retired in July. Shanksville’s churches now have traveling pastors, who divide their time among congregations in four or five different towns. This emptying-out happened so slowly, people barely noticed. It leaves just a few people who remember Sept. 11 and have something to say about it.\n\n“There’s been a separation. There’s more distance,” says Baker, 87. “The people that were here and felt the shock and were involved the first year or two, they don’t mind talking about it. But the people who came in or grew up since then, who weren’t as affected by it? It’s not a topic of conversation.”\n\nOn the first Saturday morning of August, a U-Haul truck parked on Main Street in front of Baker’s yellow house. It left that afternoon with Baker’s possessions, bound for her daughter’s home near Pittsburgh. The truck attacked the hill, filling the valley with engine groan. Then the town fell quiet. The last resident church leader of Shanksville was gone.\n\n. . .\n\nIf the terrorists had flown the plane a few seconds longer, they’d have detonated the Shanksville school. Instead the jet crashed in a field, sending black smoke over the hemlock treeline. Children on the third floor of the school saw the plume from their classroom windows. A few adults in Shanksville saw it, too, including a woman I’ll call Mrs. P---.\n\nBefore I drove to Shanksville, I called some people in town. Few wanted to talk. Instead, everyone agreed I should call Mrs. P---. She gave so many interviews after 9/11, they said. Surely, she’d talk to me. I tried her number a few times, but the phone just rang.\n\nOn my third afternoon in Shanksville, I walk up the smooth concrete path to Mrs. P---'s house. Through the front window I see an elderly woman in the living room, sitting by a lamp. I ring the bell and wait. I ring again. The house is silent. As I walk back to the street, I see the living room shades drawn shut. The lamp is off.\n\nHow many times can a person give and give and receive nothing in return?\n\n“Everybody was proud that we had been part of something good,” says Elliott Ansell, 70, who lives a mile up the road from Mrs. P---. “It changes because they get tired of putting up with the outsiders. The outsiders, they come in, and they ‘Ooh’ and ‘Aahh.’ They make a big to-do, and then they leave. And they really never cared about us.”\n\nI called Terry Shaffer. He didn’t pick up, either. In New York City and Washington, D.C., journalists covering the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon called the mayor’s office, the governor’s office, the Department of Defense, the FBI, the White House. Each bureaucracy had staffs of people paid to speak with the press. In Shanksville, everybody called Terry Shaffer. As Shanksville’s fire chief on 9/11, he was the only person in town who knew what was happening at the crash site and was allowed to talk about it. Those early stories served as a road map for the next 20 years, pointing future waves of journalists to Shaffer’s door.\n\nI ring the bell and wait. Shaffer opens the door. He says nothing. My arrival annoys him, but it does not surprise him. This is the first full sentence he says: “I think you’ll find a good many of the town people just want to get on with their lives.”\n\nThrough the open door I see Shaffer’s grandchildren in the living room, playing. He does not invite me inside. Rather he steps forward, latches the door behind him, and takes a seat on the porch. He describes the journalists who bushwhacked uphill those first few days, when the smell of death hung heavy in the woods. They tried to evade the state troopers and see the crater for themselves. They were arrested.\n\nShaffer's daughter and youngest son were released from school early on 9/11. When Shaffer saw them, a reporter was chasing them down the hill.\n\n“Some journalists do behave like idiots, to be very honest,” Shaffer says. “Some of them can be very obnoxious, and not care about the rest of your life. They just want what they want. They want the nitty-gritty.”\n\nI say I’m amazed he answered the door at all. Why not move?\n\n“I did move!” Shaffer says. “We built this house seven years ago. Most people don’t know where I’m at. But I have a sneaky feeling there’s people at the firehouse who rat me out.”\n\nThen Shaffer shares a dream that recurs in his mind. Just once, he says, he wants to walk into the fire hall alone, unrecognized. Nobody’s in there but his wife, his fellow firefighters, and relatives of the 40 passengers and crew who died on Flight 93. In Shaffer’s dream, he serves the families cheeseburgers and hot dogs. They sit together at a table and eat. When everyone’s satisfied, they start talking. The families lead. Whatever they want, that’s what they talk about. This is reciprocity. This feels good. It is people who experienced hell, trusting Terry Shaffer with their pain. It is Shaffer listening, showing that he cares. No politicians. No clicking cameras. No questions from journalists — can’t they see how merely their presence destroys this moment?\n\n“It would be nice to just walk in there and pay my respects. A sense of normality to my life would be good,” Shaffer says. “But I don’t know if that will ever happen. Leading up to September 11, I almost always have to deal with this.”\n\nHe waves his right hand to mean this interview. To mean me. Tomorrow, a man from The Washington Post will come to interview Shaffer with a big video camera. On Friday, it’s two reporters from Pittsburgh.\n\n. . .\n\nThe first memorial to Flight 93 was Judi Baeckel’s yard. By that first afternoon, half the town was there. From Judi’s place you could see everything. The government vehicles flooring it everywhere. The utility men stringing phone lines and power up to the site. A satellite truck from Fox News. Anderson Cooper.\n\nJudi’s son Christopher was just a freshman in high school then, but already he was popular. When he walked home, a bunch of kids followed him. Somebody put a plywood board out in the yard. People signed it with red and black markers, and wrote little notes. Our prayers are with you. God Bless Everyone. The board filled up within hours, so someone got another. Then another. And another.\n\nIt doesn’t sound like much, now. But in those first hours, it was all that anybody in Shanksville had. So that’s what they gave.\n\nWhen the government left, the signature boards moved up to the crash site. A chain-link fence was erected, and the boards were lashed to the fence with wire. Donna Glessner’s volunteers were happy. The boards offered a little protection from the wind.\n\n'I still get letters':How Thomas Franklin shot the famous 9/11 photo\n\nGradually the people of Shanksville imposed their rule on the place: Take what you need. Give what you can.\n\nNobody said this out loud. You just knew. Tourists left teddy bears and ribbons, police service patches, flags, blue plastic flowers, black stone markers, wooden crosses, hand-carved angels bolted to steel stakes, a flight attendant uniform, a firefighter jacket, a leather biker vest, T-shirts, baseball hats, fishing poles. One license plate just read JESUS.\n\n“Somebody left a bowling ball,” says Sally Ware. “Just anything they had in their car that they wanted to leave and never get back.”\n\nIn those early years, people from Shanksville drove to the site all the time. Five minutes away, max. Jayne Wagner and her husband Chuck used to invite the whole family home for Sunday dinner, then leave for the site and their joint shift as tour guides.\n\nThe federal memorial rose slowly. It took years just to secure the land, 2,200 acres of homes, forest, farms and coal company tracts. The planning commission rented an outlet mall near the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and paid Karl Glessner’s construction company to build a chain link fence inside. Design proposals were hung from the fence. End-to-end, the posters stretched out for half a mile. Phase one of the memorial opened on Sept. 10, 2011, with a speech by Bill Clinton. Sarah McLachlan performed “I Will Remember You.”\n\nThe backroad entrance closed. To see the crash site now, a person must drive a big loop: five miles north from Shanksville to the Lincoln Highway, then another four miles back on the memorial’s twisty main road, a drive that takes 20 minutes.\n\n“We used to go up to the temporary memorial all the time,” says Jannah Slade, who was 11 when the plane came down. “But since they changed the entrance you don’t really see that anymore. I haven’t been up to the new one. We don’t feel connected to it.”\n\nAt the memorial on a summer afternoon, purple thistle, pink crown vetch and white lily pads of Queen Anne’s Lace hem the switchbacks from the visitor’s center down to the crash site. Jays and black-capped chickadees burst from the weeds. The path empties onto a broad black sidewalk bound by a low wall of black concrete. Beyond that a field, some deer, and a boulder that marks the site of impact. The only sound is the wind spinning the hemlock leaves. A jetliner cruises safely and very far overhead.\n\nThe story, asphyxiated from so many tellings, regains its breath. Forty hostages. Four terrorists, outnumbered, let the passengers use their phones. Their families relay the news. The towers are burning. Your plane is not going to land. You are riding a missile. United Flight 93 is twenty-seven minutes from the United States Capitol. The passengers and crew make a plan. Twenty-six minutes. They will fight. They will re-take the plane. Locked inside the cockpit, two hijackers hear the hostages attack. They roll the plane across its wings, sweeping the passengers off their feet. The attack continues. The hostages reach the cockpit door. The terrorists have orders. They must not lose control. If they are unable to reach their target, they must crash the plane.\n\nThey flip the plane on its back to commence the dive. Out the cockpit window, the view turns from blue to green. An air traffic controller in Cleveland watches Flight 93 disappear from primary radar. Shanksville trembles. A black cloud rises above the treeline.\n\nLater, in town, I tell people my impression of the memorial. It’s solemn, I say. Reverent. Terry Shaffer agrees. He likes it a lot, especially when it’s quiet.\n\nOthers, mostly young people and those who never volunteered at the site, politely but firmly disagree.\n\n“A gift shop in the visitors' center? People died up there,” says Jill Shubik, 36. “I dunno. I think it’s gross.”\n\nOthers dislike the memorial’s grandiose scale. So many acres of productive land excised from the local economy. Families who raised children on that land had to sell their homes and move, one reason for declining enrollment at Shanksville’s school.\n\n“They took all these acres of tax base, and the rest of us have to suck it up,” says Robert Snyder, who co-owns Snida’s Country Store. “I know that might sound terrible. But they don’t pay school taxes. They don’t pay nothing. Basically they cut Shanksville out of it.”\n\n“Exactly,” says Leigh Snyder, who is Robert Snyder’s wife and Jayne Wagner’s daughter. “They cut us out.”\n\nThere it is. There lies the heart of this resentment. When the government investigation ended and the state troopers went home, the people of Shanksville took it upon themselves to hold things together. They led the tours. Their aesthetic — improvised, handmade, heartfelt — became the memorial’s aesthetic. The town’s story of loving reciprocity merged with the passengers’ heroism and their families’ grief to become one story, the full story of this place.\n\nThe federal memorial makes little mention of Shanksville’s sacrifice. And its design — smooth, black, restrained — leaves no room for reciprocity.\n\nMost outsiders love it, Sally Ware says. Most people in Shanksville want nothing to do with it.\n\n“I saw the old one. I don’t need to see the new one,” says Robin Lambert, whose father Bobby was among the first from Shanksville to reach the crater on Sept. 11. “We’re no part of it anymore. Our poor fire department, what they did on that site. And now up at the memorial, they want nothing to do with us.”\n\nThis fate was not imposed, and that makes it worse. Donna Glessner had a big say in the design, along with Terry Shaffer, his wife, and a few others. The process was open to anyone from Shanksville willing to devote the time.\n\n“Everybody got to have their say and sit on committees if they wanted to,” Shaffer says.\n\nHe knows that many people in town dislike the result. He doesn’t bring it up. Neither do they.\n\n“The memorial has divided the town,” says Gloria Black. “We don’t discuss it. Some people support the permanent memorial. I won’t go up there. We was the ones that took care of the families. Our firemen worked up there for months. And what do we get for it? To me, they kicked us in the teeth.”\n\n. . .\n\nChris Baeckel is now the mayor of Shanksville.\n\nHe volunteered with the fire department until college, work and family consumed too much of his time. Now he coaches the junior varsity basketball team. He tries to attend most school board meetings. For an hour before the parade, Baeckel also serves as the neighborhood babysitter. He is joined in his backyard by three girls, two boys and four puppies, all of whom yip around and ignore his commands.\n\n“Hope, you have to use the bathroom before we go to the parade,” Baeckel says.\n\n“No!” says Hope Belsterling, 6. “You’re not the boss, Chris!”\n\nBaeckel laughs.\n\n“Why do you laugh at everything I say?” Hope says. She sticks out her tongue.\n\n“Everybody thinks you’re funny because you’re the little girl who likes to yell at the mayor,” says Bella Tweardy, 12.\n\nBaeckel isn’t the only young parent raising kids in Shanksville. If the trend continues, maybe Shanksville will have enough children to save the school, enough adults to save the fire department.\n\n“There’s a bunch of younger families moving in,” says the mayor. “I think it’s gonna start turning around.”\n\nAfter the parade comes the picnic. Country people drive to the park by the school; people from town mostly walk. As they arrive, Karl Glessner stands in the pavilion, peeling potatoes. Then he is called to empty a trash can. A trailer of ponies arrives, but their handlers are short a helper. Glessner goes looking for a volunteer pony wrangler. Next he walks to the dairy barn to fix the lights. Another volunteer needs a break, so Glessner jumps in to run the pig races. This entails switching on the batteries of 10 pink stuffed pig toys, raising the starting gate, and tracking the little robots as they waddle down the wooden track.\n\nJessica Sheeler gives a dollar to her daughter Lexi, age 4. Lexi bets her money on pig number two. Glessner raises the gate. The race takes a while. After a slow start, pig number two drops headfirst into the plastic bag, taped to the end of the track. Lexi wins. She points at the stuffed animals hanging above Glessner’s head.\n\n“I want a black bear!” she says. “Hee-hee! I finally have a black bear in my room!”\n\nKarl Glessner is 70. Recently he retired as the owner of Stonycreek Builders Supply. Now he works part-time for the shop’s new owner, plus his second job as the fire department’s treasurer.\n\n“It takes 20 or 25 hours a week to do it right,” he says of the volunteer work.\n\nDonna Glessner approaches her husband. She looks stressed. I pretend not to know who she is; she pretends not to see me.\n\n“We’re almost out of ketchup — the little packets,” she says. “People are taking so much! We only have one handful left.”\n\nDonna opens her fist to show the last of the ketchup, balled up in a plastic bag. Karl looks surprised. He leaves to find some money, then someone to drive to the Dollar General store. It’s so hot. Karl sees me sweating, and hands me a bottle of water. On the house, he says. I walk to the pavilion and buy a plate of chicken and French fries. It costs $9, so I give 10. Keep it, I say.\n\nA dollar doesn’t matter, but the principle is important. People in Shanksville give so much. I wish to take nothing more.\n\nDonna returns to running the kitchen. A young acoustic band plays old Christian hymns. People buy French fries and raffle tickets. All proceeds go to the fire department. The town is sewn together by a net of reciprocity. It is torn. May it be mended.\n\nFollow NorthJersey.com columnist Christopher Maag on Twitter: @Chris_Maag\n\n'Don't stop the siren':Newly unearthed scanner audio reveals early hours of Attica prison riot", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/ai-art-fair-winner-controversy/index.html", "title": "AI won an art contest, and artists are furious | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nJason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now, his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.\n\nIn August, Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image, titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”), was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.\n\n“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it,” Allen, 39, told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.\n\nIn August, Jason M. Allen's piece \"Théâtre D'opéra Spatial\" — which he created with AI image generator Midjourney — won first place in the emerging artist division's \"digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography\" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. Courtesy Jason M. Allen\n\nAllen’s winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.\n\nThe definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.\n\nMidjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord, while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation, and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.\n\nThe newness of these tools, how they’re used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.\n\nThis came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.\n\n“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics,” one Twitter user wrote.\n\n“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’,” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”\n\nYet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.\n\n“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions,” he said.\n\nYou can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds, but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.\n\nFirst, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said. Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.\n\nAllen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.\n\n“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it,” Allen said.\n\nCal Duran, an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition, said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney, he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still, he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category, he said, calling it a “beautiful piece”.\n\n“I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way,” he said.\n\nAllen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-fast-facts/index.html", "title": "Volodymyr Zelensky Fast Facts | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nHere’s some background information about the life of Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine.\n\nPersonal:\n\nBirth date: January 25, 1978\n\nBirth place: Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine\n\nBirth name: Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky\n\nFather: Oleksandr Zelensky, computer science professor\n\nMother: Rimma Zelenska, engineer\n\nMarriage: Olena (Kiyashko) Zelenska (2003-present)\n\nChildren: Oleksandra and Kyrylo\n\nEducation: Kyiv National Economic University, law, 2000\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nOther Facts:\n\nFormer comedian, actor, writer and producer.\n\nHis best known role was in the television series “Servant of the People.” He played a destitute schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes president of Ukraine after video of his anti-corruption rant goes viral.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Zelensky's unorthodox path to leading and inspiring Ukraine 03:05 - Source: CNN\n\nTimeline:\n\n1990s - Forms a comedy troupe with college friends called Kvartal 95.

Among the victims, who range in age from 20 to 86, were people grocery shopping, a heroic former police officer who tried to stop the gunman, a long-term substitute teacher and a taxi driver who “took pride in helping people.”\n\n“This was pure evil,” Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said, calling the shooting a “straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community.”\n\nThe US Department of Justice is investigating the shooting “as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism,” according to Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nPayton S. Gendron of Conklin, New York, has been charged with first-degree murder, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said in a May 14 news release. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nOn June 1, a grand jury returned a 25-count indictment against Gendron. He is facing 10 counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of second-degree murder as a hate crime and three counts of attempted murder as a hate crime, according to court documents. Gendron is also facing a charge of domestic terror and a weapons charge, according to court documents.\n\nGendron pleaded not guilty to the 25-count indictment, his attorney said in court Thursday afternoon.\n\nGendron’s defense attorney told CNN on May 17 he would not issue a statement now.\n\nHere’s what we know about the suspect.\n\nHe planned to ‘continue his rampage,’ police say\n\nWhen the suspect arrived at the store around 2:30 p.m., he was heavily armed, wearing tactical gear – including a tactical helmet along with plated armor, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said – and had a camera that was livestreaming his actions.\n\nHe used an assault weapon, Flynn said during a news conference.\n\nThe suspect shot four people outside of the grocery store, three fatally, Flynn said in his news release. When he entered the store, he exchanged fire with an armed security guard, who authorities said was a retired Buffalo police officer. The security guard died of his injuries. The suspect shot eight more people in the store, six of whom died, the release said.\n\nConfronted by police, the suspected shooter took off some of his tactical gear and surrendered, per Buffalo police.\n\nThe suspect planned to continue his shooting rampage beyond the Tops supermarket, Gramaglia told CNN on Monday, saying there was “some documentation” he allegedly planned to target “another large superstore.”\n\n“There was evidence that was uncovered that he had plans, had he gotten out of here, to continue his rampage and continue shooting people,” he said.\n\nThe suspect made very disturbing statements describing his motive and state of mind following his arrest, an official familiar with the investigation told CNN. Those statements were clear and filled with hate toward the Black community, with the alleged shooter making it known he was targeting Black people, the official said.\n\nThe alleged shooter was “studying” previous hate attacks and shootings, investigators have learned via search warrants and other methods.\n\nThe suspect was in Buffalo on Friday, the day before the shooting, per Gramaglia, who said he was doing reconnaissance at the store.\n\nShonnell Harris Teague, an operations manager at the store, saw him Friday afternoon at the store and told him to leave because it appeared he was bothering customers, she told ABC News.\n\nHarris Teague saw the suspect sitting on a bench outside with a camper bag on his back, wearing the same camouflage clothing he wore Saturday, she told ABC. After being asked to leave, he did so without argument, she said.\n\nHer brother, the Rev. Tim Newkirk, backed up the account, noting the suspect “was in there posing as a beggar and was looking for change,” he told The Buffalo News.\n\n“She had to politely escort him out. They have a no peddling policy in the Tops, no panhandling,” Newkirk said, “so she was just letting him know that this was not the place where you do that.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Buffalo pastor on shooting: We have to resist the impulse to forget 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\nHe spent months plotting his attack, social media posts show\n\nGendron is believed to have visited Buffalo in early March, Gramaglia said Monday, citing the suspect’s “digital footprint.” Social media posts analyzed by CNN reveal the suspect visited the Tops store in March and had been extensively planning his attack for several months up until the day of the shooting.\n\nAccording to the posts – which Gendron originally shared on Discord, then on the hate-filled online forum 4Chan – the suspect drove March 8 to the supermarket in Buffalo.\n\nThe posts were made visible to a small group of people about 30 minutes before the shooting began, according to a statement from Discord.\n\nGendron wrote in the posts that he went into Tops Market three times during his visit: at 12 p.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. He wrote about activity inside the store each time he went in – noting how many Black and White people were in the market and also drawing a map of the inside of the store.\n\nDuring his 4 p.m. visit, Gendron was approached by a “Black armed security guard” who asked the suspect what he was doing going in and out of the store, he wrote. The shooter told the security guard he was collecting “consensus data,” according to the posts.\n\n“In hindsight that was a close call,” Gendron wrote.\n\nIn a post on March 10, Gendron wrote, “I’m going to have to kill that security guard at Tops I hope he doesn’t kill me or even hurt me instantly.”\n\nThe shooter wrote about how he planned his attack for March 15 but then delayed it several times.\n\nIn the posts, Gendron cites online research in choosing Buffalo as his site of attack – saying the 14208 ZIP code in Buffalo has a higher Black population than the other locations he was considering.\n\nThe shooter considered attacking a church or an elementary school but ultimately chose the supermarket because of the number of people that go to grocery stores, he wrote.\n\nHe referred to Google’s “popular times” graph for the Tops Friendly Market in determining the time he would plan his attack – so the grocery store would be busiest.\n\nDiscord said that a “private, invite-only server” was created by the suspect and that “approximately 30 minutes prior to the attack,” a small group of people was invited to and joined the server.\n\n“Before that, our records indicate no other people saw the diary chat log in this private server,” it said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families,” the company said. “Hate has no place on Discord and we are committed to combating violence and extremism. We are continuing to do everything we can to assist law enforcement and the investigation remains ongoing.”\n\nCNN asked the Discord spokesperson when the company became aware of Gendron’s posts and if any of the individuals who were invited to view his private server alerted moderators to the content but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nCNN also reached out to 4Chan asking about Gendron’s posts being shared on the platform but has not heard back.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It is White supremacy': CNN speaks to son of Buffalo massacre victim 03:06 - Source: CNN\n\nDocument talks about ‘dwindling size’ of White population\n\nInvestigators are sifting for clues in a 180-page document attributed to Gendron and posted online, Flynn said. The purported “manifesto” allegedly was written by the suspect, officials have said.\n\n“We are obviously going through that with a fine-toothed comb and reviewing that for all evidence that may lead us to besides the manifesto itself,” prosecutor Flynn told CNN.\n\n“All the evidence that we ascertain from that manifesto, from wherever that manifesto leads us, other pieces of evidence we already had, we can then use that and develop more charges potentially,” he added.\n\nThe document, independently obtained by CNN shortly after the attack and before authorities released the suspect’s name, is allegedly written by a person claiming to be Payton Gendron confessing to the attack.\n\nThe author attributes the internet for most of his beliefs and describes himself as a fascist, a White supremacist and an anti-Semite.\n\nThe author bought ammo for some time but didn’t get serious about planning the attack until January, per the document. The author also writes about his perceptions of the dwindling size of the White population and claims of ethnic and cultural replacement of Whites.\n\nThe suspect allegedly chose to attack the Tops store in Buffalo because it was in a majority-Black ZIP code within driving distance of where he lived, and he researched what time it would be busiest, according to the document.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Stelter: Shooting is 'replacement theory' rearing its ugly head again 05:04 - Source: CNN\n\nHe’s from a town hours away from Buffalo\n\nThe ZIP code that includes the store, 14208, is 78% Black – the highest percentage of Black population of any ZIP code in upstate New York – per the Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey. Conklin, where the suspect is from, is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Buffalo.\n\nGendron’s parents were not known to hold extremist views, according to two New York residents who have worked with his parents at the state Department of Transportation and who shared their views on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\n“I never thought of the family as racist or hateful,” said one coworker, who said she was heartbroken for the victims’ families as well as Payton’s parents, Pam and Paul. “I can’t wrap my head around this tragedy.”\n\nPayton Gendron talks with his attorney during his arraignment Saturday in Buffalo City Court. Mark Mulville/AP\n\nGendron was a worker at the local Conklin Reliable Market for about four months before he left about three months ago, the store’s owner said, adding he was very quiet and left on his own terms, giving two weeks’ notice.\n\nGendron’s mother regularly would walk in the neighborhood, neighbors said. She was a nice woman, one said, adding they “never would have thought that in a million years” Gendron would have racist views. “It’s pretty shocking,” the neighbor added.\n\nWhen you talked to Payton Gendron, “you wouldn’t get more than a word or two” from him, another neighbor said.\n\nGendron’s former classmates said while he could sometimes be a loner and “odd,” he wasn’t known to be violent.\n\n“I just don’t understand what convinced him to do this,” said Bryce Gibbs, who said he attended elementary through high school with Gendron and described him as “nice.”\n\nHe made ‘generalized threat’ at high school\n\nGendron made a “generalized threat” in June while he attended Susquehanna Valley Central High School in Conklin, Gramaglia said Sunday, adding the threat was not racially motivated.\n\nState police took the student for a mental health evaluation, Gramaglia said at a Buffalo news conference. After a day and a half, he was released.\n\nThe suspect was visited last year by New York State Police after he did a high school project about murder-suicides, Garcia told CNN on Monday. Concerns about alleged mental health issues “were brought to light” after he turned in the post-graduation project, the sheriff said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I'm sad, I'm hurt, I'm mad': Buffalo reacts to racially motivated shooting 01:25 - Source: CNN\n\nState police spokesperson Beau Duffy said that on June 8, 2021, state police officers responded to the high school to investigate a report that a 17-year-old student made a threatening statement. The student was taken into custody under NYS Mental Health Law section 9.41 and transported to a hospital for a mental health evaluation.\n\nDuffy confirmed it was an evaluation and not an involuntary commitment – so it would not have prevented the suspected shooter from purchasing or possessing a gun under federal law.\n\nState police were unable to confirm how long the person was in the hospital or the findings of the evaluation. The agency also refused to name the then-17-year-old.\n\nThe suspect addressed the incident in posts on Discord later shared on 4Chan, writing in a post-dated January 30 that he “had to go to a hospital’s ER because I said the word’s ‘murder/suicide’ to an online paper in economics class.”\n\n“I got out of it,” the suspect claims, “because I stuck with the story that I was getting out of class and I just stupidly wrote that down. That is the reason I believe I am still able to purchase guns.”\n\n“It was not a joke,” the post reads, “I wrote that down because that’s what I was planning to do.”\n\nThe suspect goes on to claim his mental health evaluation lasted only 15 minutes after he spent hours waiting in the emergency room. CNN has reached out to New York State police about this account.\n\nBroome County District Attorney Michael Korchak, the district attorney in the suspect’s hometown, is reviewing “all aspects” of last year’s investigation into the threat and also “going back several years” to understand the suspected shooter’s behavior and relationships with family, teachers and other students.\n\nBut it’s “hard to say” whether more should have been done in June, Korchak told CNN.\n\n“Unfortunately this is nothing new in the criminal justice system,” Korchak said. “Individuals that have mental health issues may have it under control for a period of time, and then one day they just snap and things as tragic as this happen.”\n\nInvestigators are talking to the suspect’s parents and they are being cooperative, Korchak said.\n\nGun was legally purchased, governor says\n\nThe gun used in the mass shooting was purchased legally in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN earlier, describing the weapon as an AR-15. It’s believed the high-capacity magazine was purchased out of state, the governor added.\n\nIn addition to the AR-15, Gendron had a rifle and a shotgun in his car, Gramaglia said. The online diatribe attributed to Gendron said he planned to bring those same three types of guns with him that day.\n\nHere’s how the suspect legally obtained guns\n\nThe “main firearm” Gendron planned to use was a Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle that he bought from Vintage Firearms, a gun store in Endicott, New York, before “illegally modifying it,” according to the diatribe. Gendron passed a background check before he bought the gun and he didn’t stick out among his other customers, Vintage Firearms owner, Robert Donald, told The New York Times; no one at the store has responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nGendron also bought a Mossberg 500 shotgun from Pennsylvania Guns and Ammo, a store in Great Bend, about a 10-minute drive across the state border from his hometown of Conklin, the racist document attributed to him states.\n\nThe suspect passed a background check at the store and legally purchased the shotgun in December 2021, the store owner, who did not want his name used, told CNN. The shotgun was not used in Saturday’s shooting.\n\nThe third gun was a Savage Axis XP rifle that Gendron’s father bought for him for Christmas in 2020 “so that I could go hunting without borrowing my cousin’s guns,” the document states.\n\nThe racist statement also says the shooter planned to use the shotgun and rifle to shoot other Black people on the street as he drove away from the supermarket.\n\nCNN obtained a photo of two long guns allegedly brought to the scene. The photo was confirmed by two law enforcement sources.\n\nA photo of two long guns allegedly found in the suspect's car, according to law enforcement sources. CNN\n\nThe image shows the weapons inside a car, which was found by law enforcement after the suspect’s arrest, according to one of the law enforcement sources. The weapons were not used in the shooting. Writing appears all over the weapons, including the phrase “White Lives Matter” and names including what appears to be the name of a victim of a crime allegedly committed by a Black suspect.\n\nOther notations seized by investigators reflect the racist beliefs of the shooter, as well as his obsession with mass killing, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nHe allegedly livestreamed on Twitch\n\nThe shooting suspect used the popular livestreaming platform Twitch to stream a live broadcast during the attack, the company confirmed Saturday.\n\nThe company was “devastated” to hear about the shooting, it said, adding the user “has been indefinitely suspended from our service, and we are taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content.”\n\nCNN obtained a portion of the livestream showing the alleged shooter pulling up to a Tops store.\n\nThe video is recorded from the point of view of the alleged shooter as he drives into the supermarket’s parking lot. The person is seen in the rearview mirror wearing a helmet and is heard saying, “Just got to go for it,” before he pulls into the front of the store.\n\nIn the video, store patrons can be seen walking through the parking lot as the suspect drives up.\n\nThe company removed the livestream less than two minutes after the violence started, a spokesperson for Twitch said. The company did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether the suspect was firing when the livestream was halted.\n\nHe will likely face more charges\n\nThe suspect pleaded not guilty to one count of first-degree murder Saturday evening before Buffalo City Court Chief Judge Craig Hannah, according to the judge and the district attorney’s news release. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, the release said.\n\nGendron’s attorney’s request for a mental health forensic examination was withdrawn, Flynn said. Gendron remains on suicide watch, Garcia said, and in custody without bail.\n\nThere may be more charges coming, officials said.\n\n“My office is working closely with the US Attorney’s Office and our partners in law enforcement into potential terrorism and hate crimes. This is an active investigation and additional charges may be filed,” Flynn said.\n\nGendron is set to return to court Thursday morning for a felony hearing, the release said.\n\nHe is likely the “most highly visible incarcerated individual” in the country, Garcia told CNN on Monday. There are video cameras in his cell, and he remains under a sheriff’s deputy’s watch at all times.", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Christina Maxouris Dakin Andone Samantha Beech Amir Vera", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Samantha Beech", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/11/24/whats-your-fave-album-every-year-your-life/73694002/", "title": "What's your fave album — for every year of your life?", "text": "Chris Shields\n\nclshields@stcloudtimes.com\n\nI find it is good policy to give credit where it is due. I saw some of my Facebook friends naming their favorite albums for every year they've been alive. Cool, right? You can get neat ideas from social media.\n\nThen I saw some other folks start joining in. And before long, I was seeing Facebook groups getting into it. In a very short time, it seemed to become a minor viral event.\n\nAnd it got me thinking about my favorite albums, from 1980 to 2015. Boy, it is difficult. Some years had so many fantastic albums. Other years, well ... Yeah, they were easier.\n\nIt took me a while. I had to look at charts, I looked for lists of album releases. You wouldn't believe how incomplete and patchy they can be. You have to be a detective to start piecing things together just to make a list that doesn't completely overlook genres like country, hip-hop and some alternative albums.\n\nAfter I'd made my list, I was kind of surprised at how relatively predictable it was. But you know what, we like what we like. I make no apologies for the music I love.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nI started thinking about how this would make a great column. That I could talk about each album, discuss why it made the cut, do a miniature review for each one.\n\nThen I started to face some realities. There are 36 albums on this list. If I did two paragraphs for each one, I'd have this massive story that would eat up too much real estate in the print world. And for online, I'd feel like I'd only brushed on things and would want desperately to build on it.\n\nThus, inspiration led to a special project. I allowed myself to really stretch out and tackle this idea in a special online presentation. It is too large for print, so the Times won't be reproducing it in the newspaper.\n\nWith this special package, you'll get my album reviews, with some album art and a video for each. Yup, I just might eat up your afternoon. Or maybe you'll want to space it out over the weekend.\n\nAnd I want to stress that this is about favorite albums, not best albums. In some cases, you'll often find that there's a superior artistic expression, or a more controversial or critically acclaimed work in the mix ... but it doesn't trump an album that you just like better, for whatever reason. To thine own self, be true.\n\nIn any event, I enjoyed seeing so many people get into this idea on Facebook. And I want to give special props to a musician, music fan and music columnist who I feel fortunate to consider a friend. Thanks, Jon Hunt, for being one of the sparks that got me launched on this project. Music you love is always best shared with people you enjoy.\n\nAfter reading my picks, maybe you would enjoy making your own list. Maybe this will give you some ideas. Or heck, maybe this is a good conversation starter as you get together with your families for the holidays. Maybe it'll make some fun office talk. \"Say, what was your favorite birth-year album?\" For you, my fellow music fans, I hope you have a ball. You may agree with some of the picks, you may disagree, you'll no doubt have your own thoughts. Share them! Let's jaw a bit about our favorite music.\n\nAnd with that, let's get to the fun. I hope you enjoy it, and that it inspires you to think about your favorite music over the years.\n\nThis is the opinion of music enthusiast and audio addict Chris Shields. Contact him at clshields@stcloudtimes.com and follow him on Twitter @clshields1980. Read more of his columns at www.sctimes.com/cshields.\n\nWhen I listen to music, I hear details that make a difference, that leave a mark. If a song isn't particularly amazing in terms of songwriting or construction, genuine feeling and zeal can still elevate it. Take \"Tutti Frutti\" for instance. There's a great hook to it, but what sells it? Little Richard's vocal investment. \"A wop bop a loo bop,\" indeed.\n\nBob Dylan's \"Saved,\" if nothing else, is a triumph of conviction. And by nothing else, I only mean that some will dismiss it for the direction of the content. As the middle of the \"Born Again\" albums (sandwiched between \"Slow Train Coming\" and \"Shot of Love\"), \"Saved\" often gets ignored. \"Slow Train Coming\" has great songs, sounds great and was something new as Dylan \"reinvented\" himself yet again. And \"Shot of Love\" features \"Every Grain of Sand,\" one of Dylan's finest songs.\n\nConviction, I say, and conviction I mean. Listen to Dylan's voice. His earnestness. He is invested in these songs. His passion was righteous, the words and beliefs sincerely conveyed. The gospel stylings he encourages and invests into album opener \"A Satisfied Mind\" gets things going. Hums and affirmations abound, and show that Dylan really is identifying with this sound, with these feelings.\n\nAt the time of release, Dylan often spoke of his belief that Jesus' return was nigh, that the end times were upon us and that any moment we'd face Armageddon. There's fear, there's guidance, strong declarations of faith and stirring warnings in this music. And you'd better believe that Dylan puts everything he has into this album. He sounds so committed, you can't help but believe the dedication. It's potent stuff, no matter your religious outlook.\n\nYou don't have to share the beliefs to appreciate the sincerity, or even to be moved by the outpouring of faith. You'll get portions of devotion and grace with condemnation and hellfire. And Dylan tends to work some magic when he is properly motivated. Considering the uneven quality of Dylan's 1980s albums, it is worth noting the high quality with which he started the decade.\n\nI think one reason \"Saved\" gets little love is that it tends to go unrepresented in compilations, and the period hasn't really gotten any love in the \"Bootleg Series\" collection so far. But some artists don't work well in a \"greatest hits\" or \"best of\" situation. In Dylan's case, there are precious few actual \"hits\" but so many high-quality compositions and performances. So maybe \"Saved\" also gets lost in the shuffle because of so many wonderful records. But with such great songs as \"Pressing On\" and \"In the Garden\" among the tracks, this is an album that really deserves reappraisal. This material is inspired, his performances top notch.\n\nI know, I know, reading about and listening to \"Christian music\" isn't always the cool thing to do. But I encourage you to listen to Dylan's take on the gospel/faith genre. When he tackled this material, it wasn't to tap into a solid commercial base. If anything, it put him on dangerous financial grounds. The guy refused to do his best-known songs in concert and would only perform his new, Christian-aligned material. Hard to entice old and new audiences with that. But artists follow their inspirations and instincts. Even if it was a path Dylan would soon abandon (at least in a direct musical fashion), it took great courage to pursue higher truths and find spiritual, personal fulfillment.\n\nAnd it led to a great album.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1980\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBilly Joel's \"Glass Houses.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Game.\"\n\nAC/DC's \"Back in Black.\"\n\nABBA's \"Super Trouper.\"\n\nJohn Lennon & Yoko Ono's \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nSome concept albums can feel overblown. Pretentious. Bloated.\n\nAnd taken at face value, a concept album that charts the successful opening and the eventual dilapidated closing of Chicago's Paradise Theatre, and also incorporates elements to mirror the evolving social and economic realities in contemporary times, certainly sounds like it could be, er, well ... overreaching.\n\nBut it is one of those rare marvels, a single-record concept album that works AND carries the concept throughout with enjoyable music, memorable melodies and some bombastic choruses.\n\nWhen I was growing up, we had three Styx albums in the house: \"The Grand Illusion\" and \"Pieces of Eight\" on vinyl, and \"Paradise Theatre\" on cassette. And while I spent most of my time with Beatles records, hearing the bombastic and catchy-as-heck music by Styx definitely grabbed my attention.\n\nWhen my father loaned me some of his cassettes, I was curious about the \"Paradise Theatre\" tape. I recognized a couple of songs (like \"Too Much Time on My Hands,\" \"The Best of Times\" and \"Snowblind\"), but the others? Brand new. And I remember my first listen. I was sitting next to my bed, with my dad's headphones on. When \"A.D. 1928\" started up, I had to check the cassette lineup. Isn't this \"The Best of Times?\" Nope! But it established the narrative musical thread. And it segues directly into \"Rockin' the Paradise,\" a very cool li'l rock track.\n\nI'm an unabashed Styx fan. I love the pure pop confection of \"Lorelei.\" I really dig the almost Beach Boys-esque arrangement of \"Mademoiselle\" (if you think about the \"20/20\" and \"Sunflower\" era of the Beach Boys, maybe you'll dig where I'm coming from). I think that all members of the band, but most especially Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw and James Young, were able to tap into a spirit that is so American — bold, brash, occasionally dramatic but with an embrace for the good things in life. And \"Paradise Theatre,\" a No. 1 album for the group, should have helped establish the group's legacy in American music. And maybe it did, for those listeners who don't get too hung up on what's \"hip.\"\n\nBut maybe the album is better known for its controversy. If you Google backward messages and Styx, I'm sure you'll find everything you'd want to know about the Parents Music Resource Center and the allegations of satanic messages in the music, particularly \"Snowblind.\" It's a fun story, popular, but it just isn't true — Styx wasn't trying to warp minds with unholy images and messages. But I'm betting the headlines didn't hurt the band get some sales from curious younger (and older) listeners.\n\nStill, Styx is Styx. Bad headlines, bad reviews, bad impressions, polarization of fans in a \"Dennis camp\" or a \"Tommy Camp,\" Styx seems to regularly find itself on the receiving end of misfortune. It's a shame. But that's where I can let the music speak for itself.\n\nUnfortunately, good music or not, some bands seem easier to dismiss. As I've written before, Styx is one of those bands people say they just don't like. But if you give them a chance, and \"Paradise Theatre\" in particular, you might just hear a few songs (or a whole album) that you'll find refreshing. Set aside popularity contests, unburden yourself of the need to diss \"uncool\" music and give yourself permission to embrace the pop-rock goodness of Styx.\n\nOr just groove to \"Rockin' the Paradise\" in the safety of your car, bedroom or office.\n\nSo, whatcha doin' tonight?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1981\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Hard Promises.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Shot of Love.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Tattoo You.\"\n\nJoan Jett & The Blackhearts' \"I Love Rock 'n Roll.\"\n\nI read about it before I ever heard the record.\n\nI'm sure I was reading a John Lennon biography and I'd gotten to the post-murder material, when reactions and tributes were discussed. No doubt there was a mention of the track \"Here Today\" on \"Tug of War,\" Paul McCartney's first album to follow Lennon's death.\n\nThe curiosity was planted. Obviously, I knew some of McCartney's solo stuff. You couldn't be a big Beatles fan like I was and not have been exposed to \"Band on the Run\" and other material. But the only connections I had to most of the \"Tug of War\" material came from some of the songs being featured in McCartney's feature film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" (though in re-recorded form).\n\nHearing the album the first time, I was struck by the variety of styles and how McCartney's gift as a tunesmith hadn't been hurt by the loss of his friend and former songwriting partner. Even the oft-mocked \"Ebony and Ivory\" holds its own (yes, the white keys and black keys on a piano might actually lead to more dissonance than harmony, but Paul and Stevie Wonder still get the noble point across).\n\nTwo of my favorites on the album, \"Wanderlust\" and \"Ballroom Dancing,\" are pure McCartney — I can't imagine anyone else writing them. \"Wanderlust\" is a cousin to \"Mull of Kintyre,\" this irresistible melody that feels somehow timeless. \"Ballroom Dancing\" more fits the mold of \"When I'm 64,\" \"Your Mother Should Know\" and \"You Gave Me the Answer.\" It's the kind of song that would appeal to moms and grandmas, but with a bouncier track. Fun for the sake of fun.\n\nAnd what can be said about \"Here Today\" that hasn't been said over the years? Paul sings to John, and he is holding back the tears no more. If you've seen Paul perform the song in concert the last several years, he often does tear up, choke up, the emotions are palpable. Paul lost a brother, a partner, a rival, an important figure in his life. The song conveys that in every possible way.\n\nReally, when it comes right down to it, there aren't any songs I dislike on \"Tug of War.\" The title track and \"Take It Away\" are pure Paul at his best. And the album's other duet with Stevie Wonder, \"What's That You're Doing,\" basically lays the groundwork for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller.\" Stevie's scatting at the end is ... odd, but fun.\n\nThere are link tracks, brief interludes. Maybe some folks would call them scraps, or would find them jarring. Me, I find them to be emotional and creative transitions.\n\n\"Tug of War\" is an album that justifies every view of McCartney as a musician, for good or bad. It stands as a synthesis of McCartney's skills as a Beatle, as a solo artist and as the leader of Wings. And \"Tug of War\" climbed to No. 1. It established itself as a classic, one that sets a standard that all following McCartney albums have had to measure against.\n\nPaul weathered the storm after Lennon's untimely death, and emerged from the darkness with an album that still stands the test of time today. He endured his own internal and external tugs of war, and came out on top. You gotta respect that.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1982\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRichard and Linda Thompson's \"Shoot Out the Lights.\"\n\nQueen's \"Hot Space.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"The Nylon Curtain.\"\n\nPrince's \"1999.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Thriller.\"\n\nYou can learn a lot about a person when you talk about favorites. And you can learn a lot about Pink Floyd fans from their favorite albums.\n\nI honestly have different favorites based on my moods. Sometimes I want \"Wish You Were Here,\" sometimes I want \"Meddle,\" sometimes I want \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" etc.\n\nBut one album that I always find myself putting on the list, at No. 1 or No. 2, is \"The Final Cut.\"\n\nThe last studio album to feature Roger Waters, \"The Final Cut\" also is the first Pink Floyd album not to credit Richard Wright as a member. Tensions were high, creative differences had forced some unpleasant ultimatums, and group members David Gilmour and Nick Mason were shunted to the side and used basically as session players. Gilmour, who'd been one of the primary vocalists of the group from 1968-1977, had seen his vocal presence (and artistic input) diminish in the group as Waters took on more of the vocals and asserted himself as the creative force of the band. On \"The Final Cut,\" Gilmour contributes some tasty guitar lines, but he only features as the lead vocal on one track: \"Not Now John.\"\n\nThe drama aside, the narrative of the album is one of the group's strongest. It builds upon themes expressed in \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"Animals\" and \"The Wall.\" The struggle to live life in a world controlled by corporate and military forces, humans treated as pawns in a global chess game, the loss of family, isolation, etc. You get it — not the cheeriest content. And how does the album end? \"Two Suns in the Sunset\" might give you all the clues you need. (No? Nuclear annihilation.)\n\nWaters' vocals are strong and expressive. The lyrics are personal, and illustrative. The album unfolds in such a cinematic fashion. And the production? Wow.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" polarizes fans. Some see it as Waters seizing ultimate control for his own glory, and attempting to tank the band. Some see it as the most powerful and focused album in the group's catalog. But with songs like \"Your Possible Pasts,\" \"The Hero's Return,\" \"The Gunner's Dream,\" \"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\" \"Southampton Dock\" and \"The Final Cut,\" it's impossible to dismiss it as artistically bankrupt.\n\nMy younger brother and I got into the album after we'd devoured \"The Wall.\" We were in our mid teens and that kind of power, that kind of imagery, that kind of angst was impossible to ignore. It was passionate. It was fearful. It was angry. And sadly, the themes of the album were still relevant. And they still are.\n\nArt endures, right? And while some of the references may have dated, the sense of betrayal to those who make the ultimate sacrifice, to the families who lose loved ones, to the people who work hard to live their lives only to have \"the powers that be\" control (and end) them, well ... I imagine many of us can understand that anger and identify with the emotional outpouring.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" may have been Waters' final work with Pink Floyd, but what a way to go. You can't ask for a better exit than this.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1983\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Police's \"Synchronicity.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"An Innocent Man.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Swordfishtrombones.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Infidels.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"Hearts and Bones.\"\n\nJohn Lennon was brutally killed on Dec. 8, 1980. He was shot outside of his home. And with his death, many of the dreams and hopes that had taken shape in the 1960s and had endured the 1970s came to an abrupt end. No possibility of a full Beatles reunion. No more collaborations with Paul McCartney. No more concerts. No more songs that were so personal and somehow universal at the same time. No more lyrical gobbledygook that captured the imagination.\n\nNo more Lennon songs.\n\nA couple weeks before his murder, Lennon had released \"Double Fantasy,\" a collaborative album with wife Yoko Ono. The album seemed to celebrate a mature outlook on life, a more domestically inclined point of view. Songs like \"(Just Like) Starting Over,\" \"Woman\" and \"Watching the Wheels\" were welcome additions to Lennon's output, and his song for son Sean — \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\" — is touching beyond words. But not everything was flowers and rainbows. \"I'm Losing You\" taps into a bit of anger and desperation, and \"Cleanup Time\" is pretty forward looking in how it was time to clear the slate and get moving again.\n\nThe album certainly set the stage for a follow up, one that could build on the positives established in \"Double Fantasy.\" And the material existed, as another album was being worked on simultaneously with \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nComing in early 1984, a full three years after Lennon's death, \"Milk and Honey\" gave fans some of the final fruits of Lennon's studio labors. And the songs on this new album were fun. Vital. Maybe even a little more scattered or casual. Obviously, the final polishing and mixing with Lennon's cooperation had never been done before his death. But the energy and off-the-cuff looseness of some of the performances make his songs on \"Milk and Honey\" easily the equals of those on \"Double Fantasy,\" and possibly even superior.\n\n\"Nobody Told Me\" may have been meant for Ringo Starr's \"Stop and Smell the Roses\" album, but Lennon's engaged vocal and the snappy arrangement make it one of my favorite late Lennon tracks. \"I'm Stepping Out\" has such a groove, and gives a few clues that Lennon's \"househusband\" role wasn't one he always embraced (just check out his vocal ad-libs near the end at the fade). \"I Don't Wanna Face It\" and \"Borrowed Time\" seem somehow ... foreboding, but without darkness or depression. It's like Lennon had a premonition that the end was near. Listen to the songs, tell me I'm wrong.\n\nAnd then there's \"Grow Old With Me.\" Oh, beautiful. Simple, and showing its home recording demo roots, the song was envisioned to become the kind of standard that people would play at weddings. It is beautiful, touching, sweet without being saccharine, and devastating considering Lennon's death.\n\nOno's contributions to \"Double Fantasy\" and \"Milk and Honey\" are pretty progressive, and show some skill. Ono will always have her detractors, but her songs work to both enhance Lennon's and also to provide artistic contrasts that may have been more commercially viable in the early 1980s than Lennon's own songs. Her talent should not be denied, nor should the loss she faced.\n\nThese albums stand as monuments to Lennon's life, his hopes for the future and for the love he had in his heart. There would be more posthumous releases, but \"Milk and Honey\" and its Lennon songs send the man off on a high note. The rock-and-roller, the guy with the mischievous twinkle in his eye, he was still there. And then he was gone.\n\nThe parting after \"Milk and Honey\" certainly was some sweet sorrow.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1984\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1984 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nVan Halen's \"1984.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Works.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"The Pros and cons of Hitch Hiking.\"\n\nSpinal Tap's \"This is Spinal Tap.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\"\n\nPrince's \"Purple Rain.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Let It Be.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Valotte.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nThe Meat Puppets' \"Meat Puppets II.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think life is just a rodeo / The trick is to ride and make it to the bell.\"\n\nKnow my first memory of John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\" album? It isn't the use of the title song at baseball games. It's of mowing.\n\nI'd been a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival's music for, well, pretty much my whole life. I can remember hearing the songs on the radio as a very young boy. One of the first cassettes I owned (a gift from my grandmother) was of CCR's \"Chronicle\" album, a great selection of the group's hits. Fogerty's voice is one of the greats in rock and roll.\n\nSo what does mowing have to do with \"Centerfield?\"\n\nI'd done some reading about Fogerty and CCR that mentioned the acrimony of the group's split. And I remember reading about the comeback that was Fogerty's 1985 album. So I got curious. I picked up a bargain bin copy of the album on cassette. I popped it into my Walkman and got on the riding lawnmower and started to mow.\n\nAnd wow! What an album. What a good, solid, punchy record.\n\nThe album starts off with a sound that is pure Creedence. \"The Old Man Down the Road\" has that classic Fogerty sneering drawl, a ridiculous guitar hook and a jumping rhythm. Apparently others thought it sounded like pure Creedence, too ... almost too pure. Fogerty was sued by the owner of Fantasy Records, the label CCR recorded for. It was alleged that Fogerty had plagiarized his own earlier work, ripping off \"Run Through the Jungle.\" Eventually the case closed in favor of Fogerty. But forget that. Just listen to the song, It cooks!\n\nAnd then there's \"Rock and Roll Girls,\" the song that opens with the lyrics I quoted at the start of this chapter. Fogerty's voice comes across so high and clear, a blast of summer sunshine and hope. \"Hey, let's go all over the world.\" It puts a rainbow in my mind, for sure.\n\nAnd of course, there's the title track. \"Centerfield\" and baseball, the song and the sport belong together. And when Fogerty performs the song in concert, he even uses a guitar shaped like a Louisville Slugger baseball bat. It's a history lesson and a vibe that all fans and participants of the sport can appreciate, can feel.\n\nThere are sounds that put this album clearly in the 1980s, but if you listen to the songs, if you listen to Fogerty as he sings and whoops, you could be forgiven for thinking this album slots in at the end of the 1960s, maybe between \"Willy and the Poor Boys\" and \"Cosmo's Factory.\" That's no faint praise, \"Centerfield\" is that solid, it's that classic sounding.\n\nSome voices in music just have the right feel. A little sandpaper here, a little smoke, the right amount of power and an absolute sense of purpose. Fogerty has one of those voices. His vocals reach you all the way out in center field, and his songwriting just tends to feel comfortable. Lived in. Real. Like an old ball glove, perfectly worn, battle tested and trustworthy.\n\nIt'll be several months until green grass pokes through and we're enjoying another season of baseball.\n\nBut that's OK. We have \"Centerfield.\" And say, do you smell something? I swear, it smells just like freshly cut grass ...\n\nHonorable mentions, 1985\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Southern Accents.\"\n\nDire Straits' \"Brothers in Arms.\"\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Dare to Be Stupid.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Rain Dogs.\"\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Psychocandy.\"\n\nWhen you hear \"Graceland,\" what's the first thought that comes to your mind?\n\nElvis Presley, maybe?\n\nI'd understand that. And hey, Elvis, the King of rock and roll. The man who inspired so many major artists of the 1960s. The swiveling hips, the curling lip. You ain't nothing but a hound dog!\n\nSo if an artist names an album \"Graceland,\" maybe you'd expect ... what? A tribute album? An album in the style of Elvis? Or at the very least, maybe a record recorded at the site?\n\nBut if you're giving Paul Simon's \"Graceland\" a spin, you aren't gonna get that. Any of that. Sure, the title track mentions Elvis' estate. The narrator (Simon) is traveling with his son. For reasons he can't explain, some part of him wants to see Graceland (in Memphis, Tennessee). But after that? Not much Big E.\n\nBut that's OK. In fact, it's more than OK. Paul Simon may have wanted to find something new. He may have wanted inspiration. He may have wanted to visit the site of Elvis' home, to try to plug into the spirit that may have once moved him, but this new album and the songs on it are a big departure. His muse took him to South Africa. Rhythms, complex vocal arrangements, energy ... \"Graceland\" has all the promise and mystery and soul one might expect from Presley's manor, but it all comes in an unexpected direction. Elvis grew up with gospel and soul music, American \"black\" music. Simon comes back with mbaqanga and isicathamiya, South African \"black\" music.\n\nYou get the parallels?\n\nOK, OK, so let's get to the music. It's fresh. It's fantastic. The record came out in 1986 and it still feels so different than what we hear so regularly on TV, radio, the Internet, etc. While the genre of \"world music\" has grown, I still don't expect that I could just spin a dial on the Minnesota AM/FM spectrum and come across Ladysmith Black Mambazo unless it is one of the \"Graceland\" songs the group sings on.\n\nDepending on who you are, that isn't necessarily a good thing. But for me? It opened my ears to different music. Not just genres, like rap or country or rockabilly. Hearing music made in different styles, with different instruments, in arrangements we wouldn't consider conventional because of our Western mindset, it was (and still is) kinda exciting.\n\nOh, \"The Boy in the Bubble.\" THE SOUND. You can be completely consumed in that track. \"These are the days of miracle and wonder,\" indeed. Then there's the title track (I just love the lyric \"the Mississippi Delta was shining like a national guitar\" ... not only because it refers to resonator guitars, but because you can also consider the Mississippi River and the music that has grown out of the blues traditions around it to be a national treasure, a national emblem).\n\nI figure just about everyone knows \"You Can Call Me Al,\" even if you haven't heard any of the other songs. And the video with Simon with Chevy Chase is pretty fun. But what about the other gems on the album? \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\" \"Under African Skies,\" \"Homeless\" and \"That Was Your Mother\" are so vital. And ... can you hear country music in the background? Is that a hint of rockabilly? Sweet lord, that guitar is cooking. Rock and roll!\n\nI guess it doesn't matter if you are visiting Elvis' Graceland or if you're just drawing inspiration from it, maybe there's something transcendent in the experience. Something motivational in the place, in the man, in his music. Maybe it takes you on a search, until you find just the right something, the right sound, the right instrument, the right collaborators. Something that encourages a kind of musical alchemy, a combination of cultures and sounds that leads to vibrant, beautiful sound.\n\nThe music hits us in different ways, takes us down different paths. The journey is what's important, and what you take from it. An appreciation of other cultures? A love for new sounds? What you find on the path is all that matters. And I've reason to believe we all will be received in \"Graceland.\"\n\nHonorable mentions, 1986\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nPeter Gabriel's \"So.\"\n\nQueen's \"A Kind of Magic.\"\n\nMadonna's \"True Blue.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys' \"Licensed to Ill.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"Deep in the Heart of Nowhere.\"\n\nYou know, I really had no idea that \"Got My Mind Set on You\" was George Harrison.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong. I know he didn't write it. But that sound, that song, that voice ... I'd heard it all over the radio. I remember hearing older kids singing bits of it when I was 9 or 10. That hook. \"I got my mind / SET ON YOU.\" Sure, now that I'm older and pay attention to things like voices, of course it's George Harrison.\n\nBut when I picked up my first copy of \"Cloud Nine,\" I really had no idea.\n\nI picked up a used copy of a CD after The Beatles' Anthology project wrapped up. I'd loved a lot of George's Beatles music, and I owned a couple of the solo albums (\"All Things Must Pass\" is an essential album, gotta have it), but I had never really made an effort to pick up his solo works.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nHere's the thing: John Lennon and Paul McCartney get all the credit for The Beatles. I get it, they were two of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, one of the most powerful songwriting partnerships. But the sound? That took the whole group. And after The Beatles broke up, Lennon went one way with his sound and McCartney went another. But Harrison? Listen to his music. I often think that George may have been the musical glue of the group. When I listen to \"Cloud Nine,\" I hear what The Beatles could have sounded like had they gotten together in 1986 to start putting a record together. The Rolling Stones had \"Dirty Work,\" and I think this sound could have easily skunked that.\n\nBut this isn't about The Beatles, It's about Harrison's last album released while he was still alive. And it is song after song of great quality. Yes, the album \"suffers\" from the 1980s production and Jeff Lynne's bright touches (as you can probably tell, I don't think the album \"suffers\" at all ... I like the lively sound).\n\nThe opening track is also the song from which the album takes its name, and I love that bass sound, the funkier feel. Starting off the album with this kind of track is brave, in that it isn't a sure-fire hook-driven ear grabber, but it is a wonderful song. Then you launch into other terrific songs. \"That's What It Takes,\" \"Fish on the Sand,\" both songs I really got into.\n\nBut the big songs? \"This Is Love\" is catchy and strident; you feel the breeze behind you. \"When We Was Fab\" recalls \"I Am the Walrus\" and certainly comes across as a tribute to the fallen Lennon. And if you don't love \"Devil's Radio,\" well ... maybe you just like your gossip too much.\n\nAnd there's the last song on the album ... \"Got My Mind Set on You.\" It has that 1980s sound, but with a real feel. The singing is true, and you buy into the music. Go on, listen. If you're not tapping your toe, bobbing your head, snapping your fingers or singing along, maybe your ears aren't working.\n\nThere would be some music released posthumously, and there was the Traveling Wilburys music as well, but \"Cloud Nine\" was the last album of original material to bear George's name while he still walked the earth. And what a joy it is, what a revelation. It feels so good, it makes you feel good. In a way, it puts you on your own cloud nine. Nice when the music lives up to its name, isn't it?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1987\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nU2's \"The Joshua Tree.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Radio K.A.O.S.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Pleased to Meet Me.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Bad.\"\n\nR.E.M.'s \"Document.\"\n\nAll things considered, I'm a relatively recent convert to Beach Boys / Brian Wilson fandom. But as happens with so many converts, I have a tremendous zeal and loyalty now that I'm in the tent.\n\nAnd when I was first digging into Brian Wilson's solo catalog, there wasn't a lot to track down. At the time, the only legitimate releases were Brian's self-titled solo debut, the \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" soundtrack, the \"Imagination\" album and his \"Live at the Roxy\" release. (The Van Dyke Parks collaboration \"Orange Crate Art\" is quite good, but Wilson contributes only vocals to it). And the only one of the bunch I could actually buy in stores at the time was \"Imagination.\"\n\nI think \"Imagination\" gets a bad rap. For me, it is one of those perfect summer albums. And I listened to it a lot in the summer of 1998.\n\nBut the summer of 1999? I spent it with Wilson's 1988 effort.\n\nIf you've seen this year's \"Love & Mercy\" film starring Paul Dano and John Cusack, it is this album that Brian is working on with Eugene Landy when Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) tries to help Wilson break free.\n\nStrip away the history and the drama (and some of that late 1980s production), and you get some pretty great songs. \"Pet Sounds '88\" might be a bit of a stretch, but it was still the finest collection at the time of Brian Wilson tunes since 1977's \"Love You\" (or 1968's \"Friends\" album).\n\nFrom 1997-99, I was hitting eBay regularly. I bought a lot of Beach Boys / Brian Wilson material (legit and bootleg). And my first copy of Wilson's debut album was an eBay purchase. I remember the excitement I had as I ripped open the mailing packaging to find the CD looking up at me. (I still dig the cover art ... I feel oceans and darkness and light in it).\n\nAs for the music: Want a timeless ballad, with a lot of spirituality and heart? You get \"Love and Mercy.\" Want a cool rock tune? \"Walkin' the Line\" (and its footstep percussion) might get you where you want to go. Want some lovely vocals and that traditional Beach Boys harmony? You have got to try \"Melt Away.\" That's three-for-three in great tunes, and all at the front of the album.\n\nIf you like something a bit more challenging, a bit more progressive, something more \"pocket symphony\" like the \"SMiLE\" music, give \"Rio Grande\" a shot.\n\nMy favorite track on the album is \"Meet Me In My Dreams Tonight.\" The arrangement, the sounds, the sleigh bells! It's Brian freaking Wilson, man! Here he is! He's still got it. And is that a little bit of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" in there? Shhhhh ... (And before I forget, I've gotta give a lot of praise to producer, musician, singer and songwriter Andy Paley for meeting the challenges, collaborating with Brian, getting the best out of him, giving Brian the immediacy and versatility he demands in the studio).\n\nWhen the album came out, it received a lot of praise from critics. And the Brian Wilson faithful rallied around it. But it was a different Beach Boys-related project that got the success. \"Kokomo\" came out and it became the sound of The Beach Boys, the song of the summer and the major hit.\n\nYou can say what you want about \"Kokomo\" (and EVERYBODY has an opinion), but none of it changes the fact that Wilson's solo debut is a work of tremendous talent and skill. It feels like an old friend. And that's because the music is from an old friend. An old friend who saw a world full of sex and violence and upheaval, and offered up a little hymn that gives everyone a little bit of what they need — a comforting helping of love and mercy.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1988\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nLeonard Cohen's \"I'm Your Man.\"\n\nKeith Richards' \"Talk Is Cheap.\"\n\nFreddie Mercury's and Montserrat Caballe's \"Barcelona.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"The Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Daydream Nation.\"\n\nMy first introduction to The Beastie Boys has nothing to do with \"Paul's Boutique.\" But we'll get to the album soon, I promise.\n\nMy introduction didn't even come from the ubiquitous \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).\" No, even that came later.\n\nI got introduced to The Beasties from the unlikely source of \"Beavis and Butt-head.\" At least, that's my memory. I remember my brother and I enjoying some parentless cable TV time and watching a \"moron-a-thon.\" And in one of the episodes, I seem to recall one of the music videos showing this really cheesy, 1970s-influenced cop schtick scene. But that music was so insistent. There was nothing schtick about it.\n\nThe song was \"Sabotage,\" and it is still one of my favorite Beastie Boys songs. But we always tend to have special feelings for our firsts, right?\n\nIt was in the later 1990s, after high school graduation, maybe even during my freshman year of college, when I heard bits of Beatles songs being worked into this, well, audio collage. What the heck is this?\n\nAnd that, my friends, was how I found \"Paul's Boutique.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys made heavy use of samplings in their music. What makes \"Paul's Boutique\" so special over many other artists and albums that feature the same technique is that The Beasties were very, very, very unfettered in their use of other people's music. And The Beatles' material had never really seen that kind of use in anything before. It maybe even led to some artists and companies to re-examine their policies and restrictions, because of lawsuits (and threats of lawsuits) from the blatant sampling.\n\n(As a brief aside: A lot of the music sampled actually did have permission given for use. But The Beastie Boys paid a lot less for the samples than would become the standard. It is unlikely you'd see people being able to sample Beatles music in such a way again, because it would be so cost prohibitive.)\n\nI don't think it'd be unfair to suggest that \"Paul's Boutique\" changed the industry and shook up hip-hop. It wasn't just in the sampling, either. There are references, musically and lyrically, that work together to create these huge messages and homages. And the variety! This isn't \"thrown in a blender and see what happens\" material. Nor is it noise, for the sake of sound. This is an elaborate aural tapestry, where everything has its place.\n\nThe lyrics are still pretty great today. Consider this material, from \"Shadrach\":\n\n\"It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it / I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic.\n\n\"For those about to rock, we salute you / The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to.\n\n\"I once was lost but now I'm found / The music washes over and you're one with the sound.\"\n\nThese guys knew what they were doing, from the sampling and to the allegations of how they were contributing to the delinquency of younger listeners, but it also revels in this music. Not just their music, but the music that came before them, the music that they use to contribute to their own sound. Ya know, if it wasn't for the rapping and sampling and the arrangements, this follows a lot of the folk tradition of appropriation.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute ...\n\nOne of the issues I see in classifying music under any kind of genre is that it is package-to-sell labeling. And if you are packaging to sell, you also are packaging to avoid. \"I don't like rap, and that is in the rap section, so I won't like it.\" Ditto country, rock, metal, etc.\n\nBut if you listen to \"Paul's Boutique,\" you get a lot of styles. It's not just hip-hop. It's not just using The Beatles or following usual hip-hop tropes of being \"bad\" or substance abuse or violence. There's complexity, sophistication. Would it go too far to say this material is literate, skilled? No. It'd be totally fair. What's even cooler is that it isn't pretentious, it isn't beating you over the head with a \"look how clever we are\" vibe. It's just, simply, great.\n\nGive The Beastie Boys their due, they were true MCs. They'd do more albums, including the \"Ill Communication\" album that features the song \"Sabotage,\" but my favorite remains \"Paul's Boutique.\" I get something new every time I listen to it.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1989\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1989 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nLou Reed's \"New York.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Prayer.\"\n\nTom Petty's \"Full Moon Fever.\"\n\nThe Cure's \"Disintegration.\"\n\nThe Stone Roses' \"The Stone Roses.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Flowers in the Dirt.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Bleach.\"\n\nDon Henley's \"The End of the Innocence.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Steel Wheels.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Oh Mercy.\"\n\nBefore I get to the actual assessment of the They Might Be Giants' album \"Flood,\" I really have to apologize.\n\nIn high school, a good friend of mine tried to get me to give the album a chance. But I was really heavily into The Beatles at the time, and I considered everything else inferior music. And not just inferior, but irrelevant.\n\nTo my friend: I am sorry.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't listen to the music with open ears. There's some fun stuff here! (\"Dead\" is one heck of a trip.) There's some serious stuff cloaked as fun stuff, too. (\"Your Racist Friend\" is some great social commentary.) There's some classic singalong goofiness. (\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" is just so oddly compelling.) There's a great cover song. (\"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" is catchy and fun, the kind to crank loudly in the car.)\n\nI'm sorry I didn't appreciate the variety. There's brevity (\"Minimum Wage\" and its whip, ha!), there's comic book hijinx (\"Particle Man\") and great grooves (\"Whistling in the Dark\").\n\nAnd I'm sorry that I was so caught up in the greatness that IS The Beatles that I couldn't appreciate that other music was also great, on its own terms. It took a while, but I got there. I learned that fun music, and pop music, and all kinds of music, are all as important and vital as anything \"serious\" or \"classic.\"\n\nSo ... about the album \"Flood.\"\n\nIt's pretty darn good. It is the kind of album you can love as a 9-year-old or as a 19-year-old or as a 29-year-old. Different jokes hit you as funnier when you have your own experiences. And some remain oddly touching. I first heard \"Particle Man\" as a boy, in an episode of \"Tiny Toon Adventures,\" the spinoff of \"Looney Tunes.\" The lyric seemed so easy, and the animation of the cartoon suited it so well. So when I hear the song today, I remember watching the cartoons with my younger brother, and I remember that video. Funny how we can be sentimental about such light fare.\n\nHow often do you laugh out loud at music that isn't parody, or that isn't strictly comedy music? Because this is real music. And it isn't all laughs and grins. It just doesn't take itself too seriously. The group, the songs, the album all have this open-door communication that is almost childlike without being childish. Sounds and textures and words that come out as these very colorful expressions.\n\nAhhhh, \"Dead.\" Coming back as a bag of groceries? How'd TMBG get there? No idea. But bless the quirkiness. Sometimes off-the-wall is just what you need. Let the world wash away for a bit with \"Flood,\" you'll come out of the album feeling refreshed.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1990\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nWilson Phillips' \"Wilson Phillips.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Vegetarians of Love.\"\n\nDread Zeppelin's \"Un-Led-Ed.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"The Rhythm of the Saints.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.\"\n\nConsidering that Freddie Mercury was dying, and that he knew he was dying, and that his bandmates knew he was dying, \"Innuendo\" could have been a very dark, very sad, very downbeat album.\n\nAnd while the album certainly has its reflective and introspective moments, songs that touch on mortality, \"Innuendo\" is one of the best Queen albums released in several years. It was the last Queen album released before Mercury's death in late 1991, and it sounds like a return to the progressive hey-days of the 1970s albums like \"Queen II,\" \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races.\" Whereas the 1980s seemed to latch on to R&B, dance music and middle-of-the-road chart pleasers (and I'm not knocking any of that), the edge and energy and charisma in the music was lacking.\n\nSongs like \"The Show Must Go On\" and \"These are the Days of Our Lives\" cannot be seen in any other context than through Mercury's impending death. But the former is active, raging at the dying of the light. \"I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in, on with the show!\" I get chills. And the latter is touching, a love song, a song that finds peace in the immutable truth that we all go someday, to enjoy the days we have. \"I still love you.\" Freddie's last four words of the song drive it home.\n\nThe title track recalls the days when the band would construct elaborate multi-section songs, like \"March of the Black Queen,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"The Prophet's Song.\" And the song, written and intended as a sort of homage to Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir,\" succeeds as a modern Queen epic. It is masterful, powerful and fabulous.\n\n\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\" seems an exercise in bizarre one-liners, and \"Delilah\" is really just a charming ode to one of Freddie's favorite cats (you won't find another song with the lyric \"And then you make me slightly mad / when you pee all over my Chippendale suite\").\n\nWant something a little more rock and roll? \"Headlong\" is more of a traditional rocker, and certainly would have made a concert staple had Mercury been healthy and the band had toured.\n\nAnd the beauty of \"Bijou\" ... rather than being a Queen track that's mostly vocal with a guitar solo, the guitar is the main presence and Freddie's vocal is the solo. And the singing and lyrics are so touching, so wonderful, that I ache every time I listen to the song:\n\n\"You and me, we are destined / you'll agree ...\n\n\"To spend the rest of our lives with each other / the rest of our days like two lovers ...\n\n\"Forever, yeah forever ...\"\n\nFreddie knew he was dying, and he puts his heart into that short lyric. It is electrifying, crushing and breathtaking all at once.\n\nThat's the album in a nutshell: Electrifying, crushing and breathtaking. Every element that had made Queen so great, so alluring, so fun and fabulous, is right here on this album. It was a grand, eclectic, satisfying work with which to bow out.\n\nThere'd be more music after Freddie passed, including the \"Made in Heaven\" album that featured Freddie's last works before he succumbed to AIDS. There'd be live albums issued, and so many compilations of the band's work. Queen's legacy will never fade, the music retains its power and catches new generations by storm with regularity.\n\nFreddie went out on a high note, and who could ask for anything more?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1991\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Gish.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Into the Great Wide Open.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Help Yourself.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Nevermind.\"\n\nMy Bloody Valentine's \"Loveless.\"\n\nEven if it was only \"Drive\" on this record, \"Automatic for the People\" would top my list for the year.\n\nWith \"Drive,\" I was unexpectedly pulled out of contemporary sounds and was rocketed back to ... when? I don't know. Some 1850s Western setting? A 1950s Western TV show? The song has this guitar progression and effect that brings to mind cowboys. It kind of reminds me of Bon Jovi's \"Wanted Dead or Alive,\" but I prefer R.E.M.'s take.\n\nBut the song has transitions and a build in strings, it has processing, it's kind of a throwback sound with a futuristic process. Make sense? No? Just listen.\n\nAnd \"Automatic for the People\" isn't limited just to the glory of \"Drive.\" As far as the well-known songs are concerned, it also boasts \"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite,\" \"Everybody Hurts,\" \"Man on the Moon\" and \"Nightswimming.\" That's a veritable greatest hits collection right off the bat (even if some, like \"Everybody Hurts,\" got overplayed and overexposed to the point where it's hard to listen to the music without an automatic groan).\n\nThe first copy of \"Automatic for the People\" that I owned came in used condition from a store I worked at, and it came into my possession years after the album was recorded. And though it kind of embarrasses me to admit it, I bought it because of the \"Man on the Moon\" song, which had been used as the title song to an Andy Kaufman movie starring Jim Carrey. I liked the song, I got curious, I looked for the original album (avoiding the film's soundtrack). When I found which album the song was on, and saw some familiar song titles rounding out the album, I pulled out my wallet.\n\nYou ever have that one album that is just bliss on a first listen? Where every song seems to hang together, weaving some kind of beyond-words perfection? \"Automatic for the People\" was that kind of record for me. Even when \"Everybody Hurts\" had its turn in the sequence, I was amazed at how much I actually enjoyed hearing it in the album context. It hung as part of the record's fabric. Whereas radio listens never did much for me, hearing it as a part of the greater whole made a kind of sense to me.\n\nAnd of course, I was transfixed by opening track \"Drive.\" I grabbed my brother and played it for him, and we both saw it as an incredibly picturesque, vivid soundscape with a vocal that struck something inside us. I STILL don't know whythat song resonates with me, but it does. \"Drive\" remains one of my all-time favorite R.E.M. songs, and it feels like a major piece just waiting for the right exposure to become a mammoth anthem. The album only came out in 1992, there's still time ...\n\n\"Automatic for the People\" has its big majestic moments, but largely feels more intimate, more pared down. It is music that demands to be taken seriously, with lyrics that insist upon being heard. Everyone has their favorite R.E.M. records, but I don't think the group has ever topped the glory or the beauty of this record.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1992\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1992 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nGreen Day's \"Kerplunk.\"\n\nThey Might Be Giants' \"Apollo 18.\"\n\nRingo Starr's \"Time Takes Time.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Dirty.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Gordon.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Amused to Death.\"\n\nSugar's \"Copper Blue.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Bone Machine.\"\n\nBlind Melon's \"Blind Melon.\"\n\nDr. Dre's \"The Chronic.\"\n\nEvery time I listen to \"In Utero,\" I get a tingle of electricity down my spine.\n\nEvery time.\n\nThere's something in the music, something in the sound, something in Kurt Cobain's voice and in the band's collective presence. Something primal and pure, it strikes right at the nervous system.\n\nThere's no doubt that \"Nevermind\" is the group's commercial masterpiece, but \"In Utero\" is my favorite. It's a more organic record, it's got such a punk discipline in sound. The songs feel immediate, even now, more than 20 years after the album's release. Every note, every jagged shot of feedback, every howl feels so precisely perfect on a record that was to be the antithesis to precise perfection.\n\nI've written about Cobain and Nirvana before, and touched on my love for the \"In Utero\" album. But sometimes words fail to convey the power that music holds on you, emotionally and spiritually.\n\nIsolate that bassline to \"Heart Shaped Box\" and tell me that isn't the most supremely wicked, fascinatingly dark sound you can conjure. (You can tell me otherwise, but I'll disagree with you.) I think you could release just that bassline for Halloween CDs and it'd be massively popular in its own right.\n\nListen to that overblown surf guitar sound on \"Serve the Servants.\" Surf guitar sound? How so? Man, imagine Dick Dale in plaid, with emotional baggage, more than a little anger and the commercial clout to do whatever he wants. Then get back to me. The guitar skips and dives, runs up and down, it jitters and it conjures frantic power. 'Nuff said.\n\nListen to the words of \"Dumb.\" \"I think I'm just happy.\" I mean, doesn't that say something to you? Have you ever been able to relate to a mindset where something negative might actually be positive, or vice versa? Sniffing glue? Floating on clouds? The lyrics maybe sound like teenage foolishness, but dig the sound with it. The song is like a burned-out daydream.\n\nOh, \"Pennyroyal Tea.\" How many people did I know when I was growing up who tried to make this concoction? And how many songs do you know that manage to work \"cherry-flavored antacids\" into the lyric? And that sound ... Desperation? I don't know, but it has a soothing quality to it.\n\nWhen I think of all the great work Nirvana did, all the excellent material recorded in the various incarnations of the group, and I reflect on what was lost when Cobain died, the first thing that comes to mind isn't the immortal \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" or the baby in the swimming pool cover of \"Nevermind.\" It is the power and depth of \"In Utero.\"\n\n\"In Utero\" was everything that was scary and unfettered and powerful in Nirvana. It was everything honest and dishonest and playful. \"In Utero\" is power and introversion, combined, a sonic and emotional powerhouse that darn few can claim to approach in quality. John Lennon's \"Plastic Ono Band\" is the only album that I'd put above \"In Utero\" for the complete catharsis and pain and psyche examination found in the music.\n\nNot bad for a record recorded at Pachyderm Studio in Minnesota's own Cannon Falls.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1993\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Happy Club.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Off the Ground.\"\n\nAerosmith's \"Get a Grip.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Siamese Dream.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"River of Dreams.\"\n\nI was driving back from a Boy Scouts camping trip when my friend asked, \"Do you listen to much Johnny Cash?\"\n\nI didn't. As I've written elsewhere, my parents weren't big on country music. But I knew some of the big Cash songs, like \"Ring of Fire,\" Walk the Line\" and those early hits. So I told my friend, \"I know a couple songs, but not enough to call myself a fan or anything.\"\n\nHe said, \"Oh, you have to try out this album. It is track after track of good stuff.\" And he handed me a copy of Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings.\"\n\nI admit, I didn't get to it right away. I imagine you've been in the situation where people loan you music, encourage you to try it, piling adjective upon adjective so that you'll listen to it ... but you're just really not that interested. It is no reflection on that music itself, it's more of your state of mind.\n\nAfter a couple weeks, I had nothing going on and was starting to feel bad that I was still borrowing the album and hadn't even tried it. So I popped it in.\n\nWhat can I say? I liked it. But I didn't love it. It sounded good, I liked the variety. \"The Beast in Me\" and \"Drive On\" were pretty cool, and \"Thirteen\" was a dark classic. I enjoyed pretty much all of the songs, but none of them made me want to drop what I was doing and devote my full attention to the record. So I returned the CD to my friend, thanked him, offered a few bland compliments (\"Boy, he sure sounds good on this album\") and moved on.\n\nFast forward five or more years, to when I was living in St. Cloud. Mick Hatten and I were having one of our many music talks, and the discussion turned to Johnny Cash in general and the American albums, in particular. Beyond having heard the first album and then enjoying some of the songs on \"IV,\" I had nothing much to contribute. So Mick loaded me up and my education began.\n\nWhile the \"American Recordings\" album in its own right isn't my favorite of the series, it is nonetheless a landmark album and a treat from start to finish. It is a record that tends to feel like an old friend, a record you enjoy spending time with whenever you put it on. Listening to Cash's voice soar on \"Down There by the Train\" is a treat, and his recitation of \"Delia's Gone\" is by turns sorrowful and regretful, then plainspoken and matter-of-fact.\n\nWithout the \"American Recordings\" album and the series of records under the American label, Cash's legacy would still have been strong and defined by a number of hits and stylistic evolutions. However, the American albums created a foundation for a new image, perhaps even a new myth, of the man in black. The quality was supremely high, the content varied, the myriad styles somehow all brought under the sound of Cash's guitar and voice. He proved himself the master of song, of any song.\n\nAnd that is made abundantly clear on the first record of the American series. For that reason alone, \"American Recordings\" should be feted.\n\nWhat about Tom Petty?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1994 is Tom Petty's \"Wildflowers.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1994\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1994 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe new Beatles, man! The biggest thing to hit music since Elvis! The best songs since (insert artist here) gave us (insert song here)!\n\nGet the point?\n\nOK, all those qualities may be exaggerations, but in 1995 all the hyperbole was in the air, on TV and in the trades. It sure felt true, at the time.\n\nAnd \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" was the album that sealed it. Whether or not you liked Oasis, you couldn't have gone through the 1990s without hearing \"Wonderwall\" or \"Champagne Supernova.\" It sounded enough like 1960s pop that oldies stations would play it, and it was a bright pop sound, so it did well on contemporary stations.\n\nI was 15 at the time, and my devotion to The Beatles was nearing its peak. What was this blasphemy? A new Beatles? Hadn't this label been used before? (The Knack come to mind.) Was music so creatively bankrupt that soundalikes were the only way to make it big?\n\nAh, but then, I hadn't heard any of the music. And judging any artist or album without hearing the music for yourself is always bad policy (beware of tastemakers who encourage you to skip something on their say-so ... you have your own ears).\n\nSo I gave the album a listen, and I loved it. The next Beatles? Yes, that was an exaggeration. But darned if the album didn't sound really good. My favorites were \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" (which truly does sound Beatles-esque) and \"She's Electric,\" which to this day is one of my favorite Britpop songs. \"There's lots and lots for us to do / she is electric, can I be electric too?\" Gets me every time.\n\nIn the 1990s, if you were into the Britpop sound, you tended to either be in the Oasis camp or the Blur camp. I didn't listen to Blur much, and I still haven't. I'm sure Damon Albarn and company are great, but ... I had Oasis. I was pretty comfortable with that selection.\n\nOf course, the band's lineup changed over the years. And then brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher had yet another huge falling out (shades of The Kinks and their brothers, Ray and Dave Davies) and Oasis split.\n\nConsidering the \"next Beatles\" label that Oasis itself was pinned with, I won't go so far as to say that we'll never see the like of Oasis again. But records like \"Definitely Maybe\" and \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" reflect just how good it was to have the band while it was here. And if you haven't already, check out \"Don't Believe the Truth\" and \"Dig Out Your Soul,\" the band's last two albums. The band went out the way it came in, with two excellent albums and a high bar set for its contemporaries.\n\nSo if you enjoy some good British pop music, with a solid back beat and catchy guitar solos and plenty of \"that sounds like ...\" hooks, you can do far worse than revisiting this Oasis classic. As their song \"Roll With It\" suggests, \"don't let anybody get in your way.\" The album was big for a reason, no shame in enjoying it now. Who cares what some might say?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1995\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1995 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nRadiohead's \"The Bends.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"I Should Coco.\"\n\nAlanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nThe Presidents of the United States of America's \"The Presidents of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Clouds Taste Metallic.\"\n\nShane MacGowan and the Popes' \"The Snake.\"\n\nGreen Day's \"Insomniac.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Return of the Rentals.\"\n\nQueen's \"Made in Heaven.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 1.\"\n\nWhen I first heard Weezer's \"Pinkerton,\" I hated it. Like, HATED it.\n\nMy best friend got me into Weezer, with their debut album, and it took me a while to get into it. But once I got there, I really enjoyed it. Songs like \"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here\" left a big mark on me, and I had a set belief in how the band should sound and the kinds of songs it should perform.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" took those notions and tossed them into the trash.\n\nThe sound was raw, dark. Where were the peppy, geeky kind of songs? I sure didn't hear them in the mix of songs about sex, lesbians and Japanese girls.\n\nAfter the success of Weezer's debut album (known affectionately as the \"Blue Album\"), group leader and main songwriter Rivers Cuomo went to Harvard. He wrote about some confusion, some anger, some physical ailments (walking with an old man's cane), and it all took this kind of anguished, introverted atmosphere.\n\nIf you wanted more \"Buddy Holly,\" you didn't get it. Instead, you got the grandfather of emo records. \"Getchoo\" maybe puts things in the proper perspective: \"This is beginning to hurt, this is beginning to be serious.\" The sound is live, the bass thrums and guitar lines are jagged. Cuomo gives some of his best tuneful howls, and \"Pinkerton\" becomes this great flood of passion and pain.\n\nBut on the first few listens, it just seemed like noise. Melodic noise, anthemic noise, but noise nonetheless.\n\nI think my younger brother caught on to it before I did, really. He listened to it with more regularity, and stuff started to sink in. I started to get into songs like \"The Good Life\" (a song I'll always associate with my brother), and I enjoyed the intricate lyrics of \"Across the Sea.\" And album closer \"Butterfly\" has such a wistful tune and ends with the words \"I'm sorry,\" in a straight-from-the-heart voice.\n\nAnd I think that kind of emotional and stylistic purity is what keeps \"Pinkerton\" so fresh and important to me. Strip away the Ric Ocasek production from the first album, get back to a sound more like a live experience, then dig deep into affairs of the heart and mind and then let loose as microphones pick up the crashing drums, the angry guitars and the exasperated vocals.\n\nThis, my friends, is all your growing-up angst and all those late-at-night-and-in-the-dark thoughts, thrown onto an audio canvas.\n\nAfter I'd finally given in and gave up my prejudices on how Weezer music should sound, I got heavily emotionally invested in the record. Bitter disappointment on the love front? Sure, I can relate. A general feeling of isolation and loneliness? Heck, who doesn't feel that from time to time? Feeling like you're a million miles away from someone who could make everything feel better? Oh, sure, if you've got a romantic stripe in you, you've had to have felt that sometime in your life.\n\n\"This is beginning to hurt,\" indeed. But thanks for hanging in there, Weezer. The pain led to a masterpiece.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1996\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1996 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Bad Hair Day.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 2.\"\n\nSuperdrag's \"Regretfully Yours.\"\n\nThe Wallflowers' \"Bringing Down the Horse.\"\n\nSquirrel Nut Zippers' \"Hot.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Songs and Music from 'She's the One.'\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"That Thing You Do!\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 3.\"\n\nWilco's \"Being There.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"Unchained.\"\n\nI came to Radiohead's \"OK Computer\" in an unusual way.\n\nI was a sophomore in college and I was playing an online game, and one of my friends on the game was a fella from Australia. We were talking about music, and I was undoubtedly gushing about Pink Floyd (my musical obsession at the time). He asked me about what I liked about Pink Floyd's music. I undoubtedly went into long rhapsodies about the song constructions, how some of the music has an organic buildup, that I could get washed away in blankets of sound, that the lyrics had an odd way of peering into neglected nooks and crannies that other music never penetrated.\n\n\"I think I know what you mean,\" he said. \"You've got to give Radiohead's 'OK Computer' a try.\"\n\nI'd heard, and even liked, other Radiohead material before this recommendation. But \"OK Computer\" was virgin territory for me.\n\nCurious, I eventually wandered out to a store and picked up a copy.\n\nAnd I really wasn't sure how I felt about it, even after a handful of listens. How did my love of Pink Floyd music lead me here?\n\n\"OK Computer\" and its lyrics weren't necessarily personal, they were more abstract. But there was this probing quality to them.\n\nThe music was, well, layered and atmospheric, collages of sounds that would flow together and then there'd be a tension that'd give way to something in a lyric or a vocal.\n\nI wasn't really quite sure how much of \"OK Computer\" was deliberately produced, or how much of it was a product of chance, of pure serendipity.\n\nAnd maybe that was the real hook for me. The music kept me guessing, it kept me involved. The song titles were a mix of standard fare and peculiar (the former including \"Let Down,\" \"No Surprises,\" \"Lucky\" and the latter featuring \"Paranoid Android,\" \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"Exit Music (For a Film).\"\n\nThe lyrics, the sounds, the song titles, they all appealed to different parts of my head.\n\nI tend to think that music is a very personal experience in life. Sure, you have massive hits that everyone buys and become global anthems. But what we hear in the music, what we feel from the music, what we respond to in the music are very personal. And when you move away from the big hits, the chart toppers, and you're listening to music that is more soundscape than guitar-hero hijinx, it's all about what you find and what you feel and what you take away from it.\n\nI guess I can see the Pink Floyd connection, after all. The material gets into all those nooks and crannies, organic buildups and all.\n\nI may need to track down my Aussie friend and thank him. It's long overdue.\n\nWhat about Paul McCartney?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1997 is Paul McCartney's \"Flaming Pie.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1997\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nElliott Smith's \"Either/Or.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"In It for the Money.\"\n\nJohn Fogerty's \"Blue Moon Swamp.\"\n\nOasis' \"Be Here Now.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Time Out of Mind.\"\n\nThe more things change, the more things stay the same.\n\nAn online pal got me into \"OK Computer,\" and another online pal got me into \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nI think it was around 2013 that a Facebook friend (hi Becknar!) asked me what I thought about Superdrag.\n\nOddly enough, the Superdrag albums I had been exposed to were not their biggest records. Go figure.\n\nA guy I roomed with in college had gotten me into the band a little, and I had copies of \"In the Valley of Dying Stars\" (which I really liked), \"Greetings from Tennessee\" (which was OK) and \"Last Call for Vitriol\" (another excellent record).\n\nBut I had never heard \"Regretfully Yours\" or \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nBecknar, the passionate gent that he is about music, found copies of both albums at basement prices on eBay and sent me the links. Days later, I had these albums in my hands. Headphones ready, I dug in.\n\nBefore I start talking \"Head Trip,\" let me just say this: If you love 1990s power pop and alt rock, you owe it to yourself to get these two records. Part of me wants to say that Superdrag is almost the Cheap Trick of the 1990s (and in case you have mixed feelings on what that could mean, take it as a compliment).\n\nAs for the music? Oh, man. Think about the 1967 era of The Beatles, like \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" with sitars and orchestrated hooks and lush backing tracks. The vocals are crisp, there are tasty hooks and everything sounds so punchy and vibrant. Getting the Cheap Trick angle, yet?\n\nBut Superdrag's members aren't just copying a sound or replicating a style. The best music can pay homage to a sound while also creating something distinctive and refreshing.\n\nLooking for hits or key cuts? You won't find any. The album is a triumph of studio use, but it isn't a collection of radio hits or chart toppers. If you've heard any of the songs on the record, it's likely it was \"Do the Vampire.\" But don't be dismissing the album because you don't recognize the song titles or haven't heard the tracks. \"I'm Expanding My Mind\" has to be one of the great leadoff tracks on a 1990s album, and the group's purpose for the album is right there in the title. Imagine you're outside on a hot day, and you step into an air-conditioned sanctuary. That woosh of refreshment, that sudden relief, an immediate comfort. That's the opening track. Comfortable, engaging, getting you ready for more.\n\nHats off to you, Becknar. How'd I miss this back in the day? It only took me 15 years, but now I'm in love with one of the late 1990s great lost albums. No drag in that.\n\nWhat about Madonna?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1998 is Madonna's \"Ray of Light.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1998\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Photograph Smile.\"\n\nLucinda Williams' \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Stunt.\"\n\nThe Beach Boys' \"Endless Harmony Soundtrack.\"\n\nElliott Smith's \"XO.\"\n\nWhen I first moved to St. Cloud in late 2004, I made a number of new friends. With new friendships came exposure to music I hadn't tried. I knew some Nine Inch Nails material, but it took a copy editor friend to get me into \"The Fragile.\"\n\nIt goes something like this. The copy desk was talking about key albums and artists that meant a lot to them for whatever reason. I talked about Brian Wilson and his recently released \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE,\" and others were contributing their favorites. The copy editor, a good dude named Ryan, spoke of \"The Fragile.\" Excited discussions were had, and this led to people burning CDs of albums to introduce everyone else to the music.\n\nAnd folks, the proper etiquette when sharing favorites with each other always is to at least try the favorites given by others in the conversation. That give-and-take is part of the fun.\n\nSo I popped in \"The Fragile,\" sat in a comfy chair and started to listen.\n\nSome music, you're just going to dislike for whatever reason. If you hate rap, you hate rap. If you hate country, you hate country. If you hate industrial music, you hate industrial music. And Nine Inch Nails is heavily rooted in industrial music, but it has a heavy rock vibe to it. If you like pop or lighter fare, this is probably not for you.\n\nBut oh, seriously, just listen. This isn't the usual NIN (if NIN can ever be described to be \"usual\"). It's avant garde, artsy, multifaceted, complex, almost symphonic, a truly layered work. Is this prog rock? Maybe?\n\nWhat I know for sure is that it is experimental and pushes the envelope of what Trent Reznor had done on previous albums. It can alternate from airy to suffocating, chillingly isolated and then overheated and claustrophobic. I mean, how do you zigzag like that, sometimes just one moment to the next on the same track? It's like capturing wind and trying to shape something from it, powerful and frightening and then gone. And it's angry. It is so angry.\n\nBut let you think this is some atmosphere album, no, it has songs. It has lyrics. While all the pieces fit together as a disjointed and compelling whole, you can pull out individual tunes. But it almost feels a disservice to talk about individual songs when the impact of the album is from its totality. You can thrash and wail, or you can hug yourself and chant. You feel eerily alienated and disturbingly understood.\n\nSound frightening? It is. But the best art grabs you and doesn't let you go. And \"The Fragile\" refuses to let you go, it lingers, and it draws strength over the years. It isn't that it is lyrically inventive or sonically original, but there's this cumulative effect that blows you away. It isn't for the faint of heart, but it is an album worth experiencing.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1999\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1999 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nEminem's \"The Slim Shady LP.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Echo.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Californication.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"The Soft Bulletin.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Seven More Minutes.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Fly.\"\n\nThe Magnetic Fields' \"69 Love Songs.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Run Devil Run.\"\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \"Looking Forward.\"\n\nBeck's \"Midnite Vultures.\"\n\nMy first impressions of Eminem's \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" came from selling it.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, I was working at a store that sold music, movies and books. I really enjoyed that job and the people I worked with, and we had our regulars as customers — the folks who'd come in every day and would chat about their favorite music, concerts they'd gone to, celebrities they'd met, that kind of thing.\n\nOne day, one of our regulars (a guy in his early 40s) came in wearing a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, and he headed right over to the music section. I figured there'd be some classic rock or maybe some metal coming up to the register with him. Nope.\n\nHe had a copy of Eminem's latest release, \"The Marshall Mathers LP.\"\n\nI asked him about it. Was he a fan? What got him interested in buying the album? Had he heard much Eminem before?\n\nIt turns out that he'd never heard an Eminem song before, but he was buying it for his son and had heard and read that it was a very strong album, with adult themes and language, but that it also was very artistic and intriguing. Fair enough. He bought it, and that was that.\n\nI hadn't actually heard the record. In fact, it would take another year before I'd hear more than a few tracks (you couldn't really get away from \"Stan\" or \"The Real Slim Shady,\" as they were on TV and everyone was listening to them). I had friends who listened to hip-hop regularly, and they talked about how revolutionary the record was, and they played me select tracks.\n\nAs a narrative piece, the album hangs together really well. Eminem's conflicts with authority, with fame and with his wife and mother, as well as his anger, his drug use and his violent outlook, didn't come across as gimmicks or stereotypes. Sincerity is a quality that can add quite a bit to art, and you'll find quite a bit of sincerity throughout this record — some of it quite scary.\n\nBut there's a lot of humor (sometimes dark, but humor nonetheless) on this album. The themes jump from the kind of material that could make horror movie fodder or content for a \"CSI\" episode, then jump to songs that deflate the situation and basically ask the listener, \"Are you actually taking this seriously?\" I find him refreshing, provocative, intelligent, surreal.\n\nIf you have a preconceived notion of Eminem as a violent, foul-mouthed thug, \"Stan\" still stands as one of the best challenges to that image. It gives you a glimpse behind the public face, demonstrating the fan expectations, the pressures of fame and the downsides of adulation brilliantly. Eminem knows who he is, and what he is.\n\nHe's the real Slim Shady, sometimes. He's Marshall Mathers, sometimes. He's who he needs to be, what he has to be, and this album is just an early part of an important musical and cultural legacy.\n\nHe's released some great albums since, too. And if you've never seen his film \"8 Mile,\" give it a shot. Give all his records a shot. Maybe you'll glean some understanding from all the material. Or maybe you'll be entertained. Or maybe you'll find it disturbing, or vulgar, or obscene.\n\nI'm sure Eminem would welcome any of those views. He's heard it all, been called it all. That's just the way he is.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2000\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"De Stijl.\"\n\nColdplay's \"Parachutes.\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\nRadiohead's \"Kid A.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"You're the One.\"\n\nAfter being introduced to Weezer's \"Blue Album\" and taking a while to really embrace sophomore effort \"Pinkerton,\" I was finally primed for a new Weezer release when it was announced that a third album was on the way.\n\n\"Would it be as dark and personal as 'Pinkerton?' \" I asked myself. \"Oooh, or maybe it'll be some new rock opera, some artful new expression of frustration!\"\n\nWhat we got was quite the opposite of that.\n\nPower pop, huge bursts of guitar riffs and catchy hooks, an album seemingly created to be a summer masterpiece. This was what Weezer gave us for album No. 3.\n\nAnother self-titled effort, like the group's debut, this one has taken to being called the \"Green Album\" because of the vivid green background on it. Also like the debut, the group members are lined up on the cover (though the band's personnel had changed, with a new bassist in the group).\n\nBut that's about where the similarities end. Whereas \"Blue\" had an alt-rock feel with some pop sensibilities, \"Green\" is pure pop sweetness with a tendency to rock.\n\nAnd \"Green\" is short; it runs less than 30 minutes. \"Blue\" has \"Only in Dreams,\" which is more than eight minutes by itself.\n\nIn the end, though, the length didn't matter, nor did the style. I didn't find myself disappointed by \"Green.\" In fact, I was pretty happy with it. It came out in the middle of May 2001, and I bought my first copy after finishing a couple of my more-challenging college finals of the school year. The relief I felt at being done with those classes was nicely boosted by the mostly happy feeling to the majority of the songs. Even the sadder sounds felt upbeat.\n\n\"Photograph\" was so much fun ... \"If you want it, you can have it / but you're gonna have to reach out there and grab it.\" So simple, but so true. Nothing wrong with simplicity, folks. And then there's the Sumo wrestlers in \"Hash Pipe\" (and that song has a wicked groove, I still get grabbed by it). \"Island in the Sun\" definitely grabbed a lot of ears (hip hip), and \"Crab\" is some singalong fun.\n\nMy favorite from the album then, as now, is \"Smile.\" A little different production or a little different approach and the track could have easily slipped on to \"Blue\" or \"Pinkerton.\" An off-kilter love song, I'll grant you, but I love it. \"The way you wanna wrap me up inside your smile,\" a wonderful idea.\n\n\"Green\" is probably the easiest of Weezer albums to play for new listeners, as it is fun, catchy and not terribly challenging. Beyond the drug references in \"Hash Pipe\" or the word \"knickers\" in the song \"Crab,\" it is the kind of music that 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds would find pleasing to the ear.\n\nSound awful? Sound like a sellout? Sound like commercial fluff? Bah. Get over it. Pop it in a player, crank it up and have some fun. You might just find that you like it. Maybe you'll find that it makes you feel better. Heck, maybe it will even make you feel happy. Who knows? Maybe it'll make you feel so fine, you can't control your brain. (Hip hip.)\n\nWhat about Bob Dylan?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2001 is Bob Dylan's \"Love and Theft.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2001\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"White Blood Cells.\"\n\nSuper Furry Animals' \"Rings Around the World.\"\n\nSlipknot's \"Iowa.\"\n\nElton John's \"Songs from the West Coast.\"\n\nThe Strokes' \"Is This It.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks get a lot of crap thrown at them. Too pop to be country. Too country to be pop. The George Bush and \"Shut Up and Sing\" stuff. Their brashness, their fierce \"we don't care what you think or what you want, we'll be us and you can take it or leave it\" stance on things (which would likely be celebrated if they were men instead of women ... but that's a topic for another time).\n\nBut damn, do they have a sound. Whether it is Natalie Maines' vocals or the combined instrumental and harmony sounds with bandmates Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, there's a powerful combination of sweetness, determination, mischief and joie de vivre that is as compelling as the guitar strums and fiddle flourishes.\n\nI was walking between two dorms on the University of Missouri campus in autumn 2002 when I first heard them. It was this bouncy (and laid back, at the same time) track, it almost reminded me of Civil War music but was way, way too modern. What the heck was it?\n\nI was talking to a friend about songs we liked, and out of the blue she played \"Travelin' Soldier.\"\n\nThat was IT. That was THE SONG.\n\nWell, forget the Civil War. A bus, Army greens, this was definitely a more modern setting (Vietnam). But the sound and sentiment leaps generations, and the words ring true no matter the age. \"Our love will never end, waitin' for the soldier to come back again / never more to be alone when the letter said, 'A soldier's coming home.' \"\n\nOK, so I knew the song. I knew the artist. Now to add the album to my collection. I hit a music store, and there it was: \"Home.\" That was the album. Picked up, purchased, mine. Mission accomplished (I trust you'll forgive the situational humor). And it was love from first listen.\n\nIt sounded so natural. It had more of a folk and bluegrass leaning, heavy on acoustic instrumentation and sounding fantastic. Honestly, it sounded like a classic album that had been around for decades but was freshly discovered somehow. It was warm and comfortable and exciting, something I hadn't really thought possible for a country music album at that time.\n\nCollege is a good time for getting over biases. With \"Home\" and my exposure to Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings,\" I started to set aside biases of songs about pickup trucks, drinking and \"she done me wrong\" stereotypes and started to acknowledge the depth and artistry within the genre. And \"Home\" by itself was quite an education.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks even took on Fleetwood Mac's \"Landslide\" and covered it admirably, standing tall right up there against Stevie Nicks' own definitive performance.\n\nAnd the instrumental \"Lil' Jack Slade,\" wow, really, that's a headphones track. I enjoy every listen.\n\nSure, on \"Home\" you still get some traditional country music references (song titles like \"White Trash Wedding\" and \"Tortured, Tangled Hearts\" sound tailor-made for jukeboxes at honky tonks), but I like that. It's history, it's part of the genre, it's part of the tradition. It's fun, it pulls on nostalgic heartstrings that you may not even know you had until the sounds pluck them.\n\n\"Home\" is damn good music. Setting aside the politics and the situation, this is a great American album, an important entry in country music and is my favorite Dixie Chicks album by a wide margin (and I've since picked up and enjoyed all the Maines-era Chicks records).\n\nTurn it on, let it play. See if you'll shed a tear with the pretty little girl with a bow in her hair.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2002\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2002 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe Streets' \"Original Pirate Material.\"\n\nWilco's \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\"\n\nEminem's \"The Eminem Show.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.\"\n\nMy Chemical Romance's \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"The Rising.\"\n\nInterpol's \"Turn on the Bright Lights.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"The Last DJ.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"American IV: The Man Comes Around.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison's \"Brainwashed.\"\n\nGosh, is there anyone older than 18 who hasn't heard \"Seven Nation Army?\" I'd be inclined to guess not.\n\nFor quite a stretch there, it seemed to be everywhere. It's one of The White Stripes' signature songs, and it kicks off their 2003 album \"Elephant\" with insistent, undeniable, unavoidable energy. And it is one of those earworms that you just cannot get out of your head. I know. I've tried.\n\nIt isn't a bad song. In fact, it's a pretty cool song. But like all cool songs that have been overplayed, one may find oneself skipping the track to get to other goodies. The blessing of \"Elephant\" is that there are many goodies worth skipping to.\n\nMy personal favorite is their cover of \"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,\" the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song that has been recorded by such greats as Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick. And with all respect to those versions, The Stripes' rendition is my favorite. It has a snarling, carnal quality that is both seductive and bombastic. And the video, well, it didn't hurt things either.\n\nOne of the cool touches on \"Elephant\" is the use of antiquated equipment during the recording and production of the album. No computers, no modern processes. What does this mean to the casual listener? Maybe not a whole lot (though I suspect you'll sense some undefinable something that you can't articulate). For dedicated students of sound and those who spend some time with headphones, the old equipment adds a dimension and sonic quality that conjures the live energy and excitement of earlier recordings. There's a spark, a crackle, a fuzz, not an imperfection but an enhancement, a \"you are here\" buzz that can suck you right into the music.\n\nAt least, that's how it feels to me.\n\nEarlier White Stripes albums had several good songs, and the garage rock sound was well established. But \"Elephant\" was where Jack and Meg White really kicked things up a notch, cranked the volume to 11 and blew the doors off garages near and far. And it set the stage for \"Get Behind Me Satan,\" my favorite Stripes album.\n\nIf you like you rock a bit loud and bluesy, if you like some slashing guitars and your drums to feel like thunder, \"Elephant\" has those qualities in spades. You want things a bit more toned down, intimate, you want to be coaxes through songs? \"Elephant\" has that too. There's such a variety of styles, I never get bored with \"Elephant.\" No one-trick pony, The White Stripes.\n\nAnd if all else fails, there's always \"Seven Nation Army.\" It's one of the 14 great songs on the album, and every single one's got a story to tell.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2003\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRingo Starr's \"Ringo Rama.\"\n\nAvenged Sevenfold's \"Waking the Fallen.\"\n\nWarren Zevon's \"The Wind.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Let It Be ... Naked.\"\n\nAlicia Keys' \"The Diary of Alicia Keys.\"\n\nIn 2004, My Chemical Romance was nowhere near my radar. I had college graduation, my first newspaper job in North Carolina, my first car that was all mine and then the move to St. Cloud. And Brian Wilson released two albums that year, so I was pretty preoccupied.\n\nAnd to be honest, I don't know if I'd have paid any attention to My Chem even if the rest of the variables weren't in play. The band looked like the goth guys you maybe avoided in class. And songs about vampires and zombies and ghosts and ... well, there you go.\n\nBut then I discovered \"The Black Parade,\" and everything changed. I learned the ever-popular (and generally true) creed of not judging books by their covers.\n\nAfter I got hooked on \"The Black Parade,\" I started filling in the past releases. The excellent 2002 debut \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\" is a much rawer effort than \"The Black Parade,\" and makes one wonder if the 2004 sophomore effort \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" would bridge the harder punk sounds and the smoother rock opera touches.\n\nNope. \"Three Cheers\" is a polished effort, too. And that's OK, because it's a great polished effort at that.\n\nWhen I started listening to \"Three Cheers,\" I got swept away by the variety of textures and by the operatic sweep of the sound. My first thought was, \"This band has to have been inspired by Queen.\" My second thought was, \"This is really freaking good.\"\n\nAnd it is. It is really freaking good. \"Helena,\" \"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison,\" \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise),\" \"The Ghost of You,\" \"Thank You for the Venom,\" \"Cemetery Drive\" and \"I Never Told You What I Do for a Living\" ... all great! Yes, this is a band influenced by horror movies, by comic books, by classic rock albums and punk rock albums and by old movies ... and dang it, that's great! If you enjoy that kind of stuff, if you have similar tastes and influences, isn't it great to see (or hear) a band that combines it all so well and makes music you can relate to?\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is.\n\nCall me a sucker for liking soaring vocals and catchy guitar riffs, but there is some dimension to this music. Chiming guitars, propulsive drum fills, bass notes that bubble up, all combining into a layered sound and complexity that tickles the ears.\n\nOh, and all the videos released to promote the singles are pretty sweet too. \"I'm Not Okay\" is like a trailer to a film, \"Helena\" is a funeral (with some epic dancing), but my favorite is the retro \"The Ghost of You,\" with its World War II era vibe. Good stuff.\n\nSet aside the goth clothing, ignore the hairstyles, pay attention to the situations, the stories, the performances. Once you've jettisoned your prejudices (just as I had to do), there's something altogether human, quirky and enjoyable to this music. Allow yourself to bask in the outsider mentality a bit (it may be no stranger to you, anyway). An open mind can take you places, from the Old West to Omaha Beach.\n\nIf you like your music dramatic, My Chemical Romance and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" may be right up your alley.\n\nWhat about Brian Wilson?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2004 is Brian Wilson's \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2004\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Killers' \"Hot Fuss.\"\n\nMatt Sharp's \"Matt Sharp.\"\n\nArcade Fire's \"Funeral.\"\n\nIf \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" doesn't come up in a conversation about Paul McCartney's best solo work, then the people in that conversation need to give it another try (and use their ears this time). Simply put, it isn't just one of McCartney's finest solo albums, it is one of his finest albums. Period.\n\nThe guy who really flowered on The Beatles' \"Revolver\" and gave us \"Eleanor Rigby,\" \"Here, There and Everywhere\" and \"For No One\" is right here. That's no hyperbole, my friends. Emotional music, introverted, personal. For folks who think Sir Paul is only good for catchy melodies and grandma music (and shame on you if you're one of them), \"Chaos and Creation\" will put you in your place.\n\nThat isn't to say the music isn't tuneful. Of course it is. But it tends to be more intimate, with Paul singing of topics in a first-person narrative that transcends the \"silly love songs\" for which he tends to be known. A more reflective, from-the-heart bend is found in these songs.\n\nWhen I bought the album, I didn't have a lot of high expectations. Obviously, I'd dearly loved \"Flaming Pie\" when it came out, and I enjoyed \"Run Devil Run\" quite a bit when it was released. But I find the bulk of 2001's \"Driving Rain\" lackluster, abysmal, tedious. The album was littered with good song ideas, but mostly the performances lacked any kind of spark or energy that would lift the songs from middle-of-the-road compositions to lively or engaging favorites.\n\n\"Chaos and Creation\" was the first release after \"Driving Rain,\" so I was curious (and more than a little worried) to hear what Paul would give us next. Would there be a new direction, or would he be settling into a \"well, this is good enough\" mindset and give us a \"Driving Rain II?\"\n\nRelief, friends. Sheer relief. From the strident piano of opening track \"Fine Line\" to the looped sounds on \"How Kind of You\" to the playful whimsy of \"English Tea\" and the aching beauty of \"Too Much Rain,\" there were many standout tracks. Many? Try all. ALL. No lie. Sure, some songs bear stylistic similarities to past glories (you'll no doubt note that \"Blackbird\" and \"Jenny Wren\" sound like the cousins they are), but there's a maturity and emotional fullness to the new pieces that lifts them from being recreations or homages. Some songs start out in one style and then deftly transition to a different style entirely, in completely unexpected ways (\"Promise to You Girl,\" for example).\n\nThe album is one reward after another, an artistic achievement followed by another artistic achievement, and all while staying accessible, melodious, friendly to the ear.\n\nAnd some credit must be given to producer Nigel Godrich, who has coaxed sounds and feelings out of Radiohead's best works as almost an auxiliary band member, using the studio to bring out textures in the music beyond those created with instruments and computers. Godrich would challenge McCartney, he'd set goals, he'd discuss the emotional qualities and anthemic possibilities, he'd slow down songs, he'd add sounds, all while keeping Paul very much Paul. In fact, most of the instrumentation on the album is played by McCartney himself (shades of \"McCartney\" and \"McCartney II\" in the mix).\n\nIn the final assessment of the album, it is one of the most well-rounded, sincere and inclusive McCartney records released, to date. You'll still get pieces of good-time Paul, and balladeer Paul, and romantic Paul ... and you SHOULD. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I think the best music is music with sincerity, and Paul is sincerely that kind of musician. But he's also a human, a man who has had losses, has suffered setbacks, has fought for what he has, and knows that not everything is wine and roses. And nowhere is Paul more reflective (while also being colorful and stirring and inventive) than he is on \"Chaos and Creation.\"\n\nPost Beatles, post Wings, McCartney has some great albums. And with \"Tug of War,\" \"Flaming Pie\" and 2013's \"New,\" \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" is at the top of the heap. It is a genuine classic, and I hope it grows in stature as more and more people give it a try. It took emotional and creative courage to put this material out there, to buck some of the expectations McCartney has just for being Paul McCartney, and it is a rewarding listen time after time. If you don't feel a tug within you, a recognition of yourself in the music of \"Too Much Rain,\" well, do some living.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2005\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Fiery Furnaces' \"EP.\"\n\nWeezer's \"Make Believe.\"\n\nOasis' \"Don't Believe the Truth.\"\n\nThe White Stripes' \"Get Behind Me Satan.\"\n\nNeil Diamond's \"12 Songs.\"\n\nOver the course of my time as a music columnist, one of the genuine delights I've encountered has been email conversations with folks out in the real world about music. One of the most regular and insightful has been area columnist Dennis Dalman. His love for Bob Dylan, his deep interest in Dylan trivia and his pool of anecdotes have been interesting and enjoyable over the last year.\n\nWe've talked about Dylan's evolution, his different styles and personas, and we've discussed the merits of many of the albums about which I've written. From \"Love and Theft\" to \"Blood on the Tracks\" and discussions about Dylan's speed-induced electric years, it's been fun to trade notes.\n\nOne album we haven't talked much about has been \"Modern Times,\" the 2006 album that picks up where \"Love and Theft\" left off.\n\nIf you enjoyed the bluesy tones and rockabilly charms of \"Love and Theft,\" then \"Modern Times\" will be right up your alley. You can look up the controversy about lyrical and musical influences and uncredited contributions, but Dylan has long been a man who has made use of old folk songs, old blues songs and standards in his music. To me, what matters is the performance, the personal investment in the material.\n\nAnd with \"Modern Times,\" Dylan is in fine performance form. There are some excellent later-period vocals, jauntiness on more upbeat songs and a reservedness to the ballads (of which there are a few). When an album features such fine pieces as \"Thunder on the Mountain,\" \"Rollin' and Tumblin',\" \"Someday Baby,\" \"Workingman's Blues #2,\" \"Nettie Moore\" and \"Ain't Talkin',\" it is going to be worth your while. (Truth be told, I prefer the version of \"Someday Baby\" on \"The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989–2006,\" but that's a conversation for another time.)\n\n\"Modern Times\" was the first Dylan album released after I'd moved to St. Cloud, and my first impression was that it is a very long record. Though only 10 songs, the album lasts more than an hour. Brevity apparently wasn't on Dylan's mind. But rather than feeling bored or distracted by the longer songs, I enjoyed that you had time to absorb and digest the songs. Like with blues and jazz albums, the journey is at least half of the experience; it isn't about the instant payoff or the standard verse-chorus-verse construction.\n\nTake \"Ain't Talkin',\" for instance. That's a journey song if ever there is one. We're with the narrator as he wanders, as he tries to do good, and we see when the narrator falters and how he is distracted into darkness. That's not the kind of song you sum up in three minutes with the chorus repeated four times.\n\nOver the years, I've grown to enjoy \"Modern Times\" as a worthy successor to \"Love and Theft.\" \"Love and Theft\" may be my favorite of the two, but in a world where you can have both, why not indulge in the greatness of the pair of albums?\n\nConsidering the streak that started with at least \"Time Out of Mind\" and led to \"Love and Theft\" and then \"Modern Times,\" it is hard to deny that Dylan was on one heck of a hot streak. If only we could all be so lucky at age 65. Here's hoping ...\n\nWhat about My Chemical Romance?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2006 is My Chemical Romance's \"The Black Parade.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2006\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2006 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs' \"Show Your Bones.\"\n\nEagles of Death Metal's \"Death by Sexy.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Stadium Arcadium.\"\n\nDavid Gilmour's \"On an Island.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Taking the Long Way.\"\n\nThe Decemberists' \"The Crane Wife.\"\n\nThe Killers' \"Sam's Town.\"\n\nFoo Fighters' \"Skin and Bones.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards.\"\n\nStart with a little R.E.M. Toss in a bit of Bruce Springsteen. Add a pinch of Roger Waters. Mix it up, and you get some music resembling Arcade Fire's \"Neon Bible.\"\n\nDon't you hate trying to describe how a group or an album sounds to someone who hasn't heard it? What you hear, the similarities or echoes, may hit others differently. \"Th", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Putin orders Russian deterrence forces onto high alert as troops ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nA Ukrainian delegation will meet with a Russian delegation on Monday for talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border following assurances from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nThe announcement came Sunday as Ukrainian forces engaged in fierce fighting with Russian troops in multiple cities across Ukraine.\n\nRussia is facing universal condemnation and increased sanctions from Western powers over Moscow’s unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day.\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin said the talks would take place Monday morning local time.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he would be willing to hold talks with Russia but not in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country.\n\nOn Sunday, Zelensky said in a brief televised statement that he doesn’t expect much from the meeting.\n\n“I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by “enemy artillery” on Saturday night, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails.

This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian state TV is covering the war very differently 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that “very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay” for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the European Union. This will apply to any plane,” von der Leyen said.\n\n“Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane. And that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” she added.\n\nOn Sunday, the EU also announced a ban on Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, according to the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell.\n\n“Today we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tap for the Russian’s information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union,” Borrell said at a joint press conference in Brussels.\n\nAt home, the Kremlin appears to be in damage control, attempting to limit information about the difficulties its forces are facing in Ukraine.\n\nSocial media platform Twitter said Saturday it is being restricted inside Russia and is working to address the issue.\n\nRussia’s media regulator told 10 news outlets that it would restrict access to their publications unless they stopped spreading “false information” – including the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces.\n\nNonetheless, Russians continued to turn out for anti-war protests over the weekend. Russian authorities have detained a total of 4,862 people for participating in unsanctioned anti-war protests across the country since the invasion of Ukraine was ordered independent monitoring site OVD-Info said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Ivana Kottasová Laura Smith-Spark Julia Hollingsworth", "Tim Lister", "Ivana Kottasová", "Laura Smith-Spark", "Julia Hollingsworth"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/13/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-13-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Russian forces strike targets in western Ukraine, killing dozens at ...", "text": "Kyiv and Lviv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia expanded its offensive to western Ukraine on Sunday, firing missiles near the city of Lviv and hitting a large military base close to the Polish border, reportedly killing dozens of people and drawing the war closer to the borders of a NATO country.\n\nThe attack came the day after the Kremlin threatened to attack Western weapons shipments to Ukraine.\n\nAs the invasion runs into its third week, the northwest city of Lviv has largely been spared from Russia’s relentless bombardment. The picturesque city has instead become ground zero for displaced Ukrainians. Hundreds of thousands of them have flooded into the city in search of relative safety, with many using it as a stopping point before making their way to the Polish border about 43 miles (70 kilometers) away.\n\nBut Russia’s war is moving closer to the cultural hub. Russian forces fired more than 30 missiles at Yavoriv military training ground on Sunday, according to Lviv’s military administration. Located between Lviv and the Polish border, the military base has held joint drills with NATO and Western military personnel, including the United States.\n\nA witness, who was on the base when the strike happened, told CNN of hearing a “sudden clap” from a bomb shelter, adding that the explosion craters were 10 meters deep and there are fears people are under the rubble.\n\nLocal authorities say 35 people were killed and 134 injured at the military base, in what Ukraine’s Minister of Defence Oleksii Reznikov described as a “terrorist attack” on peace and security “near the EU-NATO border.”\n\nThere were no reports of foreign nationals among the casualties so far, say Ukraine defense officials. The strike came the day after Russia launched a missile attack in the northeastern city of Lutsk, only 70 miles from the Polish border.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that it was only a matter of time before Russia’s military assault on Ukraine expanded to members of NATO – unless the alliance installs a no-fly zone in Ukraine.\n\n“Last year, I made a clear warning to NATO leaders that if there were no tough preventive sanctions against Russia, it would start a war,” Zelensky said in a video address Sunday posted to his Facebook page. “Now, I repeat again, if you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory. NATO territory. On the homes of citizens of NATO countries.”\n\nUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that the strikes on Lviv were a sign that the war was not going to plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin “is frustrated by the fact that his forces are not making the kind of progress that he thought that they would make against major cities, including Kyiv, that he is expanding the number of targets, that he is lashing out, and that he is trying to cause damage in every part of the country,” Sullivan said.\n\nAmbulances are seen traveling to and from the Yavoriv military base on March 13, 2022. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nA senior US official told CNN Sunday that Russia has asked China for military assistance in Ukraine, including drones. Potential assistance from the Chinese would be a significant development in Russia’s invasion, and could upend the hold Ukrainian forces still have in the country.\n\nWhen asked by CNN about reports of Russia’s request for military aid, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US, said in a statement, “I’ve never heard of that.”\n\nAs attacks on civilian areas continued throughout the weekend, a new round of Russian-Ukrainian talks has been set for Monday.\n\nZelensky alluded to the talks in his remarks Sunday, saying his country’s delegation “has a clear task – to do everything to ensure a meeting of the presidents. The meeting that I am sure people are waiting for.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday evening, according to a White House official. Macron had spoken to Putin on Saturday in a joint call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nAmerican journalist killed in Ukraine\n\nHeavy fighting continued Sunday, with Britain’s Ministry of Defense saying Russia was attempting to “envelop” Ukrainian forces in the east of the country as it advanced from Crimea westwards towards Odessa.\n\nRussian troops continue to focus on the capital Kyiv. Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin leader of Russia’s Chechnya region, reportedly told Russian soldiers outside of Kyiv that the key task is to seize the capital, Russian state news network Russia 24 reported on Sunday.\n\nBrent Renaud is pictured at the Peabody Awards Ceremony in New York City on 2015. Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nAmid a growing civilian toll in Ukraine, American journalist Brent Renaud, 50, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to social media posts by Kyiv region police. Two other journalists were wounded by Russian troops, the police added.\n\nRenaud “paid with his life for attempting to expose the insidiousness, cruelty, and ruthlessness of the aggressor,” an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, Anton Gerashchenko, said in a statement on Telegram.\n\nThe US State Department confirmed Renaud’s death on Sunday. “We are horrified that journalists and filmmakers—noncombatants—have been killed and injured in Ukraine by Kremlin forces,” department spokesman Ned Price said on Twitter. “This is yet another gruesome example of the Kremlin’s indiscriminate actions.”\n\nSocial media footage has emerged of a journalist identified as Juan Arredondo, a filmmaker and visual journalist who is also an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, at Okhmatdyt hospital in Kyiv, in which he describes being shot at by Russian forces while driving through a checkpoint in Irpin on the way to film refugees leaving the city.\n\nThe exact circumstances of the attack against the two journalists are yet to be determined.\n\nTIME released a statement Sunday saying Renaud was in the region working on a TIME Studios project on the global refugee crisis.\n\n“We are devastated by the loss of Brent Renaud. As an award-winning filmmaker and journalist, Brent tackled the toughest stories around the world often alongside his brother Craig Renaud,” TIME Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal and President and COO Ian Orefice in the statement.\n\nUkrainians take to the streets to protest\n\nUkrainians continue to protest Russian occupation. The southern city of Kherson, which is occupied by Russian forces, saw the biggest protest since the invasion on Sunday. Hundreds of demonstrators flocked to the streets to protest against suspected Russian plans to turn the southern Ukrainian oblast into a breakaway republic.\n\nResidents of Kherson turned out en masse on Sunday, March 13, in the largest protest the city has seen since the invasion began and it came under Russian occupation. From Telegram\n\nWaving Ukrainian flags, the protesters chanted anti-Russian slogans, filled with expletives about Putin, according to videographer Artem Ivanov, who is on the ground in Kherson.\n\nIhor Kolykhaiev, the mayor of Kherson, said in a video posted on Facebook Sunday that mass protests show “Kherson is Ukraine” and insisted that he retains administrative control of the city.\n\nBut the mayor also said that the city had been cut off from humanitarian aid and was running out of resources. He said that the city “can’t receive a humanitarian cargo here, food is finishing in the stores, we are running out of gas, we only have diesel oil left at the gas stations. We are running out of the medications and insulin.”\n\n“Our main weapon is unity,” he added.\n\nIn recent days, at least one Kherson regional council official warned that occupation forces were laying the groundwork for the “Kherson People’s Republic.” If true, the move would mirror Moscow’s establishment of two Russian-backed breakaway states in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.\n\nPutin recognized the independence of those two territories in the days leading up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as part of his pretext to launch an assault on the country.\n\nSchool demolished by Russian strike\n\nRussia’s air offensive on Sunday also bore down on heavily populated areas around the country. Nine people were killed in a Russian bombardment in Mykolaiv Sunday, local officials said. The strategic southern city has resisted Russian occupation and impeded an apparent push towards the major port of Odessa to the west.\n\nA school in the village of Zelenogai, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of Mykolaiv, was demolished by a Russian military strike, Mykolaiv regional administrator Vitali Kim said.\n\nKim said that the military strike left several people either dead or in critical condition. “Some people got under the rubble and we are evacuating them,” Kim said.\n\nMissiles also destroyed an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankivsk, while the northern city of Chernihiv was struck for the third night in a row, hitting a high-rise building, the regional head, Vyacheslav Chaus, said.\n\nIn the eastern region of Luhansk, much of which is now occupied by Russian forces, the head of the regional administration, Serhiy Haidai, said there had been “massive shelling” of several towns, including Kreminna and Rubizhne, which had prevented buses from leaving with civilians.\n\nThe Ukrainian military thwarted an attempt by Russian military vehicles to cross the Irpin River on a pontoon bridge near Hostomel, a new satellite image from Maxar Technologies shows.\n\nThe bridge first appeared in satellite imagery from Maxar on March 10, appearing to have been destroyed. An additional photo, published on social media on March 13, also shows the pontoon bridge destroyed, in addition to nearby Russian military vehicles.\n\nUkrainian forces in Kyiv’s suburb of Irpin have so far repelled the Russian forces’ attempted advance towards the Ukrainian capital city. With the main bridge crossing the Irpin River having been destroyed by the Ukrainians, the river poses a significant obstacle for the Russian military.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Ukraine’s National Energy Company Ukrenergo completed repair work and resumed power supply to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the company announced. The plant’s electrical system was damaged during a Russian attack on March 9. Later on Sunday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement that the staff at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are so tired they have stopped carrying out the repair and maintenance of safety-related equipment.\n\nAs the devastation mounts, Zelensky said the key task Sunday is to get the humanitarian convoy that is traveling towards the besieged city of Mariupol to its destination. Mariupol has been under siege for more than a week. Much of the city is without power and water.\n\nMariupol’s city administration confirmed Sunday night that the convoy was still stuck some 50 miles to the west.\n\nAs the city waits, officials said it had suffered 22 bombing attacks in the last 24 hours and “to date, 2,187 Mariupol residents have died from attacks by Russia.”\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said that nine of the 14 evacuation routes declared Sunday had allowed civilians to escape fighting. About 3,950 people were rescued in the Kyiv region and 1,600 were able to escape from the Luhansk region in the east of the country, according to Vereshchuk.\n\n“The city of Mariupol was subjected to shelling and aerial bombardment all day long,” Vereshchuk said. “The humanitarian cargo remained blocked in the city of Berdyansk halfway to the occupied city.”\n\nNew round of talks\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak said Sunday that the next round of Russian-Ukrainian talks will take place on Monday, via video link.\n\n“Again. Negotiations go non-stop in the format of video conferences,” Podoliak said on Twitter. “Working groups are constantly functioning. A large number of issues require constant attention.”\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency RIA earlier on Sunday that the talks would continue on Monday.\n\nPodoliak said earlier Sunday that he believed that talks in the next few days will “achieve concrete results.”\n\n“Our proposals are on the table. They are very tough. Among them, the withdrawal of troops, the ceasefire,” Podoliak said in a video posted on Twitter.\n\nThis comes after Leonid Slutsky, a Russian delegation member for talks with Ukraine, said “significant progress” has been made in negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation since the beginning of talks, Russian state news agency RIA reports.\n\nTalks between Ukraine’s and Russia’s top diplomats last week in Turkey, however, yielded no discernible progress.\n\nIn Russia, authorities continue to violently repress all dissent. Riot police arrested more than 658 people in 35 Russian cities on Sunday, as the number of those detained grows, according to an independent human rights group, OVD-Info.\n\nImages of brutal arrests have flooded social media showing people dragged off the streets by Russia’s riot police. OVD-info also reported cases of house searches of human rights activists, police officers stopping people on the street to check through bags, as well as phone records.\n\nAccording to the monitoring group, more than 5,000 people have been arrested across Russia for participating in anti-war protests since last weekend and over 14,633 protesters have been detained in dozens of cities since the start of the invasion on February 24.", "authors": ["Tim Lister Mohammed Tawfeeq Olga Voitovych Simone Mccarthy Tara John", "Tim Lister", "Mohammed Tawfeeq", "Olga Voitovych", "Simone Mccarthy", "Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/03/13"}]}

Amr Abdallah Dalsh/Reuters The best photos of the 2022 World Cup Prev Next\n\nThe clashing of two stars\n\nThis match had been billed as Kylian Mbappé vs. Messi – the 23-year-old French star ready to assume the mantle of the world’s greatest player from his 35-year-old Paris Saint-Germain teammate.\n\nMbappé was defending France’s 2018 win at the tournament in Russia, Messi was playing in his final World Cup match, looking to claim the trophy which has eluded him for so long and which would enable him to match Diego Maradona’s achievement of winning the 1986 competition.\n\nThe opening 79 minutes was all about Messi. Argentina’s captain converted the penalty to give Argentina the lead. Next, his deft touch was key in springing the move which led to La Albiceleste’s second.\n\nThen in the closing stages of normal time, Mbappé single-handedly took a grip of the game, scoring two goals in two minutes and sending the final to extra time.\n\nMessi looked shot and Mbappé looked like he was just getting going.\n\nExcept it was the diminutive Argentine who next popped up to score his second goal of the match and restore his team’s lead in the 109th minute.\n\nRefusing to accept defeat, Mbappé roused his teammates, scoring a second penalty to grab his hat-trick and take the final to a penalty shootout.\n\nBoth Mbappé and Messi scored in the shootout but in the end – with France missing two penalties – it was the Argentina captain who was mobbed by his teammates as his World Cup dream was lived out in real time.\n\nOver two hours of soccer, these was two players – at two different points of their careers – demonstrating the beautiful game in vivid, glorious technicolor.\n\nMbappé sits on the bench at the end of the World Cup final. Manu Fernandez/AP\n\nFrom the spot\n\nThe last time a World Cup final went to penalties was in 2006 when France was once again beaten, this time by Italy.\n\nSometimes, it feels unfair to settle a game in a shootout, a series of actions between the penalty taker and the goalkeeper.\n\nHowever, at the Lusail Stadium on Sunday, the abundance of penalties seemed to ratchet up the pressure and tension.\n\nMessi’s penalty in the first half gave him his first World Cup final goal, while his spot kick in the shootout was coolness personified.\n\nMbappé’s ability to not once, not twice, but three times successfully convert from the spot in one game showed extreme gumption.\n\nMbappé scores France's third goal against Argentina in the World Cup final. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nPreviously at Qatar 2022, one team had already experienced the intensity of that pressure cooker atmosphere and emerged the other side, and one which had not.\n\nArgentina got the better of the Netherlands in the quarterfinals in an epic which culminated in a penalty shootout, and one which saw the South American team display distraction and delaying tactics to arguably mentally monster their opponents.\n\nIn Sunday’s final, Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez showing his ability to distract the French takers, throwing the ball away before Aurélien Tchouaméni attempt, which flew wide. France’s previous attempt – from Kingsley Coman – had been saved by Martinez.\n\nA penalty shootout is arguably unlike anything else in sports – it’s a modern day duel and a World Cup final with so much at stake only heightens the tension and drama.\n\nMartínez saves the penalty from Kingsley Coman of France in the World Cup final. Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nGreat goals\n\nWorld Cup finals are often tight and cagey affairs, with goals at a premium.\n\nArgentina and France threw away that playbook – delivering six goals, two of which were of the highest quality.\n\nArgentina’s second was arguably as good as Carlos Alberto’s breathtaking goal in the 1970 World Cup final in Brazil’s 4-1 win over Italy.\n\nIt was in the 35th minute, when a flick round the corner from Alexis Mac Allister to Messi, relieved some pressure on the Argentina defense as France pushed for an equalizer.\n\nAfter Messi’s deft touch to Julián Álvarez and the Manchester City forward’s excellently weighted pass to Mac Allister, who had continued his run, Argentina was in on goal.\n\nUnselfishly, Mac Allister had the presence of mind to square the ball to Ángel Di María who finished off a brilliant sweeping counterattack to put Argentina 2-0 up.\n\nDi María celebrates after he scored Argentina's second goal against France in the World Cup final. Stefan Matzke/sampics/Corbis Sport/Getty Images\n\nAt that point, it looked to be the crowning moment of a dominant Argentina victory, until Mbappé stepped up.\n\nAfter his penalty reduced the deficit to 2-1, a neat one-two with Marcus Thuram had the ball falling to the PSG star out of the sky on the edge of Argentina’s penalty area.\n\nWith seemingly all the time in the world, Mbappé produced a wonderful display of technique and timing to thunder the ball past a despairing Martínez.\n\nThese are the moments that capture imaginations and the moments that came to define the 2022 World Cup final.\n\nIt will be remembered for so many reasons – Messi’s moment of history, Mbappé’s hat-trick in defeat, the seesaw nature of the game that oscillated from end to end and never ceased to tug on gobsmacked watchers’ emotions.\n\nOther great World Cup finals\n\nOf course, there’s plenty of competition for the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’\n\nIn 1950, Uruguay upset Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, while four years later, West Germany provided another huge surprise, beating Hungary’s Magical Magyars, earning the country its first World Cup title.\n\nGeoff Hurst scored the first World Cup final hat-trick in the 1966 final between England and West Germany. Hurst’s second goal is still talked about 56 years later – had the ball crossed the line? It did, according to the game’s officials and England won 4-2.\n\nThe 1970 final marked Pelé’s last World Cup appearance as he secured his third title in Brazil’s swashbuckling victory over Italy.\n\nFour years later in Munich, host West Germany came from behind to win 2-1 against a star-studded Netherlands team – made up of Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens – to win its second World Cup.\n\nMuch like Messi at Qatar 2022, Diego Maradona almost single-handedly drove his team to its second title in eight years, beating West Germany 3-2 in the final.\n\nIn 1998, France hosted and won its first World Cup, mainly down to the genius of Zinedine Zidane, who scored twice in the final, to beat a formidable Brazil side, composed of Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Cafu, Bebeto and Roberto Carlos.\n\nHowever, with its multiples story lines and the drama and artistry on display, surely the 2022 showpiece now owns the title of ‘greatest World Cup final.’", "authors": ["Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/956871/a-stunning-end-to-the-premier-league-season", "title": "A stunning end to the Premier League season | The Week", "text": "The final afternoon of the 2021-22 Premier League season began with top-placed Manchester City leading Liverpool by a single point, said Phil McNulty on BBC Sport. Pep Guardiola’s side knew that a win at the Etihad Stadium – against Aston Villa, a side managed by Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard – would guarantee them their fourth title in five years. A draw or a loss, on the other hand, would almost certainly hand the Reds – who were taking on Wolves at Anfield – their second title in three seasons.\n\nIn the event, City got the victory they needed, beating Villa 3-2, said Henry Winter in The Times. Yet such a summary doesn’t begin to do justice to the “nerve-draining” route they took to that destination. With just 14 minutes remaining, Villa were 2-0 ahead – thanks to a first-half goal from Matty Cash and a wonderful 69th-minute effort by another former Liverpool player, Philippe Coutinho. Although at this stage Liverpool were 1-1 against Wolves – meaning that City were still theoretically heading for the title, on account of their superior goal difference – no one expected things to stay that way. And indeed, two late goals at Anfield gave the Reds three points. City’s predicament was therefore stark: their hopes of winning the title depended on scoring three quick goals.\n\nWhat happened next was scarcely believable, said Martin Samuel in the Daily Mail. “It was as if a switch had been flicked.” City, who up to that point had been a pale shadow of their usual selves, “suddenly woke up to the looming catastrophe”. In the space of five surreal minutes, they took the league out of Liverpool’s hands by finding the back of the net three times. First came a header by Ilkay Gündogan, set up by a “good, early cross” from Raheem Sterling. Next came an impeccably controlled side-footed effort by Spanish midfielder Rodri. And then Gündogan completed the job with the “simplest conversion”, after the indefatigable Kevin De Bruyne had spotted him “lurking again at the far post”. Much of the credit must go to Guardiola for a trio of inspired second-half substitutions, said Jason Burt in The Daily Telegraph. Gündogan and Sterling had both been introduced after the break, as had Ukrainian left-back Oleksandr Zinchenko – who provided the pass for Rodri’s goal.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

In 2012, needing a victory on the final day to secure the title (this time with Manchester United lying second), City had trailed Queens Park Rangers 2-1 before scoring twice in stoppage time. “I swear you’ll never see anything like this ever again,” commentator Martin Tyler had famously declared on that occasion, following Sergio Agüero’s 94th-minute winner. City, admittedly, didn’t leave it quite so late this time, said Owen Slot in The Times. But for sheer improbability and drama, this was surely the equal of the “Agüerooooo moment”. It was “another day when football held your attention and so shook you, you could not quite believe it”. What a fitting end to a magnificent season.\n\nLiverpool, for their part, will go into Saturday’s Champions League final against Real Madrid carrying an “unmistakable sense of regret”, said Andy Hunter in The Guardian. But for City’s remarkable comeback, that match would have represented a chance for the Reds to fulfil their dream of an unprecedented quadruple. They may yet win the treble, but it must be galling to end the season with 92 points – the third highest points total in their history – and yet again finish in the runner-up spot. To make matters worse, they may well have to play Real Madrid without their “great maestro of the midfield”, Thiago Alcântara, said Sam Wallace in The Daily Telegraph. The Spaniard “headed straight off the pitch” on Sunday after injuring his Achilles tendon late in the first half, and was “hobbling quite a bit in the post-match lap of appreciation”. With Fabinho, Liverpool’s other key midfielder, also doubtful for Saturday, Liverpool have their work cut out if they are to atone for their Premier League heartbreak by becoming champions of Europe.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Uk", "Anahi Valenzuela", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Mike Starling", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/football/usmnt-wales-timothy-weah-gareth-bale-world-cup-2022-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Gareth Bale saves Wales to frustrate USMNT | CNN", "text": "Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, Al Rayyan, Qatar CNN —\n\nThere was frustration for the United States Men’s National Team (USMNT) in its opening game of Qatar 2022 as Gareth Bale scored a late penalty for Wales.\n\nThe USMNT was dominant for much of the match, but as has so often been the case, it was LAFC star Bale who dug Wales out of a sticky situation as this Group B game ended 1-1.\n\nThe 22-year-old Timothy Weah, son of soccer great George Weah, had put the US ahead in the first-half with a fine finish but this young US side – with an average age of 25 years and 175 days – was unable to maintain its dominance and allowed Wales to snatch a draw.\n\nThere was no shortage of American fans inside the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium on Monday and they made their voices heard, exchanging songs with the Welsh contingent behind the opposite goal.\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

For much of the match, it looked as though those fans would be celebrating a much deserved win.\n\nBut just as all hope looked to have disappeared for Wales, Bale was clumsily brought down by Walker Zimmerman in the US box.\n\nThere was then no doubt as Bale stepped up to fire his spot-kick into the top corner of the net.\n\nIt sent the Welsh fans behind the goal into a frenzy and it was Bale’s name being sung the loudest at the final whistle.\n\n“He has never let us down,” Wales manager Rob Paige said of Bale after the game.\n\nThe moment Bale was brought down by Walker Zimmerman. Pedro Nunes/Reuters\n\nWales, playing in its first World Cup match since 1958, seemed to struggle with the occasion in the first half and even Bale had looked off the pace until his goal.\n\nBut the USMNT’s so-called ‘golden generation’ showed a touch of naivety.\n\nThe team has a real opportunity to shine in Qatar 2022 but will need to quickly learn the lessons from this match before facing a much sterner test against England on Friday.\n\nWhat was most surprising was its drop-off in performance after the halftime interval. The US pressed with intensity in the opening 45 minutes and limited Wales to a few wasteful balls into the channels.\n\nUS star Christian Pulisic looked lively and Weah, who was living his father’s dream by playing in a World Cup, looked to have scored the winner with a delicate finish with the outside of his boot.\n\nBut a change of shape from Wales seemed to surprise the young US players who weren’t able to adapt to a more direct approach from their experienced opponents.\n\n“Walking into the locker room after the game you could see the disappointment on their faces,” US head coach Gregg Berhalter told reporters after the game. “We got a bit sloppy with the ball in the second half, we had control in the first half.”\n\nHe added: “Even when we’re winning, we’re thinking about how we could close out the game, but it didn’t happen. Players were disappointed, staff were disappointed.”\n\nA draw, for both teams, is not the end of the world and still leaves qualification into the knockout stages a real possibility.\n\nMeanwhile in Group A, late goals from Cody Gakpo and Davy Klaassen gave Holland a 2-0 win over Senegal at the Al Thumama Stadium.\n\nHolland’s win puts Louis van Gaal’s team joint top of the group with Ecuador, who beat Qatar 2-0 on Sunday.", "authors": ["Ben Church"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/08/football/manchester-city-newcastle-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Manchester City thrash Newcastle to seize on Liverpool's slip-up in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nManchester City licked the wounds of its heartbreaking Champions League exit by taking a step towards the Premier League title with a dominant 5-0 victory over Newcastle United on Sunday.\n\nLiverpool’s frustrating draw with Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday offered City the opportunity to go three points clear at the summit with just three games to play, and Pep Guardiola’s side made no mistake with a scintillating performance at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nRaheem Sterling’s opener settled any lingering nerves following Wednesday’s semifinal collapse against Real Madrid, which had seen City – seemingly cruising through to a second straight final – concede twice at the death before Karim Benzema completed the fightback in extra-time.\n\nGoals from Spanish duo Aymeric Laporte and Rodri against Newcastle were followed by late strikes from Phil Foden and Sterling, adding further gloss on a near-perfect weekend for City, who will retain its Premier League crown with victories over Wolves, West Ham and Aston Villa regardless of Liverpool’s efforts.\n\nDespite the continued elusiveness of the Champions League, another league victory would mark a fourth in five years for the Citizens, and simultaneously end Liverpool’s pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple.\n\nAfter a tumultuous week, it was a “perfect afternoon” for Guardiola, whose faith in his team responding to midweek’s defeat was never shaken.\n\n“With what this team have done, do you have any doubt?” Guardiola told Sky Sports.\n\n“We are five years doing this every three days. If some people doubted us they don’t know this team.\n\n“It’s one of the best groups I ever trained in my life,” he added.\n\nSterling heads in the opener. Stu Forster/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nSterling start\n\nAn entertaining opening saw both sides squander excellent chances before Sterling nodded home Joao Cancelo’s cushioned header.\n\nHis 83rd league goal under Guardiola, the 27-year-old has now surpassed Sergio Agüero as the club’s highest league goalscorer during the Spanish coach’s tenure.\n\nMany a beautiful goal have been scored at the Etihad since Guardiola’s arrival in 2016 – City’s second was not one of them.\n\nNewcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka fumbled Ilkay Gundogan’s bouncing strike into the path of Ruben Dias, his subsequent save presenting the ball to Laporte, who bundled home for his fourth league goal of the season.\n\nCity fans might have been forgiven for not being content with a two-goal advantage after the Madrid collapse, but as the home side’s possession count ticked closer to 70%, even the most pessimistic must have relaxed after Rodri added the third.\n\nThe Spaniard escaped his marker to head home De Bruyne’s corner for his third league goal in as many games. For a team renowned for its flowing passing moves, incredibly, it marked City’s Premier League-high 20th set-piece goal of the season, according to BBC Sport.\n\nCallum Wilson’s squandered one-on-one miss compounded a disappointing day for the visitors, but Newcastle’s season has long been safe after initial fears of relegation.\n\nSpurred by the Saudi-Arabian backed consortium takeover in October, a January spending spree helped rocket the Tyneside club up the table, with a top-half finish still possible.\n\nGoals in the games closing moments from Sterling and Foden meant that City fans could – this time – enjoy two late goals in a game.\n\n“We showed the personality we have after the defeat we have that is incredible [against Madrid],” Rodri told Sky Sports.\n\n“But football is like this, we have to wake up because you have to stay focused on the Premier League … still we are in the fight. The personality we showed today was unbelievable.”\n\nArsenal edge closer to Champions League return\n\nElsewhere, an early brace from Eddie Nketiah secured a crucial 2-1 win for Arsenal over Leeds United in its chase for a Champions League spot, heightening Leeds’ fears of relegation.\n\nDespite playing with 10 men for over an hour after Luke Ayling’s first half red card, Diego Llorente’s header set up a nervy finish for fourth-placed Arsenal, who head into Thursday’s hotly-anticipated derby against Spurs with a four-point advantage over their North London rivals.\n\nVisit CNN.com/sport for more news, features, and videos\n\nDefeat for Leeds saw the Yorkshire club fall into the relegation zone, its misery compounded by Everton’s 2-1 victory at Leicester which lifted it out of the bottom three.\n\nWest Ham joined Manchester City in bouncing back from midweek European disappointment, routing already-relegated Norwich 4-0 to ease the pain of Thursday’s Europa League semifinal defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt.", "authors": ["Jack Bantock"], "publish_date": "2022/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/football/qatar-world-cup-review-spt-int/index.html", "title": "Why this has been a culturally unique World Cup | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThis was never going to be a traditional World Cup.\n\nBreaking ground in the Middle East and played for the first time in the European winter, it was always going to look and feel different.\n\nQatar was described by some as the most controversial World Cup tournament host, with criticism ranging from alleged corruption in the bidding process to a callous disregard for human rights.\n\nIt is undoubtedly right to shine a light on the deaths and conditions endured by migrant workers to make this tournament happen, and LGBTQ and women’s rights too, although some Qataris might wonder why their country came under such intense criticism when countries with questionable human rights records, or laws that curtail the freedoms of certain members of society, have also hosted major sporting events in recent years.\n\nThe last World Cup was held in Russia, for example, a country that has made it illegal for anyone to promote same-sex relationships or suggest that non-heterosexual orientations are “normal.”\n\nBut the world is complicated and full of contradictions, and hosting a major sporting event is about more than a country’s politics. It’s also about its culture and its people, their hopes and their dreams.\n\nOver the last four weeks, this tiny Gulf State truly became a global village. Fans of all 32 teams, along with supporters from many other countries, mingled cheek by jowl in a way that was never possible in previous tournaments, which were spread across much larger geographical areas.\n\nSometimes it was hard to tell who was cheering for who as processions of cheering fans would follow drummers through Souq Waqif, a marketplace in downtown Doha, drunk only on the joy of the shared experience.\n\n“The atmosphere here in Qatar is like a Moroccan wedding,” one supporter told CNN in the thick of the festivities. “When everyone is enjoying the music and singing, it’s like a big party.”\n\nSupporters dance and sing at the Souq Waqif in Doha on November 30, 2022, during the Qatar 2022 World Cup football tournament. Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMorocco’s thrilling run to the semifinals was a watershed moment for the sport, the first time that a team from outside Europe and South America had made it to the final week in the tournament’s 92-year history.\n\nBut even before the Atlas Lions’ stirring win against Portugal, it was already Africa’s most successful World Cup, as it was for Asia, too, which saw three teams – Japan, South Korea, and Australia – make it to the round of 16 for the first time ever. In 2005, world governing body FIFA ratified Australia’s switch from the Oceania Football Confederation to the Asian Football Confederation.\n\nThere have certainly been matches that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nSaudi Arabia scored a result for the ages, beating Argentina in its opening match, while Iran managed to shine, despite the protests and violence in their homeland with admirable performances against Wales and the US.\n\nFans of Morocco show their support ahead of the third place match against Croatia. Ashraf Amra/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThis was a tournament in which the underdogs challenged the old-world order, and won universal respect for doing so.\n\nMoroccan supporter Boubker Benna told CNN that he believes the message of this World Cup has been self-determination.\n\n“You may be an underdog,” he said, “but if you do your work, you can achieve big, big things. That’s what [Morocco head coach] Walid Regragui is trying to prove. And that’s what Morocco is trying to prove.”\n\nIt’s not unusual to see African fans rooting for other teams from their continent, but it has been particularly striking to witness the shared joy in Qatar, where CNN spoke to fans from Egypt, Syria, Sudan, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and the Palestinian territories, all cheering for Morocco in the later stages.\n\n“If France is playing, you will find only French people supporting their team, never England or Germany behind them. And I don’t know why,” explained Moroccan fan Adam Marzoug.\n\nA musician from Oman perform traditional music at the Corniche sea promenade in Doha, Qatar, Saturday, Nov. 26, 2022. Francisco Seco/AP\n\nHe continued: “That’s why it’s special for the Arab and Muslim and African countries. That’s what makes us strong in every tournament, this is just the beginning.”\n\nHis friend, Oumaima Amallah, added: “Despite all the political and historical problems, Muslims, Arabs and Africans love each other and they are like brothers and sisters and everyone is happy for us, like they would be happy for their own nation.”\n\nIt was almost poetic that Morocco overturned two of its former colonizers, Spain and Portugal, and went toe-to-toe with a third, France. But any score settling was done politely, with respect.\n\nSupporters who spoke with CNN would always praise Qatar for hosting the World Cup and express gratitude and thanks for bringing it to the region.\n\nAnd although there was surprise, even an outcry in some media establishments, when Budweiser vending stations were removed from the stadium concourses on the eve of the tournament, did anyone really miss the alcohol?\n\nCertainly, many that we spoke to, including the former player turned broadcaster Ally McCoist, agreed that the atmosphere among the crowds was much more congenial as a result.\n\nWe watched security personnel in the stadia respectfully asking shirtless Argentina fans to cover up, humbly gesturing with their palms closed by their chest. Local customs were followed and cultures exchanged. The sea of humanity that flowed from every stadium to Metro station passed by a series of musicians and dancers.\n\nWhat might have once been described as a culture clash felt more like a cultural exchange here in Qatar.\n\n“We must be open minded,” said another Moroccan fan, David Hamriri, an engineer who currently works in Europe. “I am very rich, culturally, because I am open minded.\n\n“We have emotions,” he continued, “We have many conflicts in the world. But when we enjoy football, we forget this problem. We forget the economic crisis, and we return to the origin. A value of humanity, shared between Occidental and Oriental society. I find it amazing.”\n\nFans are seen on the Doha Metro ahead of the match between Argentina and Mexico. Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\nThe fans CNN spoke to were leaving Qatar with positive memories of their experiences.\n\nEngland fan Theo Ogden, who attended all of the tournament’s 64 games, told CNN: “People said that you couldn’t host it in the desert, and they proved them wrong.\n\n“They’ve been so welcoming. You won’t find a fan out here who will say that they had a bad time, and it’s because they are so hospitable. I don’t think that gets spoken about enough.”\n\nOgden could only have attempted his feat at this World Cup, where every stadium was just a metro or cab ride away.\n\nThe landmass of the 2026 World Cup will be almost 2,000 times bigger in the USA, Mexico and Canada. Qatar managed to turn the world’s most popular game into something much smaller, and it was all the better for it.\n\nFrom the results on the field, to the experience on the ground. Qatar 2022 has been memorable.\n\nBut we mustn’t forget that there were members of the soccer community who refused to travel here, LGBTQ fans who felt it wasn’t safe for them to support their teams because of the Gulf State’s laws. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and punishable by up to three years in prison.\n\nLGBTQ rights was an issue that would not go away during the tournament as reports also emerged of security officials asking people to remove rainbow-colored items of clothing – a symbol of LGBTQ pride.\n\nFIFA’s decision to threaten sanctions for any player wearing a “OneLove” armband, which features a heart containing different colors to promote inclusion, created a rift between the sport’s governing body and the seven European nations whose captains had planned to wear it.\n\nLionel Messi holds up the World Cup trophy after Argentina defeated France in the tournament final on Sunday, December 18.

It could have been a flake from one of King Power Stadium’s famous pies, or a stray speck of paper, but the point is that it hadn’t been there at the start of the game, it wouldn’t move of its own accord and it had to go.\n\nWelcome to the exquisite agony, delight and paranoia that now comes with being a Leicester City fan, and seeing an impossible miracle creep closer to reality.\n\nSoccer fan or not, you may have heard of Leicester by now. They are the team that began the English Premier League campaign priced at 5,000-to-1 yet went into last weekend seven points clear at the top with a month left.\n\nFor neutrals who simply love sports and tales of unlikely inspiration, it’s a joy. For those like me who have followed the club for decades, through dismal days loitering outside the top league, it is surreal.\n\nReconciling the fact that the sporting object of your affection may attain its finest hour and produce an epic masterpiece is not so hard. The difficulty comes from the haunting thought it could still be stolen away, that this majestic dream could end in a knifing heartache.\n\nChampions League quarterfinals in photos\n\nI lived in Leicester as a small child but, now 37, have spent the last nine years living and working in Southern California. As a sports writer I am conditioned to be impartial and I am. Unless it involves Leicester.\n\nAll season, my support has manifested in superstition. Leicester was on the brink of demotion to the second-tier Championship a year back, before an incredible late run led to EPL survival. Through an off-season change of coach, the form has gone on, making me a servant of the gods of chance.\n\nI must clap the same way, the same number of times each time I see a play I like. I must sit the same way, in the same position. If I yell support and misspeak a player’s name through nerves, I must repeat it correctly under my breath.\n\nThe time difference means games are broadcast in the early hours of weekend mornings on the West coast, so I watch on the tablet in bed. If my slumbering wife changes position at a nerve-wracking portion of a game, yep, I roll her right back over.\n\nSunday, at home to West Ham, was different. I was actually there. I had to come, despite long hours of soul-searching as to whether it might jinx the whole thing. At the stadium, the superstitions were worse than ever. More than 32,000 people. Lots more variables.\n\nLike that damn speck on that man’s coat.\n\nI noticed it in the first half, when Leicester took the lead through Jamie Vardy, a fairytale story in his own right. Vardy played semi-pro for $50 a game a few years ago. He is now one of the hottest strikers in the world’s toughest league, with 22 goals this season.\n\nBarca loss to Valencia leaves Spanish league wide open\n\n“Jamie Vardy’s having a party,” sing the fans, and so we were. Finally, as half-time came with Leicester leading 1-0, I knocked the errant fleck of probable pie crust free, with no one noticing, and gave myself an internal high-five.\n\nThings were going to turn out okay. Right?\n\nWrong. The second half quickly turned into a disaster. First Vardy was sent off for diving. West Ham is a fine team and the man advantage paid off. Andy Carroll scored a penalty, then defender Aaron Cresswell smashed in a stunning blast from outside the area.\n\nI didn’t know what to do, or where to look. I felt guilty, responsible, for the disappointment on the faces around me. Why had I come? What had I done? In one of my life’s more peculiar moments, I looked on the ground, thinking that if I could find that miserable fleck of crust I could stick it back on the man’s coat.\n\nCrazy, isn’t it? I know it is pointless. I know that it doesn’t really affect what happens on the field. I understand science, logic and its firm realities. But what if it does make a difference? So says that tunneled whisper of the mind.\n\nMy wife once asked why this story, this season, means so much. It is a tough thing to answer.\n\nI lived in Leicester, where my parents owned a motorcycle speedway team that was beloved among the community until the landlord, also the proprietor of a rival team, sold the land where the track was situated for development.\n\nI love this place for everything it is and all it isn’t. It is not a famous place, but it has good, kind, genuine people.\n\nAnd I love this team for the way it has allowed the dream to breathe, using players dismissed and derided elsewhere.\n\nLike Vardy, and midfielder Riyad Mahrez, who was acquired for less than some EPL players earn in a week. Like Danny Drinkwater, released by Manchester United and told he wasn’t good enough. And defensive maestros Robert Huth and Wes Morgan, laughed off as being old and lumbering. All have played like legends, despite earning a tiny fraction of the sums paid by bigger clubs.\n\nFor Leicester, this isn’t the start of a dynasty that will see us perennially among the elite. Soccer’s cruel economics forbid such romance, which makes what has transpired so far all the more wondrous.\n\nIf we win it, I’ll tell my family forever of the miracle, of the power of human will, togetherness and a rare sliver of magic.\n\nAs the final ticks approached on Sunday it all looked in doubt. Until there was a final twist, both in my twisted mind and on the field. Amid the mayhem of the final moments, I remembered that at halftime I’d shifted my wallet to the other pocket while buying refreshment. Cursing myself, I moved it back. Too late, surely.\n\nAnd then a second later, substitute Jeffrey Schlupp was bundled over in the box, and the hated referee gave a penalty.\n\nAs Leonardo Ulloa ran up to take the kick, I ran through a checklist. Was I standing right? Had I missed anything else? I couldn’t find anything.\n\nUlloa slammed it home for a draw that felt more like a win.\n\nWhich means the dream remains on course, with four more games to paradise. Four more afternoons of torture. Three wins would clinch it beyond any doubt.\n\nI’ll be watching, waiting, not moving. Transfixed, enthralled, terrified of the prospect of ultimate joy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2018/01/07/toothless-west-ham-held-by-3rd-tier-side-in-fa-cup/109248268/", "title": "Arsenal's FA Cup title defense ended by second-tier Nottingham ...", "text": "AP\n\nLong protected at Arsenal by FA Cup glory, Arsene Wenger endured his earliest elimination Sunday when his title defense ended at managerless, second-tier side Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe decision to rest stars backfired as a 4-2 collapse saw Arsenal knocked out in the third round, when Premier League teams enter, for the first time since Wenger took charge in 1996.\n\n\"It hurts even more because it's a competition we love,\" said Wenger, who has lifted the FA Cup in three of the last four seasons and is the 145-year-old competition's most successful manager with seven triumphs.\n\nWhile Wenger has endured a Premier League title drought since 2004, success in soccer's oldest cup competition has helped the Frenchman to gain new contracts.\n\nThe manner of the loss in Nottingham was mortifying for Wenger, who was forced to watch from the stands as he started a three-match touchline ban for misconduct toward a referee.\n\n\"They were sharper than us,\" Wenger said, \"more incisive and more dominant in the challenges.\"\n\nEric Lichaj was the match-winner with two goals for Forest, which is 14th in the League Championship and without a manager since firing Mark Warburton a week ago.\n\nAfter Lichaj headed in Kieran Dowell's free kick in the 20th minute, Per Mertesacker quickly leveled but the American defender was on target again just before halftime. Rob Holding's weak headed clearance fell straight to Lichaj, who brought the ball down with his chest and unleashed a dipping volley into the far corner of the net.\n\n\"My wife told me that if I get a hat trick any time during the year, then I get a dog,\" Lichaj said. \"So I was trying to get the penalty.\"\n\nThere were two in the second half. Ben Brereton extended Forest's lead in the 64th after Holding tripped Matthew Cash.\n\nAlthough Welbeck pulled one back — seizing on goalkeeper Jordan Smith's losing his grip on the ball — Arsenal conceded a second penalty. Mathieu Debuchy challenged former Gunners defender Armand Traore from behind and Kieran Dowell netted from the spot in the 85th.\n\nWith a two-goal cushion it should have been a calm conclusion for the hosts, but Joe Worrall was sent off three minutes later for a sliding tackle on Chuba Akpom.\n\nIt was too late for Arsenal, which rested Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil, to mount a comeback.\n\nAnd Forest secured a victory that revived memories of its heyday under Brian Clough.\n\nThe modest central England team stunned soccer from 1978 to 1980 when it won the top flight and then back-to-back European Cups. But Forest, which reached the FA Cup final in 1991 when it lost to Tottenham, has been out of the Premier League since 1999 and only avoided relegation to the third tier last season on goal difference.\n\nNow the team, which was bought last year by Olympiakos owner Vangelis Marinakis, is preparing for the fourth round.\n\nMORE:\n\nHughes fired as Stoke manager after FA Cup humiliation\n\nFA Cup: Van Dijk grabs derby winner on dream Liverpool debut\n\nKlopp says Liverpool couldn't do any more to keep Coutinho\n\nTOOTHLESS WEST HAM\n\nWhile West Ham avoided being eliminated at Shrewsbury, midfielder Josh Cullen did have a tooth knocked out.\n\nAnd the 0-0 draw means West Ham will have to face the third-tier side again with a replay at the Olympic Stadium after struggling in its third game in five days.\n\nCullen had a front tooth inadvertently kicked out by Shrewsbury midfielder Abu Ogogo as they both went for the ball in the 75th minute. The tooth was recovered from the turf, while a bloodied Cullen was cleaned up on the touchline before returning to the action.\n\nKANE DOUBLE\n\nLike West Ham, Tottenham struggled to breakdown a third-tier side but it did find a breakthrough after 63 minutes against AFC Wimbledon.\n\nHarry Kane made up for Tottenham's profligacy by scoring twice inside two minutes. And Jan Vertonghen netted from 30 yards (meters) in the 71st minute to seal a 3-0 victory at Wembley Stadium — the site of the final being used as the north London club's temporary home this season.\n\nLEEDS UPSET\n\nHours before Arsenal's shock loss, fourth-tier side Newport knocked out Leeds, which is 53 places higher in the league ladder in the second-tier Championship.\n\nLeeds led through Gaetano Berardi's ninth-minute strike but Newport leveled through Conor Shaugnessy's own-goal in the 76th and Shawn McCoulsky's 89th-minute header sealed a 2-1 victory.\n\nLeeds finished with 10 men after Spanish forward Samuel Saiz was sent off in stoppage time for spitting at Newport midfielder Robbie Willmott.\n\nPHOTOS: Best of the 2017-18 Premier League season", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/golf/matt-ford-open-championship-first-qualifying-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Matt Ford has spent decades trying to qualify for the Open. Now, he's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIf at first you don’t succeed, try again. Then try 23 more times.\n\nThe Claret Jug won’t be lifted in St Andrews, Scotland, till Sunday, but English golfer Matt Ford has already secured the victory of a lifetime: qualifying for the Open Championship.\n\nThe 44-year-old has struck tens of thousands of shots in over 280 tournaments, but when he drives from the opening tee of the Old Course Thursday, it will mark his first swing at a major, in a professional career spanning almost two decades.\n\nFord turned professional in 2003, but his efforts to reach The Open began as an amateur. They included a qualifying playoff defeat to future Masters winner Trevor Immelman, and he has since made it to final qualifying numerous times.\n\n“I tried to work it out the other day actually, how many times I’ve tried,” Ford told CNN, settling on an estimate of 24 attempts without success until now.\n\nThe son of a professional footballer, Ford grew up in the English town of Swindon wanting to follow in his father’s footsteps. Having only picked up a club for the first time aged 10, it wasn’t until he had finished school at 18 he threw himself into pursuing golf full-time.\n\n“I loved football but it was also so frustrating, whereas golf is just down to yourself,” Ford said.\n\n“Although the game of golf is anything but control, you still can control a lot more in an individual sport.”\n\nFord plays out of the bunker during the Srixon PGA Playoff in October, 2009. Tom Dulat/Getty Images\n\nTurning professional at age 25, Ford made a strong start, competing at the 2005 BMW PGA Championship (formerly the British PGA Championship) in Wentworth.\n\nCompeting on a European Tour event gave the Englishman a huge confidence boost, but by 2013 he was close to walking away from the sport. Despite a handful of further appearances on the European Tour (now the DP World Tour), Ford has spent the vast majority of his career on its feeder series, the Challenge Tour.\n\nChallenge Tour challenges\n\nFive runner-up finishes have been highlights, but constant long hauls around the world to courses far less luxurious than the European and PGA Tours have taken their toll mentally and, above all, financially.\n\nOnly the top 10 finishers of the Challenge Tour’s 156 player field “realistically” earn enough prize money to subsidize the cost of playing the event, with Ford estimating more than half the remaining players lose over $1,000 a week.\n\nBy Ford’s own reckoning he’s lost money more often than he’s won it, and with wife Suzie and two young children to support, the pressure of quite literally ‘playing to live’ has been challenging.\n\n“The amount of times I’ve thought about giving up this game and as a lot of people say, ‘get a proper job’, it’s been tough,” he said.\n\n“It’s emotional because of the way my family has supported me. I haven’t necessarily made as much money as I’d like to make this comfortable.”\n\nFord shoots from the tee during the Challenge de Espana in Cadiz, Spain, in May. Octavio Passos/Getty Images\n\nA big breakthrough followed in late 2014 when Ford got his card at the European Tour Qualifying School, opening the door for him to compete in almost 60 European Tour events across the following two years.\n\nHe lost his card ahead of the 2017 season, but kept plugging away until he found himself competing at the final Open qualifying event at Prince’s Golf Club in Kent, England, in July.\n\nA blitzing start to the second round put Ford in a commanding position at 5-under heading into the final 10 holes of qualifying, before four shots dropped across the next four holes looked set to pen a familiar chapter in his Open qualifying story.\n\n“You start wondering, ‘Have I blown it? What have I done? You idiot,’” he recalled.\n\nYet when Suzie and the two children arrived for the last six holes after school, they watched Ford soar to a spectacular finish. He shot an eagle en route to picking up those four lost strokes to finish 5-under and qualify as event winner, two shots clear of second place.\n\nFord lines up a putt on 14th green during the Italian Challenge Open in Viterbo, Italy, in July. Valerio Pennicino/Getty Images\n\n‘The biggest ever’\n\nAs well as realizing his own childhood dream of playing the Open – a historic 150th edition on the legendary Old Course no less – Ford is equally thrilled to share the experience with his family.\n\n“Sorry teachers,” his kids have secured a result of their own with days off to watch their Dad compete in Scotland. And desperate to meet Tiger Woods, Ford has already made good on his promise, tweeting a picture of his daughter with the three-time Open champion on Wednesday.\n\n“They are just as happy and as excited as I am,” he said. “The tournaments they’ve walked around with me, they’ve been able to watch every shot and there haven’t been too many people around.\n\n“It’s just gonna make it crazy at St Andrews with that many people … it’s gonna be such a big event, people are saying it’s gonna be one of the biggest ever.”\n\nThe experience, the potential paycheck, and the opportunities it may spring for future DP World Tour events; Ford cites plenty of reasons to be excited about the week. Yet when the lifelong aim was just to make it to the first tee, what is the end goal now he’s about to be there?\n\n“Am I thinking of winning the tournament? No, not really,” Ford said. “But there’s no reason why I can’t have a great week and who knows what can happen. This is golf and if I can get on a run, you just don’t know.\n\n“I’m not really setting myself too many specific goals apart from keep a smile on my face and enjoy the week. If I do that, hopefully I’ll shoot some good scores.”\n\nWhatever the result, it certainly won’t be for a lack of effort.\n\nFord is scheduled to tee off for his first round at 11:15 a.m. BST (6:15 a.m. ET) Thursday.", "authors": ["Sandy Thin Jack Bantock", "Sandy Thin", "Jack Bantock"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/04/18/oklahoma-city-bombing-victims-names-and-faces/5929605001/", "title": "Oklahoma City bombing victims: The names and faces", "text": "The Oklahoman\n\nUSAToday Network\n\nThe Oklahoma City bombing committed by Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people.

Being a student and working, she was afraid Christopher didn't get enough of her time,\" Cooper said, \"but he did. \"\n\nAs the new director of America's Kids daycare center in the federal building, his wife felt great about being able to take her young son to work with her, Cooper said. Cooper said he dropped the two off at the Murrah Building Wednesday morning, planning to return for them that afternoon.\n\nDana Cooper, 24, had planned to fly that day to San Francisco for a daycare conference. However, the Coopers' lives were forever altered when a bomb shattered the federal building. Cooper said he was notified Saturday that his son Christopher, 2, was dead.

The grief for his wife and son could not be borne without help from a higher power, Cooper said. \"I could not imagine how anyone could get through something like this without God. \"\n\nAmerica's Kids owner Melva Nokes said she had known Dana Cooper since she first hired the young woman to work in her Choctaw day-care center. Nokes said even then, as a student at Choctaw High School, the young woman showed signs of promise. \"She would have made an excellent teacher,\" Nokes said. Nokes, with Dana Cooper at the helm, took over operation of the federal building daycare center March 27. Now, just three weeks later, Nokes said it is hard to believe Dana Cooper is gone. She then remembered that cheery voice still on the recording. \"This is exactly like I've lost one of my own children. It hurts that much,\" Nokes said.\n\nAnthony Cooper said his wife was a student at the University of Central Oklahoma, majoring in early childhood education. Dana Cooper was about a year away from graduation, he said. The couple had been married for five years and had talked about expanding their family.

Cooper II. \"He was a very happy child, very vibrant - Mr. Personality,\" Cooper said.\n\nHe said his wife loved all children. \"She was the most beautiful person I ever met. Everything she did, she did for the children,\" Cooper said. Former Rose State College instructor Ruth Ann Ball said she had Dana Cooper in several of her early childhood development classes. She was really happy when she learned the young woman had chosen to go on to a four-year college to complete her studies. \"I was glad because I knew she would contribute to the profession,\" Bell said. \"It's very sad to know that she's not here now. Her face has been on my mind. \"\n\nAnita Fowler, who worked with Dana Cooper several years ago, said the young woman had a maturity beyond her years. \"She's a big loss to child care because she's given very much of herself to the child care community, as much as she could. She was a very good role model for caregivers,\" Fowler said.\n\nAnthony Christopher Cooper II\n\nAnthony Cooper said he dropped the two off at the Murrah Building Wednesday morning, planning to return for them that afternoon.

But it wasn't until a month later that he learned that his brother probably was dead. \"It was really a blessing that whole time, not knowing\" that his brother probably had been in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, Harvey Justes said. Their sister, Violet, had tried unsuccessfully to contact Alvin since the day of the federal building bombing.

He was a regular customer at the Federal Employees Credit Union, and an employee who survived said she saw Justes moments before the explosion. It was easy to understand why it took so long for him to show up on the \"missing\" list. Justes had no family in Oklahoma City and there were few people who noticed him missing.

Alvin Justes left home for Oklahoma at age 19 - perhaps to satisfy his curiosity about Indians, his brother said - served time in the military during the Vietnam War, then returned to Oklahoma.

Even when he answered the telephone,\" a Marine at an Oklahoma City recruiting substation said.\n\nRandy Guzman\n\nMarines have a reputation of sticking to the job, no matter how difficult. And that's exactly where rescue workers digging through the ruins of the bombed-out federal building found Marine Capt. Randy Guzman.

The IDF also said Hamas \"had taken over civilian buildings” and that tunnels under them collapsed.\n\nIn a tweeted video, military spokesman Jonathan Conricus said Biari had \"liters of Israeli blood in his hands'' and killing him was the main goal of the operation, which also killed \"dozens of Hamas combatants who were hiding in the vast tunnel complex that was underneath the Jabaliya area.''\n\nReuters reported a long line of bodies covered in white cloth laid outside Indonesian Hospital in the nearby town of Beit Lahiya, and a procession of injured people of different ages getting rushed into the facility amid screams and chaos.\n\nNetanyahu says no cease-fire:Rejection comes as incursion into Gaza intensifies\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to the Middle East for the second time in three weeks Friday, initially meeting with Israeli officials before visiting other nations in the region, the State Department said.\n\n∎The nearly 672,000 Palestinians sheltering in 149 U.N. refugee locations across the Gaza Strip are \"facing increasingly desperate conditions,\" the U.N. Reliefs and Works Agency said.\n\n∎ Rocket and drone attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria are up to 27, according to the Pentagon, which said it's sending 300 more troops to the Middle East, with specialization in explosive ordinance disposal and communications.\n\n∎ Israel said two of its soldiers were killed in fighting in northern Gaza, the first military deaths reported since the ground offensive intensified late last week.\n\n∎ Ten UNRWA staffers have been killed in the last three days, bringing the total to 63 staffers killed since the war began Oct. 7.\n\nHurling insults, Molotov cocktails:Jews live in fear as antisemitism rages\n\nIsrael condemned by foreign powers, loses diplomatic relations\n\nQatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates each issued statements condemning Israel's airstrikes on the Jabaliya refugee camp. The three Arab states noted the dangerous and escalating conditions in Gaza.\n\nThe UAE, which diplomatically recognized Israel in 2020, warned that \"indiscriminate attacks will result in irreparable ramifications in the region.\"\n\nAnd three South American countries have severed ties with Israel in response to the country's ground offensive in Gaza. Chile and Columbia recalled their ambassadors to Israel on Tuesday, citing humanitarian concerns for Gaza civilians.\n\n\"If Israel does not stop the massacre of the Palestinian people, we cannot be there,\" Colombian President Gustavo Petro said on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBolivia cut diplomatic relations with Israel and called for the country to end its military offensive. During a news conference Tuesday, Bolivia’s deputy foreign minister Freddy Mamani said the country \"decided to break diplomatic relations with the Israeli state in repudiation and condemnation of the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive taking place in the Gaza Strip\"\n\nUN demands Israel, Hamas follow international humanitarian law\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was \"deeply alarmed\" by the intensifying conflict in Gaza and the rising number of civilian casualties. Guterres demanded that Israel and Hamas abide by international humanitarian law.\n\n\"Protection of civilians on both sides is paramount and must be respected at all times,\" Guterres said.\n\nGuterres singled out \"the expansion of ground operations by the Israel Defense Forces accompanied by intense air strikes, and the continued rocket fire towards Israel from Gaza.\"\n\nHe also reiterated that the conditions in Gaza are a humanitarian crisis and called the level of aid getting into the Palestinian territory \"completely inadequate.\"\n\nIsrael OKs 100 daily trucks of aid into Gaza, White House says\n\nIsrael has agreed to allow up to 100 trucks of humanitarian aid to come into Gaza daily, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday, but fuel is still excluded.\n\nIn a CNN interview, Kirby said 67 trucks with food, water and other necessities entered Gaza on Tuesday, the most since the convoys started rolling through the Rafah crossing Oct. 21 and a substantial increase over the 59 combined Sunday and Monday.\n\n“It’s not enough,’’ Kirby said. “It’s still a trickle compared to what was going in before (the war), but the Israelis have committed to allowing 100 trucks a day. … It’s good progress, but we have a long way to go.’’\n\nKirby confirmed Israel’s contention that Hamas has fuel and is using it for its own needs, such as lighting the hundreds of miles of tunnels it has in Gaza instead of distributing it to civilians who are going without.\n\nBut he also said the United Nations and aid organizations are reporting a dire need for fuel in the territory.\n\n“We’ve got to find a way to get more fuel in there, so that the hospitals have the power, so the desalination plants, the pumps, can keep running, keep fresh water going,’’ Kirby said. “There’s a desperate need for fuel. We’re working on that very, very hard.’’\n\nWar could inspire anti-US attacks, FBI chief says\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war could have major implications for Americans, possibly inspiring extremists to try to attack the U.S. and other Western nations, FBI Director Christopher Wray told a Senate committee Tuesday.\n\nWray said there has been an increase in calls for such action from foreign groups in recent weeks, as the U.S. has staunchly stood behind Israel, and added that the number of threats figures to grow if the war expands.\n\n“We assess that the actions of Hamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the likes of which we haven’t seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate years ago,” Wray said.\n\nThe FBI isn’t currently tracking an “organized threat” in the U.S., but law enforcement is concerned the war could motivate individuals or small groups to attack Americans in their daily lives, he said.\n\nWray also pointed out Jewish people make up only 2.4% of the U.S. population but are the targets of 60% of the religion-based hate crimes, which he called “jarring.’’\n\n“This is a threat that is reaching in some ways sort of historic levels,” Wray said.\n\nIsrael says it killed key Hamas commander\n\nIsraeli fighter jets killed the Hamas commander who directed the deadly attacks on the border communities of Kibbutz Erez and Moshav Netiv HaAsara in the first hours of the war, Israeli authorities announced Tuesday.\n\nNasim Abu Ajina, commander of the Beit Lahia Battalion of Hamas’ Northern Brigade, previously led Hamas’ Aerial Array, helping develop drone and paraglider warfare for the militants, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. “His elimination significantly harms the efforts of the Hamas terrorist organization to disrupt the IDF’s ground activities,” the statement said.\n\nAbout 20 residents of Netiv HaAsara were killed when Hamas militants raced through the village on the Gaza border, shooting residents, burning homes and taking hostages during the stunning Hamas attack Oct. 7. A security team at the kibbutz eventually repelled the militant attack there, but one member was killed.\n\nMore than 1,300 Israelis were killed that day, and the total number of deaths has risen to about 1,400, Israeli authorities say. The Health Ministry in Gaza has put the Palestinian death toll at more than 8,000, and the U.N. says more than 3,450 children have died.\n\nThe IDF said its combat forces struck approximately 300 targets Monday, including anti-tank missiles and military compounds inside underground Hamas tunnels. Israeli soldiers killed militants and directed air force strikes on targets and terror infrastructure, the IDF said.\n\n“We are hunting their commanders, we are attacking their infrastructure, and whenever there is an important target that is related to Hamas, we strike it,” Conricus said.\n\nMore than 3,450 children have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war and the number is rising every day, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said Tuesday. The threat goes beyond Israel bombs. More than 1 million children in Gaza also are facing an acute water crisis, Elder said, calling infant and child deaths from dehydration a growing threat. And he said the psychological trauma the youths in Gaza are facing is creating a long-term cost to communities for generations to come.\n\n“Gaza has become a graveyard for thousands of children,\" Elder said, adding that the territory is \"a living hell for everyone else.\"\n\nNational Security Council chairman Tzachi Hanegbi says the Hamas attack has changed the way Israel views its security, with strengthening deterrence to keep the militants at bay no longer an option.\n\n\"The massacre on Oct. 7 did away with the illusion that we are facing an enemy who wouldn’t risk his total destruction,\" Hanebgi said in briefing picked up by the Times of Israel and other outlets. He said Hamas views Palestinians living in Gaza as “human dust\" that shielded the militants.\n\nHanegbi also said U.S. support was crucial to Israel's goal of crushing Hamas now. To keep that support, he said it was crucial for Israel to \"distinguish between murderers and civilian bystanders\" and to allow foreign aid forces to provide food, water and medicine to Palestinians in southern Gaza.\n\nProtesters repeatedly interrupted Secretary of State Antony Blinken as he delivered testimony to a Senate committee Tuesday on the administration's emergency funding request for Israel and Ukraine. As Blinken sought to give opening remarks, the demonstrators called for a \"cease-fire now\" and accused the U.S. of supporting a \"massacre\" in Gaza, which has been under bombardment from Israel since Hamas launched a deadly surprise attack on the nation in early October.\n\n\"Save the children of Gaza,\" an unidentified protester shouted. \"Cease-fire now. Where is your pride in America.\" Read more here.\n\nBlinken testimony on Israel-Hamasconflict interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nA mob stormed a Russian airport over the weekend trying to stop a plane from arriving from Tel Aviv. Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters in Barcelona last week occupied a hotel owned by an Israeli businessman. And in Berlin, vandals hurled Molotov cocktails at a synagogue last week and scrawled the Star of David on the doors of homes and apartment buildings where Jews live.\n\nAn alarming rise in antisemitic acts reported across Europe and the United States in the three weeks since Hamas and Israel went to war is bringing fear into the lives of Jewish people.\n\n“The dramatic rise in antisemitism has the Jewish communities very much on edge in every part of the world,” said Ted Deutch, chief executive officer of the American Jewish Committee, a Jewish advocacy group. Read more here.\n\n− Michael Collins\n\nIran is in talks with Hamas aimed at freeing hostages who were not involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and do not have Israeli citizenship, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said. Britain-based Amwaj.media reported that Iran has been approached by several countries whose citizens have been abducted and seek help facilitating their release. About 240 people were seized and taking to Gaza. Iran has repeatedly denied any involvement in the Hamas attack on Israel.\n\n“We have had talks with Hamas officials and received positive promises,” Kanani said, adding that Israel’s “constant attacks on and bombardments in Gaza” have made the talks difficult.\n\n“Iran will continue its efforts,\" he said.\n\nBiden adviser meets with Saudi defense minister\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Saudi Arabian Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud at the White House on Monday as the Biden administration continued efforts to keep the war from expanding. A readout released by the White House said the duo affirmed the urgent need to increase humanitarian assistance in Gaza. They also emphasized the importance of working toward a sustainable peace between Israelis and Palestinians \"building on the work that was already underway between Saudi Arabia and the United States over recent months.\"\n\nThe Hamas attack came as U.S. officials were working on a plan to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel − a plan opposed by Hamas leadership and their longtime pledge to destroy the state of Israel.\n\n\"The stronghold was used for training and execution of terrorism activities,'' the IDF said in a tweet accompanied by a photo showing some of its targets. \"During the ground activity, the troops eliminated approx. 50 terrorists, as well as destroyed entrances to terrorist tunnels and weapons.''\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/04/13/israel-war-updates-iran-ship/73311944007/", "title": "Israel war updates: Iran launches drones at Israel in revenge strike", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Israel-Hamas war for Saturday, April 13.

The official was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe Iranians had been observed preparing drones to attack Israel, according to a second U.S. official briefed on the intelligence but not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThe attacks were retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s embassy in Damascus, Syria last of Apr. 1. that killed seven Revolutionary Guards officers including two senior commanders. The move by Iran marks the most recent escalation in an inflamed Middle East that has been building for half a year − ever since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in Israel detonated a retaliatory war against the militant group in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Our defensive systems are deployed; we are ready for any scenario, both defensively and offensively,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address. \"The State of Israel is strong.\"\n\nIsrael's military said fighter jets and navy vessels are \"on a defense mission in Israeli airspace.\"\n\nThe attack is \"likely to unfold over a number of hours,\" U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.

The United States will stand with the people of Israel and support their defense against these threats from Iran,\" Watson said in a statement.\n\nAfter the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, the small Mideast country maintained relations with Iran − an outlier from other Muslim majority countries in the region. After Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, the two nations turned into fierce rivals.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Iran said it will not hesitate to take further \"defensive measures\" to protect its interests against any military aggression, the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday.\n\n∎ Israel's national emergency service reported a 10-year-old boy in the Arad region had been injured.

Security Council President Vanessa Frazier said Iran’s drone and missile attacks at Israel was a “clear violation” of the U.N. Charter and international law, calling it a “severe and dangerous escalation.”\n\nHe pointed to Saturday’s attacks, as well as weapons transfers to Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah, among other Iranian-backed proxies, as evidence of violations that he said threaten international peace. He also cited Revolutionary Guards seizing a Portuguese civilian cargo ship earlier on Saturday.\n\n“The time has come for the Security Council to take concrete action against the Iranian threat,” he said.\n\nThe 15-member Security Council includes the U.S. as a permanent member. Neither Israel nor Iran are current members.\n\nIDF: Most Iranian missiles intercepted outside Israel’s borders, IDF base hit with ‘minor damage’\n\nIsrael said most missile launches from Iran were intercepted before crossing into Israel. On social media, Israel Defense Forces said its Aerial Defense Array and its “strategic allies” intercepted most launches before they hit Israeli territory. Still, IDF did identify “a small number of hits,” including at an IDF base in southern Israel. The base had minor damage to infrastructure, IDF said.\n\n“Over the past few hours, many dozens of hostile aircraft, as well as dozens of cruise missiles, from Iran were identified approaching Israeli territory and intercepted,” IDF said. “Dozens of (Israeli Air Force) fighter jets are currently operating to intercept all aerial threats approaching Israeli territory.”\n\nWhat is Israel’s Iron Dome?\n\nThe Iron Dome is Israel’s mobile missile defense system that is designed to find and shoot down short-range rockets fired at Israel. An all-weather system, the Iron Dome can also take down artillery and drones, and it can detect and engage rockets up to 40 miles away.\n\nAfter becoming operational in 2011, it’s been upgraded over the years and has a high success rate. It’s part of Israel’s three-tiered air defense system that protects against short-range ballistic missiles, large-caliber rockets and cruise missiles, via David’s Sling, and also through Arrow-3, which provides defense against medium-range ballistic missiles.\n\nIran won’t hesitate to take more ‘defensive measures’ to protect ‘legitimate interests’\n\nIran’s foreign ministry said it would not hesitate to take further “defensive measures,” against any military aggression, Reuters reported.\n\n“Iran, if necessary, will not hesitate to take further defensive measures to safeguard its legitimate interests against any military aggressions and unlawful use of force,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement, according to state TV.\n\nIran would do so, the statement reportedly said, while reaffirming its commitment to the principles of the U.N. Charter and international law.\n\nU.N. secretary-general ‘deeply alarmed’ by region-wide escalation\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he strongly condemned Iran’s “large-scale attack” on Israel. In a statement, he called for an immediate stop to the fighting.\n\n“I am deeply alarmed about the very real danger of a devastating region-wide escalation,” he said. “I urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid any action that could lead to major military confrontations on multiple fronts in the Middle East. I have repeatedly stressed that neither the region nor the world can afford another war.”\n\nTrump praises Israel, attacks Biden's leadership during Pennsylvania rally\n\nFormer President Donald Trump paid tribute to Israel and blamed President Joe Biden for Iran's attack during a campaign rally Saturday night in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"God Bless the people of Israel,\" Trump said at the start of a rally at a fairground in Schnecksville, Pa., near Allentown.\n\nTrump, who attacked Biden in a series of Truth Social posts earlier in the day, did not cite the president by name when discussing Israel, but did blame what he called weak U.S. leadership for the attack by Iran.\n\nEchoing a Truth Social post earlier in the day, Trump said the attack \"would not have happened\" if \"we were in office.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nBiden says commitment to Israel’s security 'ironclad'\n\nPresident Joe Biden said that he met with his national security team for an update on Iran’s attacks against Israel.\n\n“Our commitment to Israel’s security against threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad,” he said on social media.\n\nSirens, booms across Israel as 10-year-old critically injured\n\nSirens sounded off across Israel amid Iranian drone attacks, according to Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe IDF issued a flurry of alerts on Telegram for sirens sounding from southern Israel to northern Israel. This also included Jerusalem, the Negev and Dead Sea regions, among others.\n\nMagen David Adom, Israel’s national emergency service, said there were no casualties reported, but a 10-year-old boy in the Bedouin area in the Arad region is in critical condition. On social media, MDA said first responders were treating the boy.\n\nIt was unclear whether he was injured by missile fragments or an interceptor, Times of Israel reported.\n\nEarlier, MDA said sirens sounded across the country but there were no reports of casualties aside from calls of “stress symptoms” and people injured running for cover.\n\nTrump attacks Biden over Iran attack; claims it wouldn't have happened under him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump reacted to the attack by referring to himself.\n\n\"ISRAEL IS UNDER ATTACK! This should never have been allowed to happen - This would NEVER have happened if I were President!\" the presumptive Republican presidential candidate said in one of a string of Truth Social posts.\n\nIn other posts, Trump taunted Biden for not giving a live speech on the attack, and said the U.S. would always stand behind Israel.\n\nTrump may address the situation during a campaign rally near Allentown, Pa.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nJordan shoots down dozens of Iranian drones to help Israel\n\nJordan shot down dozens of Iranian drones above northern and central Jordan en route to Israel, Reuters reported citing two security sources.\n\nThe news outlet reported Iran said it had been watching if Jordan made any moves seen as supporting Israel, warning that Jordan could be the next target, Reuters reported.\n\nIranian drone attack makes Israel attack on embassy ‘concluded,’ Iran U.N. mission says\n\nIran’s mission to the UN. said its drone attack against Israel marks the end of its response to Israel suspected bombing Iran's embassy in Syria in early April.\n\n“The matter can be deemed concluded,” Iran’s mission said in a social media post Saturday evening. “However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!”\n\nLawmakers respond to Iran attack on Israel\n\nReactions from lawmakers were largely divided among partisan lines, with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La, stating the \"Biden Administration's undermining of Israel and appeasement of Iran have contributed to these terrible developments,\" and GOP Rep. Mike Crenshaw, R-Texas, arguing that \"Biden signaled waning support for Israel. Now a potential war is erupting.\"\n\nOther GOP lawmakers such as Sen. Roger Wicker, the top-ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called on the U.S. to stand with Israel.\n\n“Our shared enemies, including Iran and their proxies, need to know our commitment is unwavering. We must join with Israel to ensure that Iran’s aggression is met with resolute action and resounding strength,\" Wicker, R-Miss., said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada also said, \"The United States stands firmly with Israel and its right to defend itself against attacks from Iran and its terrorist proxies.\"\n\nThe senator said she would keep working to get legislation passed that provides additional military aid to Israel.\n\n\"What is happening now in the Middle East is why the house should have voted for the Senate passed security bill that supports Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan in their fight for sovereignty and democratic principles,\" Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said in a X post, calling the U.S. the \"backbone of the free world.\"\n\nDrones key to Iran and its militias against U.S., Israel, researchers say\n\nDrones have been key to Iran and militant groups it supports to attack U.S. forces and allies, according to the Iran Primer, a consortium of scholars who study the country.\n\nIran first developed rudimentary drones during its war with Iraq in the 1980s, Iran Primer's article said Friday. Today, Iranian drones are used for combat as suicide drones that explode on impact, or by traveling long distances to launch munitions at targets. They are also used for surveillance to identify targets using photo and video.\n\nIran began sending drones to Hezbollah, the militant group it backs in Lebanon, in the 2000s. In 2006, Hezbollah used drones against Israel in its 34-day war. They’ve reportedly since been used against ISIS militants, as well as in attacks in Saudi oilfields and in Iraq against U.S. military and diplomatic targets. Since 2022, Iran has supplied Russia with drones starting to use against civilian and military targets in Ukraine. Iran’s use of drones has increased in Syria, Iraq and Jordan after the war began between Hamas and Israel. In January, an Iranian-made drone killed three American soldiers in Jordan, while Houthi militants, backed by Iran, used Iranian-designed drones to attack ships in the Red Sea.\n\nWhile some Iranian drones are small, carrying as little as 7 pounds of explosives, others can have payloads of up to 1,240 pounds. Many are modeled on captured American drones, Iran Primer said.\n\nPlans in place ahead of drones, defense not ‘hermetic,’ IDF says\n\nIsrael plans to cut GPS services in certain areas as part of its plan to counter Iran launching drones at the country, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a briefing Saturday evening.\n\n“The IDF and the Israeli Air Force are implementing the plan we prepared in advance,” Hagari said in remarks. “As part of the preparations, GPS services will not be available in certain areas - the disruption is deliberate and according to plan. If we detect additional threats with a shorter arrival time, we will update you immediately.”\n\nHagari reminded Israelis of Home Front Command, which helps prepare civilians for conflicts or disasters. With sirens activated, IDF said people must enter shelters and remain there for no less than 10 minutes, though he said it could be longer. He encouraged Israelis to act responsibly and calmly. The IDF remains cooperating with the U.S. and partners in the region to counter launches and intercept them, he added. Protection includes the Israeli Air Force and Navy personnel, as well as the Aerial Defense Array, which includes the Iron Dome Aerial Defense System.\n\nThe defense is not “hermetic,” he said, adding it’s crucial to follow the country's Home Front Command.\n\nU.S. promises to support Israel in face of Iran attack\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke Saturday with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and “made clear that Israel could count on full U.S. support to defend Israel against any attacks by Iran and its regional proxies,” according to a readout of their call provided by Pentagon press secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan also affirmed the U.S.' \"ironclad commitment to the security of Israel\" in a call with his counterpart in Israel, Tzachi Hanegbi, Sullivan said Saturday.\n\nNetanyahu said in an address he appreciates the U.S. and other allies' support.\n\nHow long until the Iranian drones reach Israel?\n\nThe dozens of drones that were launched could take hours to arrive, according to Israel's top-rated Channel 12 TV news. Retired general Amos Yadlin told the channel the drones were equipped with 20 kg of explosives. Israel's military said sirens will sound in any threatened areas. Iran has threatened to retaliate for an April 1 attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus that killed seven of its military commanders. Iran blames Israel for the attack, but Israel has not confirmed or denied involvement.\n\nIran readies missiles for potential attack, US official says\n\nIran has been observed preparing cruise missiles for use in a potential attack on Israel, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, national security officials remained focused Saturday on Iran’s next steps, a second official said. Both officials were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nBiden confirmed Friday that U.S. intelligence showed that an Iranian attack on Israel could happen soon. Iran has vowed revenge for the April 1 airstrike. Iran blames Israel for the airstrike; Israel has not publicly acknowledged its role in the attack.\n\nIran’s anticipated retaliation comes as tensions have spiked in the Middle East as Israel’s war against Hamas continues. The Pentagon has bolstered defenses for the tens of thousands of U.S. troops in the region in advance of the prospect of an imminent attack on Israel and Western interests.\n\nMore:Israelis ask if world has forgotten their hostages six months after the trauma of Oct. 7\n\nMore:Pregnant women in Gaza Strip face starvation, no anesthesia after 6 months of war\n\nIranian forces seize ship with ties to Israel in Strait of Hormuz\n\nMembers of Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized an Israel-linked cargo ship in the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday.\n\nIranian state media reported that the MSC Aries ship, which carries a Portuguese flag, was taken into Iranian waters. The ship's operator, MSC, confirmed the seizure by Iran and said it was working with authorities to ensure its return and the safety of the crew.\n\nThe crew includes Indian, Filipino, Pakistani, Russian and Estonian, according to White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson. Watson said the seizing of a \"civilian vessel without provocation is a blatant violation of international law\" and an act of piracy.\n\n\"We strongly condemn the Iranian seizure of the Portuguese flagged, British-owned MSC AIRES in international waters,\" Watson said on X.\n\nShip incident comes amid Houthi attacks in Red Sea\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen has been attacking ships in the Red Sea for months, saying it aims for Israel-linked ships.\n\nThe ship seized on Saturday is owned by Gortal Shipping, an affiliate of Zodiac Maritime. Zodiac is partly owned by an Israeli businessman. Zodiac said in a statement that MSC leases the Aries and is responsible for its activities.\n\n\"Iran will bear consequences for choosing to escalate this situation any further,\" said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, a spokesperson for Israel's military.\n\nHasan Alhasan, an analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Reuters that if the seizure of the ship is in retaliation for the April 1 attack, it may indicate Iran's desire to save face without causing a wider escalation of the regional conflict. \"Iran may be trying to play on fears that it could obstruct shipping through the strait, a passageway of greater significance to global oil and gas supplies than the Red Sea,\" Alhasan said.\n\nBody found of missing Israeli teen\n\nIsraeli officials said the body of a 14-year-old boy who went missing near the Malachei Shalom outpost on Friday morning was found Saturday in the West Bank.\n\nBinyamin Achimair's death was a \"terrorist attack,\" the Israeli military said, while Netanyahu vowed the perpetrators would be found.\n\nIsraeli forces were searching \"from the air and on the ground\" Friday, while groups of Israeli settlers stormed a nearby Palestinian village and set fire to houses and cars overnight. One person was killed and several injured in the conflict, Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsraeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal under international law by most of the world, which Israel contests. The settlements house Israeli citizens in the occupied land.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/04/01/israel-hamas-gaza-war-updates/73165725007/", "title": "Israel war updates: Iranian commander killed in Syria; Israel blamed", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Israel-Hamas war for Monday, April 1.

Mohammad Reza Zahedi of Iran's elite Quds Force. His death was confirmed in a statement by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, which said seven military advisers were killed.\n\nIranian ambassador Hossein Akbari said his country's response would be of “the same magnitude and harshness,” The Associated Press reported.\n\nSyrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad, who was at the scene, said, \"We strongly condemn this atrocious terrorist attack that targeted the Iranian consulate building in Damascus and killed a number of innocents.\"\n\nIsrael has not commented, in keeping with its practice in other high-profile strikes against Iran and its proxies. Attacks from Iranian-backed militants in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen have increased markedly since the Oct. 7 start of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe Biden administration has made concerted efforts to keep that conflict from expanding regionally.

Police told i24 News that documents and electronic devices found during a raid on her home linked her to “serious security offenses.”\n\n∎ Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said senior Hamas militants arrested by Israel's armed forces in recent days \"made it clear that the organization is disintegrating from within.\" He said senior militants are turning themselves in and providing information helpful to the Israeli military.\n\nMichigan congressman on video:Appears to call for nuclear bombs to be dropped on Gaza\n\nCharity that feeds Gazans says Israeli attack killed its workers\n\nWorld Central Kitchen, the charity founded by celebrity chef Jose Andres that has been distributing meals amid acute food shortages in Gaza, said some of its workers were killed by Israel Defense Forces while performing those duties.\n\n\"We are aware of reports that members of the World Central Kitchen team have been killed in an IDF attack while working to support our humanitarian food delivery efforts in Gaza,'' WCK said in a statement to USA TODAY, most of which it also posted on the X platform. \"This is a tragedy. Humanitarian aid workers and civilians should never be a target, ever. We will share more information when we have gathered all the facts.\"\n\nAt least five WCK workers, including a Palestinian and citizens of Australia, Britain and Poland, died in an Israeli airstrike in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, Reuters reported, citing the Hamas-run Gaza government media office.\n\nThe Israeli military referred to the deaths as a tragic incident and said it was thoroughly reviewing what led to it, Reuters reported. \"The IDF makes extensive efforts to enable the safe delivery of humanitarian aid, and has been working closely with WCK in their vital efforts to provide food and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,\" the IDF said in a statement.\n\nWCK helped collect and deliver the first shipment of food supplies to reach Gaza by sea during the war in mid-March, and it has set up dozens of kitchens in the embattled territory to cook the meals. The nonprofit, known for feeding the hungry in distressed areas, also built a makeshift jetty on the Gaza coast to help bring humanitarian shipments into land.\n\nIsrael ends two-week siege of Gaza's Shifa Hospital\n\nThe Israeli military announced completion of its controversial \"targeted operation\" at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City on Monday after killing 200 militants and arresting 500 others during a weeks-long siege that drew outcries from hospital officials and global leaders.\n\nThe military said the operation was carried out as a result of \"preliminary and accurate\" intelligence indicating Hamas militants were using the sprawling campus and its environs as a command-and-control center and a military headquarters.\n\n\"The forces located many weapons (and) intelligence documents throughout the hospital, encountered terrorists in face-to-face battles and fought battles while preventing harm to the medical staff and patients,\" the military said in a statement, adding that Israeli forces will \"continue to operate in the north of the Gaza Strip and wherever terrorism rears its head.\"\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, posted a photo of a battered hospital building on Twitter with the words \"I repeat: hospitals must be respected and protected; they must not be used as battlefields.\"\n\nThe Hamas-run Gaza media office said Israeli forces killed 400 Palestinians around Shifa, including a female physician and her son, also a physician, and left the hospital in ruins.\n\n\"The occupation destroyed and burnt all buildings inside Al Shifa Medical Complex,\" said Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the media office. \"They bulldozed the courtyards, burying dozens of bodies of martyrs in the rubble, turning the place into a mass graveyard.

Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi, a hard-liner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, championed the bill, saying it provided a quick tool for use against those who use freedom of the press to harm Israeli soldiers and incite terrorism.\n\n\"There will be no freedom of speech for Hamas mouthpieces in Israel,\" Karhi said after the bill won approval. \"Al Jazeera will be closed in the coming days.\"\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre called reports of a possible Israeli ban on Al-Jazeera \"concerning.\"\n\n“We've seen the reports,\" she said. \"If it is true, a move like this is concerninig.

So we believe that work is important.\"\n\nThousands march in Israel, call for government to resign\n\nThousands of protesters marched in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as the massive demonstrations against Netanyahu's coalition government stretched into a second day Monday. One of the organizing groups, Kaplan Force, said on its website it is \"employing all lawful means available to prevent this dictatorship's takeover of Israel.\"\n\nNetanyahu was under pressure over an effort to weaken Israel's judicial system, viewed as a power grab, even before the war began. The longtime Israeli leader then drew extensive criticism when Israel appeared unprepared for the Oct. 7 militant attack that killed 1,200 people and saw around 250 seized as hostages. Netanyahu also has drawn criticism from the families and supporters of more than 100 hostages still held in Gaza, claiming his government has not pressed hard enough to negotiate their release.\n\nUltra-Orthodox Jews face military draft for first time\n\nHundreds of ultra-Orthodox protesters blocked an Israeli highway outside the central city of Bnei Brak on Monday to protest conscription to the military, the Times of Israel reported. Protesters held banners reading “To jail and not the army,” “We will die rather than draft,” and “Russia is here.”\n\nMonday was the legal deadline for the Defense Ministry to begin drafting Haredim, or ultra-Orthodox Jews. They have been exempt from military service since Israel's founding in 1948, but their growing numbers and the increased demand for soldiers has built resentment among some Israelis for the opt-out. A High Court of Justice order also freezes financial support for Haredi academies whose students receive the annual military service deferrals, and the Defense Ministry was instructed to begin drafting Haredi men.\n\nUS, Israeli officials meeting on Rafah invasion plans\n\nSenior U.S. and Israeli officials held a virtual meeting Monday to discuss alternative proposals to an Israeli military invasion of Rafah. President Joe Biden has repeatedly urged Israel not to launch a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city that is packed with residents and refugees from other parts of the war-torn enclave. Netanyahu had been equally adamant in saying there is no there is no other way to eliminate Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu canceled a planned visit to Washington last week by a senior Israeli delegation after the Biden administration allowed passage of a Gaza cease-fire resolution at the U.N. Days later, however, Israel asked the White House for the high-level meeting on military plans for Rafah.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/14/israel-hamas-war-gaza-updates/71183927007/", "title": "Israel-Hamas war news: US death toll; Gaza City attack warning", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest news on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here.\n\nA week after Israel sustained a deadly surprise attack by Hamas, the nation's military said it would soon begin launching a widespread offensive in northern Gaza – a warning that comes about a day after Israel ordered roughly a million civilians to flee the area.\n\nThe sealed-off territory ruled by Hamas was in turmoil on Saturday amid the sweeping evacuation order that covered about half of Gaza's population. Gaza also faces a growing water crisis as Palestinians were struggling to evacuate northern Gaza by foot, car and donkey cart.\n\nHumanitarian groups said the evacuees had nowhere to go. The other way of leaving Gaza, into Egypt, appeared to be sealed as well, amid confusion over whether the neighboring country would allow anyone to exit Gaza.\n\nAn offensive even more powerful than Israel's previous shelling of Gaza appeared imminent. “We are going to attack Gaza City very broadly soon,” Israel’s chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said in a nationally broadcast address, without giving a timetable for the attack.\n\nOver 2 million people live in the Gaza, an area of about 139 square miles. The northern part of territory includes Gaza City, the 63rd-most densely inhabited urban region in the world. Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip, stopping entry of food, and has said it would continue its siege until Hamas returned dozens of hostages taken last weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday reiterated U.S. support for Israel's efforts to defend itself, while noting that care should be taken to protect civilians.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, a top Hamas official, said that “all the massacres” will not break the Palestinian people.\n\nAttacks continued, with Hamas launching rockets into Israel and Israel carrying out strikes in Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry said Friday that roughly 1,800 people have been killed in the territory. The Israeli military said more than 1,300 people, including 222 soldiers, have been killed in Israel.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n∎ The number of U.S. citizens who have died amid the conflict has risen to 29, according to a Saturday statement from the State Department. That's up from the 22 people reported dead on Wednesday. Additionally, 15 U.S. citizens remained unaccounted for on Saturday, the statement says.\n\n∎ The World Health Organization on Saturday condemned Israel's evacuation orders for 22 hospitals in northern Gaza, where over 2,000 patients are being treated. The WHO says forcing sick and injured patients to move \"could be tantamount to a death sentence.\"\n\n∎ Israel is \"preparing to implement a wide range of offensive operative plans\" in the Gaza strip involving air, ground and naval forces, its military said on Saturday.\n\n∎ The Israeli military said its troops conducted temporary raids into Gaza on Friday to battle militants and hunted for traces of some 150 people – including men, women and children – who were abducted during Hamas’ shocking assault on southern Israel.\n\n∎ Patients and medical staff of Al Awda Hospital in Gaza spent part of their night on the street “with bombs landing in close proximity,” following Israel’s orders to evacuate the facility, the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders said.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war newsletter:Sign up to get the latest news and analysis from USA TODAY in your inbox.\n\nSecond U.S aircraft carrier group sent to the region\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday ordered a second aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean as tensions mounted ahead of an expected Israeli invasion of Gaza. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier strike group will join the USS Gerald R. Ford and its associated warships. Earlier in the week, the Pentagon also deployed additional warplanes to the Middle East to deter adversaries such as Iran and its proxy force, Hezbollah, from widening the conflict that began last week after Hamas militants attacked Israel. “The increases to U.S. force posture signal the United States' ironclad commitment to Israel’s security and our resolve to deter any state or non-state actor seeking to escalate this war,” Austin said in a statement late Saturday.\n\n-- Tom Vanden Brook\n\nIran's foreign minister warns Israel to stop Gaza attacks\n\nIran’s foreign minister on Saturday called on Israel to stop its attacks on Gaza, warning that the war might expand to other parts of the Middle East if Hezbollah joins the battle, and that would make Israel suffer “a huge earthquake.”\n\nHossein Amirabdollahian told reporters in Beirut that he met Friday with Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, a leader of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group, which is funded heavily by Iran and which Israel considers its most serious threat.\n\n“I know about the scenarios that Hezbollah has put in place,” Amirabdollahian said. “Any step the resistance (Hezbollah) will take will cause a huge earthquake in the Zionist entity.”\n\nAmirabdollahian added: “I want to warn the war criminals and those who support this entity before it's too late to stop the crimes against civilians in Gaza, because it might be too late in few hours.”\n\nWith an eye toward Hezbollah, President Joe Biden has warned other players in the Middle East not to join the conflict and has sent American warships to the region and vowed full support for Israel.\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nHostages need medicine, say relatives of Israelis taken captive by Hamas\n\nThe relatives of Israelis taken captive by Hamas are demanding Saturday that the militant group allow in medicine to hostages who require it, saying their loved ones are suffering.\n\n“Every day without her medication is torture. She’s being tortured,” said Yifat Zailer, who said her kidnapped 63-year-old aunt has Parkinson’s disease. She was taken along with several other family members, Zailer said.\n\nIn its assault on southern Israeli communities, Hamas militants captured dozens of Israelis and some foreign or dual nationals, including children, women and the elderly, dragging them into the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsraeli military spokesman Read Adm. Daniel Hagari said Saturday Israel had so far identified 126 captives. Their fate becomes more complicated as Israel continues its bombardment of Gaza.\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nPeople in Gaza face growing crisis as taps run dry\n\nWater had stopped coming out of taps altogether in some parts of Gaza. Amal Abu Yahia, a 25-year-old pregnant mother in the Jabaliya refugee camp, told the Associated Press she waits anxiously for the few minutes each day or every other day when contaminated water trickles from the pipes in her basement. She then rations it, prioritizing her 5-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter. She said she is drinking so little herself, she only urinates every other day.\n\nMohammed Ibrahim, 28, said his neighbors in Gaza City have been drinking the salt water coming out of the taps, contaminated with Mediterranean Sea water because of the lack of sanitation facilities.\n\nRami Swailem said he and a handful of other families in his building are staying in Gaza City: “We are rooted in our lands ... We prefer to die in dignity and face our destiny.”\n\nOthers looked desperately for a way out.\n\n“What we know is that hundreds of thousands of people have fled. And that 1 million people have been displaced in total in one week,” Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, said.\n\nThe agency said many people – particularly pregnant women, children, older people and people with disabilities – will not be able to flee the area. And UNICEF has called for an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian access into Gaza, saying children and families in Gaza have practically run out of food, water, electricity, medicine and safe access to hospitals.\n\nTens of thousands seek shelter in Gaza City hospital\n\nAbout 35,000 people have crammed into the grounds of Gaza City's main hospital ahead of the expected Israeli ground offensive, said Mohammad Abu Selim, general director of Shifa Hospital.\n\n“People think this is the only safe space after their homes were destroyed and they were forced to flee,” said Dr. Medhat Abbas, a Health Ministry official. “Gaza City is a frightening scene of devastation.”\n\nBlinken calls for protecting civilians\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday called for protecting civilians and expressed support for Israel's campaign to topple Hamas, whose fighters took more than 100 people hostage during last Saturday’s attack.\n\n“As Israel pursues its legitimate right, to defending its people and to trying to ensure that this never happens again, it is vitally important that all of us look out for civilians, and we’re working together to do exactly that,” Blinken said.\n\nA U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity told the Associated Press Saturday that Washington stressed the importance of the safety of civilians as Israel moved to enforce evacuations, but did not ask Israel to slow or hold off the evacuations.\n\n\"None of us want to see suffering by civilians on any side, whether it’s in Israel, whether it’s in Gaza, whether it’s anywhere else,\" Blinken said.\n\nIsraeli-Palestinian crisis fuels disputes at US colleges\n\nCollege campuses across the United States have hosted rallies and counterprotests, setting off tensions and some violence between factions with opposing views and prompting concerns about student safety.\n\nThis past week:\n\n— Krystal Nurse, USA TODAY, with contributions from Sarah Al-Arshani, USA TODAY; and Lily Kepner, Austin American-Statesman\n\nReuters journalist, killed in shelling in Lebanon, laid to rest\n\nIssam Abdallah, a Reuters videographer who was killed while gathered with a group of international journalists along the Israel-Lebanon border during an exchange of fire, was laid to rest Saturday with a funeral procession that drew hundreds of mourners.\n\nSeveral journalists were also injured on Friday, including two other Reuters journalists and two Al-Jazeera TV employees, the news agencies said. The Associated Press reported an Israeli shell struck the journalists.\n\nLebanon’s Foreign Ministry asked Beirut’s mission to the United Nations to file a complaint against Israel over Friday’s shelling calling it a “flagrant violation and a crime against freedom of opinion and press.” The statement was carried by the state-run National News Agency.\n\nIsraeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht did not confirm to the Associated Press in Jerusalem Saturday that the journalists were hit by an Israeli shell but said, “We are aware of the incident with the Reuters journalist and we are looking into it ... we're very sorry for his death.\"\n\nWhy can't people leave Gaza entirely?\n\nThe Gaza Strip is surrounded by blockades imposed by Israel and Egypt.\n\nEgyptian officials have long tried to encourage Palestinians to remain in their territory, in part because accepting refugees could widen the longstanding regional conflict.

Meanwhile, the Iran-backed Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into Israel on Saturday in retaliation\n\nThey also talked about how to speed up humanitarian aid to Gaza, which has been under siege for months while humanitarian groups warn of civilian deaths, hunger and illness ravaging the territory. Israel’s air, ground and sea assault on Gaza has killed more than 22,400 people, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nIt is Blinken's fourth trip to the Middle East since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks that killed about 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, in which another 240 people were taken captive and held hostage in the Gaza Strip.\n\nDuring his trip, Blinken is also scheduled to travel to Israel, the West Bank, Egypt, Qatar, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, according to a statement from Matthew Miller, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State. Blinken also met with Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Saturday.\n\nBlinken will underscore the \"importance of protecting civilian lives\" in Gaza and the West Bank, ensuring Palestinians are \"not forcibly displaced from Gaza,\" and the secure release of hostages, who remain in captivity, Miller said.\n\nThe top U.S. diplomat will also \"discuss urgent mechanisms to stem violence, calm rhetoric, and reduce regional tensions,\" including deterring the attacks of Houthi rebels on vessels in the Red Sea and avoiding escalation in Lebanon.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Israeli military said it struck more than 100 targets throughout Gaza on Friday, killing an unspecified number \"of operatives\" and destroying multiple \"operational command centers and military sites.\"\n\n∎ The Palestinian Red Crescent, an independent humanitarian aid group, said on X that its headquarters in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis was hit by an Israeli airstrike. The group also said Israeli forces aimed gunfire at one of its ambulances in Central Gaza. The crew inside the vehicle reportedly survived.\n\n∎ At least six people were killed in an apparent Israeli airstrike on a home in Rafah overnight, according to the Associated Press. Rafah, in the southern portion of Gaza, is where over a million Palestinians have crowded after they fled their homes. About 85% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war.\n\n∎ France announced a joint operation with Jordan to airdrop 7.7 tons of medical aid to a Gaza field hospital. “The humanitarian situation remains critical in Gaza,” French President Emmanuel Macron said Friday on X. “In a difficult context, France and Jordan delivered aid to the population and to those who are helping them.”\n\n∎ Former Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday he visited Israel’s Northern Command and met with soldiers near the Lebanon border. “Ever since October 7th, these courageous Israelis, several of whom are also American citizens, left families and home to stand strong for Israel. God Bless Them All,” Pence said.\n\nHezbollah launches rockets after suspected Israeli strike\n\nHezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group in Lebanon, launched dozens of rockets into northern Israel on Saturday and said it was an initial response after the targeted killing of a top Hamas leader presumably carried out by Israel.\n\nThe attacks come a day after Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a televised speech that the group must respond to the killing of the Hamas official or face exposure to further operations by Israel's military.\n\nHe said Hezbollah \"cannot be silent about a violation of this seriousness,\" referring to the airstrike in Beirut that killed Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday. While Nasrallah, Lebanon state media and others blamed Israel for the attack, no party has yet claimed responsibility.\n\nArouri, who had a $5 million U.S. information bounty on his head, was believed by Israeli and U.S. national security officials to be involved in the funding and training of Hamas militants who carried out the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.\n\nIn a statement credited to Hezbollah earlier this week, the group vowed not to let Arouri’s death go unpunished, characterizing it as a “dangerous development in the course of the war between the enemy and the axis of resistance.”\n\nNasrallah said about 670 operations have been carried out by Hezbollah along the border between Israel and Lebanon since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. He said the group's operations have \"destroyed a large number of Israeli vehicles and tanks\" and killed \"a large number of Israeli troops.\" He did not provide any specific number. The Israeli military has said at least nine of its soldiers have died in the skirmishes along the country's northern border.\n\nUN: 'Death and despair' in Gaza\n\nThe United Nations' relief chief on Friday called for the international community to use its influence to end the war, and described \"death and despair\" unfolding in Gaza since Oct. 7.\n\n\"Gaza has simply become uninhabitable. Its people are witnessing daily threats to their very existence – while the world watches on,\" Martin Griffiths, undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement.\n\nGriffiths said people in Gaza are experiencing the highest levels of food insecurity ever recorded; families are sleeping out in the open while temperatures drop; areas previously declared safe are under bombardment; and a health crisis is underway.\n\nTens of thousands of people, mostly women and children, have been killed or injured, he said.\n\n\"We have seen how violence cannot resolve differences, but only inflame passions and build new generations of danger and insecurity,\" Griffiths said.\n\nWatchdog group warns of unauthorized Israeli settlements during war\n\nA record number of unauthorized outposts by Israeli settlers have cropped up in areas of the occupied West Bank since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, according to a new report by Israeli watchdog group Peace Now.\n\nNine outposts and 18 roads have been created by settlers since Oct. 7, a record for any three-month span since settlements began in the 1990s, Peace Now said in its report. The report also said settlers have constructed roadblocks, restricting the movement of Palestinians.\n\nAccording to the report, the settlements are in parts of the West Bank under full Israeli control, according to 1990s accords. Israel says the territory is disputed and that the fate of settlements should be negotiated. The international community considers settlements illegal, because the Fourth Geneva Convention bars an occupying power from transferring parts of its civilian population into occupied territory.\n\nMore than half-a-million Israelis live in settlements in the West Bank and in east Jerusalem, areas Palestinians seek for a future state.\n\nThe new outposts include tents or simple structures, but many similar outposts have been developed into more permanent settlements over the years.\n\n\"They persist in constructing outposts on private Palestinian lands, defining open areas, and restricting Palestinian movement in the West Bank,\" Peace Now said.\n\nAccording to the U.N., 2023 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank with 507 people killed since the agency began recording casualties nearly two decades ago. It was also a record year for the number of Israelis killed in the West Bank and Israel from attacks by Palestinians with 36 fatalities recorded.\n\nSince Oct. 7, 314 Palestinians – including 80 children – have been killed in the West Bank, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Israeli forces have injured 3,949 others, including 593 children, OCHA added.\n\n2nd Biden administration official quits over war\n\nA Department of Education policy adviser appointed by the Biden administration quit this week over the White House’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nTariq Habash became at least the second official, and the first known official of Palestinian origin, to resign from the administration in protest of President Joe Biden’s actions regarding the war. State Department veteran Josh Paul resigned in October as the U.S. accelerated arms transfers to Israel.\n\nHabash confirmed on X that he resigned on Wednesday.\n\n“I cannot represent an administration that systematically dehumanizes Palestinians and enables their ethnic cleansing. The President must call for a permanent ceasefire,” he said.\n\nHabash had been among staffers of Middle East, Muslim and Jewish backgrounds who were taking part in meetings with senior White House officials and others in the administration regarding concerns over the U.S. role in the war. Habash described the sessions as briefings from higher-ups rather than opportunities for staffers to be heard.\n\nThe former Biden administration appointee worked in the education department to help overhaul the student loan system and address inequities in higher education.\n\nUNICEF: Gaza's 1.1 million children face malnutrition, diseases\n\nCases of malnutrition and indications of deteriorating health conditions have surged among Gaza's 1.1 million children as well as other vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, UNICEF said in a statement on Friday.\n\nAbout 90% of children under 2 are consuming two or fewer food groups, according to a UNICEF survey conducted on Dec. 26. Most families who participated in the survey said their children were only eating grains or milk, meeting the definition of “severe food poverty,\" UNICEF said.\n\nAmong pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, of which there are over 155,000 in Gaza, 25% said they ate only one food type the day before, while almost 65% said two.\n\nThe U.N. agency also said cases of diarrhea in children under 5 rose from 48,000 to 71,000 in one week in mid-December – \"a strong indication that child health in the Gaza Strip is fast deteriorating.\"\n\n“Children in Gaza are caught in a nightmare that worsens with every passing day,” Catherine Russell, UNICEF’s executive director, said in a statement. “The futures of thousands more children in Gaza hang in the balance. The world cannot stand by and watch. The violence and the suffering of children must stop.\"\n\nWith Gaza's overwhelmed and understocked hospitals focusing on the large number of wounded patients, they are \"unable to adequately treat disease outbreaks,\" according to UNICEF.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of clean water makes it nearly impossible for Palestinians to maintain the necessary hygiene levels needed to prevent disease. The World Health Organization said this week over 180,000 people in Gaza are suffering from upper respiratory infections; more than 5,000 chickenpox cases have been reported; and lice and scabies are affecting 55,000 people.\n\nIsraeli hostage, 38, dies in captivity\n\nTamir Adar, a 38-year-old Israeli who was taken hostage on Oct. 7, has died in captivity, according to the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum. A cause of death was not provided.\n\nAdar lived in Kibbutz Nir Oz community, where 40 people were abducted during Hamas' deadly attack in Israeli border communities, which left 1,200 people, mostly civilians, dead. Of the 250 people taken hostage, the Israeli military says about 113 are still being held captive in Gaza following a weeklong cease-fire in November.\n\nAdar's grandmother, 85-year-old Yaffa Adar, was taken hostage in the incursion. She was among more than 100 hostages released during the temporary cease-fire.\n\nIsraeli official lays out vision for next phase of war\n\nIsrael's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in a statement on Thursday presented his vision for the next phase of the war in Gaza and how the territory would be run after Israel achieves its stated goal of defeating Hamas.\n\nGallant said operations in northern Gaza, where entire neighborhoods have been destroyed, would slow to a less intensive, more targeted \"combat approach\" in which military forces would focus on raids, destroying tunnel networks, “air and ground activities and special operations.\" Israel has in recent days begun to withdraw troops from northern Gaza, signaling a potential scale-down in operations.\n\nMeanwhile, combat in southern Gaza, where most of Gaza's displaced population has sought refuge, will go on \"for as long as necessary,\" Gallant said.\n\nGallant added that, after the war, Israel would hold onto military control in the region while Palestinian local civil servants or communal leaders would run the territory, with Israel providing “information to guide civilian operations.\" The U.S. would be in charge of a task force that would lead a rebuilding effort.\n\nThe vision is a stark contrast from proposals from U.S. officials, including Biden, who had previously said he'd like the Palestinian Authority to take control of the region.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Jorge L.

It said the blast killed a total of six people and was carried out by an Israeli drone.\n\nThe Lebanese state-run news agency also tweeted a statement that it said had been released by Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based Hamas ally, in which it mourned Arouri “and a number of his fellow mujahideen.”\n\n“We consider the assassination of Sheikh Saleh al-Arouri and his martyred comrades in the heart of the southern suburbs of Beirut a serious attack on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty and resistance,” according to the statement attributed to Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah, U.S.-designated terrorist group that is also a political force in Lebanon, vowed not to let Arouri’s death go unpunished, characterizing it as a “dangerous development in the course of the war between the enemy and the axis of resistance.”\n\nIsrael has not yet commented on the alleged strike, and the Israel Defense Forces had no immediate confirmation when asked by USA TODAY. \"The IDF has no comment,\" a spokesman said in a text message.\n\nIsrael committed to \"settling accounts\" with Hamas\n\nOn Wednesday, the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service vowed to hunt down every Hamas member involved in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, much like the spy agency did after the 1972 terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics.\n\nIn that case, Palestinian gunmen killed 11 Israeli athletes and coaches in a raid at the athletes' village in Munich in what became the worst terror attack in Olympic history.\n\nThe Mossad is “committed to settling accounts with the murderers” behind Oct. 7, Barnea said while speaking at the funeral of former Mossad head Zvi Zamir, who died a day earlier at the age of 98.\n\n“It’ll take time, as it took time after the Munich massacre, but we will put our hands on them wherever they are,” Barnea said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHowever, Barnea has not commented on whether or not Israel is behind Arouri's apparent assassination.\n\nAlso Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Matt Miller declined to comment on whether Israel was behind the strike that killed Arouri and at least a few others in a Beirut suburb.\n\n“I don't have an assessment to make about who was responsible for that incident. I'll leave it to the Government of Israel to speak to their actions,” Miller said at the daily press briefing.\n\nAsked when the Biden administration was informed about the strike in Beirut, Miller replied, “I'm not going to get into that specific detail, but we were not informed in advance.”\n\nJohn Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security matters, said the U.S. is not in position to confirm reports of Arouri’s death but defended Israel's right to go after the organization's leadership.\n\n“Israel has a right and responsibility to go after the threat that Hamas poses, which means they have a right and responsibility to go after the leadership of Hamas,” Kirby said. “We expect that they will do that in accordance with international law.”\n\nHe said: “I would just tell you, Arouri was a noted, designated global terrorist. And if he is in fact dead, nobody should be shedding a tear over his loss.”\n\n'A shadowy guy'\n\nBased in Lebanon, Arouri, believed to be 57, was a top leader of Hamas’ political bureau and was considered by many to be the de facto leader of its military wing in the West Bank. He had also traveled widely in recent years, operating from Turkey and Qatar before setting up a Hamas operation in Lebanon where Hamas fighters could train.\n\nLast November, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that he had told Israel’s premiere intelligence agency, the Mossad, to find and neutralize the heads of Hamas wherever they reside in the wake of the October 7 assault on southern Israel.\n\n“They are looking for him like the Americans were looking for bin Laden\" after 9/11, Udi Levy, former head of economic warfare for Mossad, told USA TODAY in its Oct. 20 story. \"He is a shadow guy. He is under the radar. And believe me, these are the dangerous people, people like that.\"\n\nLevy confirmed Arouri's death on Tuesday based on contacts within the Israeli government. \"Yes, I'm very happy,\" Levy told USA TODAY.\n\nDig deeper:He's a key link between Hamas and Iran. Now Israel is hunting the world to find him\n\nQuestions about targeted killings outside Israel − and Gaza\n\nArouri’s death raises questions about whether – and where – Israel can target and kill suspected leaders of Hamas in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks. Netanyahu and other Israel leaders say it is their right to do so, while others disagree, citing international laws regarding sovereignty and the rule of law.\n\nIsrael's similar campaign of assassinations after the 1972 Munich attacks, raised significant legal questions that have yet to be definitively resolved.\n\nIn a follow-up X posting after confirming Arouri’s death, Lebanon’s National News Agency said, “The bombing of the suburb is a declaration of war on Lebanon after the failure of the criminal machine to achieve its goals in Gaza,” in an apparent reference to Israel.\n\nLevy and other current and former Israeli intelligence officials told USA TODAY in October that they believe Arouri was involved in numerous other terrorist attacks against Israel, and of being the conduit between Hamas, Iran and Hezbollah that gave the Palestinian organization the capability to pull off the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel.\n\nThough experts told USA TODAY in October that they did not yet know what specific role Arouri might have played on Oct. 7, they said they saw him at the heart of a changing − and alarming − dynamic in which these three U.S.-designated terrorist entities are teaming up and further destabilizing the Middle East under the direction of Tehran.\n\n“With him, I cannot go into details about the involvement,” Danny Danon, an Israeli lawmaker who sits on the Knesset foreign affairs committee, told USA TODAY when asked about Arouri. “But I can tell you that Iran is heavily involved with everything that's happening in Gaza – the training, equipment, funding and method of fighting.”\n\n“We have knowledge of collaboration between Tehran, Beirut and Gaza,” said Danon, who also was Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations. “We are worried that the technology came from Tehran to Beirut and to Gaza.”\n\nAnd Arouri, he said, “was heavily involved in that triangle.”\n\nArouri was a founding commander of the the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas that carried out the attacks.\n\nAnd despite having spent years under U.S. terror sanctions, he traveled widely in the region, including in and out of Iran. Arouri also collaborated with terrorist figures including the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force paramilitary group, Qasem Soleimani, before he was killed by a U.S. airstrike in early 2020, Danon and other current and former Israeli and U.S. intelligence officials told USA TODAY.\n\nWashington offered the reward of up to $5 million for information about Arouri in November 2018, saying he was \"currently living freely in Lebanon\" and reportedly working with Soleimani, and that he had been linked to \"several terrorist attacks, hijackings, and kidnappings.\"\n\nWill Israel target more Hamas leaders internationally?\n\nRichard Goldberg, a Trump administration Iran official, predicted that the strike that killed Arouri is just the first by Israel as it expands its counterattack on Hamas.\n\n“Israel sent a message to all terror allies of Iran that no matter where they hide, they will never be secure,” said Goldberg, who served as the National Security Council director for Countering Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction from 2019 to 2020. “Whether Hamas leaders reside in Qatar, Turkey, Lebanon, or another country, they should assume their days are numbered.”\n\n“Hezbollah’s leadership,” Goldberg said in a post for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank, “must also factor this escalation into the group’s next move.”\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/11/01/israel-hamas-gaza-war-live-updates/71405089007/", "title": "Israel and Hamas war updates: Americans, others allowed to exit Gaza", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest news on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here.\n\nIsraeli troops were knocking on the \"gates of Gaza City'' on Wednesday, reaching the densely populated urban center as hundreds of people − including some Americans − were allowed to escape the Gaza Strip through its southern crossing with Egypt.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes pounded the Jabaliya refugee camp and killed a key Hamas figure for the second day in a row, while ground troops engaged in heavy fighting with militants in several locations. Hamas’ armed wing posted video purporting to show its fighters emerging from tunnels and firing rockets at Israeli tanks east of Gaza City.\n\nLess than a week after launching a modified ground incursion from three fronts, Israeli forces have made considerable headway. “We are located at the gates of Gaza City,” said Brig Gen. Itzik Cohen, commander of the 162nd Armored Division.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis intensified and the war's combined death toll reported by Palestinian and Israeli authorities climbed above 10,000, but in a rare peaceful development, Egypt allowed hundreds of foreign passport holders and dozens of seriously injured Palestinians trapped in Gaza to flee through the Rafah crossing.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said multiple Americans left Gaza and others are expected to follow suit in the coming days, but did not specify how many made it out. Department spokesman Matthew Miller said about 400 U.S. citizens are seeking to leave the territory, and along with their family members, the total trying to exit is close to 1,000.\n\n“We do expect to be able to get all our Americans out.

Internet and communication services have been repeatedly interrupted in Gaza and humanitarian aid agencies have warned that blackouts severely disrupt their work.\n\n∎ After being interrupted by a protester calling for a cease-fire during a fundraiser in Minneapolis, President Joe Biden said there should be a humanitarian halt of the war. “I think we need a pause,” Biden said in response. “A pause means give time to get the prisoners out.”\n\n∎ Jordan, an important U.S. ally in the region, recalled its ambassador from Israel and told Israel’s ambassador to remain out of the country because of the war \"and the humanitarian catastrophe it is causing,” Deputy Prime Minister Ayman al-Safadi said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to travel to Jordan on Friday after first meeting with Israeli officials.\n\n∎ The government of Cyprus said it is working toward sending ships loaded with medical supplies, food and clothing to Gaza after its president, Nikos Christodoulides, got the OK on Tuesday during a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n∎ U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “is appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza,” including the killing of Palestinians by Israeli airstrikes in the Jabaliya refugee camp Tuesday and Wednesday, his spokesman said.\n\n∎ The Palestinian death toll has reached 8,805, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, 130 Palestinians have been killed, authorities there said. More than 1,400 Israelis have died, most of them civilians killed in the first hours of the Oct. 7 Hamas rampage, Israeli authorities say. About 240 people were taken hostage.\n\nInside an American family's fight:Family desperate to free their loved ones held hostage by Hamas\n\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency reports 70 staff members dead\n\nIn a report issued Wednesday, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, also known as UNWRA, said the number of its workers killed in Gaza rose to 70.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, three additional UNRWA staff have been killed, bringing the total to 70 UNRWA colleagues killed since 7 October,\" the report states.\n\nUNWRA also reported that more than 690,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering in 149 UNRWA facilities across the Gaza Strip. The agency reiterated that available aid remains insufficient and providing humanitarian assistance continues to be a challenge due to lack of fuel, ongoing bombardment, and widespread destruction of infrastructure.\n\nUNRWA’s Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, crossed into Gaza on Wednesday and met with Palestinians and aid groups. In a statement that followed, Lazzarini called for a humanitarian ceasefire and \"urgent\" fuel deliveries to Gaza.\n\n“Our calls are falling on deaf ears. A humanitarian ceasefire is long overdue,\" Lazzarini said. \"Without it, more people will be killed, those who are alive will endure further losses, and the once vibrant society will be in grief, forever.\"\n\nPalestinian dual nationals, the injured among Gaza escapees\n\nAmong those escaping Gaza through Egypt were 335 foreign passport holders, mostly Palestinian dual nationals but also some foreigners, according to Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority. In addition, 67 critically wounded Palestinians and their companions were evacuated for treatment, and some personnel from aid organizations got out as well, Abu Omar said.\n\nEgypt is concerned about taking in Palestinian refugees whom Israel might not allow back after the war, and also about a mass exodus from Gaza that could bring Hamas members and other extremists to its population. Egypt has supported Israel's blockade of Gaza since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007.\n\nMore than 2 million Palestinians remain trapped in Gaza, many exposed to the Israeli airstrikes that followed the brutal attack by Hamas militants on Israeli border communities Oct. 7.\n\n\"The situation in shelters remains critical, with very limited assistance available and no additional space to accommodate the increasing number of internally displaced people,\" the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees said in a statement.\n\nThe UNRWA said more than 670,000 Palestinians living in about 150 UNWRA shelters across Gaza are \"facing deteriorating humanitarian conditions and health and protection risks.\" The organization itself is grappling with extreme danger, saying 70 of its workers have died in the war.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes target refugee camp for second day\n\nIsraeli airstrikes again hit apartment buildings in the Jabaliya refugee camp, a Hamas stronghold near Gaza City, causing an undetermined number of deaths and injuries, the Hamas-run government said. The Israeli military said it had \"significantly expanded\" ground operations in the area.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said in a tweet it \"eliminated'' Muhammad A'sar, describing him as the chief of Hamas’ anti-tank missile unit in Gaza and the leader of attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians.\n\nWednesday's assault came a day after a flurry of Israeli airstrikes on Jabaliya caused dozens of casualties, flattened apartment buildings and killed what the Israeli military said was a Hamas commander and numerous militants who had established headquarters in the camp. The buildings tumbled when Hamas tunnels beneath them collapsed, Israeli Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said at a press briefing Wednesday.\n\n\"These once again demonstrate how murderous terrorists use civilians as a ‘human shield,’ civilians whom we have called upon to evacuate for their own safety,\" Hagari said.\n\nThreats against Jews, Arabs and Muslims up since war started\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday's arrest of a Cornell University student for threatening Jewish students illustrated Justice Department coordination with local law enforcement to combat hate crimes.\n\nPatrick Dai, 21, of Pittsford, N.Y., was charged with posting threatening messages in an online discussion calling for the deaths of Jewish people. One post said “gonna shoot up 104 west,” referring to a dining hall that caters predominantly to Kosher diets located next to the Cornell Jewish Center.\n\nGarland noted a “significant increase in the volume and frequency” of threats against Jewish, Arab and Muslim communities nationwide since the start of the Israel-Hamas war Oct. 7.\n\n“As this arrest shows, we are focusing our efforts on confronting and disrupting illegal threats wherever they arise,” Garland said Wednesday at a Washington seminar for a program he initiated called “United Against Hate.” “The Justice Department has no tolerance for violence or unlawful threats of violence fueled by antisemitism or Islamophobia.”\n\nKristen Clarke, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, said reported hate crimes remain at the highest levels in more than a decade. Prosecuting the cases is a top priority, and more than 80 defendants have been charged since January 2021, she said.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nReporters Without Borders files war crimes complaints against both sides\n\nReporters Without Borders said Wednesday that it has filed a complaint for war crimes committed against some of the 34 journalists killed since the war began. The complaint includes eight Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza and one Israeli journalist in Israel. The group says the deaths justify an investigation by the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe complaint says the Palestinian journalists were killed − and two others wounded − in bombings of Gaza. The Israeli journalist was killed during Hamas’ attack in southern Israel the day the war began. Other deaths are still being investigated and could draw war crime complaints, the group said.\n\nThe group also cites the\" deliberate, total or partial, destruction\" of the newsrooms of more than 50 media outlets in Gaza.\n\nWhite House developing plan to combat Islamophobia\n\nThe Biden administration is developing a national strategy to combat Islamophobia amid skepticism from many Muslim Americans, the Associated Press reported, citing people briefed on the matter. AP said the the White House originally was expected to announce plans to develop the strategy last week but was delayed partly because of concerns from Muslim Americans that the administration lacked credibility given its zealous support of Israel.\n\nThe launch has been anticipated since the administration in May released a national strategy to combat antisemitism that made passing reference to countering hatred against Muslims.\n\nLebanon prime minister calls for five-day cease-fire\n\nNajib Mikati, leading Lebanon's paralyzed government, called Wednesday for a five-day cease-fire for humanitarian purposes as Hezbollah and Israeli troops continue to clash along Lebanon's border. Mikati, struggling to keep the war from expanding into his country, said the pause would accommodate prisoner exchanges and allow for talks aimed at ending the fighting.\n\n\"The decision to go to war today is in Israel's hands,\" Mikati said.\n\nIsrael, which has steadfastly rejected previous calls for a cease-fire, said Wednesday that its military had intercepted a surface-to-air missile launched from Lebanese territory toward an Israeli drone. In response, Israeli aircraft struck the \"origin of the missile launch, as well as the terrorists who carried out the launch,\" the military said.\n\nClashes on the Lebanon-Israel border have also wounded Lebanese civilians, according to human rights agencies.\n\nTwo Lebanese shepherds were injured Wednesday and are now missing, according to a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping force on the border. UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said the Lebanese army had requested assistance from peacekeepers to evacuate two people near the border.\n\nThe Israeli army suspended fire to allow the Lebanese army and UNIFIL to search for the shepherds but Tenenti said they could not be found.\n\n“Due to the darkness and presence of land mines in the area, the search will have to resume in the morning,” Tenenti added.\n\nAnd human rights group Amnesty International said civilians in southern Lebanon have also been injured by Israeli forces using shells containing white phosphorus.\n\nHostage crisis brings war home to Brooklyn\n\nBrooklyn resident Alana Zeitchik's life has been in turmoil since Oct. 7, when her mother called in a panic, worrying about the fate of six Jewish family members in Israel taken hostage by Hamas. Zeitchik’s days have been a mix of news and social media hits ever since. Trips to the United Nations. Meetings with lawmakers. Long-distance texts and voice messages to her family back in Israel desperately trying to find their relatives.\n\n\"I can't wrap my brain around it.

Israel said it returned fire from militants but did not shell Indonesian Hospital.\n\nOf the original 39 premature babies authorities warned were endangered as fighting around Shifa intensified, eight have died. The surviving ones face an uphill battle after getting sick amid a lack of medicines, clean water and power for incubators along with other substandard conditions at the besieged Shifa, raided by Israeli forces last week.\n\n\"All babies are fighting serious infections and others conditions, and need specialized medical care,'' World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu said in a tweet that included a video showing the group effort to care for and transport the tiny infants.\n\nThe 31 babies were taken for stabilization Sunday to a hospital in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Three of them remain there in \"good health,'' the Palestine Red Crescent Society said.\n\nPart of the war has focused on north Gaza hospitals because Israel says Hamas uses the civilians there as human shields and that it operated a major command hub inside and beneath the 20-acre Shifa complex, a claim hospital officials and Hamas deny. The White House said Monday it has “corroborated” Israel's assertion.\n\nThe WHO has evacuated some patients and staff from embattled Shifa in recent days but said it remains gravely concerned about the safety and health needs of more than 250 patients and 20 health workers who remain.

President Joe Biden also said an agreement is near, without providing specifics.\n\n∎ The relatives of some Israeli hostages met Monday with top officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Udi Goren, whose cousin is captive in Gaza, said they were told the hostages won't be prioritized over crushing Hamas. “This is incredibly disappointing because … taking down Hamas, we keep hearing from them, is going to take months or years,” Goren said.\n\n∎ The Israeli military said its airstrikes killed three Hamas company commanders and destroyed a weapons depot where they were hiding.\n\n∎Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, met with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Monday in Qatar. The ICRC is seeking communication between the hostages and their families and also wants its teams to visit captives and bring them medication.\n\n∎ Israel said it found a 60-yard-long tunnel about 30 feet under Shifa Hospital grounds, claiming it represents more evidence that Hamas maintained a compound under the sprawling hospital facility..\n\n'Did we die?'A week in the life of a journalist in the Gaza Strip\n\nReport: Hamas chief says close truce agreement with Israel is close\n\nThe chief of Hamas told Reuters Tuesday that the Palestinian militant group was near a truce agreement with Israel. The news outlet said it received a statement from an aide of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh indicating that the group had delivered its response through Qatari mediators.\n\nThe statement did not give more information, Reuters added. A Hamas official said negotiations were centered on how long the truce would last, arrangements for delivery of aid, and the exchange of hostages, the news outlet reported citing Al Jazeera TV.\n\nHamas official Issat el Reshiq said both sides would free women and children, terms and details that will be announced by Qatar.\n\nOn Monday, the State of Qatar condemned Israel for bombing the Indonesian Hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, calling it “a blatant violation of international laws and agreements, especially the Fourth Geneva Convention.”\n\nWHO chief ‘appalled’ by attack on another Gaza hospital\n\nTedros said he was \"appalled\" by an attack on Indonesian Hospital that reportedly resulted in 12 deaths, including patients, and several critical and life-threatening injuries. Heavy fighting erupted around Indonesian Hospital as Israel continues to expand its offensive in the enclave.\n\n“Health workers and civilians should never have to be exposed to such horror, and especially while inside a hospital,” Tedros said in a social media post.\n\nMarwan Abdallah, a medical worker at the hospital, said dozens of Palestinians killed and wounded in overnight airstrikes and shelling at the nearby Jabaliya refugee camp were brought into the facility, and that Israeli tanks were less than 200 yards away.\n\nHundreds of patients, about 200 health care workers and 2,000 displaced Palestinians were sheltering at the health care center, Hamas Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said. Late Monday, he said roughly 200 wounded patients and their companions were evacuated to southern Gaza in a rescue effort coordinated by the U.N. and the Red Cross, and that 400 and 500 other wounded people remain.\n\nAccording to the U.N., a clinic operated by Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, was also hit in Gaza City on Monday. A building and five of the organizations' cars were burned and crushed by tank shelling, the U.N. said.\n\nTwenty-one people were in the clinic and might be in \"extreme danger,\" according to the U.N. Their status is unknown.\n\nParents of hostages discuss 'nightmare,' plea for release\n\nSeveral relatives of hostages being held by Hamas made an urgent plea for their release at a news conference Monday in London. The Irish father of Emily Hand, who turned 9 on Friday, pleaded for her release. Emily was originally feared dead after the assault on Kibbutz Be’eri in Israel on Oct. 7.\n\n''It's nightmare, an absolute nightmare,\" Thomas Hand said. \"The sheer terror of a 9-year-old-girl down in those dark tunnels, never seeing the light of day. Sheer terror, panic every hour of every day.\"\n\nHand said he prays for his daughter's return but said his family has been given virtually no information on the progress of talks aimed at freeing the captives. Officials in Qatar have said a deal is close for the release of some of the hostages in return for a temporary cease-fire.\n\n\"I don't know what condition she is going to be in, but she's going to be broken, very broken, mentally and physically,\" Thomas Hand said of his daughter. \"And we are going to have to fix that.\"\n\nUN chief mourns 'unparalleled' civilian deaths in Gaza, urges 2-state solution\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday decried the ''unprecedented'' loss of civilian lives, including thousands of children, as Israel expanded its bombardment of Gaza.\n\n“This is what matters,” Guterres said at a press briefing at U.N. headquarters in New York. “We are witnessing a killing of civilians that is unparalleled and unprecedented in any conflict\" since he became secretary general in 2017.\n\nPalestinian health authorities report a death toll of more than 11,500 since the war began Oct. 7, including about 5,500 children. Guterres said it is crucial that the world seizes an opportunity from tragedy unfolding in Gaza to create a two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli crisis.\n\nU.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Lynn Hastings on World's Children Day appealed for all parties to \"protect Palestinian and Israeli children and their rights.\" This is the largest child mass-casualty in all war zones since 2019, the U.N. said citing the charity Save the Children.\n\nIsrael releases videos it says shows hostages in Gaza hospital\n\nThe Israeli military released multiple videos it says shows Hamas militants \"forcibly transporting hostages\" inside Shifa Hospital on Oct. 7, the day Hamas militants seized them during the rampage that left more than 1,200 people dead. The military said the videos show a Nepalese civilian and a Thai civilian, who were kidnapped from Israeli territory. In one of the videos a person is being dragged along a hospital corridor; another shows a bleeding person on a gurney. Israeli vehicles stolen during the attack can also be seen inside the hospital compound, the military said.\n\n\"These findings add to previous evidence presented regarding Hamas’ use of the hospital area as infrastructure for its terrorist activities in a systematic and ongoing manner,\" the military said.\n\nIsrael says its soldier was killed by Hamas, not airstrike\n\nAn Israeli army corporal being held by Hamas was killed by her captors, not by an Israeli airstrike as the militants claimed, the Israeli military says.\n\nHamas says the airstrike Nov. 9 killed Cpl. Noa Marciano, a 19-year-old whose body was recovered last week in Gaza. But Israel says a militant holding Marciano, captured during the Oct. 7 Hamas rampage through Israeli border communities, was killed and Marciano was wounded when the airstrike hit an apartment near Shifa Hospital.\n\n“The pathology report states that Noa was injured by the strike, but not in a life-threatening way, and this is contrary to the lies published by Hamas,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesperson, said late Sunday. “According to intelligence information, Noa was taken inside the walls of Shifa Hospital, where she was murdered by a Hamas terrorist.”\n\nThe Israeli military said it sends its “heartfelt condolences to the Marciano family” and will continue to support them while working toward the return of the more than 200 hostages believed held by militants in Gaza.\n\nEU official accused of double standard\n\nEU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell is facing backlash in the Arab world over what is being viewed as a double standard for his comments Sunday on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza. Borrell was asked by Al Jazeera whether he believed Israel's attack constituted a war crime.\n\n“Well, I’m not a lawyer, but there’s an International Court of Justice that’ll investigate and I’ll abide by their decision,” Borrell said.\n\nWhen asked specifically whether the Hamas attack Oct. 7 was a war crime, Borrell said it was. When pressed on why he was willing to judge Hamas but not Israel, Borrell denied applying a double standard but acknowledged that \"you are right, we should let the International Criminal Court decide.\" The interview circulated widely on social media, drawing outrage from some Palestinians.\n\nDarine Dandachly of Lebanon posted that \"you are not a lawyer but you are a complicit in genocide against the Palestinians.\" Another social media post by #UncensorPalestine said \"there you have it. Evident display of racism and double standards.\"\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/02/10/israel-hamas-war-gaza-live-updates/72551342007/", "title": "Israel Hamas updates: Rafah ground invasion expected; fatal airstrikes", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Israel-Hamas war for Saturday, Feb. 10. For the latest news on the conflict in the Middle East, view our live updates file for Sunday, Feb. 11.\n\nThe United Nations is “extremely worried” about civilians in Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, after Israel has ramped up airstrikes in the area ahead of an expected ground invasion.\n\nOn Friday, Stéphane Dujarric, a U.N. spokesperson, said people in the city that borders Egypt must be protected and not face forced displacement. Already, 1.4 million people, more than half of Gaza’s population, are packed into the the city that was about 280,000 people before the start of the war.\n\nAt least 28,000 Palestinian people have died since the start of the war, according to latest figures from the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. About 70% of the dead are women and children, the ministry says. Another 8,000 are missing under rubble.\n\nApproximately one in four Gazans are starving, the U.N. said.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war:Virgin Voyages, Carnival alter itineraries to avoid Red Sea amid continued attacks\n\nOver four months ago, Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped about 250 people. More than 130 of them remain as hostages, though it’s estimated approximately 30 people are dead.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden recently said Israel’s military response has been \"over the top,\" but the White House on Friday maintained U.S. policy remains the same in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nDevelopments:\n\nIsrael’s military said it discovered Hamas tunnels under the headquarters of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza. The Associated Press reported it doesn’t definitively prove Hamas operated under the agency’s headquarters in Gaza City. The UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said the recent media reports merit an independent inquiry, which isn’t possible in an active war zone.\n\nMoody’s Investors Service downgraded Israel’s credit rating, citing its war in Gaza as the primary reason. The war is estimated to cost $70 billion over two years, according to Moody’s, citing the Bank of Israel.\n\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society on Saturday said a 6-year-old girl missing for two weeks was found dead alongside two rescuers who searched for her in Gaza City.\n\nAdditional cruise lines are avoiding the Red Sea amid continued attacks in the area by Houthi militants backed by Iran.\n\nOn Saturday, U.S. Central Command said its forces struck Houthi targets as a defensive measure. The targets included two mobile unmanned surface vessels, four mobile anti-ship cruise missiles and a mobile land attack cruise missile.\n\n'Disastrous consequences' if Israel moves forward with Rafah ground invasion, mediators warn\n\nMediators, neighbors and allies of Israel gave stark warnings about a possible ground invasion of Rafah, where over a million displaced Gazans have crowded amid the ongoing war.\n\nAny Israeli ground offensive in the Gaza Strip's southernmost city would have \"disastrous consequences,\" said Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry. Egyptian officials have warned that moving Palestinians into Egypt would threaten the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt that is four decades old.\n\nQatar, a key mediator in negotiations between Israel and Hamas, also warned Israel, as did Saudi Arabia about \"serious repercussions.\"\n\nIsrael's offensive on Rafah would be a \"human catastrophe,\" said Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister for Germany, an ally of Israel.\n\n\"The people in Gaza cannot disappear into thin air,\" she said in a social media post.\n\nThe U.S., Israel's most important ally, has increasingly grown critical of Israel's handling of the war. Still, the White House has downplayed comments made by President Joe Biden on Thursday.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes kill 44 Palestinians in Rafah\n\nIsraeli airstrikes hitting Rafah on Saturday killed at least 44 Palestinians, about a third of them children, health officials told the Associated Press, which also had journalists who saw bodies arriving to local hospitals.\n\nThe strikes came hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he requested a military plan to evacuate thousands of people for a ground invasion. No timeline was given.\n\nIsraeli drone strike in Lebanon kills two, wounds Hamas official\n\nIsrael launched a drone strike in Lebanon on Saturday, killing at least two people and wounding two more, the Associated Press reported. The strike occurred 37 miles from the border with Israel, near the port town of Jadra.\n\nOne of the wounded was Hamas leader Basel Saleh, according to the Associated Press, citing an Israeli security official who said he had been injured to an “unknown extent.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Saleh led recruitment for Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe strike is believed to be one of Israel’s farthest strikes. In early January, Israel killed a Hamas official in a suburb of Beirut, located more than 20 miles north of Saturday’s strike near Jadra.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel Defense Forces also announced they struck several Iran-backed Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.\n\nIn Gaza, IDF said it killed a senior operative for Hamas in Rafah in an airstrike. The IDF identified the official as Ahmed Eliakubi, who oversaw security for senior leaders and was a senior commander in Rafah. Israeli officials said two other operatives were killed in the strike.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/11/03/israel-hamas-gaza-war-live-updates/71434474007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war updates: Hezbollah leader speaks; US drones", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest news on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see Saturday's updates file here.\n\nOn Friday, Israel fired an airstrike on an ambulance outside of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, killing at least 15 people and injuring 50 others, according to health authorities in Gaza, CNN reported.\n\nIsrael Defense Forces said in a statement that they targeted the ambulance because it was being used by Hamas and carrying militants, according to Reuters.\n\n“An IDF aircraft struck an ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in close proximity to their position in the battle zone,” the statement reads. \"A number of Hamas terrorist operatives were killed in the strike.\"\n\nDr. Ashraf Al-Qidra, a spokeperson for the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, concurred that Israel was responsible for the attack on the vehicle, which was headed to the Rafah Crossing, CNN reported.\n\nOfficial: Hamas tried to get its wounded fighters out of Gaza\n\nThe Palestinian militant group Hamas tried to secure passage out of the Gaza Strip for some its wounded fighters as part of an agreement that allowed for limited evacuations from the besieged territory, a U.S. official said Friday.\n\nHamas’ demands during negotiations with Egypt, Israel and the U.S. slowed down the talks, said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\n\nHamas said it would allow foreign nationals to leave through the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza as long as a number of wounded Palestinians were on the list, the official said. But once negotiators vetted the list of possible evacuees provided by Hamas, they discovered that one-third of them were Hamas fighters, the official said.\n\n“It was just unacceptable to Egypt, to us, to Israel,” the official said.\n\nThe deal that was eventually reached allowed wounded Palestinian civilians, but not Hamas fighters, to leave Gaza along with foreign passport holders. More than 1,000 people, including more than 100 Americans, have evacuated Gaza since the arrangement was announced Wednesday.\n\nIsrael 'refuses a temporary cease-fire that doesn’t include a return of our hostages'\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials about \"concrete steps\" to minimize the deaths of civilians in Gaza, securing the release of more hostages, increasing humanitarian aid to the region and the ongoing ground offensive as Israeli forces encircle Gaza City.\n\nBlinken stressed the United States' support for Israel's right to defend itself with the caveat that how Israel carries out its military campaign to defeat Hamas \"matters,\" adding that it threatens to limit public support and eventual peace talks. He did not offer details about the steps he discussed with Israeli officials, including the humanitarian pauses he and President Joe Biden have encouraged.\n\nShortly after Blinken spoke in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said in a statement that Israel \"refuses a temporary cease-fire that doesn’t include a return of our hostages.”\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of stranded Palestinian laborers in Israel and the West Bank have been expelled and began their return to the besieged enclave.\n\nAt the Rafah crossing, more foreign nationals and wounded Palestinians in Gaza were allowed to leave the Gaza Strip on Friday under an apparent agreement among the U.S., Egypt, Israel and Qatar, which mediates with Hamas. Over 800 people have escaped since Wednesday's partial opening of the Rafah crossing, the only viable way out of Gaza.\n\nIsrael has allowed over 260 trucks carrying food, water and medicines through the Rafah crossing, but aid workers say it’s not enough and will not reach civilians in north Gaza where Israeli troops have tightened their perimeter around Gaza City, and where tens of thousands of civilians remain in the path of escalating battles between militants and Israeli ground forces.\n\nNearly half of the hospitals across Gaza, including the only cancer facility, are not operating amid a massive fuel shortage. Netanyahu on Thursday said his administration has not made a decision on whether to allow fuel to get to the medical facilities.\n\n'Circle of blood':The club no Israeli or Palestinian wants to be in. Yet, they urge peace.\n\nThe Palestinian death toll − which has surpassed 9,000, including more than 3,600 children − and images of widespread destruction in densely populated areas of Gaza have contributed to growing unease among Israel supporters and Arab nations with which it has peaceful relations. Since the war began, more than 1,400 Israelis have died, most of them civilians killed in the first hours of Hamas' surprise attack.\n\nOther Developments:\n\n∎ World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told reporters Friday that 70% of the victims in Israel and Gaza who've been killed since Oct. 7 are women and children. “It’s the innocent civilians that are losing here,\" said Lindmeier. \"Let’s think about the victims.\"\n\n∎ Israeli military forces killed a \"Hamas battalion commander during overnight operations,\" according to a statement on X, formerly Twitter, by the Israel Defense Forces, adding: \"Our ground, aerial and naval forces continue to operate to eliminate Hamas’ chain of command and terrorist capabilities.\"\n\n∎ In raids across the occupied West Bank overnight, Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians and arrested many others. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas rampage, 130 Palestinians have been killed and more than 820 have been displaced amid settler violence and increased movement restrictions.\n\n∎ The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, on Friday said nearly 50 of their buildings, including schools and shelters where around 700,000 Palestinians have taken refuge, have been struck by airstrikes. Four of its schools-turned-shelters in Gaza were damaged by airstrikes in the past day, killing a reported minimum of 24 people.\n\nHezbollah leader says group will not limit involvement in conflict\n\nHezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah broke his silence for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, saying Friday that the Iran-backed group would not limit its involvement in the conflict to the northern border between Israel and Lebanon.\n\nHowever, Nasrallah, who has not appeared in public for years over fears he could be assassinated by Israel, appeared to stop short of formally declaring war on Israel.\n\nLebanon-based Hezbollah, considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and U.K., has since the outbreak of the war been attacking Israel's military across the border with shells and rockets.\n\nNasrallah said the Hamas attacks exposed \"the frailty, weakness and total fragility of Israel,\" adding that Israel is \"more fragile than a spider’s web.\"\n\nIn his speech, held in a secret location but broadcast live to thousands of people at a rally in Beirut, Nasrallah said the Hamas attacks were \"100% Palestinian\"; that no other groups were involved in its planning. He also cast doubt on Israel’s ability to achieve its aim of releasing the hostages held in Gaza.\n\n‒ Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUS uses unarmed drones to search for hostages in Gaza\n\nThe Pentagon has been flying unarmed drones over Gaza in search of hostages, the Defense Department acknowledged on Friday.\n\nThe drone flights began after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that killed 1,400 people, Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement. Hamas militants also seized 200 people hostages in the attacks, including U.S. citizens.\n\nThe drone flights indicate deeper involvement by the U.S. military in the conflict than previously acknowledged. U.S. military experts have advised their Israeli counterparts on lessons learned from urban combat in Iraq, U.S. officials have said.\n\nDrones have the ability to feed video and still footage from surveillance sensors to forces involved in hostage rescue attempts.\n\n‒ Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBlinken says Israel must do more to protect Palestinian civilians\n\nBlinken told reporters Friday that he's urged Israel \"to do more to protect Palestinian civilians\" in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The secretary of state said Israeli leaders agreed to address and \"hold accountable\" extremist settlers attacking and displacing Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\n“We’ve provided Israel advice that only the best of friends can offer on how to minimize civilian deaths while still achieving its objectives of finding and finishing Hamas terrorists and their infrastructure of violence,” he said.\n\nHumanitarian pauses were an “important area of discussion,\" Blinken said, adding that questions raised in his various meetings asked how, when and where humanitarian pauses can happen, as well as how to connect a pause to the release of hostages, and how to ensure that \"Hamas doesn’t use these pauses or arrangements to its own advantage.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, we believe this can be a critical mechanism for protecting civilians,\" he said. Blinken also reiterated that while balancing urgent needs, the United States is focused on \"setting the conditions for a durable and sustainable peace and security.\"\n\n\"The United States continues to believe that the best viable path, indeed the only path, is through a two state solution,\" he said. \"That's the only guarantor of a secure Jewish and democratic Israel, the only guarantor of Palestinians realizing their legitimate right to live in a state of their own, enjoying measures of security, freedom, opportunity and dignity. The only way to end a cycle of violence once and for all.\"\n\nIsrael expels workers, 'severing all contact with Gaza'\n\nIsrael's security cabinet late Thursday announced that it is expelling thousands of Palestinian workers who have been stranded in Israel and the West Bank since the outbreak of the war almost a month ago.\n\nAbout 18,000 Palestinians in Gaza previously routinely crossed into Israel for work via the now sealed off Gaza-Israel border. But since Oct. 7 many of them have been arbitrarily detained by Israel.\n\nUSA TODAY last month encountered a group of about 130 workers who had been arrested, beaten and then transferred from Israel to Ramallah, a Palestinian city in the West Bank. In addition to their ill-treatment, they spoke about the difficulties of staying in touch with family members in Gaza amid Israel's intensifying bombing campaign that has now claimed more than 9,000 lives.\n\n\"I am powerless to help them, and for every 10 times I try to reach them on the phone, I get through maybe once,\" said one worker, speaking about his wife and 12 children from the grounds of a school in Ramallah where he and other Palestinians in Gaza had been given temporary shelter.\n\nIn a statement, Israel's security cabinet said the move to expel the workers was aimed at \"severing all contact with Gaza,” adding that there \"will be no more Palestinian workers from Gaza.\"\n\nThe statement did not explain how, when or to where precisely the workers would be returned. Gaza is an active war zone that Israel's military is bombarding hundreds of times per day.\n\n‒ Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nWhat is the Rafah border crossing?\n\nThe Rafah crossing is a pedestrian border between Gaza and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. It's currently the only viable point of exit for Palestinians and others seeking to escape the besieged enclave.\n\nEgypt, Hamas and Israel agreed to open the border for a limited time to allow for people with foreign passports, some critically injured Palestinians and aid workers to cross, the embassy said. One of those aid groups includes 22 Doctors Without Borders staffers.\n\n\"There are still over 20,000 injured people in Gaza with limited access to health care due to the siege,\" the nonprofit said.\n\nThe United Nations said in an Oct. 22 update that truckloads of humanitarian aid has poured into Gaza via the crossing. The U.N. also said on Wednesday about 80 sick and wounded Palestinians and 500 foreign passport holders gained entry into Egypt via the crossing.\n\nContributing: Jorge Ortiz, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/03"}]}

Darrian Traynor/Getty Images\n\nThe incident demonstrates the lingering pain felt by Australia’s First Nations people since the occupation of their country by British settlers in 1788. In other Commonwealth Nations, the Queen’s death has prompted rumblings – some louder than others – of moves to abandon the British monarchy for a republic. But in Australia, despite Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s pro-republic views, there’s no concerted push in that direction.\n\nIn interviews and press conferences since the Queen’s death, Albanese has repeatedly said now is not the time to time to be talking about a republic. And on Tuesday, the Australian Republican Movement seemed to agree, suspending its campaign on the issue until after the period of mourning “out of respect for the Queen.”\n\nBut for Albanese, the reluctance to push for a republic right now is not just a matter of respect for the late monarch. The Labor leader made a pre-election promise to hold a referendum to recognize Australia’s First Nations people in the constitution within his first three-year term, if he won office.\n\nWhen asked about it on Monday, Albanese said: “I said at the time I couldn’t envisage a circumstance where we changed our Head of State to an Australian Head of State but still didn’t recognize First Nations people in our constitution and the fact that we live with the oldest continuous culture on Earth. So that’s our priorities this term.”\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attends the Proclamation of King Charles III, on the forecourt of Parliament House on September 11, 2022 in Canberra, Australia. Mick Tsikas/Getty Images\n\nA resounding ‘no’\n\nChanging the constitution requires the majority of Australian people across the country, as well as the majority in most states to vote “yes” in a referendum, a notoriously difficult task. Since Federation in 1901, only eight of 44 proposals for constitutional change have been approved.\n\nThe last rejection came in 1999, when the country’s citizens were asked if they wanted to replace the Queen and Governor-General with a President.\n\nBack then, campaigning focused on cutting ties with an archaic monarchy and moving forward as a bold new multicultural nation intent on forging its own path. Indigenous issues weren’t high on the agenda, though Australians were asked a second question, to approve a new preamble to the constitution that honored First Nations people for their “kinship with their lands.” That failed too, with Aboriginal elders of the day complaining they hadn’t been consulted on the wording.\n\nAn Aboriginal land rights protest in Spring Street, Melbourne, 1971. Fairfax Media/Getty Images\n\nIt wasn’t a surprise. Indigenous people had long complained their voices hadn’t been heard by successive governments, so much so that in 1999, Yawuru man Peter Yu, now Vice President First Nations at the Australian National University (ANU), took the advice of a local elder to take their message to the Queen.\n\n“A very old senior leader said, ‘You better go and see that old girl overseas … because they call her name the wrong way over here,’” Yu recalled. The old man meant that the only time Aboriginal people heard the Queen’s name was when they were arrested, Yu told CNN. “They felt that, given the community’s respect for the Queen, her name was being sullied and her reputation being besmudged, and that therefore we needed to go and explain the situation,” he said.\n\nSo they did.\n\nYu and an delegation met Queen Elizabeth for around 30 minutes in Buckingham Palace, and received a much warmer welcome from the monarch than either government in the UK or Australia, he said.\n\nToday, Yu says views within the Australia’s Indigenous community on the Queen are mixed – as they are in most communities.\n\n“There are strong emotions,” he said. “And we are continuing to suffer the full force of the consequences of colonization. But do we hold her personally responsible for it? I don’t,” he said. “Who I hold responsible for it is the Australian government … governments who deliberately neglected their duty of care. That’s what I’m angry at.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II watches an Aboriginal cultural performance near Cairns, March 2002. Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVoice to Parliament\n\nBy the end of his first term, Albanese has promised a referendum on the Voice to Parliament – a body enshrined in the constitution that for the first time would give Indigenous people a say in laws that affect them.\n\nJohn Warhurst, Emeritus Professor of political science at ANU and former chair of the Australian Republic Movement, says a referendum on the Voice to Parliament is “undoubtedly the first priority” over a republic.\n\n“You won’t get argument about that among republicans,” he added.\n\nAn image of Queen Elizabeth II looks down from the sails of Australia's Opera House, September 9, 2022. Robert Wallace/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Voice to Parliament is important for a number of reasons, said Warhurst. “It’s a line in the sand about Australia’s colonial past. It’s a line in the sand about race relations in Australia … and I think the message internationally would be a shocking one, too, if we fail to pass this referendum.”\n\nHowever, not all Indigenous people back the concept.\n\nTelona Pitt, a Ngarluma, Kariyarra, and Meriam woman of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island descent, is the admin of the “Vote no to constitutional change” Facebook group, which has 11,000 members.\n\nShe believes not enough Indigenous people were given a say in drafting the document that led to plans for a Voice to Parliament. And she says the government is already aware of Indigenous problems but hasn’t done enough to fix them – and that won’t change with a referendum on a Voice to Parliament.\n\n“All it’s going to do is just disempower Aboriginal people and power up the Parliament against us,” she said.\n\nProtesters take part in an \"Invasion Day\" rally in Sydney on January 26, 2022.

It has no integrity. It has no sense of moral or soul.”", "authors": ["Hilary Whiteman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/954744/geoffrey-cox-and-the-british-virgin-islands-the-backstory", "title": "Geoffrey Cox and the British Virgin Islands: the backstory | The Week", "text": "Former attorney-general Sir Geoffrey Cox has been referred to the parliamentary commissioner for standards over claims that he used his office in Westminster to defend the British Virgin Islands (BVI) government in a corruption case brought by the UK Foreign Office.\n\nCox, “the highest-earning MP”, has been paid more than £1m in the past year working as a lawyer for clients including the British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean, reported The Times today.\n\nHe was already facing criticism for casting his ballot in the Commons by proxy while he was abroad defending BVI ministers in April, May and June this year.

Although he had been an MP for 13 years at the time, many of his colleagues confessed that they knew little about him as he was “continuing his busy practice as one of Britain’s leading barristers”, he said.\n\nBorn in Wroughton, Wiltshire, in 1960, Cox attended the private King’s College in Taunton before graduating from Cambridge, and was called to the Bar in 1982. Twenty-three years later he became the MP for Torridge and West Devon, but “only the promise of the job of attorney-general could coax him on to the front bench”, said Zeffman.\n\nHe remained in the post throughout the Brexit crisis but was sacked by Johnson in February last year, “leaving him free again to pursue a busy legal life”.\n\n‘Nothing but indefatigable’\n\nFor months, day after day, Cox “has been sitting hunched over a pile of court papers” trying to prove to the UK government that the BVI premier Andrew Fahie is innocent of corruption, wrote Patrick Wintour at The Guardian.\n\nCox, his “baritone voice familiar to Brexit aficionados”, has been “nothing but indefatigable”, said Wintour.\n\nBut in Westminster, Hansard shows he has spoken in the chamber only once this year and, according to The Telegraph, “turned up to Parliament to vote on just two days in 13 months”.\n\nDowning Street “appeared to reprimand the Tory MP” yesterday, said the paper, with a spokesman saying “MPs’ primary job is and must be to serve their constituents”.\n\nThere was no suggestion that this set-up was breaking any rules, said the BBC’s Nick Eardley yesterday, noting that many MPs have second jobs. But he said the “extent to which he has focused on his legal work” had left “question marks over whether he has got the balance right”.\n\n‘Dangerous scoop’\n\nUsing a parliamentary office to conduct private work is another matter, however, as it may be a breach of Commons rules.\n\nNo. 10 is facing “Operation: Get The Toothpaste Back in the Tube”, said The New Statesman’s Stephen Bush, explaining that the toothpaste in this case is the “renewed media interest in MPs’ side-hustles”.\n\nToday’s report by The Times is the “most dangerous scoop from the government’s perspective”, said Bush. Cox may even face a recall petition in his seat.\n\n‘Getting to the truth’\n\nA statement on Cox’s website, published today, said the “leading barrister” makes “no secret of his professional activities” and that his role in the BVI inquiry was not to “‘defend’ a tax haven” but to assist it “in getting to the truth”.\n\nIt said he had approval from the Office of the Attorney General of England and Wales to work on the BVI inquiry, and assurance from the chief whip that his use of proxy voting was “appropriate”.\n\n“Sir Geoffrey regularly works 70-hour weeks and always ensures that his casework on behalf of his constituents is given primary importance and fully carried out,” it continued.\n\n“Sir Geoffrey’s view is that it is up to the electors of Torridge and West Devon whether or not they vote for someone who is a senior and distinguished professional in his field and who still practises that profession.”\n\nIt added that Cox did not believe he had breached the rules regarding the claim that he was in his parliamentary office while participating in the online BVI hearing, but that he “will of course accept the judgment of the Parliamentary Commissioner or of the Committee on the matter”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Becca Stanek", "The Week Us", "Catherine Garcia", "Theara Coleman", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Peter Weber", "Justin Klawans"], "publish_date": "2021/11/10"}]}

In the video, Taylor captured the snow and whiteout conditions. She told her sisters who live in North Carolina that she was stuck and the snow kept falling, Brown said.\n\nTaylor called 911 and was waiting for first responders, Brown and Wanda Brown Steele – Taylor’s mother – told CNN.\n\n“Her plan was to wait until the police got there,” her sister said. But if that failed, she planned to “get up and walk once her car ran out of gas.” She also said she planned to go to sleep and then try to walk home once she woke up if help did not arrive.\n\nHer family said they kept in touch with Taylor as the day dragged on. At one point, Taylor texted one of her other sisters separately to say that she was starting to panic, Brown added.\n\nIn the early hours of Christmas Eve, Taylor would send her last video message to the group chat. In the video, Taylor cracks open the driver’s side window of her car, revealing a road turned into a barren wasteland by the snow. A van down the road, which appears to be stuck, can be seen flashing its hazard lights. Taylor wrote in the group chat that she thought the snow would probably be up to her waist if she got out of her car.\n\nLater that morning, at around 9 a.m. on Christmas Eve, members of her family in North Carolina called and sent her multiple messages. “We texted her in the group to ask, ‘Are you OK?’” Brown said. The family was alarmed when Taylor was not responding.\n\n“Maybe two hours later, my sister tracked her phone,” Brown said. “She [Taylor] must’ve shared her location with my sister. And it showed that she was still outside.”\n\nThe family alerted Taylor’s relatives in Buffalo to the address, but once they arrived, they said they saw Brown’s car, but did not see her inside.\n\n“So I put the info on a private Facebook page called Buffalo Blizzard 2022 and asked for help,” Brown said. She posted the address of the tracked phone and later that evening, she got a phone call from an unnamed man. “He let us know he checked her pulse and there was no pulse,” Brown said.\n\n“I really didn’t believe it,” she said. “It was like a piercing feeling in my stomach, a pain I’ve never felt before.”\n\nTaylor’s mother, Brown Steele, told CNN she was in “shock.”\n\nIt would not be until the next day that Taylor’s body was removed from the car, Brown said, after a woman sent a message on Facebook to let Brown know that she had also located the car – and her sister’s body.\n\nThe woman told the family in Charlotte that she would not leave until someone came to pick her up.\n\nWith emergency personnel unable to reach the car, the woman waited until Taylor’s relatives who live in Buffalo arrived. They all helped move Taylor’s body into another vehicle, where she was taken to the hospital, Brown said.\n\nAfter leaving multiple voicemail messages through the course of the holiday weekend, the family in Charlotte heard back from authorities on Monday evening. They were calling to let them know they were ready to go to rescue Taylor, Brown said. The Brown family informed them that Taylor’s body had already been transported to the hospital the day before.\n\n“I want to get to the bottom of why the city was unable to help,” Brown Steele told CNN.\n\nErie County Executive Mark Poloncarz told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on “CNN This Morning” on Monday that two-thirds of the equipment that was dispatched to help clear snow during the height of the storm got stuck.\n\nPoloncarz added that a historian with the Buffalo Fire Department said this was the first time in the agency’s history that personnel could not respond to emergency calls because the severity of the conditions wouldn’t allow it.\n\nErie County officials said on Tuesday that the county had restored its emergency response service, but they were still begging residents to abide by Buffalo’s travel ban and stay off the roads.\n\nCNN has contacted the Buffalo Police Department for further details.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, Taylor’s family in Charlotte has yet to learn the official cause of Taylor’s death, Brown said.\n\nTaylor was described by her sister as “a caring and nurturing person. She hustled a lot, she cared about a lot of people,” her sister said.\n\n“If she could help, she would help you,” her mother said. “She had a lot of friends here in Charlotte – a lot of people cared about her.”\n\nCharlotte Mayor Vi Lyles released a statement offering her deepest condolences to Taylor’s family and friends.\n\n“Anndel was taken from this world far too soon, and words cannot begin to express the heartache and pain her loved ones feel during this difficult time,” Lyles’ statement reads. “This was a devastating storm that brought tremendous tragedy, and our community here in Charlotte mourns with her family.”\n\nHer family set up a GoFundMe campaign to pay for her funeral services.\n\nTaylor would have turned 23 next month, Brown said.", "authors": ["Sharif Paget"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2022/01/03/2022-movies-tv-music-books-top-gun-maverick-adele-halo/9049732002/", "title": "'Top Gun 2,' 'House of the Dragon,' 'Avatar' are can't miss in 2022", "text": "And just like that … it’s 2022.\n\nDespite the endless barrage of bad news, the last 12 months still gave us plenty to be grateful for in entertainment: Carrie Bradshaw sashayed back into our lives (sans Samantha Jones) for a wobbly but welcome “Sex and the City” revival.

But it is merely British singing/songwriting royalty, a transformative vocal talent who now has the clout to insist that fans pack their suitcases and come to her. – Ruggieri\n\nOlivia Rodrigo hits the road\n\nThe breakout performer of 2021, the Disney teen-turned-confessional punk-pop songstress will prove she’s more than a manufactured melody maker with her first world tour (April 2-July 7). It’s shaping up to be a potent year for the 18-year-old behind zingy hits “Good 4 U,” “Déjà vu” and the sweeping “Drivers License”: She’s also nominated for seven Grammy Awards in January. – Ruggieri\n\n'jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy'\n\nFor more than 20 years, Coodie and Chike, film directors and longtime friends of the mercurial rapper now known as Ye have tracked West’s career, from rapping with Mos Def in 2002 to the death of his beloved mother, Donda (the namesake of his oft-retooled album), in 2007 to his failed 2020 presidential bid. The Netflix film is expected to be released in three parts. – Ruggieri\n\nA new Missy Elliott album\n\nSo far we only have a tweet, but it’s a noteworthy tweet and a tweet that the eternally “Supa Dupa Fly” maven has endorsed, so we’re going with that. In early December, longtime Elliott collaborator Timbaland sparked a frenzy on social media when he tweeted, “Who ready for that @MissyElliott Timbo album?” Elliott responded with a GIF of herself grooving and emojis of clapping hands and tornadoes – indications that the dynamic duo is indeed fashioning what will be Elliott’s first album since 2005’s “The Cookbook.” – Ruggieri\n\nTV's 'The Lord of the Rings'\n\nAmazon Prime Video’s lavish adaptation (launching Sept. 2) of J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic novel series promises “familiar and new” characters confronting “the re-emergence of evil to Middle-earth.” It’s the most expensive TV show ever made, with a reported first-season budget of $465 million; a second is already planned, along with related content sure to satisfy fans of the books and Peter Jackson’s 2001-2003 movie trilogy. – Gary Levin\n\n'House of the Dragon'\n\nRoughly three years after HBO’s biggest hit, fantasy epic “Game of Thrones,” wrapped its eight-season run, the first of several potential spinoffs finally arrives: “House” focuses on the story of the rise and reign of the Targaryen family as rulers of the mythical Westeros. It’s set 200 years before the original series, so don’t look for any returning cast members, but Matt Smith (“The Crown,” “Doctor Who”) plays Prince Daemon Targaryen. – Levin\n\n'Obi-Wan Kenobi'\n\nAmong several current or planned “Star Wars” spinoffs on Disney+ (“The Mandalorian,” “The Book of Boba Fett”), the reunion of the iconic characters Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) and Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen) seems like a slam-dunk for fans of the franchise. The series, long-delayed for script polishing, is set years before the first “Star Wars” film. – Levin\n\n'Halo'\n\nOne of TV’s longest-gestating projects, the series based on the hit Xbox game centers on a 26th-century conflict with an alien force known as The Covenant and stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief Petty Officer John-117. “Halo” was first announced in 2013 for Microsoft’s then-planned video platform. Eventually, it moved to Showtime and now aims to be the first hit for streaming service Paramount+. – Levin\n\n'Inventing Anna'\n\nJulia Garner (“Ozark”) plays the Russian scam artist who posed as New York socialite Anna Delvey in this Netflix series adapted by Shonda Rhimes (“Grey’s Anatomy”) from a New York magazine article. “Anna” (streaming Feb. 11) is notable as the first series Rhimes has created and written since ABC’s “Scandal” in 2012, although “Bridgerton,” which she produced, was a breakout hit in 2020.– Levin\n\nThe 'Knives Out' sequel\n\nDirector Rian Johnson is planning not one but two “Knives Out” sequels for Netflix and the photos that leaked from the international shoot this summer are criminally good. What we know: For the first installment (expected in the summer) Daniel Craig is back as private detective Benoit Blanc, this time solving a fresh mystery involving Dave Bautista, Janelle Monáe, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr. and Kate Hudson. Glam photos leaked from Greece in June, where the seaside production commenced production. “Aaaaaaaand WE’RE OFF!” tweeted Johnson at the time. “Thanks to all the lovely patient people here in Greece for letting us do all this murdering on their peaceful shores.” – Andrea Mandell\n\n'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'\n\nWriter/director Ryan Coogler's “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” (Nov. 11), the follow-up to Marvel’s 2018 culture-changing smash hit “Black Panther,” takes on even greater significance following the death of beloved leading man Chadwick Boseman. How the burgeoning franchise will carry on after losing its title character is the movie’s most searingly compelling secret. Marvel has said Boseman’s role won't be recast, and the new film will honor Boseman and the legacy he helped create. “Wakanda Forever” has been hit with production delays, but is still slated for the prime November spot. – Bryan Alexander\n\n'Avatar 2'\n\nJames Cameron first revealed the wonders of the mysterious exoplanet Pandora in 2009’s “Avatar.” Close to $3 billion in the box office and more than a decade later, Cameron is finally ready to return viewers to this world and beyond – bringing back former Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), who found a home with Na'vi princess Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and her clan at the end of the first movie. It’s not going to be a pleasure trip. “Avatar 2” (Dec. 16), shot in conjunction with “Avatar 3” (Dec. 20, 2024), will also see new perils and the return of past foes such as Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who died at the end of the first film. Big explanations and wondrous new worlds await. – Alexander\n\n'Top Gun: Maverick'\n\nWe’ve had the need for speed, well, it seems like forever now. Tom Cruise’s long-anticipated return to the cockpit has been sitting on the flight deck for two years after production and COVID-19 delays. But Paramount has released intoxicating trailers of director Joseph Kosinski’s sequel (May 27), with Cruise’s Pete “Maverick” Mitchell now a still-rebellious Top Gun flight instructor. We strongly urge viewers not to sip hot coffee when the jets start screaming across the big screen. “Maverick” will see the return of original frenemy Tom “Iceman” Kazansky (Val Kilmer) and bring new faces such as Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Miles Teller), the son of dearly departed RIO Nick “Goose” Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards). – Alexander\n\n‘The Batman’\n\nSure, there was a time when even the concept of Robert Pattinson as \"The Batman\" (March 4) would be something The Joker would throw out at a Warner Bros. pitch meeting. But in director Matt Reeves' hands, Pattinson's vengeful Caped Crusader is darkly effective, pummeling his foes like they they’re critics bringing up \"Twilight.\" The DC film has rightfully turned into a wildly anticipated movie event, as Batman hunts down serial killer The Riddler (played by Paul Dano). We haven't even touched the surface of this craziness. – Alexander\n\n‘Bros’\n\nNext year looks sensational for queer moviegoers, from Joel Kim Booster’s “Pride and Prejudice”-inspired “Fire Island” to the feature directorial debuts of Billy Porter (“What If?”) and Tig Notaro (“Am I OK?”). One of the most high-profile projects is rom-com “Bros” (Aug. 12), co-written by and starring “Billy on the Street” funnyman Billy Eichner, in what is being touted as the first major studio film with an all-LGBTQ principal cast. Hollywood, get ready for Bowen Yang (“Saturday Night Live”) and Symone (“RuPaul’s Drag Race”). – Patrick Ryan\n\n‘Don’t Worry Darling’\n\nFirst-time director Olivia Wilde made one of the most magnificent comedies in years with 2019’s “Booksmart.” Now, she’s back behind the camera and doing a total 180 with an erotic thriller (Sept. 23) about a 1950s housewife (Florence Pugh) in a utopian community whose life begins to unravel. Pugh knows a thing or two about psychological horror from her staggering performance in “Midsommar,” and here, she’s matched up with singer-turned-actor Harry Styles, whose rumored romance with Wilde behind the scenes only stokes curiosity around this movie. – Ryan\n\nPrince Harry's memoir\n\nIf a mere Oprah Winfrey interview set the internet (and the royal family’s hair) on fire, what’s an entire book going to do? \"Prince Harry will share, for the very first time, the definitive account of the experiences, adventures, losses, and life lessons that have helped shape him,\" publisher Random House announced earlier this year. Details on the Duke of Sussex’s memoir are slim – there’s no title or release date yet – but he’s not been shy about critiquing the royal family and its treatment of his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, since the two gave up royal duties and moved to the U.S. – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama' by Bob Odenkirk\n\nThe beloved star of “Better Call Saul” and “Mr. Show” opens up in this memoir about his journey from cult comedy writer to dramatic actor and action film star, revisiting the highs and lows of show business. This book (out March 1) would have been welcome news no matter what, but it’s especially sweet following Odenkirk’s recovery from a scary July heart attack that saw the star collapse on the set. We’ll take all the Odenkirk we can get. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Booth' by Karen Joy Fowler\n\nSome books hit so hard, the emotional bruise they leave stays tender for years. Such is the case with Fowler’s 2013 marvel “We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves,” winner of the PEN/Faulkner Award for fiction. “Booth” (March 8), her first novel since, is about the family behind one of American history’s most notorious figures: John Wilkes Booth. This snapshot of a troubled family in a country in its own throes of change promises difficult insights into our current moment. – VanDenburgh\n\n'The Candy House' by Jennifer Egan\n\nBy the time this comes out, it will have been nearly 12 years since Egan’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “A Visit from the Goon Squad” was hailed as a postmodern masterpiece. Egan’s forthcoming “The Candy House” (April 5) is a sibling novel to “Goon Squad,” in which tech guru Bix Bouton creates “Own Your Unconscious,” a technology that allows users to access and share every memory they’ve ever had. It’s a concept so killer, it’s hard to believe such technology doesn’t already exist. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Finding Me' by Viola Davis\n\nAny debate about our greatest living actress that doesn’t include Davis isn’t to be taken seriously. The Oscar-, Emmy- and Tony-winning thespian (“Fences,” “The Help,” “How to Get Away With Murder”) is a creative powerhouse, but just as impressive is her personal story (April 26) of overcoming childhood poverty and dysfunction to become one of the most celebrated artists of her generation. “I believe that our stories, and the courage to share them, is the most powerful empathetic tool we have,” Davis said in a statement shared with The Associated Press. – VanDenburgh\n\nFeeling frustrated as we head into 2022?How to deal with your disappointment", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/12/entertainment/toby-keith-stomach-cancer-trnd/index.html", "title": "Toby Keith announces he has stomach cancer | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCountry music superstar Toby Keith has announced he has been battling stomach cancer since late last year but has received treatment and plans to return to the stage soon.\n\nIn a statement posted on his verified Twitter and Instagram accounts Sunday, Keith said he was diagnosed with cancer last fall.\n\n“I’ve spent the last 6 months receiving chemo, radiation and surgery.

He was 43.\n\nSullins, who had a history of heart problems, died of a torn aortic valve, according to a message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\n\"Sullins was a poet in the mold of Woody Guthrie and Bob Childers. He was the essence of what red dirt means to its artists and its fans until his last breath,\" said Josh Crutchmer, author of the book \"Red Dirt: Roots Music Born in Oklahoma, Raised in Texas, at Home Anywhere,\" in a statement to The Oklahoman.\n\n\"He loved a song and he loved when it found ears. His passing is a tragedy, but he spent his last day singing to his friends at The Farm in Stillwater, then put all he had into his Altus gig, and I know if he could choose his last 24 hours, that’s what he’d have picked. He never really got his due in this mortal world, but nobody who heard him play or chatted him up at an Oklahoma dive bar is ever going to forget him.\"\n\nBorn in Hobart and raised in the Altus area as well as in Knoxville, Tennessee, Sullins told The Oklahoman in a 2012 interview that he was working a job he hated in the southwestern Oklahoma oil-fields when a pal introduced him to red dirt music, that enigmatic and heady blend of country, rock, folk, blues and Western swing.\n\nWhile working as a truck driver, he honed his songwriting talents over the long miles. He wrote hundreds of songs and recorded several albums as the frontman of the band Chad Sullins and the Last Call Coalition and as a solo artist.\n\n\"He was a true troubadour. He was reporting back from the frontlines,\" said John Cooper of the venerable Oklahoma band the Red Dirt Rangers.\n\nSullins was preceded in death by his nephew Chance, father Bill, grandmother Martha and grandfather Glenn. He is survived by his mother Marsha, son Corbin, daughters Presley and Madison, brothers Brad and Randy, sister Gena and many other relatives, friends and fans.\n\nSullins was a stalwart supporter of the nonprofit Red Dirt Relief Fund, which provides a safety net of critical assistance for Oklahomans in the music business in times of need, even before the organization stepped up to help the singer-songwriter when he experienced health issues in 2014.\n\n\"Chad, was he was one of those guys with a gruff exterior and a complete heart of gold,\" said Cooper, who is a founder and board member for the relief fund.\n\nThe Red Dirt Relief Fund has launched a fundraising effort to help Sullins' family with funeral costs and other expenses and is co-sponsoring the July 31 Chad Sullins Last Call Celebration at Stillwater's Tumbleweed Dancehall & Concert Venue.\n\nAnother memorial benefit show is planned for July 11 at Grady's 66 Pub in Yukon.\n\nFor more information, go to https://www.facebook.com/chadsullinsofficial.\n\nIconic Oklahoman Wanda Jackson announces new album 'Encore'\n\nIconic Oklahoman Wanda Jackson teams with fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Joan Jett and Kenny Laguna to conceptualize her upcoming album \"Encore,\" due out Aug. 20 via Big Machine Records/Blackheart Records.\n\n\"Encore\" is rooted in the belief that the pure rock 'n' roll that Jackson pioneered has lived on in Jett’s modern version of agency, independence and audacious self-expression that has been taboo for women in music, according to a news release.\n\nThe 32nd album from the Rock and Roll, International Gospel and Rockabilly Hall of Famer is a billed as \"a final chapter,\" amplifying a career that’s ignited others, too, from the Cramps to Amy Winehouse, Adele to Jack White, who produced her 2009 critical favorite \"The Party Ain't Over.\"\n\n“Right around the time I retired from performing and what I thought was the end of my career, I found myself back to writing songs with some of the great writers in Nashville,\" Jackson said in a statement. \"The songs you hear are truly my life story. This is the first time I have ever inserted so much of my personal life into my music. You’ll get a picture of my early life and have a peak into the closeness that my late husband Wendell and I had in our life together. I’m happy to share this with all of you. Your constant love and support has seen me through the ups and downs of my 64-year career. I love you all and God bless you.\"\n\nRecorded just before she announced her retirement from touring in 2019 at the age of 81, \"Encore\" reportedly features Jackson's familiar growling voice as well as her penchant for rockabilly, country and punk music.\n\nSinging along with the living legend on \"Encore\" are Pistol Annie Angaleena Presley and Candi Carpenter on the jaunty “Can’t Keep A Good Girl Down,\" Jett on the garage grunge come-on “You Drive Me Wild,” as well as the classic ballad closer “That’s What Love Is,\" and Jett plus Elle King on a rockabilly number called “Two Shots.\"\n\n“Real, authentic rock and roll is something you have to have inside. It can’t be taught, it can’t be faked. Wanda Jackson has it. Joan Jett has it. 'Encore' has it. It is rare,” said Laguna in a statement.\n\nThe bodacious vocalist known for “Hot Dog! That Made Him Mad,” “Mean, Mean Man,” “Fujiyama Mama” and “Let’s Have A Party,\" Jackson penned half of the eight tracks on \"Encore,\" with co-writers including triple Grammy Awards winner Lori McKenna, Grammy nominees Will Hoge and Luke Laird, Presley, and bluegrass queen Sonia Leigh.\n\nThe album also includes Jackson's plaintive cover of Johnny Tillotson’s 1962 R&B smash “It Keeps Right On A Hurtin’,” which is the first song we're getting to hear from the anticipated new album.\n\nKnown for more than six decades as “The Queen of Rockabilly,” Jackson, a Maud native and longtime Oklahoma City resident, was crowned in 2018 an Oklahoma Cultural Treasure in recognition of her influential seven-decade career as a singer, songwriter, performer, trailblazer and style icon.\n\nPreorder Jackson's \"Encore\" at https://wandajackson.lnk.to/EncorePR.\n\nJerod Impichchaachaaha' Tate named state department cultural ambassador\n\nOklahoma-based Chickasaw composer Jerod Impichchaachaaha' Tate has been named one of 31 cultural ambassadors for the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.\n\nPart of the American Music Abroad Program’s 2021-2022 season, Tate’s appointment will take him on a month-long, multi-country virtual tour, where he will engage with international audiences through public concerts, interactive performances with local musicians, lectures and demonstrations, workshops, jam sessions, and media interviews.\n\nBorn in Oklahoma, Tate's father is a Chickasaw lawyer and tribal judge and was author to the current Chickasaw constitution, and his mother is of Manx descent originally from Nebraska. In addition to being an active leader of American Indian law and politics, Tate’s father is a classically trained pianist and baritone, and his mother was a professional choreographer and dancer, leading to Tate’s immersion into American dance, ballet, musical theater and opera. Like his classical composer role models such as Debussy (France), Bartók (Hungary), and Stravinsky (Russia), Tate strongly identifies with his culture and imbues it into all of his compositions.\n\nTate’s recent commissions include \"Shell Shaker: A Chickasaw Opera\" for Mount Holyoke Symphony Orchestra; \"Ghost of the White Deer, Concerto for Bassoon and Orchestra\" for Dallas Symphony Orchestra; and \"Hózhó (Navajo Strong)\" and \"Ithánali (I Know)\" for White Snake Opera Company. He recently hosted San Francisco Symphony’s Currents series and curated a performance by the ETHEL Quartet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nHis music has been featured on the HBO series \"Westworld,\" and last month, Tate released the world-premiere recording of \"Lowak Shoppala' (Fire and Light),\" which expresses Chickasaw identity through the medium of modern classical music and theater via eight scenes, on Azica Records.\n\nAmerican Music Abroad activities focus on younger and underserved audiences in countries where people have few opportunities to meet American performers and experience their music first-hand.

Then a major star of the Grand Ole Opry and a best-selling Columbia recording artist, Acuff enjoyed broad appeal in country music at the time, serving as an important bridge from the string-band era to the modern era of star singers backed by bands.\n\nThe fiddle was acquired this year by Gill, who became friends with Acuff when Gill began appearing on the Opry in the late 1980s.\n\n“It felt important to me that the great Roy Acuff’s fiddle join the ranks of other revered instruments in the museum’s permanent collection — including Maybelle Carter’s 1928 Gibson L-5 guitar and Bill Monroe’s 1923 Gibson F-5 mandolin,” said Gill in a statement. “The fiddle was given to Acuff by soldiers during a time of war because of how much he meant to them. He meant a lot to me, too.”\n\nThe instrument was built in Germany around 1890 and is a copy of the highly prized violins constructed by Austrian luthier Jacobus Stainer in the 1600s. Discovered in a bombed-out music store in Frankfurt, Germany, by soldiers from the U.S. Army’s 348th Engineer Combat Battalion in the waning days of World War II, the fiddle was sent to Acuff, their favorite country music performer, as a show of appreciation. Liking the tone, Acuff made it his primary fiddle for many years.\n\nAcuff (1903-1992) was a singer, fiddle player, bandleader, songwriter, music executive and Grand Ole Opry favorite. Acuff’s star power among U.S. servicemen and women was proven when he prevailed over pop crooner Frank Sinatra in a popularity contest held on Armed Forces Network’s “Munich Morning Report” near the end of World War II.\n\nAcuff’s remarkable contributions to country music, which included co-founding Nashville’s Acuff-Rose Publications in 1942, led to him becoming the first living member of the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1962.

To celebrate, members will be performing as part of the month-long Queen City Music Festival at First Unitarian Society 724 Park Ave, Plainfield on Sunday, Oct. 8, at 5 p.m.\n\nThe Club was organized in 1882 by a group of Plainfield musicians who wished to have a venue for performing for one another and an opportunity for socializing. The club met in members’ homes, and in its early days was a highly formal occasion, with men wearing tuxedos and women long dresses.\n\nToday's club, in line with the times, is much more informal. and not limited to Classical Music. It does remain a private organization, but has spread out into the community. In addition to its October appearance at the First Unitarian Society of Plainfield, the club's February and April meetings will be held at the Plainfield Public Library. These meetings will also display materials such as news stories and pictures which are archived in the library.\n\nREAD: About the October Plainfield Music Festival\n\nREAD:Immaculata rededicates theater after major transformation\n\nNeed a break?

International concerts will follow in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. The scammers love it.\n\nOne teen in the Atlanta area, unbeknownst to her parents, lost about $350 when she bought two fake tickets in a scam that started on Instagram. Her parents asked that her name not be used so scammers don't target her.\n\nA huge fan since age 5, the young woman had been commenting on verified Instagram accounts set up by other Taylor Swift fans, known as Swifties. All of a sudden, someone reached out to her directly in January about tickets for sale. The seller even showed her proof with a screenshot of Taylor Swift tickets for one of three Atlanta concerts, which ran April 28-30 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nIt sounded like the real deal.\n\nThe teen did not realize that the screenshots of the tickets could be easily faked. She ended up sending money via Venmo and Cash App, as the seller kept requesting more money, including a fake $85 fee to transfer a Ticketmaster ticket to her. As more fees kept being added on, the high school student realized something wasn't right.\n\nSuddenly, the seller who had her money wasn't able to talk to her.\n\n\"She ghosted me for like a week,\" the young woman told me by phone. The seller claimed she had dropped her phone in the toilet and it was no longer working. Whatever. By this point, the buyer knew it was a scam.\n\nLike many fans, she didn't just want to go see a concert for a flashy show. She wanted desperately to see an old friend, someone whose words helped her get through tough times in her young life, someone she felt like she grew up with over the years. \"Her music, it touched something in me,\" she said.\n\nAnd while oddly enough things turned out OK in the end, she's still bitter about the scammers and the fact that she never got to see Taylor Swift in person. In a very strange twist, someone she met online later on TikTok gifted her one Taylor Swift ticket to a Nashville concert ‒ which she couldn't go to but was able to sell to another Swiftie via a reseller on Twitter for $475. That fan even sent her video of the concert and it all worked out smoothly. Sort of.\n\nScammers know all too well why the Swifties need to be there.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau has reportedly received almost 200 complaints nationally, ranging from struggles getting a refund to outright scams, related to the Swift tour, according to the AG's office.\n\nA fan in Columbus, Ohio, saw $690 vanish via Venmo in late May when trying to buy three Taylor Swift tickets from someone named Dawn on a Facebook moms group, according to a report made to the Better Business Bureau's ScamTracker. The seller provided pictures of her tickets. After the money was sent, the seller deleted her Facebook account and blocked the fan on Facebook.\n\nA New Jersey fan lost $750 in May after spotting Taylor Swift tickets via another Facebook group. The buyer trusted the seller because members of the group must be verified. What she didn't realize was that the real account had been hacked. The money was sent via the peer-to-peer payment app, Zelle. The fan never got the tickets, according to a report made to the BBB.\n\nAnother Swiftie reported losing $2,500 for three tickets, sending money via Zelle, according to the AARP Fraud Watch Network. The fan received digital tickets, but the fake tickets wouldn't scan at the gate.\n\nWe know you really, really, really want to go to see Taylor Swift. But the scammers really, really, really want your money.\n\nWhy ticket scams just won't quit\n\nCon artists swindle people for big names and big games, and events. One consumer, according to the BBB ScamTraker report, lost $550 on tickets for the French Open tennis tournament, also known as Roland-Garros. The tickets never arrived.\n\nScammers play into the hype\n\nWhy scammers pitch fake tickets: Many fans are eager to get their hands on tickets to sold-out events, especially after a slump in major tours after the pandemic. Even sky-high ticket prices aren't scaring people off, if they really want to see a much-loved artist like Taylor Swift, who told a sold-out concert in East Rutherford, New Jersey, \"I really, really missed you!\"\n\n\"They feel like it's OK to splurge a little bit,\" said Teresa Murray, who directs the Consumer Watchdog office for U.S. PIRG, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nScammers, Murray noted, often need to create a sense of urgency to get people to suspend skepticism even for a few seconds. If you think those tickets being offered online could be soon sold to someone else, you're going to jump at that chance to buy them.\n\nThe young fan in Atlanta didn't realize that scammers can easily manipulate consumers, send fake pictures and impersonate well-known businesses or other fans.\n\nFake tickets, of course, can trigger real heartbreak. Sometimes, a scam artist will have real tickets ‒ and send the same picture to you and everyone else over and over again ‒ as part of the same scam, Murray warned.\n\nRemember, con artists have been hard at work for months ‒ and in various markets all across the country ‒ to figure out ways to snatch hundreds or thousands of dollars at a time by selling fake tickets.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to snag tickets, don't post pictures of them: According to an FBI warning, the barcode found on most tickets is a \"goldmine for scammers.\" The scammer might be able to use that information to get into the event without paying or copy the information and sell more fraudulent tickets to unsuspecting buyers.\n\nThe FBI says: \"Consumers should protect ticket barcodes as they would credit card numbers.\"\n\nTicketmaster notes online that when someone resells a ticket, the name on the ticket is the name of the original purchaser. \"You’ll still be able to enter the event; it’s the barcode that’s needed for entrance.\"\n\nChoose a safe payment method\n\nDon't pay for tickets with a Target gift card, Zelle, Venmo, Bitcoin ATM or debit card: Consumer watchdog groups note that several ticket-related scams, as with other scams, take advantage of payment methods where consumers lose cash quickly.\n\nYes, some consumers reportedly paid for some fake concert tickets with Target gift cards, according to watchdogs. \"Ticketmaster will never ask you to purchase a Ticketmaster Gift Card or any type of third-party gift card to use as a form of payment for tickets,\" according to a warning from Ticketmaster.\n\nWhile it's OK to send money to friends via payment apps, don't send money this way to strangers.\n\nOne other sign: The young woman in Atlanta noted that the scammers told her that she shouldn't mark the sale as one for \"goods and services.\" That should be a clue right there, the teen now warns others.\n\nUnder such a plan, a consumer might be covered if the transaction doesn’t go as expected but that doesn't work on all sales, either. Restrictions apply, including making a deposit on an apartment or buying concert tickets from users you do not personally know.\n\nWhen buying a good or service with Venmo, the transaction must be marked as a purchase before hitting send on the payment. Before paying, the consumer should review the “eligible items covered by purchase protection” found under the “Pay” button. You'd want to buy from approved business accounts.\n\nOn June 5, a consumer in Philadelphia told the BBB about almost being scammed out of $1,200 for four Taylor Swift tickets. The person who was selling the tickets claimed she uses her niece's Venmo \"under the handle @rachelraae.\"\n\nThe scammer also said, \"Don’t turn on purchase when sending.\" Venmo notes online that scammers will often ask you to not mark the payment as a purchase. \"When you tag a payment to a personal profile as a purchase, your payments for eligible items will be covered by Purchase Protection, and you can contact us afterward if something goes wrong,\" Venmo stated.\n\nEven so, Venmo recommends online that you don't pay for tickets from strangers via a Venmo account.\n\nThe consumer in Philly became suspicious and didn't send money. She later Googled the phone number and found another person was scammed from this number for Taylor Swift tickets.\n\nIf you have a credit card, many times you want to use your credit card to buy online ‒ again, if you believe that the seller is legitimate. You do not want to be reading your credit card number over the phone to a scammer or entering it online at a sketchy site.\n\nScammers can use low-price tickets to trick people into entering their credit card information, according to a BBB alert. Scammers will then use your credit card number to buy big-ticket items. You never receive your ticket.\n\nIn general, you can dispute fraudulent charges and have better odds for getting your money back, if you use a credit card.\n\nWatch out for lookalike sites: Many times, a search for tickets by first doing an internet search for a spot like Ticketmaster or StubHub, could land you at a far different site, according to a BBB warning. Consumers are advised to take an extremely close look at the website’s URL to spot misspellings. Impostors create lookalike websites with domain names that play off well-known business names.\n\nDeal with secure websites that begin with “HTTPS” and have a “lock” symbol on the address bar.\n\nAnother key tip: Ticketmaster does not have resale tickets at its site for Taylor Swift concerts. Resale tickets for the Eras Tour have not been available at all on Ticketmaster.\n\nUse extra caution buying tickets sold on Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, or other free online listings, according to the BBB. Scammers know how to provide realistic tickets and fake receipts.\n\nIf a T. Swizzle ticket is priced at $100, it's likely too good to be true\n\nBargains, a no go: No one, repeat no one, is going to underprice Taylor Swift tickets. If someone starts messaging you by saying \"Hey girl,\" the young consumer in Atlanta warns, expect that it's a message from a scammer. Scammers, she said, have an odd demeanor.\n\nAnd $350 for two tickets? Probably not.\n\nSix-digit code spells trouble: Con artists who are supposedly selling tickets ‒ or even renting out a vacation home or selling a car ‒ might say they need to send you a code to verify your identity, according to PIRG's Murray. They claim there are a lot of scammers out there and they need to know you're real.\n\nIt’s usually a six-digit code that's being generated elsewhere ‒ and one you're going to need to read back to the seller so they can use it for a scam. Don't do it.\n\nIn some cases, they can use the code to set up \"Google Voice\" account in your name and use that phone number to scam people, in your name. How sweet.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com. Follow her on Twitter @tompor.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/18"}]}

Among the victims, who range in age from 20 to 86, were people grocery shopping, a heroic former police officer who tried to stop the gunman, a long-term substitute teacher and a taxi driver who “took pride in helping people.”\n\n“This was pure evil,” Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said, calling the shooting a “straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community.”\n\nThe US Department of Justice is investigating the shooting “as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism,” according to Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nPayton S. Gendron of Conklin, New York, has been charged with first-degree murder, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said in a May 14 news release. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nOn June 1, a grand jury returned a 25-count indictment against Gendron. He is facing 10 counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of second-degree murder as a hate crime and three counts of attempted murder as a hate crime, according to court documents. Gendron is also facing a charge of domestic terror and a weapons charge, according to court documents.\n\nGendron pleaded not guilty to the 25-count indictment, his attorney said in court Thursday afternoon.\n\nGendron’s defense attorney told CNN on May 17 he would not issue a statement now.\n\nHere’s what we know about the suspect.\n\nHe planned to ‘continue his rampage,’ police say\n\nWhen the suspect arrived at the store around 2:30 p.m., he was heavily armed, wearing tactical gear – including a tactical helmet along with plated armor, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said – and had a camera that was livestreaming his actions.\n\nHe used an assault weapon, Flynn said during a news conference.\n\nThe suspect shot four people outside of the grocery store, three fatally, Flynn said in his news release. When he entered the store, he exchanged fire with an armed security guard, who authorities said was a retired Buffalo police officer. The security guard died of his injuries. The suspect shot eight more people in the store, six of whom died, the release said.\n\nConfronted by police, the suspected shooter took off some of his tactical gear and surrendered, per Buffalo police.\n\nThe suspect planned to continue his shooting rampage beyond the Tops supermarket, Gramaglia told CNN on Monday, saying there was “some documentation” he allegedly planned to target “another large superstore.”\n\n“There was evidence that was uncovered that he had plans, had he gotten out of here, to continue his rampage and continue shooting people,” he said.\n\nThe suspect made very disturbing statements describing his motive and state of mind following his arrest, an official familiar with the investigation told CNN. Those statements were clear and filled with hate toward the Black community, with the alleged shooter making it known he was targeting Black people, the official said.\n\nThe alleged shooter was “studying” previous hate attacks and shootings, investigators have learned via search warrants and other methods.\n\nThe suspect was in Buffalo on Friday, the day before the shooting, per Gramaglia, who said he was doing reconnaissance at the store.\n\nShonnell Harris Teague, an operations manager at the store, saw him Friday afternoon at the store and told him to leave because it appeared he was bothering customers, she told ABC News.\n\nHarris Teague saw the suspect sitting on a bench outside with a camper bag on his back, wearing the same camouflage clothing he wore Saturday, she told ABC. After being asked to leave, he did so without argument, she said.\n\nHer brother, the Rev. Tim Newkirk, backed up the account, noting the suspect “was in there posing as a beggar and was looking for change,” he told The Buffalo News.\n\n“She had to politely escort him out. They have a no peddling policy in the Tops, no panhandling,” Newkirk said, “so she was just letting him know that this was not the place where you do that.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Buffalo pastor on shooting: We have to resist the impulse to forget 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\nHe spent months plotting his attack, social media posts show\n\nGendron is believed to have visited Buffalo in early March, Gramaglia said Monday, citing the suspect’s “digital footprint.” Social media posts analyzed by CNN reveal the suspect visited the Tops store in March and had been extensively planning his attack for several months up until the day of the shooting.\n\nAccording to the posts – which Gendron originally shared on Discord, then on the hate-filled online forum 4Chan – the suspect drove March 8 to the supermarket in Buffalo.\n\nThe posts were made visible to a small group of people about 30 minutes before the shooting began, according to a statement from Discord.\n\nGendron wrote in the posts that he went into Tops Market three times during his visit: at 12 p.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. He wrote about activity inside the store each time he went in – noting how many Black and White people were in the market and also drawing a map of the inside of the store.\n\nDuring his 4 p.m. visit, Gendron was approached by a “Black armed security guard” who asked the suspect what he was doing going in and out of the store, he wrote. The shooter told the security guard he was collecting “consensus data,” according to the posts.\n\n“In hindsight that was a close call,” Gendron wrote.\n\nIn a post on March 10, Gendron wrote, “I’m going to have to kill that security guard at Tops I hope he doesn’t kill me or even hurt me instantly.”\n\nThe shooter wrote about how he planned his attack for March 15 but then delayed it several times.\n\nIn the posts, Gendron cites online research in choosing Buffalo as his site of attack – saying the 14208 ZIP code in Buffalo has a higher Black population than the other locations he was considering.\n\nThe shooter considered attacking a church or an elementary school but ultimately chose the supermarket because of the number of people that go to grocery stores, he wrote.\n\nHe referred to Google’s “popular times” graph for the Tops Friendly Market in determining the time he would plan his attack – so the grocery store would be busiest.\n\nDiscord said that a “private, invite-only server” was created by the suspect and that “approximately 30 minutes prior to the attack,” a small group of people was invited to and joined the server.\n\n“Before that, our records indicate no other people saw the diary chat log in this private server,” it said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families,” the company said. “Hate has no place on Discord and we are committed to combating violence and extremism. We are continuing to do everything we can to assist law enforcement and the investigation remains ongoing.”\n\nCNN asked the Discord spokesperson when the company became aware of Gendron’s posts and if any of the individuals who were invited to view his private server alerted moderators to the content but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nCNN also reached out to 4Chan asking about Gendron’s posts being shared on the platform but has not heard back.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It is White supremacy': CNN speaks to son of Buffalo massacre victim 03:06 - Source: CNN\n\nDocument talks about ‘dwindling size’ of White population\n\nInvestigators are sifting for clues in a 180-page document attributed to Gendron and posted online, Flynn said. The purported “manifesto” allegedly was written by the suspect, officials have said.\n\n“We are obviously going through that with a fine-toothed comb and reviewing that for all evidence that may lead us to besides the manifesto itself,” prosecutor Flynn told CNN.\n\n“All the evidence that we ascertain from that manifesto, from wherever that manifesto leads us, other pieces of evidence we already had, we can then use that and develop more charges potentially,” he added.\n\nThe document, independently obtained by CNN shortly after the attack and before authorities released the suspect’s name, is allegedly written by a person claiming to be Payton Gendron confessing to the attack.\n\nThe author attributes the internet for most of his beliefs and describes himself as a fascist, a White supremacist and an anti-Semite.\n\nThe author bought ammo for some time but didn’t get serious about planning the attack until January, per the document. The author also writes about his perceptions of the dwindling size of the White population and claims of ethnic and cultural replacement of Whites.\n\nThe suspect allegedly chose to attack the Tops store in Buffalo because it was in a majority-Black ZIP code within driving distance of where he lived, and he researched what time it would be busiest, according to the document.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Stelter: Shooting is 'replacement theory' rearing its ugly head again 05:04 - Source: CNN\n\nHe’s from a town hours away from Buffalo\n\nThe ZIP code that includes the store, 14208, is 78% Black – the highest percentage of Black population of any ZIP code in upstate New York – per the Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey. Conklin, where the suspect is from, is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Buffalo.\n\nGendron’s parents were not known to hold extremist views, according to two New York residents who have worked with his parents at the state Department of Transportation and who shared their views on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\n“I never thought of the family as racist or hateful,” said one coworker, who said she was heartbroken for the victims’ families as well as Payton’s parents, Pam and Paul. “I can’t wrap my head around this tragedy.”\n\nPayton Gendron talks with his attorney during his arraignment Saturday in Buffalo City Court. Mark Mulville/AP\n\nGendron was a worker at the local Conklin Reliable Market for about four months before he left about three months ago, the store’s owner said, adding he was very quiet and left on his own terms, giving two weeks’ notice.\n\nGendron’s mother regularly would walk in the neighborhood, neighbors said. She was a nice woman, one said, adding they “never would have thought that in a million years” Gendron would have racist views. “It’s pretty shocking,” the neighbor added.\n\nWhen you talked to Payton Gendron, “you wouldn’t get more than a word or two” from him, another neighbor said.\n\nGendron’s former classmates said while he could sometimes be a loner and “odd,” he wasn’t known to be violent.\n\n“I just don’t understand what convinced him to do this,” said Bryce Gibbs, who said he attended elementary through high school with Gendron and described him as “nice.”\n\nHe made ‘generalized threat’ at high school\n\nGendron made a “generalized threat” in June while he attended Susquehanna Valley Central High School in Conklin, Gramaglia said Sunday, adding the threat was not racially motivated.\n\nState police took the student for a mental health evaluation, Gramaglia said at a Buffalo news conference. After a day and a half, he was released.\n\nThe suspect was visited last year by New York State Police after he did a high school project about murder-suicides, Garcia told CNN on Monday. Concerns about alleged mental health issues “were brought to light” after he turned in the post-graduation project, the sheriff said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I'm sad, I'm hurt, I'm mad': Buffalo reacts to racially motivated shooting 01:25 - Source: CNN\n\nState police spokesperson Beau Duffy said that on June 8, 2021, state police officers responded to the high school to investigate a report that a 17-year-old student made a threatening statement. The student was taken into custody under NYS Mental Health Law section 9.41 and transported to a hospital for a mental health evaluation.\n\nDuffy confirmed it was an evaluation and not an involuntary commitment – so it would not have prevented the suspected shooter from purchasing or possessing a gun under federal law.\n\nState police were unable to confirm how long the person was in the hospital or the findings of the evaluation. The agency also refused to name the then-17-year-old.\n\nThe suspect addressed the incident in posts on Discord later shared on 4Chan, writing in a post-dated January 30 that he “had to go to a hospital’s ER because I said the word’s ‘murder/suicide’ to an online paper in economics class.”\n\n“I got out of it,” the suspect claims, “because I stuck with the story that I was getting out of class and I just stupidly wrote that down. That is the reason I believe I am still able to purchase guns.”\n\n“It was not a joke,” the post reads, “I wrote that down because that’s what I was planning to do.”\n\nThe suspect goes on to claim his mental health evaluation lasted only 15 minutes after he spent hours waiting in the emergency room. CNN has reached out to New York State police about this account.\n\nBroome County District Attorney Michael Korchak, the district attorney in the suspect’s hometown, is reviewing “all aspects” of last year’s investigation into the threat and also “going back several years” to understand the suspected shooter’s behavior and relationships with family, teachers and other students.\n\nBut it’s “hard to say” whether more should have been done in June, Korchak told CNN.\n\n“Unfortunately this is nothing new in the criminal justice system,” Korchak said. “Individuals that have mental health issues may have it under control for a period of time, and then one day they just snap and things as tragic as this happen.”\n\nInvestigators are talking to the suspect’s parents and they are being cooperative, Korchak said.\n\nGun was legally purchased, governor says\n\nThe gun used in the mass shooting was purchased legally in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN earlier, describing the weapon as an AR-15. It’s believed the high-capacity magazine was purchased out of state, the governor added.\n\nIn addition to the AR-15, Gendron had a rifle and a shotgun in his car, Gramaglia said. The online diatribe attributed to Gendron said he planned to bring those same three types of guns with him that day.\n\nHere’s how the suspect legally obtained guns\n\nThe “main firearm” Gendron planned to use was a Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle that he bought from Vintage Firearms, a gun store in Endicott, New York, before “illegally modifying it,” according to the diatribe. Gendron passed a background check before he bought the gun and he didn’t stick out among his other customers, Vintage Firearms owner, Robert Donald, told The New York Times; no one at the store has responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nGendron also bought a Mossberg 500 shotgun from Pennsylvania Guns and Ammo, a store in Great Bend, about a 10-minute drive across the state border from his hometown of Conklin, the racist document attributed to him states.\n\nThe suspect passed a background check at the store and legally purchased the shotgun in December 2021, the store owner, who did not want his name used, told CNN. The shotgun was not used in Saturday’s shooting.\n\nThe third gun was a Savage Axis XP rifle that Gendron’s father bought for him for Christmas in 2020 “so that I could go hunting without borrowing my cousin’s guns,” the document states.\n\nThe racist statement also says the shooter planned to use the shotgun and rifle to shoot other Black people on the street as he drove away from the supermarket.\n\nCNN obtained a photo of two long guns allegedly brought to the scene. The photo was confirmed by two law enforcement sources.\n\nA photo of two long guns allegedly found in the suspect's car, according to law enforcement sources. CNN\n\nThe image shows the weapons inside a car, which was found by law enforcement after the suspect’s arrest, according to one of the law enforcement sources. The weapons were not used in the shooting. Writing appears all over the weapons, including the phrase “White Lives Matter” and names including what appears to be the name of a victim of a crime allegedly committed by a Black suspect.\n\nOther notations seized by investigators reflect the racist beliefs of the shooter, as well as his obsession with mass killing, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nHe allegedly livestreamed on Twitch\n\nThe shooting suspect used the popular livestreaming platform Twitch to stream a live broadcast during the attack, the company confirmed Saturday.\n\nThe company was “devastated” to hear about the shooting, it said, adding the user “has been indefinitely suspended from our service, and we are taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content.”\n\nCNN obtained a portion of the livestream showing the alleged shooter pulling up to a Tops store.\n\nThe video is recorded from the point of view of the alleged shooter as he drives into the supermarket’s parking lot. The person is seen in the rearview mirror wearing a helmet and is heard saying, “Just got to go for it,” before he pulls into the front of the store.\n\nIn the video, store patrons can be seen walking through the parking lot as the suspect drives up.\n\nThe company removed the livestream less than two minutes after the violence started, a spokesperson for Twitch said. The company did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether the suspect was firing when the livestream was halted.\n\nHe will likely face more charges\n\nThe suspect pleaded not guilty to one count of first-degree murder Saturday evening before Buffalo City Court Chief Judge Craig Hannah, according to the judge and the district attorney’s news release. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, the release said.\n\nGendron’s attorney’s request for a mental health forensic examination was withdrawn, Flynn said. Gendron remains on suicide watch, Garcia said, and in custody without bail.\n\nThere may be more charges coming, officials said.\n\n“My office is working closely with the US Attorney’s Office and our partners in law enforcement into potential terrorism and hate crimes. This is an active investigation and additional charges may be filed,” Flynn said.\n\nGendron is set to return to court Thursday morning for a felony hearing, the release said.\n\nHe is likely the “most highly visible incarcerated individual” in the country, Garcia told CNN on Monday. There are video cameras in his cell, and he remains under a sheriff’s deputy’s watch at all times.", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Christina Maxouris Dakin Andone Samantha Beech Amir Vera", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Samantha Beech", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/03/us/athena-strand-kidnapping-death-man-arrested/index.html", "title": "Athena Strand abduction: Texas man arrested for kidnapping, killing ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA driver working for FedEx was arrested and charged Friday in the kidnapping and killing of a 7-year-old girl who had disappeared from her home’s driveway in Texas earlier this week, police said.\n\nAthena Strand’s body was recovered Friday evening, Wise County Sheriff Lane Akin said at a news conference.\n\n“It hurts our hearts to know that child died,” Akin said Friday.\n\n“It’s one of the toughest investigations that I’ve been involved in because it’s a child. And anytime there’s a child that dies, it just hits you in your heart,” he said.\n\nAthena was reported missing Wednesday and authorities launched a search for her across Wise County, located northwest of Fort Worth. Authorities believe the young girl was killed within an hour after her kidnapping from her family’s driveway, which is about 200 yards from her home.\n\nThe suspect, Tanner Lynn Horner, 31, has been charged with capital murder and aggravated kidnapping. Wise County Sheriff's Office\n\nTanner Lynn Horner, 31, is being held in Wise County jail on capital murder and aggravated kidnapping charges, according to its website. Bond was set at $1.5 million, Akin said. It was unclear whether Horner had an attorney Friday.\n\nHorner, identified by authorities as a contract driver for FedEx, was allegedly making a delivery to Athena’s home at the time she disappeared.\n\nEarlier Friday, police say they received a tip that helped investigators determine Horner abducted the child from her driveway.\n\nStrand’s mother, Maitlyn Presley Gandy, said her daughter was taken from her by “a sick, cruel monster for absolutely no reason,” she wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday morning.\n\n“I cannot describe the pain and absolute anger I feel. Missing her doesn’t cover how I feel,” Gandy said in the post accompanying a video of Athena, then age 3. “I want the world to know my baby, my first baby, my first true love, the reason I breathe.”\n\n“Athena is innocent, beautiful, kind, intelligent, and just the brightest, happiest soul you could ever meet. I don’t want her to be the girl known as the one murdered and discarded by a monster,” she added. “I want everyone to know, every single person in this world, that this is my baby and my baby was taken from me. I want everyone to know her face and her voice and just how wonderful of a person she is.”\n\nAthena will be remembered for so much, like her dream of growing up to be a Viking princess with tattoos just like her dad’s, how much she loved her two little sisters, and her love for anything pink, her mother wrote.\n\nAuthorities did not indicate a possible motive and said Horner did not know the family or the child, according to Akin.\n\nAthena’s cause of death remains under investigation and her body was transferred to the medical examiner’s office Friday, Akin said.\n\nGandy shared another Facebook post dedicated to thanking “the hundreds if not thousands of volunteers” and the authorities who helped look for her daughter.\n\n“As a mother, I know no one is as broken as I am…” she wrote, adding that the official agencies who assisted in the investigation “have all cried with me.”\n\n“It takes a special kind of person and whether a child is yours or not, working crime scenes involving children are hard,” she added. “Thank you for finding my baby. I know everyone wishes this would have ended differently.”\n\nIn a statement to CNN, FedEx expressed its sympathies and directed further questions to law enforcement.\n\n“Words cannot describe our shock and sorrow at the reports surrounding this tragic event.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/us/iowa-teen-killed-alleged-rapist-escape/index.html", "title": "Pieper Lewis, Iowa teen who killed her alleged rapist, has escaped ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPieper Lewis, the Iowa teenager who killed a man she said raped her and was sentenced to probation and ordered to pay restitution to his family, has escaped from a residential corrections facility, according to Iowa’s Fifth Judicial District Department of Corrections.\n\nLewis “walked away from the Fresh Start Women’s Center on Friday at 6:19 a.m. after cutting off her electronic monitoring tracking device,” Jerry Evans, the district’s executive director, told CNN in an email Sunday morning. “At this time, her whereabouts are unknown.”\n\nOfficials have filed a probation violation report, Evans said, recommending her probation be revoked. “A warrant for her arrest was subsequently issued that remains outstanding.”\n\nLewis was 15 years old when she killed a man she said had raped her multiple times, CNN previously reported. She received a deferred judgment from Polk County District Judge David Porter after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter and willful injury, and in September an Iowa judge ordered Lewis to pay $150,000 to his family in restitution, as required by Iowa law.\n\nPorter also ruled Lewis would receive five years’ probation, serve 200 hours of community service and pay an additional $4,000 in civil penalties. The deferred judgment meant it could be expunged from Lewis’ record.\n\nThe Des Moines facility from which Lewis escaped is a residential corrections facility, according to the Fifth Judicial Circuit Department of Corrections website. It “accepts residents with varied legal status,” who might be admitted “as a condition of probation or parole,” it says. The program aims to “provide a safe and holistic approach to supervision that seeks to educate, support and advocate for all women to transform their lives,” the website says.\n\nLewis pleaded guilty in June 2021 to the killing of Zachary Brooks, saying in the plea agreement the 37-year-old raped her multiple times in 2020. She was initially charged with first-degree murder.\n\nIn the agreement, Lewis said she ran away from home several times and ended up sleeping in the hallway of an apartment complex.\n\nOne man took her in, but she left when he became abusive, she wrote in the plea agreement. She said she then moved in with another man who created an online dating profile for her and arranged for men to have sex with her for money. She lived with that man, who told her she was his girlfriend, from April 2020 until she was arrested for killing Brooks, Lewis said.\n\nShe was introduced to Brooks in May 2020, and he gave her alcohol and marijuana and had sex with her five times while she was unconscious over a three-day period, she said. Lewis learned of what he had done, according to the plea, each time she regained consciousness and he was still on top of her.\n\nOn May 31, the man with whom Lewis lived with confronted her with a knife after she refused his order to go to Brooks’ apartment to have sex with Brooks in exchange for marijuana, she wrote. Eventually she agreed to go after he cut her neck, she said in the plea.\n\nAt Brooks’ apartment, she was forced to drink vodka shots and fell asleep, she wrote. At one point she woke up and Brooks was raping her, she said. Brooks fell asleep and Lewis went to find her clothes. When she came back to the bedroom, she saw him passed out naked, she wrote.\n\n“I suddenly realized that Mr. Brooks had raped me yet again and was overcome with rage. Without thinking, I immediately grabbed the knife from his nightstand and began stabbing him,” Lewis stated in the plea agreement. “I further acknowledge that the multiple stab wounds that I inflicted upon Mr. Brooks thereafter ultimately resulted in his death.”\n\nAdvocate expressed concern\n\nIn ordering community service, Judge Porter said it would give Lewis the opportunity to tell her “story to other young and vulnerable women in our community.\n\nLewis’ attorney said that he was pleased with the court deferring her sentence, praising her courage. But advocates for victims of sexual violence disagreed.\n\n“I don’t think that justice was served,” KellyMarie Meek of the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault said at the time, expressing concern about Lewis’ ability to manage the terms of her probation due to the severity of her trauma.\n\n“Because I know that many of the ways that trauma survivors deal with their trauma is not understood very well by folks that haven’t experienced trauma, which can sometimes lead to behaviors that get folks in trouble,” she said.\n\nLewis is one of several teenagers – often of color – who have been legally penalized or convicted of killing their sex trafficker or assaulter in recent years in the US.\n\n“It’s just a story that has unfortunately become all too familiar,” Cyntoia Brown told “PBS Newshour.” Brown, now 32, was sentenced to life in prison for killing a man who paid to rape her when she was a 16-year-old trafficking victim. She was granted clemency in 2019 after spending half her life behind bars.\n\n“She was a victim in this situation,” Brown, now a criminal justice reform advocate, said of Lewis. “Not only is she going to have to serve time in a facility but, over the next five years, anything that she does can trigger her having to serve a 20-year sentence. So,she’s not truly free.”", "authors": ["Michelle Watson Dakin Andone", "Michelle Watson", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2021/05/12/mollie-tibbetts-abduction-missing-cristhian-bahena-rivera-iowa-murder-trial-what-to-know/5026630001/", "title": "Mollie Tibbetts murder: Cristhian Bahena Rivera guilty in Iowa killing", "text": "From staff reports\n\nDes Moines Register\n\nThe search for Mollie Tibbetts attracted national attention when the 20-year-old went missing in the summer of 2018.\n\nThe University of Iowa student went out for a jog on July 18, 2018, in her hometown in Brooklyn, Iowa. She never came back.\n\nAfter being interviewed by police, Cristhian Bahena Rivera led authorities to her body in a Poweshiek County cornfield.

He was sentenced to life in prison on Aug. 30, 2021.\n\nFor subscribers:The untold story of Mollie Tibbetts’ final moments — and her family’s 3-year struggle to reclaim her memory\n\nWho was Mollie Tibbetts?\n\nMollie Tibbetts was born on May 8, 1998, in San Francisco, California.\n\nHer parents liked the name Grace, according to a 2018 profile, but when they looked at her for the first time, they decided she wasn't a Grace, after all.\n\nFrom 2018:She's nurturing. She's a Harry Potter fan. We all know Mollie Tibbetts' face, but her friends and family say she's so much more.\n\n“Well, she’s more of a Mollie,” her father, Rob Tibbetts, remembers saying.\n\nTibbetts moved to Iowa with her mother, Laura Calderwood, and brothers after her parents separated when she was in the second grade.\n\nIt was in Brooklyn, Iowa, where Tibbetts would grow up, graduating from Brooklyn-Guernsey-Malcom High School, where she was involved in choir and ran cross country.\n\nWhile she enjoyed choir, Tibbetts found her strength in speech, theater and writing, those who knew her said in the 2018 profile.\n\n\"She just wanted to lift people up,\" her high school speech coach, Jarrod Diehm, remembered.\n\nMore:Mollie Tibbetts' poetry describes slain woman in her own words\n\nAfter the verdict, signs of Tibbetts were unavoidable in Brooklyn. Teal ribbons — her favorite color — lined downtown's Jackson Street and surrounding roads for miles.\n\nTibbetts made a lasting impact in her hometown, said Shane Wilson, 49, a teacher at BGM Elementary who was Tibbetts' fourth-grade teacher, youth group leader and high school track coach.\n\n\"Brooklyn will never forget Mollie Tibbetts,\" Wilson said. \"It's Mollie's spirit. It will continue to move the community of Brooklyn.\"\n\nWilson described her spirit as fun and loving. \"Her ability to make people smile and her kindness\" are memories the community holds close, he said.\n\nAt BGM Elementary, teachers and students call random acts of kindness \"Mollie's Movement.\"\n\n\"It's her legacy,\" Wilson said.\n\nFrom 2018:Mollie Tibbetts' boyfriend talks about the last message he received from her\n\nMollie Tibbetts search: Missing persons posters were everywhere\n\nMollie Tibbetts was watching dogs at her boyfriend's brother's house in Brooklyn when she went for a routine evening jog on Wednesday, July 18, 2018. Tibbetts' boyfriend, Dalton Jack, was out of town.\n\nThe next day, Jack sent her text messages but didn't get any response. When Tibbetts didn't show up to work at a Grinnell day care, a co-worker there contacted Jack.\n\nThat day, authorities searched buildings and open spaces in Brooklyn and the surrounding area for Tibbetts. Family members started a Facebook group to disseminate information and promote sharing of any news about Tibbetts.\n\nBy the weekend, missing persons posters filled nearly every storefront in downtown Brooklyn.\n\nA week after Tibbetts went missing, state and federal authorities announced they obtained information from Tibbetts' FitBit, which she always wore when running.\n\nOn July 31, 2018, state authorities held their first formal press conference about the investigation, but they offered scant details.\n\nA couple of days later, the Bring Mollie Tibbetts Home Safe Reward Fund reached $172,000 for tips about Tibbetts, announced her mother, Laura Calderwood. The fund would eventually grow to nearly $400,000.\n\nOn Aug. 6, 2018, Rob Tibbetts told Fox News that he thought his daughter was caught in \"some kind of misunderstanding\" with someone she knows.\n\nThe national scope of the search was cemented when Vice President Mike Pence commented on the case while at an event in Des Moines.\n\n\"I just want Mollie's family to know: You’re on the hearts of every American,\" he said during an Aug. 15, 2018, event.\n\nOn Aug. 20, 2018, police questioned Cristhian Bahena Rivera about Tibbetts’ disappearance. Following a long interrogation, Bahena led authorities to a body in a cornfield in rural Poweshiek County, officials announced Aug. 21. The body was later confirmed to be Mollie Tibbetts.\n\nMollie Tibbetts' abduction: How a surveillance video helped crack the case\n\nDuring an Aug. 21, 2018, news conference announcing Bahena's arrest, Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation Agent Rick Rahn said the case was solved with the help of video recordings from area security cameras. The recordings showed Tibbetts running by, and also showed a black Chevrolet Malibu repeatedly passing through the area.\n\nDuring Bahena's trial, Agent Derek Riessen with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation called the video a significant lead in the case.\n\nThe Malibu first appeared in the footage driving slowly down the street about 20 to 30 seconds after a jogger, believed to be Tibbetts, was recorded on a resident's security camera. ​About two minutes later, the Malibu drives through again. Another minute passes, and the Malibu is seen again.\n\nAbout 20 minutes after the jogger was seen, the Malibu was captured for a final time on video at approximately 8:08 p.m. on Wednesday, July 18. Riessen said, \"In my opinion, on this trip, it appeared to be going faster.\"\n\nInvestigators traced the car to Bahena.\n\nBahena told investigators on Aug. 20, 2018, that as he ran alongside Tibbetts, she grabbed her phone and threatened to call police, according to 2018 charging documents.\n\nDuring Bahena's trial, Pamela Romero, a former Iowa City Police Department officer who is trained in interviewing suspects and witnesses, said she was asked to help interview Bahena in Spanish.\n\nBahena said Tibbetts tried to slap him away and was screaming at him, which made him \"angry,\" Romero said. Bahena told Romero that he usually blacks out when he is angry, she said. The next thing he remembered was driving, looking down at his legs and seeing Tibbetts’ earbuds, which reminded him that she was in the trunk of his car, Romero testified.\n\nHe said he didn’t remember anything after the fight, but remembers he took her out of his trunk, carried her over his shoulder, laid her down in the cornfield, covered her face with cornstalks, then quickly left, Romero said. The officer testified that the defendant said he had taken off his shirt because it was covered in blood.\n\nBahena also said Tibbetts was bleeding from the head and neck, and he \"told me (she) felt like a person who had just fainted,\" Romero said.\n\nRomero said she began to press him for more details, but he couldn't provide any more information, she said.\n\n\"I brought you here, didn't I? So that means I did it, right? I don't remember how I did it,\" Romero said the defendant told her.\n\nHow did Mollie Tibbetts die?\n\nThe Iowa State medical examiner confirmed on Aug. 23, 2018, that the body found earlier that week in rural Poweshiek County was Mollie Tibbetts and that she died from \"multiple sharp force injuries.\"\n\nTibbetts' body was found face up and covered by corn stalks in a secluded part of a farm field, near the intersection of 460th Avenue and Highway 21 outside of Guernsey.\n\nWhen the Division of Criminal Investigation released its summary of the state medical examiner's preliminary autopsy, the DCI did not release additional details regarding the manner of Tibbetts' death or what kind of weapon, if any, was used.\n\nDuring Bahena's trial, however, Dr. Dennis Klein testified about details of Tibbetts' death.\n\nKlein, the state medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on Tibbetts' body, said that Tibbetts' body was in a \"moderate to severe\" state of decomposition, and that the hot, humid conditions of an Iowa cornfield in August rapidly accelerated the process.\n\nReviewing findings from the autopsy, he walked the jury through a number of injuries found on Tibbett's body, including one that penetrated her skull and another to her neck. The shape of the injuries was consistent with a single-edged knife blade, Klein said.\n\nKlein described finding at least nine stab wounds on Tibbetts' body, including six to the torso and one to the right hand. The wound that penetrated her skull could have caused her death all by itself, he said. He said he suspected there were at least three additional stab wounds, for a total of 12, but due to the state of the body when it was discovered, said he could not be sure. The wound to her hand, he said, could have been a defensive wound incurred trying to fend off an assailant.\n\nWho is Cristhian Bahena Rivera?\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2018, authorities charged Bahena Rivera with first-degree murder in the disappearance of Tibbetts. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nBahena, a Mexican immigrant who authorities say was in the U.S. illegally, worked at Yarrabee Farms in rural Poweshiek County for four years, the owners said in 2018. He gained employment there through a former girlfriend and worked on day-to-day operations with the cows.\n\nHe lived on the property in a mobile home, said Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.\n\nBahena, who was 24 when he was arrested, is from El Guayabillo, a town with about 400 people in the state of Guerrero in southern Mexico. Before his arrest, he lived and worked in Iowa for four to seven years, most recently with Yarrabee Farms.\n\nBahena blamed masked men for Tibbetts' death\n\nDuring his trial, Bahena testified that he didn't kill Tibbetts. He pointed blame at two unknown masked men — one armed with a gun, another with a knife — who surprised him at his home on the Yarrabee Farms property in rural Poweshiek County the night Tibbetts disappeared.\n\nHe claimed the men forced him to get into his car July 18, 2018, and drive around near Brooklyn, Iowa, before spotting Tibbetts jogging toward town. Bahena said the men made him circle around several times before stopping along a gravel road near where Tibbetts was last seen.\n\nThey drove out of Tibbetts' sight, Bahena testified. The man armed with the knife got out of the car for 10 to 12 minutes, while the other sat in the back seat.\n\nBahena told the jury he heard the man in the back seat mutter to himself while they awaited the other man's return to the car. The man with the knife then returned, Bahena said, put something heavy in the trunk and told Bahena to drive them away.\n\nThe men, whom he'd never seen before that night, he testified, then threatened Bahena's family if he dared speak up, including his girlfriend and then-3-year-old daughter, and then allegedly ran off toward a gravel road.\n\nFrightened, Bahena testified through an interpreter, he went to the car's trunk, found Tibbetts barely alive — but in such a state that he couldn't save her — then carried her into a cornfield where he laid her body down.\n\n\"She was very heavy ... I picked her up and I put her in the cornfield,\" he said, adding that he covered her with cornstalks. \"I didn't want her to be too exposed to the sun.\"\n\nBahena's testimony was the first time he publicly gave a version of events from the night that Tibbetts was killed that differs from the hourslong statements he gave to police allegedly admitting to Tibbetts' murder a month after she went missing.\n\nMore:The prosecution brought a strong case against Cristhian Bahena Rivera, legal observers agree, and his own testimony didn't help\n\nJurors find Cristhian Bahena Rivera guilty of murder\n\nThe jury of five women and seven men deliberated for more than seven hours over two days before returning a guilty verdict of first-degree murder on May, 28, 2021. Bahena showed little reaction as the verdict was read, before being led from the courtroom in handcuffs.\n\nOver the course of the two-week trial, jurors heard that investigators identified Bahena's car circling in the area where Tibbetts was last seen, and that, during a marathon interview with police, he admitted to following Tibbetts, whom he found \"hot.\" He told them he fought with her and then, he said, he blacked out, later realizing that Tibbetts' bloodied body was in his trunk. He said he carried her body to the cornfield and covered it with cornstalks. Forensic experts found smears of blood with Tibbetts' DNA in his trunk.\n\nThroughout the trial, defense attorneys pointed the jury toward several other possible suspects, including Tibbetts' boyfriend. For their part, prosecutors made clear that Bahena was the only person they considered to be a suspect in the case.\n\nAfter the trial, one of the jurors spoke with the Register.\n\nMore:Juror describes deliberations before Cristhian Bahena Rivera was convicted of murdering Mollie Tibbetts\n\nEmma Coonfare of Davenport said she and two other jurors who \"weren’t so sure\" and had to be persuaded by their fellow jurors during deliberations to reach the first-degree murder verdict.\n\n\"At first I didn’t think he was guilty of the first-degree. I really didn’t,\" she said.\n\nBahena sentenced to life in prison\n\nJudge Joel Yates sentenced Cristhian Bahena Rivera to spend the rest of his life in prison on Aug. 30, saying Bahena had \"forever changed the lives\" of those who loved Mollie Tibbetts.\n\nThe sentence — mandatory in Iowa for those convicted of first-degree murder — was pronounced by before a crowd of Tibbetts' family and friends.\n\nTibbetts' family and friends filled the courtroom's seats. They watched in silence as Yates delivered the sentence.\n\nIn a statement read by a representative of the Attorney General's Office, Laura Calderwood, Tibbetts' mother, asked Bahena to imagine the pain her family felt. She asked how he would feel if it were his family — including his young daughter — to suffer such a tragedy.\n\n\"I do hope, one day, (your daughter) Paulina has an opportunity to become a mother. But how will she ever explain to her children who their grandfather is?\" Calderwood wrote.\n\n\"This is the legacy you left behind for your only child, Mr. Rivera.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/us/waukesha-christmas-parade-trial/index.html", "title": "Darrell Brooks: Man who drove SUV into Waukesha Christmas ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDarrell Brooks was found guilty of six counts of first-degree intentional homicide on Wednesday for driving his SUV into a crowd of Christmas parade attendees in Waukesha, Wisconsin, last November, killing six people and wounding dozens more.\n\nHe faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison for the convictions.\n\nBrooks, 40, also was convicted of 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety with the use of a dangerous weapon, six counts of fatal hit and run, two counts of felony bail jumping and one count of misdemeanor domestic battery – a clean sweep for the prosecution.\n\nBrooks represented himself in court and has been combative throughout the trial, repeatedly speaking over the judge to make inane and outlandish arguments. Yet as the stream of guilty verdicts were read Wednesday, he looked down, put his head on his hands and sat silently.\n\nThe trial comes less than a year after he drove a red SUV through the crowd in Waukesha’s Christmas parade on November 21, killing an 8-year-old boy and several members of the “Dancing Grannies” group.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It was zooming': Man marching in parade describes SUV plowing through crowd 02:07 - Source: CNN\n\nBrooks had been released from jail less than two weeks prior in a domestic abuse case, on a $1,000 bail that prosecutors later acknowledged was “inappropriately low.” In that case, he allegedly ran over a woman who said she’s the mother of his child, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors said in closing arguments Tuesday he intentionally drove through the crowd at significant speeds and hit 68 individual parade-goers, turning a joyous afternoon into a horrific one.\n\n“He reached speeds of approximately 30 mph. That’s intentional. He plowed through 68 different people. 68. How can you hit one and keep going? How can you hit two and keep going?” Waukesha County District Attorney Susan Opper said.\n\n“His intent I do have to prove, and I submit without any doubt there’s overwhelming evidence that this was an intentional act by Darrell Brooks and an act of utter disregard for human life.”\n\nIn his own closing arguments, Brooks attempted to raise questions about the vehicle and about his intent. He repeatedly said there had been “misconceptions” and “lies” told about him during the trial.\n\n“I’ve never heard of someone trying to intentionally hurt someone while attempting to blow their horn while attempting to alert people of their presence,” Brooks said.\n\nJurors deliberated on Tuesday night for just under two hours and then resumed again on Wednesday morning before quickly reaching its verdicts.\n\nThe family of Virginia Sorenson, the 79-year-old killed in the attack, thanked the jury for the verdicts.\n\n“We have been praying for this day for a long time,” her son Marshall Sorenson said.\n\n“This morning my five-year-old daughter came up to me and handed me this necklace with my mom’s ashes in it and she told me to take my mom with us for the sentencing so she was with us today,” he continued. “My mom always used to tell us when we were kids and our family, she always said, ‘Angels watch over you guys,’ so I just want to say, ‘Angels watch over you guys,’ and turn on those blue lights tonight.”\n\nHow the trial played out\n\nIn court, a series of videos and witnesses detailed the disturbing sights of the SUV ramming through the parade route.\n\n“The band had just passed us, a red SUV … going maybe 30, 40 miles per hour, just went straight over the Waukesha South (high school) band,” said Kyle Jewell, a spectator who tried unsuccessfully to catch up to the SUV to stop it. “And it’s not like it stopped, it went over … it looked like it went in the air, like over a pretty big object, and it was just like a big old speed bump and kept going.”\n\nNicole White, who prosecutors said was the first person struck by Brooks’ vehicle, testified she sustained injuries to her spine and tailbone and suffered ligament damage to her right knee.\n\n“I just remember being struck by the vehicle from behind on my back and then I fell to my knees and kind of rolled under the vehicle,” White said.\n\nBrooks’ trial has been marked by his unusual decision to represent himself in court and his persistent disruptions. Throughout the trial, he has spoken over prosecutors and the judge, asked vague questions, challenged the court’s jurisdiction and declared “Darrell Brooks” is not his name.\n\nJudge Jennifer Dorow has repeatedly removed Brooks from the court for his outbursts and placed him in a nearby courtroom, where he can communicate via a monitor and microphone which is most often muted.\n\nOn Tuesday, after removing him for the prosecution’s closing arguments due to interruptions, she called him “stubbornly defiant.”\n\n“He continues to not respect the fact that a ruling has been made, and he wants to argue and reargue and reargue points that this court has already gone over,” she said.\n\nBrooks previously pleaded not guilty by insanity, but his public defenders withdrew the insanity plea in September. The attorneys later filed a motion to withdraw from the case, and the judge ruled to allow Brooks to represent himself at trial.\n\nOpper, the prosecuting attorney, told jurors in her closing arguments not to be distracted in their deliberations by Brooks’ conduct during the trial.\n\n“You must not, not, not consider anything about Darrell Brooks other than his conduct in downtown Waukesha on the evening of November 21, 2021,” Opper told the jury. “Nothing he’s done before that, nothing he’s done since that. When you go back to that deliberation room, please obey Judge Dorow. Confine your comments to his conduct on November 21.”\n\nOutside court on Wednesday, Opper said Brooks’ behavior was “taxing.”\n\n“We felt very, very offended by his behavior, his disrespect of the court, the decorum, the families, in insulting the judge, in challenging the judge,” she said. “That’s not the way our system is designed. That was intentional on his part, we truly believe that, he did everything he can except claim that the dog ate his homework.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Bill Kirkos Brad Parks", "Eric Levenson", "Bill Kirkos", "Brad Parks"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2021/09/13/indiana-death-row-terre-haute-indiana-federal-executions-thomas-sanders-dylann-roof-charles-hall/8032124002/", "title": "Death row in Indiana: the 46 men awaiting execution", "text": "The United States halted federal executions this month, making news across the country but hitting home more so in Indiana – where the death sentences are carried out.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland announced a moratorium on executions while officials review the Justice Department's policies and procedures related to the deaths.

Gretchen Whitmer on Biden cognitive test: 'I don't think it would hurt.'\n\nNew York Times editorial board says Trump is unfit for a second term\n\nThe New York Times editorial board in a new piece called on voters to reject a Donald Trump presidency, saying that the former president is unfit for a second term.\n\n“Mr. Trump has shown a character unworthy of the responsibilities of the presidency. He has demonstrated an utter lack of respect for the Constitution, the rule of law and the American people,” the Times editorial board, made up of opinion journalists, wrote in a piece published Thursday.\n\n“Instead of a cogent vision for the country’s future, Mr. Trump is animated by a thirst for political power: to use the levers of government to advance his interests, satisfy his impulses and exact retribution against those who he thinks have wronged him,” they added.\n\nThey wrote that they “urge voters to see the dangers of a second Trump term clearly and to reject it.”\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDemocratic lawmakers to closely watch Biden’s press conference\n\nDemocratic lawmakers will be closely watching Biden’s press conference this afternoon as several of them privately harbor concerns about his reelection bid but have so far declined to publicly weigh in.\n\nA number of House Democrats are sitting on public statements calling on the president to withdraw or to cast doubt on his chances of winning in anticipation of the press conference, according to one House Democrat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss their conversations with colleagues.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump goes after Clooney: ‘Get out of politics’\n\nFormer President Donald Trump slammed George Clooney on Wednesday after the Oscar-winning actor called on President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 presidential race.\n\n“So now fake movie actor George Clooney, who never came close to making a great movie, is getting into the act. He’s turned on Crooked Joe like the rats they both are,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Clooney should get out of politics and go back to television.”\n\nClooney, a self-described lifelong Democrat and public supporter of Biden, in an op-ed on Wednesday called on Democrats to choose a new nominee, writing “We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate.”\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nNew poll finds that most Dems want Biden to drop out and Harris would beat Trump in head to head matchup\n\nA new Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll, conducted between July 5 and July 9, found that 56% of Democratic U.S. adults surveyed want Biden to drop out of the 2024 race, while 42% think he should continue his campaign for president and 2% were skipped.\n\nThe poll also found that Harris would beat Trump in a head to head matchup.\n\nForty-nine percent of registered voters surveyed said if the election were held today, they’d choose Harris, while 47% said they’d choose Trump. Biden and Trump remain tied 46% in a head to head matchup.\n\nThe poll, conducted among 2,431 adults with 2,041 being registered voters, has a sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMichael Douglas says Clooney makes a 'valid point' about Joe Biden\n\nAmerican actor Michael Douglas has joined the growing list of celebrities who have called for President Joe Biden to step down or questioned his ability to serve.\n\nDouglas said on ABC’s The View that actor George Clooney’s op-ed calling for Biden to step out of the race makes a “valid point.”\n\n“I mean, I’m deeply, deeply concerned. I mean, especially, it’s difficult because the Democrats have a big bench. I mean, they’ve got a lot of heavy-hitters… a lot of talent,” he said.\n\n--Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho could replace Biden?\n\nSeveral names have been floated as replacements for the Democratic incumbent. Vice President Kamala Harris would most likely be the top choice, according to Reuters, but cites Harris’ difficult start to the job and poor polling numbers as potential hurdles. Other names that have been mentioned include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who are also seen as viable contenders. These possible replacements are currently Biden supporters working to re-elect the president.\n\nDespite the mounting calls, Biden remains defiant. “I’m getting so frustrated by the elites ... any of these guys that don’t think I should run, run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention,” he told MSNBC earlier this week.\n\nRyan Ross and Jeremy Yurow\n\nWhich lawmakers have called for Biden to bow out?\n\nFor nearly two weeks, President Joe Biden has been trying to downplay concerns by Democratic lawmakers worried he might lose to his Republican rival, Donald Trump, following his shaky debate performance last month.\n\nBut a wave of dissent on Capitol Hill has revealed that ten Democratic lawmakers are now publicly calling for President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race.\n\nNine House Democrats, including Lloyd Doggett of Texas, Raul Grijalva of Arizona, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Mike Quigley of Illinois, Angie Craig of Minnesota, Adam Smith of Washington, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Pat Ryan of New York and Earl Blumenauer of Oregon are urging Biden to step aside for a new generation of leaders.And on Wednesday evening, Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont became the first Democratic senator to publicly call on Biden to drop his bid for the White House.In an opinion piece in the Washington Post, Welch wrote, “For the good of the country, I’m calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.”\n\nDespite these calls, prominent members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) continue to support him.\n\n--Jeremy Yurow\n\nPelosi, Clooney raise doubts about Biden as Democratic nominee\n\nJust when it looked like Biden had united most congressional Democrats around his candidacy, the dam has started to crack.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said in a Tuesday night interview on CNN that he fears Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, will defeat Biden in a \"landslide,\" and Democrats will lose the Senate and House. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was noncommittal Wednesday on whether Biden should be the party's nominee.\n\nRep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y, who represents a swing congressional district, became the 8th House Democrat to call for Biden to withdraw from the race.\n\nAdding to Biden's woes, Hollywood actor and Democratic donor George Clooney, who hosted a Biden fundraiser just last month, called for Democrats to choose a different nominee. As did actor and director Rob Reiner, another major fundraiser.\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden aides to make case to Democratic senators\n\nAiming to shore up support, Biden's campaign is making another effort Thursday by sending three senior campaign advisors to meet with Senate Democrats.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has been holding several meetings with Democratic lawmakers throughout the week to discuss Biden's candidacy and fitness to serve. Jeffries has told his members in those private discussions he will bring their concerns back to Biden, according to a House Democrat familiar with the meetings.\n\n— Joey Garrison and Ken Tran", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/08/joe-biden-live-news-updates/74325442007/", "title": "RECAP: Dems hedge on Biden; president vows to continue 2024 ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − Senior Democrats on Capitol Hill trickled back into Washington on Monday with very different takes on whether President Joe Biden should leave the 2024 campaign against Donald Trump over concerns he's not up to the job.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer became the highest-ranking Democrat to declare his allegiance to the 81-year-old Biden, telling reporters \"I'm in for Joe\" as the New Yorker made his way into the Capitol. That comment contrasted with Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee, who in a CNN interview became the sixth House Democrat to say Biden's time was up following the president's \"alarming\" debate performance.\n\nFor his part, Biden came out swinging on Monday morning in defense of his spot atop the 2024 Democratic ticket as a pivotal week started where the incumbent's political future remains on the line.\n\nBiden insisted in a letter to congressional Democrats that he's not dropping out despite concerns about his mental fitness and capacity through the 2024 campaign and a possible second term. The oldest president in U.S. history also called into MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' to push back on the growing calls to step aside and later joined a Zoom meeting with his biggest campaign contributors to declare that the party's primary voters have spoken.\n\n\"I've got a pretty good political instinct and here's the deal, it's not going to happen here,\" Biden said during his MSNBC appearance. \"This time around, the American public is not going to move away from me as the average voter.\"\n\nThe Democrats who appeared in the House and Senate for votes Monday evening also expressed concerns about Biden's position atop the ticket, though the number of elected lawmakers who are calling publicly for the president to stand down in November didn't grow by any considerable degree. Looking ahead, Biden is set to huddle with several key constituencies, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. A set of important closed-door meetings are also scheduled on both ends of Capitol Hill on Tuesday where Biden's political future is sure to be atop lawmakers' agendas.\n\nDemocrats fret Biden could be paving way for Trump\n\nDemocrats who rallied around Joe Biden four years ago as their best chance to beat Donald Trump now fear he may be paving the way for Trump’s return.\n\nConcerns about Biden’s advanced age, questions about his physical and mental health and the fallout from a disastrous debate with Trump two weeks ago are raising doubts about whether the 81-year-old president can beat Trump again and, even if he does, whether he is capable of serving another four years.\n\n“President Biden has got to prove to the American people – including me – that he's up to the job for another four years,” Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who is facing his own tough re-election battle, told reporters on Monday.\n\nWith lawmakers returning to Capitol Hill after a short recess, the next 48 hours will be crucial for Biden’s reelection bid. Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., told reporters Biden “has to make a decision on how he feels about his ability to run, both for office and to serve as president.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden huddle in the works for Congressional Hispanic Caucus\n\nPresident Joe Biden's outreach to key Democratic constituencies will also include a huddle with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, according to Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.).\n\nPadilla didn't have a set date or time for the meeting. But the California senator who in 2021 replaced Vice President Kamala Harris also told reporters on Monday that he is sticking with Biden in 2024. \"He's more than capable of not just running, but winning in November,\" he said.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nBiden to meet with Congressional Black Caucus as he pushes back at detractors\n\nPresident Joe Biden will meet virtually Monday night with the Congressional Black Caucus, whose members have stayed firmly behind the president as some of their Democratic colleagues call for Biden to withdraw from the election.\n\nThe call, confirmed by the Biden campaign, is set for 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nNo Black members of Congress are among the six House Democrats who have publicly called for Biden to drop out of the race.\n\nWith his campaign in crisis, Biden has leaned into backing from Black voters – whose backing in the 2020 primary was critical for Biden to secure the Democratic nomination.\n\nBiden on Sunday visited a predominantly Black church in Philadelphia and emphasized his support from African-American voters during a surprise phone call Monday morning into MSNBC’s Morning Joe.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nParkinson's specialist visited White House eight times in the last year\n\nAn expert on Parkinson’s disease visited the White House a handful of times in an eight-month period − including once with the president's physician − official visitor logs show.\n\nDr. Kevin Cannard, who has served as the “neurology specialist supporting the White House Medical Unit, according to his LinkedIn, made eight appointments stretching from last August to March.\n\nCannard met with Dr. Kevin O’Connor, the president's physician, and two others at the White House residence clinic on Jan. 17, as was first reported by the New York Post.\n\nDuring a contentious press briefing Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would not say why the Parkinson’s expert visited the White House eight times or confirm who the specialist was even visiting. She said “thousands of military personnel” are on the White House campus and that “many of them get care from the White House medical unit.”\n\nJean-Pierre would only confirm that a neurologist checked Biden three times during his annual physical, which is taken at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n\nBiden’s recent physical report, from February of this year, doesn't mention Parkinson's disease at all despite the president having been evaluated by a neurologist.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Joey Garrison\n\nRep. Adam Smith joins growing chorus of Democrats calling on Biden to end candidacy\n\nThe top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee on Monday called on Joe Biden to end his candidacy after his “alarming” debate performance last month.\n\nRep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., is among the most senior Democratic lawmakers to demand that Biden leave the race and allow his party to nominate a new candidate. He is the sixth House Democrat to publicly call for Biden to drop out. Smith urged the president to exit the race as soon as possible to allow the new candidate time to make his or her case to American voters.\n\n“I'm pleading with him – take a step back,'' Smith said in an interview with CNN. \"Look at what's best for the party, look at what's best for the county.\"\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nBiden makes his case to top donors in Zoom call\n\nJoe Biden addressed his biggest donors in a Zoom conference call Monday afternoon, making the case that Democratic voters already spoke during the Democratic primary and that he will be the party’s nominee.\n\nAmid calls for Biden to drop out of the race, the president made it clear to 400 members who joined the Biden Victory Fund National Finance Committee meeting that he is “absolutely and unequivocally” remaining in the race, Chip Forrester, who co-chairs the Biden-Harris Southern Finance Committee, told USA TODAY.\n\nBiden was “clear-eyed and articulate” about his intent to move forward with the campaign, Forrester said, and he called out Donald Trump for being away from the campaign trail since Biden’s heavily criticized debate a week and a half ago.\n\nOn the call, Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley looked ahead to next week’s Republican National Convention, arguing the choice for voters will crystallize during the convention in which Trump officially accepts the GOP nomination.\n\nBiden took questions from some of the donors during the Zoom call and was introduced by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, who has become one of Biden’s top surrogates.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden is \"all in\" for Biden's campaign\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden reassured supporters that she and Joe Biden are intent on staying in the 2024 presidential race during a campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina on Monday.\n\n“Joe has made it clear that he’s all in,\" the first lady said to boisterous cheers from the crowd. \"And just as he has always supported my career, I’m all in too.\"\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nChuck Schumer says he is backing Biden\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, reiterated his support for the president on Monday, telling reporters \"I'm for Joe,\" as he entered the Capitol.\n\nSeveral other congressional Democrats have spoken out to support Biden amid the growing calls for him to drop out of the race, including Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina and Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Alex Padilla of California. Clyburn is a co-chair of Biden's campaign. Padilla sits on its national advisory board.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nBiden calls into Morning Joe\n\nJoe Biden emphatically said he will continue to run for president during a live TV phone interview Monday morning.\n\n\"I want to make sure I was right, that the average voter out there wanted Joe Biden and I'm confident they do,” Biden said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. “The bottom line here is that we are not going anywhere. I am not going anywhere. I would not be running if I didn't believe I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump in 2024.”\n\nThe president said average voters would not turn away from him, and expressed frustration with the “elites” calling on him to drop out, claiming they have been wrong in past elections.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 Republican nominee, calling him a “liar.”\n\n“This guy is gonna rip away at a woman's right to choose in a permanent way. This guy is gonna make sure that he exacts revenge. This guy's gonna destroy democracy,” Biden said.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nLatino voters in Arizona say they are unfazed by Biden’s debate performance\n\nBiden campaign organizers in Arizona on Monday sought to rally Latino and young voter support amid swirling concerns about the future of the president’s reelection bid.\n\nLatino voters the USA TODAY Network spoke with in Arizona said they were unfazed by Biden’s poor debate performance and believed demands for him to withdraw from the 2024 race were ridiculous.\n\n“Biden is the best choice. He has the best interest for America as a whole, and I think that performance in itself, at least for me, wasn’t going to change anything,” said 25-year-old Jose Medrano, a Latino voter from Phoenix said.\n\nGarnering support among Latinos, who make up one-quarter of eligible voters in Arizona, is pivotal for Biden this election season.\n\n– Sabine Martin\n\nReps. Jerry Nadler, Adam Smith and Mark Takano call for Biden to exit race\n\nFour House Democrats said Biden should step down as the Democratic presidential nominee during a private phone call for committee ranking members on Sunday afternoon, multiple media reported.\n\nThey include Reps. Jerry Nadler of New York, Adam Smith of Washington, Mark Takano of California and Joe Morelle of New York.\n\nAll of those lawmakers are the top Democrats on House committees. The call was held by House Democratic leadership and was attended by other top Democrats as questions mount over whether Biden can beat former President Trump in November.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJohn Fetterman stands by Biden\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., defended President Joe Biden during an appearance on CNN on Monday as multiple Democrats continue to voice concerns about the incumbent president's decision to stay in the 2024 White House race.\n\n\"Joe Biden has been a great president ... and I'm not going to chuck him for a rough debate,” Fetterman said.\n\nThe Pennsylvania senator, who appeared with Biden at multiple campaign stops across the pivotal swing state on Sunday, said he did not see the president falter.\n\n“He was perfect,\" Fetterman said. \"At every single stop that we had, people were thrilled, I mean, people were thirsty to have their picture taken with the president. And he was crisp, and he was engaged ... he was crushing it.\"\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\n‘Run against me’: Biden lashes out at ‘elitist’ Democratic critics\n\nJoe Biden lashed out at Democratic critics during a phone call Monday morning into MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” slamming those who want him to withdraw from the race as “elites” and daring them to run against him.\n\n“I’m getting so frustrated by the elites in the party – they know so much more,” Biden sarcastically told co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski\n\n“If any of these guys don’t think I should run, run against me. Announce they’re (running for) president. Challenge me at the convention.”\n\nDespite facing nominal opposition during the Democratic primary, Biden has argued he is the choice of Democratic voters.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nReps. Seth Moulton, Mike Quigley and more urge Biden to step aside\n\nFive House Democrats have publicly called for Biden to drop out of the 2024 race, including Reps. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, Seth Moulton, D-Mass., Mike Quigley, D-Ill., Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., and Angie Craig, D-Minn.\n\nQuigley said Monday that he believes there will be more Democrats this week speaking out against President Joe Biden's reelection campaign.\n\n“It's going to be an amazing, unfortunately horrible week. But I do think the numbers will grow. I don't know how the president will react to that,” he said during an interview on CNN.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen is the Democratic National Convention?\n\nThe 2024 DNC will start on August 19 and run through August 2022 in Chicago. Though, the DNC plans to hold a virtual roll call vote on a date still to be determined to formally decide the nominee.\n\nThe Democratic Party will officially nominate it's presidential and vice presidential candidate during the convention. Joe Biden will be the party's nominee unless he voluntarily steps aside, which he has so far said he will not do.\n\n– Elizabeth Beyer\n\nWill Biden be replaced?\n\nBarring a very messy intra-party revolt, the Democratic presidential nomination is Biden's to accept – or decline. And so far the president has pushed back on growing calls for his exit with seemingly no intention yet of stepping away.\n\nIf Biden were to change his mind and drop his bid for reelection, focus would then turn to finding a replacement for the top of the ticket. Vice President Kamala Harris, already first in line for the presidency, is a favored candidate for the position.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhere does Biden stand in the polls?\n\nJoe Biden has slipped further behind Donald Trump in most polls taken since the two faced off last month in the first 2024 presidential debate.\n\nAccording to an exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University survey conducted immediately after the debate, Trump edged ahead of Biden 41% to 38%. Prior to the debate debacle, the two contenders were tied at 37% of the vote.\n\nA recent New York Times and Siena College poll found that Trump's lead against Biden increased by 3% after the debate\n\n– Elizabeth Beyer and Karissa Waddick\n\nDavid Axelrod predicts that Biden won’t win, can’t beat Father Time\n\nFormer Obama advisor David Axelrod said Sunday that he thinks it’s more likely Joe Biden will lose the 2024 race “by a landslide” than narrowly beat Donald Trump.\n\n“He’s fought his way back from political defeats and against the odds. And so, his psyche is that he can beat anybody and any long odds. What he can’t beat is Father Time. And that’s really the concern here. It’s not about his record,” Axelrod told CNN.\n\n“There are certain immutable facts of life,” Axelrod added. “And those were painfully obvious on that debate stage, and the President just doesn’t seem to come to − he hasn’t come to grips with it. He’s not winning this race...if you just look at the data and talk to people around the country, political people around the country, it’s more likely that he’ll lose by a landslide than win narrowly this race.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden's letter to congressional Democrats\n\nJoe Biden sent a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday reaffirming his commitment to staying in the presidential race.\n\nBiden said he'd had \"extensive\" conversations with Democrats and understood their \"good faith fears and worries\" about the stakes of the election. \"I'm not blind to them,\" Biden said.\n\n\"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\" he wrote.\n\nHe has consistently said since a debate fiasco, where he froze and trailed off at times, that he would continue on in the race.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nHistorian with near perfect prediction record rejects calls for Biden to drop out\n\nHistorian Allan Lichtman has accurately predicted nine of the last ten presidential elections. Now, he's rejecting the growing chorus of political pundits and Democratic activists calling on Biden, 81, to bow out of the presidential race.\n\n“It’s a huge mistake. They're not doctors. They don't know whether Biden is physically capable of carrying out a second term or not,” Lichtman, a professor at American University, said during an interview with CNN. “This is all foolhardy nonsense.”\n\nLichtman references several factors, from incumbency to economic conditions, in forecasting election winners. Debate performance, he argued, is not one of the factors that determines the outcome of an election.\n\n“Debate performances can be overcome,” he said. “At the first sign of adversity the spineless Democrats want to throw under the bus, their own incumbent president.

Gretchen Whitmer, then-Sen. Kamala Harris of California and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker at a campaign rally in Detroit in March of that year. “They are the future of this country.”\n\nThough Biden never publicly pledged he would seek only one term, many in the party believed he would not run again. Yet four years later, Biden, already the nation’s oldest president on the day he assumed office, is asking voters to send him back to the White House. If he’s reelected, Biden would be 82 at the start of a second term and, if he served the full four years, 86 when he finished.\n\nBiden’s decision has left Regunberg with “an immense amount of sadness, disappointment and anger.”\n\n“It is very clear where we're headed right now,” said Regunberg, who is among a growing number of Democrats calling on Biden to end his campaign. “All of the smart people in our party have been ringing the alarm bells.”\n\nBiden, already facing a brutal rematch against former President Donald Trump, is getting slammed by a tsunami of challenges, including another bout of COVID, as he tries to persuade voters to give him a second term.

Biden’s poll numbers dropped, triggering calls for him to step aside so the party could nominate Harris or someone else who might have a better chance of beating Trump.\n\nMore complications set in last Saturday when Trump survived a shocking attempted assassination at a rally in Pennsylvania, forcing Biden to tone down his tough rhetoric against his Republican rival.\n\nThen on Wednesday, Biden tested positive for COVID-19. The diagnosis – his third positive test in two years – could take him off the campaign trail for several days at a time when the president is trying to convince voters he is physically and mentally fit.\n\nA campaign in crisisJoe Biden bargains with America, insists he's in good shape. That might not be enough.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of Democrats asking him to drop out of the race keeps growing.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, who is running for Senate in California, on Wednesday became the most prominent Democrat to call for Biden to step aside.\n\nOther top Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have reportedly raised concerns to Biden privately and have warned that his struggling campaign could weaken candidates running for the House and Senate.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of aides who worked with Biden when he was a senator and vice president released a letter asking him to exit the race.\n\n“While we maintain tremendous loyalty to you personally, our loyalty to the principles of our democracy and the needs of our nation must take precedence at this critical moment when the norms and institutions of our democracy are at risk,” reads the letter, a copy of which was obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nJamie Metzl, who was deputy staff director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Biden was chairman, circulated the letter to other former staffers in conjunction with a group called Pass the Torch, which was co-founded by Regunberg.\n\n“Hope springs eternal with regard to health and biology and aging. But at the debates we saw just a very different story,” Metzl said. “It's unfortunate, but every single person saw the ravages of time. It's just inconceivable to call that just a bad night.”\n\nFull-blown crisis:An inside look at campaign's pitfalls.\n\nTwo-thirds of Democrats don’t want Biden to run for reelection, according to a new survey by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Seven in 10 adults polled, including 65% of Democrats, say Biden should withdraw and allow his party to select another nominee. The survey was conducted July 11-15 and mostly completed before the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nHe continues to resist calls to exit. Biden said in an interview with BET on Tuesday that he would consider dropping out only \"if I had some medical condition that emerged, if the doctors came to me and said you got this problem or that problem.\"\n\nBiden's deputy campaign manager, Quinten Fulks, insisted Thursday that his team was not preparing for the possibility of him dropping out. “Our campaign is not working through any scenarios where President Biden is not the top of the ticket,\" Fulks said. \"He is and will be the Democratic nominee.\"\n\nRegunberg, a progressive activist and former state senator from Rhode Island, said it was “unconscionable” and “unfathomable” to him that “one person would put their own career and ambitions and ego above the good of an entire country and world.”\n\nPass the Torch has already organized 5,000 phone calls and 15,000 emails from voters to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, as well as state legislatures, to try to persuade Biden to step aside.\n\n“But Biden still hasn’t gotten the message,” Regunberg said.\n\nRhode Island state Sen. Tiara Mack, who is running for reelection, said Biden’s “underwhelming and terrifying” debate performance convinced her that he was not the right person to face Trump.\n\nMack, 30, who is Black and identifies as queer, said she worries about what a second Trump administration would mean to marginalized communities.\n\n“We need the strongest candidate possible to defeat the existential threat to our democracy,” she said.\n\nTo drive home that point, Pass the Torch is planning a rally Saturday outside the White House. But Biden won’t be there to hear their message. He was expected to be isolating at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, while he recovers from COVID-19.\n\nWhether his campaign can recover remains an unanswered question.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Michael Collins cover the White House.

A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,” Trump wrote in a post on the social network Truth Social and accused “Big Tech” of working closely with Democrats. “Our great ‘Founders’ did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!”\n\nTrump’s post came after the release of internal Twitter emails showing deliberation in 2020 over a New York Post story about material found on Hunter Biden’s laptop.\n\nWhite House spokesman Andrew Bates said Saturday that Trump’s remarks are “anathema to the soul of our nation, and should be universally condemned.”\n\n“You cannot only love America when you win,” Bates said in a statement. “The American Constitution is a sacrosanct document that for over 200 years has guaranteed that freedom and the rule of law prevail in our great country.

Party leaders had hoped that the former president would drop his election denialism rhetoric after lackluster results in the midterms.\n\nEarlier this week Trump expressed support for the rioters behind the deadly January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, saying in a video played during a fundraiser that “People have been treated unconstitutionally in my opinion and very, very unfairly, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it.”\n\nIn a September interview, Trump said he was “financially supporting” some January 6 defendants and promised he would issue pardons and a government apology to those being prosecuted if he were reelected.\n\nHe has also come under fire for having dinner at his Mar-a-lago resort with known White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and rapper Kanye West, who has recently made a slew of antisemitic remarks.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/10/barack-obama-joe-biden-2024-trump/72091768007/", "title": "Barack Obama fears close 2024 race with Trump, tries to 'move the ...", "text": "The people closest to Barack Obama are expressing increasing alarm about 2024 at the same time President Joe Biden’s campaign looks to quell worrisome voices within the Democratic Party.\n\nFormer Attorney General Eric Holder, a close friend who is often considered Obama's political alter ego, told USA Today Monday there would be \"incalculable damage\" to the country if former President Donald Trump wins the November election.\n\nAsked if Obama shares that view, Holder replied: \"Absolutely. I don't think it's a question about that.”\n\n\"I think that's what motivates him. I think that's what will continue to motivate him,\" Holder said.\n\nThe former president’s wife, Michelle, revealed she’s \"terrified\" about the election's outcome in a podcast interview this week.\n\nTrump is leading Biden in multiple surveys, including a Jan. 3 USA Today/Suffolk University poll. That survey finds Biden narrowly trailing Trump, the likely Republican nominee, 39%-37%; with 17% supporting an unnamed third-party candidate.\n\nOther Democrats, who recently marked the 15th anniversary of Obama’s historic win, are also sharing their fears that Trump could return to power with a vengeance. They say Biden's campaign must lean heavily into the emotions progressive and independent voters are having more urgently.\n\n\"I'm convinced more than ever before, that we have to save the American democracy through our actions, and that we cannot allow Trump to be dictator for one minute, much less one day, one week and give him four years,\" said Anton Gunn, a South Carolina Democrat who worked on Obama's 2008 campaign.\n\nDavid Axelrod, a longtime personal friend and adviser of Obama, last year went as far to suggest Biden drop out of the contest, though people close to the former president have emphasized Axelrod does not speak for anyone but himself.\n\nThis puts a unique spotlight on Obama, who is speaking with Biden regularly and honestly about his thoughts on the race, according to sources close to the former president who spoke with USA Today.\n\nHe is increasingly being tasked with coming to his former vice president's rescue as polling shows Biden struggling with Black, Hispanic and voters younger than 35, who are essential to any victory.\n\nMany Obama alumni, such as pollster Cornell Belcher and campaign manager Jim Messina, who spoke with USA Today, downplay the reported panic and tension between the two camps, pointing to various examples that presidential reelections are often behind this far out.\n\nBut others acknowledge that, rather than optimism, there is dread going into 2024 that Biden's campaign cannot dismiss.\n\nHow worried is Obama about Biden in 2024?\n\nObama's office said the former president is well aware of the stakes.\n\nFor now, his strategy is based on \"driving impact,\" and being deliberate in \"picking our moments because our objective is to move the needle,\" according to senior advisor Eric Schultz.\n\nWhat that looks like in public is the former president \"finding creative ways to reach new audiences,\" with tools directly tied to mobilizing voters, Schultz said.\n\nThe president and his former boss chat regularly, and Obama thinks the election \"will be a very close race,\" according to a person close to Obama who spoke to USA Today.\n\nObama views the 2024 race as having \"major structural advantages that will favor Republicans,\" in the form of rising polarization, intensely loyal Trump voters and a Trump-friendly conservative ecosystem, especially online.\n\nOthers close to the former president said he views Trump's reelection as \"dangerous\" and has been consistent in delivering that message to all Democrats, including Biden.\n\nHolder said the former president's deepening concern is felt by how plugged in he is with Biden and his campaign in the early stages.\n\n\"This is certainly the campaign that President Biden is going to have to ultimately make decisions about,\" Holder said.\n\n\"President Obama is going to do everything he can to help in that regard, and that means campaigning, but it also means sharing strategic advice with (Biden),\" he added. \"And who better than President Obama to be a primary advisor to the campaign?\"\n\nObama's 'mentor-in-chief' role to Biden, younger Dems\n\nObama remains the brightest star in the Democrats' political constellation and Biden's most lucrative fundraiser, outside of White House principals, according to campaign officials.\n\nStanding should-to-shoulder with the president in a recent campaign fundraising ad, which the president's team said brought in roughly $4 million, Obama told viewers, \"our democracy depends on you.\"\n\nThose who have worked intimately with the former president convey that their old boss is keenly aware of how consequential this election will be and how vital his involvement is at every level.\n\n\"I think he's playing a lot of roles simultaneously,\" said Eric Lesser, a former Massachusetts legislator who worked on the 2008 campaign.\n\n\"He's sincere about wanting to support school committee members and city councilors, up to presidents. So there's almost like a mentor-in-chief role that he's taken on.\"\n\nObama remains a sounding board for the president, sources tell USA Today. He has an open \"yes\" to requests from the White House and Biden campaign, and their staffs have a \"family\" connection, multiple sources said.\n\nHe has also notedly been hosting private discussions with younger Democratic lawmakers and candidates, including progressive House members such as Reps. Maxwell Frost, of Florida, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York.\n\nAt a time when many voters express concern about Biden's age, many alumni from the previous Democratic administration see Obama's chief role in 2024 as a necessary generational bridge for a party trying to court Gen Z voters with an 81-year-old incumbent.\n\n\"It's funny because he's simultaneously an elder statesman in the sense that he's been through a lot of battles and has a lot of experience, but he's also very young and has a big, long career in front of him,\" Lesser said.\n\nPoll: Dems less enthusiastic about Biden\n\nYet it is impossible to quiet Democrats who are publicly biting their nails about Biden's chances, including prominent figures in the party's power circles and Obama network.\n\nThey point to how most 2024 polls show Trump in the lead with a little less than 10 months to go, and a failure to sell progressive voters on accomplishments, such as securing $132 billion in student loan debt relief despite resistance from Republican opponents.\n\nAxelrod, who served as a senior adviser to Obama, rattled the race when he suggested last year that Biden should think about leaving the race.\n\nHe later said the surveys showing Trump ahead in battleground states represented \"very dark\" news for Biden's reelection campaign.\n\nRep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., who was instrumental in helping Biden win the Democratic nomination in 2020, said on CNN's State of the Union he's \"very concerned\" about the president's support.\n\nGunn, the South Carolina Democrat who considers himself a Clyburn protégé, was instrumental in selling the public on the heart and soul of the Affordable Care Act when he was part of the Obama administration. He said the Biden campaign isn't engaging voters, particularly African Americans, on the urgency of 2024 beyond facts and statistics.\n\n\"What keeps me up is that if we only make the rational, thoughtful and deliberate argument of why Biden is better, and don't recognize that there needs to be an emotional current through this campaign,\" he said.\n\n\"The same way Obama had an emotional currency, the same way Trump had an emotional currency when he won in 2016, there's a big fear that this could all go south because people vote emotionally. They don't vote rationally.\"\n\nThe USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll released Jan. 3, for instance, shows only 18% of primary voters selected “very enthusiastic” when asked to rate their excitement about Biden on a scale 1 to 10.\n\nRoughly 44% of GOP primary voters said the same when asked to rate Trump.\n\nThird party woes and Biden's selling points\n\nThe Biden campaign and other Obama alumni push back at many of these conclusions while trying to calm a widening apprehension among Democrats.\n\nQuentin Fulks, who serves as Biden's deputy campaign manager, said that instead of \"parachuting into communities of color a few weeks before the election,\" the president's reelection team is investing earlier and more aggressively than in previous cycles.\n\nThe Biden campaign has invested more than $25 million in Black and Latino media, according to Biden campaign officials.\n\n\"We are meeting voters in every community where they are and putting in the work to earn every vote and let voters know how President Biden and Vice President Harris have delivered for them in an unprecedented way,\" Fulks said.\n\n\"The stakes are high, and we aren’t taking anything for granted.\"\n\nOther Democratic campaign veterans who come from Obama's network throw cold water on political forecasters, who had similar gloomy predictions in years past.\n\n\"I am amused at the collective amnesia every election season of the press,\" said Belcher, a Democratic pollster who worked for both Obama presidential campaigns.\n\n\"No candidate or campaign starts off a year or year and a half out where they want to be or where they need to be. If so they would, we would have no need for campaigns.\"\n\nBelcher noted how headlines wondered if Obama was “toast” in the early stages of his 2012 reelection bid, and that predictions from FiveThirtyEight, a political data analysis site, rated Obama with a 17% chance of winning against Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nMessina, who led Obama's two campaigns, said surveys \"are famously bad\" in the earlier stages of a presidential race because voters don't have a focused choice in front of them.\n\n\"Elections are a choice, and we haven’t formalized that choice yet. Once voters know their options, their opinions change,\" he said.\n\nOne element that could make 2024 different than the Obama reelection 12 years ago, however, is the role third−party contenders are playing.\n\nWhen respondents are asked about their choice when ballot includes the seven possible presidential candidates—such as independents Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West; or Green Party nominee Jill Stein—Trump holds a 37%-34% lead, according to the USA Today/Suffolk poll released this month.\n\nThat margin shrinks in Biden's favor when there are fewer candidates. The president trails 44%-43% when there are no other third party contenders in the race, according to the survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1%.\n\nThe data points to significant frustration among potential Biden voters, said David Paleologos, director of Suffolk's Political Research Center.\n\n\"The bet for Biden right now is once we get this to a binary choice, one-on-one, people will not vote for Trump,\" he said. \"And that's a big gamble, because that assumes that all of the other third party candidates will go away or their support will dissipate.\"\n\nPaleologos said more progressive-leaning voters have consistently expressed being, \"fed up with the staleness of the choices that are being offered.\"\n\nBelcher, the Democratic pollster, said the problem Biden's campaign will be challenged to solve over the next 10 months is selling Black, Hispanic and younger constituencies on its accomplishments.\n\n\"For me, Biden has really better story to tell these young, diverse voters than Obama did,\" he said. \"But these voters have a stronger affinity to Obama than they do Biden.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/08/joe-biden-calls-to-drop-out-2024/74330665007/", "title": "Joe Biden faces crucial moment as calls mount for him to drop out", "text": "WASHINGTON – Democrats quickly rallied around Joe Biden four years ago when they became convinced he was their best chance at beating Donald Trump.\n\nOne by one, other candidates dropped out of the Democratic primary and threw their support to Biden before many Americans even had a chance to vote amid the global COVID pandemic. The strategy worked. Biden captured the party’s nomination and defeated Trump that November.\n\nNow, with Biden ensnared in a political crisis that threatens to end his five-decade career, a growing number of Democrats have grown fearful that the man who stopped a second Trump presidency in 2020 may be paving the way for Trump’s return in 2024.\n\nConcerns about Biden’s advanced age, questions about his physical and mental health and the fallout from a disastrous debate with Trump two weeks ago are raising doubts about whether the 81-year-old president can beat the 78-year-old Trump again and, even if he does, whether he is capable of serving another four years.\n\nA handful of Democrats, including the top-ranking Democrats on four House committees, already have called on Biden to drop out of the race so the party can nominate someone else with a better chance of winning. Others are expected to soon join the growing chorus urging Biden to quit.\n\n“President Biden has got to prove to the American people – including me – that he's up to the job for another four years,” said Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who is facing his own tough re-election battle in November.\n\n2024 race:Candidates have survived bad debates. But is a reckoning afoot after Biden v. Trump?\n\nWith lawmakers returning to Capitol Hill on Monday after the two-week Fourth of July holiday recess, the next 48 hours will be crucial for Biden’s reelection bid. Some major Democratic donors are looking to the party’s senior leadership to get through to the president.\n\nThe conversation is not just about who can defeat Trump, but whether the party should nominate an octogenarian “who looks like he’s slowing down\" to lead the country for the next four and a half years, said Marty Dolan, a donor who shelled out $10,000 to the Biden campaign in April.\n\nDolan said he has been encouraged to speak out by donors who have plunked down multiples of that amount. For now, many of them prefer to work behind the scenes, he said.\n\n“No one thinks confidently that Biden is going to be leading this country when he is 86-years-old,” Dolan said. “That's the central issue that the donors are stuck on.”\n\nBiden and his reelection team have been working frantically to undo the damage caused by the debate debacle and quell the calls for him to quit. Biden sent a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday and insisted he’s not dropping out.\n\n\"I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\" he wrote.\n\nBut some lawmakers on Capitol Hill and Biden’s wealthy donors are worried time is running out.\n\nThe party’s candidate “must be able to clearly, articulately, and strongly make his or her case to the American people,” Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said in calling on Biden to end his candidacy.\n\n“It is clear that President Biden is no longer able to meet this burden,” Smith said.\n\nDolan said donors are waiting to see what Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will do.\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., showed no signs of doubt about Biden on Monday. “I’m for Joe,” he told reporters as he entered the Capitol.\n\nBiden fights back:President lashes out at Dem 'elites,' dares post-debate critics to 'run against me'\n\nSen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip, said his level of confidence in the president is “high” and that he thinks Biden should continue his campaign. Durbin said he is discussing “alternatives” with his colleagues but hasn’t heard anything he’ll support publicly.\n\nDurbin said he’s concerned the narrative throughout the 2024 presidential race will remain about Biden’s mental fitness for the job, but he said Biden has “a hard-charging, directly confrontational approach” and that he’s “going to establish that he has the physical and mental strength to finish his campaign and win.”\n\nWalking into the first Senate vote of the week, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, said he'll tell his colleagues that Biden is doing what they've asked. He pointed to Biden’s primetime interview with ABC News on Friday and decision to call into MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Monday.\n\nBiden “is the most accomplished and consequential president in my lifetime,” Coons said. “I think it would be a huge mistake for the Democratic Party, based on one evening and one debate, to turn aside from supporting a very seasoned and capable president.”\n\nSen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., said he remains confident Biden is going to win and with strong support. Still, he said Biden needs to get out into the country and have informal, unscripted conversations with voters and reporters.\n\n“He needs to get out and keep chatting with people,” Lujan said. “And we saw that with gatherings across the country where President Biden was out there chatting with folks, unscripted, just chatting with people. That's when Joe Biden's best.”\n\nIn Arizona:Biden campaign pushes for Latino voter support as candidacy concerns swirl\n\nWith so much at stake in the upcoming election, “now is the time for conversations about the strongest path forward,” said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who has reportedly pulled back from trying to assembling a group of senators to call on Biden to withdraw.\n\nWarner told reporters on Monday that it is incumbent upon Biden “to more aggressively make his case to the American people and to hear directly from a broader group of voices about how to best prevent Trump’s lawlessness from returning to the White House.”\n\nSen Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said he wants to see Biden be able to \"go out there and campaign day and night vigorously and passionately.\" He declined to say whether he thinks Biden should remain on the ticket. But, \"I think it's very appropriate for us to be having this discussion,\" he said.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, stopped short of a definitive \"yes\" when asked whether he still supports Biden as the party's nominee. \"The president is going to win,\" he said, warning against electing Trump.\n\nOn the House side of the Capitol, Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., told reporters Biden “has to make a decision on how he feels about his ability to run, both for office and to serve as president.”\n\nHigh-stakes summit:His reelection campaign in crisis, Joe Biden hosts NATO meeting in Washington\n\n“He's going to continue to make his judgments, and I think those of us who care deeply about this country and care deeply about him, we're going to have to continue to communicate whatever concerns we have,” Morelle said.\n\nBiden’s letter to congressional Democrats wasn’t enough, added Morelle, who along with three other ranking members of House committees had spoken up about the president exiting the 2024 campaign during a Sunday night call with party leaders.\n\n“The American public is very concerned about his ability to continue to serve as commander-in-chief, and he's going to have to do more to persuade them – and simply writing a letter to Congress or an open letter to the public, I don’t think that’s sufficient,’ Morelle said.\n\nThe head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., suggested reporters questioning Biden’s debate performance should also ask Republicans why they are supporting a convicted felon.\n\n“Republicans should be calling for Donald Trump to step down as a candidate for President,” Jayapal said.\n\nJayapal said Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris had “remarkable accomplishments” during their first term. But Trump’s appointments to the Supreme Court ended the right to abortion, she said, and “he demonizes and scapegoats immigrants and destroys wages and labor protections for working people.\"\n\n“It is true that Democrats are having many conversations among our members and our constituents as we consider the best path forward to protect our democracy,” said Jayapal, who said she would continue to listen carefully to voters across the country about how to defeat Trump.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/09/bennet-biden-trump-voter-concerns/74347221007/", "title": "Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet warns Biden could lose to Trump ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said Tuesday night he thinks President Joe Biden cannot beat former President Donald Trump in the November presidential election, the most stark comments from a Senate Democrat to date.\n\n“Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,” Bennet, a three-term senator, told CNN. “So for me, this isn’t a question about polling. It’s not a question about politics. It’s a moral question about the future of our country.”\n\nBennet stopped short of calling upon Biden to step out of the race, but made the case that Democrats have a \"moral obligation\" to \"do everything we can\" to beat Trump during an interview with Kaitlan Collins.\n\nHe noted that Biden was nine percentage points ahead of Trump on a national level at this point in the 2020 cycle and that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was five points ahead of Trump in the 2016 cycle. Biden is currently around two percentage points behind Trump as of Tuesday night, according to polling averages.\n\n\"I'm sure President Biden has a different view of his prospects in this election than I do, but we should be having a discussion about that,\" Bennet said.\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election, that they have a convincing plan to win in the battleground states where we have to win in order to win the election. And they need to do that,\" Bennet said.\n\nThe interview comes after Biden's debate stumbles last month kicked off a panic within the party over whether he can effectively represent them in an election many Democrats see as an existential fight against Trump and his Republican allies.\n\nSenate Democrats met for the first time in more than two weeks on Tuesday, and lawmakers leaving the caucus lunch meeting were tight-lipped about the nature of the conversations. However, they made it clear that they were unwilling to create a public firestorm that might push Biden to leave his post as the party's nominee.\n\nBennet and a handful of his colleagues, however, have been arguing that Biden must do more to show voters that he is capable of successfully prosecuting a case against Trump in the general election.\n\nIf Biden is at the top of the ticket, Bennet argued on CNN, he could also impact other races beside his own: The Colorado lawmaker said Democrats could risk losing the House and Senate in the fall, and Trump would likely have additional Supreme Court nominees if he's reelected to a second term.\n\n\"I believe the entire future of our country is at stake,\" Bennet said. \"I think it's critically important they address the concerns of the American people, not ignore them.\"\n\nBennet noted in the CNN interview that no one in the Senate's caucus meeting directly said they believe Biden should drop out of the race.\n\nBiden has made clear that he has no intention of ending his reelection bid. In a letter to Congressional Democrats Monday morning, Biden said he is \"firmly committed\" to remaining the party's nominee.\n\n\"There are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to multiple outlets after Bennet's interview.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/09"}]}

Gavin Newsom was “the final straw,” causing him to move his Space X company to the Lone Star State. He later posted that X will also relocate its headquarters to Texas.\n\n“Because of this law and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies, SpaceX will now move its HQ from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, Texas,” he posted.\n\nCalifornia's SAFETY Act limits schools from creating rules that require employees to notify parents of a child's gender identity. Musk, who has 12 children, has been an outspoken critic of California's policies.\n\nWhere is Starbase, Texas?\n\nStarbase, a company town being built near Brownsville in South Texas, currently houses a landing pad, launch facility, launch control center and tracking station for SpaceX. The aerospace company has been conducting all its Starship test launches from Boca Chica, near the Texas-Mexico border along the coast, and earlier this year it announced a $100 million, five-story office there. Construction for that office has already started and is set to be completed by 2025, Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation records show.\n\nElsewhere, SpaceX already has facilities in Bastrop, where Musk is building the Hyperloop Plaza, which he imagines as a work-live community for his employees.\n\nThe crown jewel of Musk's companies, Tesla, is headquartered in Austin and could be the reason he chose the capital city as the next home for his social media company, X.\n\nMusk had been eyeing moves to Texas\n\nPublic filings made with the Texas Secretary of State Office in February showed Musk's interest in moving SpaceX to Texas as the California-based aerospace company requested to change its incorporation location to the Lone Star State.\n\nMusk started to grow more fond of the move to Texas after clashing with a Delaware judge over his extraordinary compensation plan with Tesla. This meant moving the incorporation location of various businesses, including Austin-based Tesla, out of Delaware and to Texas.\n\nAfter the recent announcement of the headquarters relocations to Texas, Musk doubled down on why he dislikes California saying, \"Have had enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building.\"\n\nHe also claims that he warned Newsom, California's governor, about enacting legislation such as the SAFETY Act.\n\n\"I did make it clear to Governor Newsom about a year ago that laws of this nature would force families and companies to leave California to protect their children,\" he said.\n\nHow did Gov. Greg Abbott respond to Musk's news?\n\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott was quick to seize on the Space X announcement, reposting Musk's \"This is the final straw\" missive that announced the move from California to Texas.\n\n\"This cements Texas as the leader in space exploration,\" the governor said on X before Musk dropped the second shoe in his Texas two-step about his social media company's planned relocation to Austin.\n\nAbbott's office declined to weigh in on the X move. But he and Musk have been fairly interactive on the platform in recent months. When Musk on June 6 posted a video of Starship's liftoff in the Lone Star State, Abbott amplified the event with his own message.\n\n\"Elon Musk, making Texas proud,\" Abbott posted in a reply.\n\nWhen Musk broke ground on Tesla’s lithium refining facility in Robstown, near Corpus Christi, in May 2023, Abbott was lavish in his praise\n\n\"This is not just good for jobs, but it’s good for the entire future of the state,\" Abbott said. \"Texas wants to be able to be self-reliant, not dependent on any foreign hostile nation for what we need. We need lithium for the phone you have in your hands, for the batteries that be in Tesla trucks, and for other purposes.\"\n\nLongtime political operative Bill Miller of Austin said Musk's moves open the door for Abbott and other state leaders to continue boasting about Texas' business-friendly regulatory policies.\n\n\"He is one of the world's wealthiest people ... and he's one of the most famous people in the world,\" Miller said of Musk. \"No matter how you cut it, that qualifies this as a big deal. You can brag about it any way you want.\"\n\nWhy is Texas so desirable for Musk?\n\nIt is no secret that Musk has an affinity for Texas, but, as a business decision, moving to the state has a myriad of personal and professional advantages. He seems to prefer the politics in the state and his stated reason for leaving California confirms that.\n\nMore importantly, Musk being in favor in Texas and the state's fewer regulations could be attractive to him in terms of headquarters locations and incorporations.

This includes automaker Tesla and the Boring Company, which are both now headquartered in Central Texas.

Here's what we know\n\nIs Elon Musk 'more at home with Texas culture than California?'\n\nMusk does spend a significant amount of his time in the Austin area in particular, though he says he lives in South Texas. While Twitter has taken much of his focus in recent weeks, between March 2021 and September 2022 Musk spent more time in Austin than anywhere else, according to his flight log.\n\nRoger Kay, a technology analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates, also said it's likely Twitter's presence in Texas will grow, whether Musk formally moves the corporate headquarters or not.\n\n\"I think it’s fair to say Twitter’s presence in Texas will grow,\" Kay said. \"It’s where his other companies are and where he spends more time these days. I also think he’s more at home with Texas culture than California. Whether it’s called a headquarters or not doesn’t much matter.

It changes the age conversation.\n\nIn 2022, Musk said via a meme that perceived extremism on the left has led him to become more of a moderate conservative. Since then, he’s said that he would support Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in a presidential run and said in 2023 that he believed the Republican Party should choose Vivek Ramaswamy for vice president. Neither is a moderate conservative.\n\nIt’s especially visible in Musk’s takeover of Twitter, now X. We're talking about the same guy who interacts with antisemitic content and barred the use of the word “cisgender” because of his own hang-ups about trans people.\n\nHis determination to make the site less “woke” led to the 2022 reinstatement of Trump’s account and, according to a Washington Post analysis, an increased popularity of right-wing figures on the platform.\n\nTransgender member of Congress?Sarah McBride could become the first trans person elected to Congress. It's about time.\n\nAll of this makes sense for Musk as he continues down his path as a far-right influencer and general social media troll. You only have to look as far as his personal social media and overzealous fanbase to see the overlap between his cult of personality and the far right.\n\nThis is something that should concern everyone, even those of us who don't particularly care what Musk has to say about politics.\n\nMusk puts business over everything, and right now, he thinks Trump is good for business\n\nI’m not shocked that Musk has made a hard pivot toward the Republican Party. He’s been telling us who he is for a while now. And as much as he complains about the left, it’s unlikely that liberals are solely responsible for driving Musk away from the Democrats and out of California.\n\nMusk is, first and foremost, a businessman. He knows that a Trump-controlled federal government will provide him tax cuts and lucrative business contracts, and that the Securities and Exchange Commission is far likelier to take it easy on him with the GOP in power.\n\nTrump himself has mocked Musk's \"many subsidized projects.\"\n\nIt’s also highly likely that his plans to leave California are business-minded, as well. In moving X and SpaceX to Texas, he also leaves behind California’s corporate tax rate and labor laws. He’s already seen the benefits since moving Tesla’s headquarters to Austin.\n\nWhat's concerning is how he may influence others.\n\nAside from owning one of the largest social media platforms in the world, he has a loyal fanbase that follows his every move. With his huge contributions to Trump's reelection and a bully pulpit to opine from, there's no telling how much he will affect the upcoming presidential election.\n\nMusk has always been a political force – he's just being more open about it.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Sara Pequeño on X, formerly Twitter, @sara__pequeno and Facebook facebook.com/PequenoWrites", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/tech/twitter-elon-musk-acquisition-lawsuit/index.html", "title": "Twitter sues Elon Musk to force him to complete acquisition | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTwitter has sued billionaire Elon Musk in an effort to force him to follow through with his deal to buy the social media company.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on Tuesday, comes after Musk said in a letter to Twitter’s top lawyer late Friday that he wants to terminate the blockbuster $44 billion acquisition agreement.\n\nMusk’s lawyer alleged in Friday’s letter that Twitter (TWTR) is “in material breach of multiple provisions” of the deal, claiming the company has withheld data Musk requested in order to evaluate the number of bots and spam accounts on the platform. Twitter (TWTR)’s legal team hit back in a letter on Monday, calling Musk’s attempted termination “invalid and wrongful,” claiming that Musk himself had violated the agreement and demanding that he follow through with the deal.\n\nIn the complaint filed Tuesday, Twitter’s lawyers say they are seeking to prevent Musk from further breaches of the agreement, and to “compel consummation of the merger upon satisfaction of the few outstanding conditions.”\n\n“In April 2022, Elon Musk entered into a binding merger agreement with Twitter, promising to use his best efforts to get the deal done,” the complaint states. “Now, less than three months later, Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests.”\n\nShortly after news of the suit was filed, Musk tweeted,”Oh the irony lol.” Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n\nThe deal is now likely headed for a lengthy court battle to determine whether Twitter can force Musk to close the deal and become its owner, or at least get him to pay the $1 billion set out as a breakup fee in the original agreement.\n\nAfter initially saying he wanted to buy Twitter to eradicate bots, Musk has in recent weeks expressed concerns (without any apparent evidence) that there are more bots on the platform than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nSome analysts, however, have suggested that Musk simply wants an excuse to get out of a deal that now seems overpriced following the downturn in Twitter shares and the overall tech market. Tesla (TSLA) shares, which Musk is relying on in part to finance the deal, have also declined sharply since he agreed to the acquisition deal.\n\nTwitter said in its Tuesday complaint that, “having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.”\n\nIt later adds that Musk’s attempts to exit the deal and his “disparagement of Twitter and its personnel … expose Twitter to adverse effects on its business operations, employees and stock price.”\n\nIndeed, Twitter’s stock, which regained around 4% on Tuesday after falling sharply on Monday, is trading 34% below its price the day Twitter and Musk struck the deal, and 37% below Musk’s offer price, suggesting deep skepticism about the deal getting done, at least at its original price. The sale price in the agreement, $54.20 per outstanding share, represented a 38% premium over the stock price the day before Musk revealed his stake in the company.\n\nVery little about the process of Musk and Twitter pursuing a deal has been typical by the standards of corporate mergers and acquisitions, and Tuesday’s complaint seeking to enforce the agreement — which is filled with references to tweets, memes and one nod to the poop emoji — highlights just how bizarre it has been.\n\nThe document references, for example, Musk’s tweets in the days leading up to the agreement, in which he appeared to hint at launching a hostile takeover through a tender offer by tweeting “Love Me Tender” and a blank followed by “is the Night.” It also pointed to a Monday tweet by Musk that included images of Musk laughing and suggesting that if Twitter sued him to enforce the deal, it would have to reveal the data on bots he’d been asking for in court.\n\n“For Musk, it would seem, Twitter, the interests of its stockholders, the transaction Musk agreed to, and the court process to enforce it all constitute an elaborate joke,” the complaint states.\n\nIn the filing, Twitter took issue with several of the ways in which Musk has accused the company of violating the acquisition agreement, including the claim in his Friday letter that Twitter breached the deal by letting go of two senior executives last month. Twitter claims Musk wanted the merger agreement to state the company could not hire or fire employees at or above the level of vice president, or “above a presumptive violation of the ordinary course covenant,” without Musk’s consent. “Twitter successfully struck that provision before signing,” the complaint states.\n\nIn conjunction with the complaint, Twitter filed a motion to expedite proceedings in the case, requesting a four-day trial on the dispute to be completed in September.\n\n“Expedition is essential to permit Twitter to secure the benefit of its bargain, to address Musk’s continuing breaches, and to protect Twitter and its stockholders from the continuing market risk and operational harm resulting from Musk’s attempt to bully his way out of an airtight merger agreement,” the filing states.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2024/02/01/never-incorporate-in-delaware-elon-musks-tesla-chancery-court-history/72425132007/", "title": "'Never incorporate in Delaware.'

Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe deal’s closing removes a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Twitter’s business, employees and shareholders for much of the year. After initially agreeing to buy the company in April, Musk spent months attempting to get out of the deal, first citing concerns about the number of bots on the platform and later allegations raised by a company whistleblower.\n\nMusk appeared to acknowledge the takeover in a tweet Thursday night saying, “the bird is freed.”\n\nBy completing the deal, Musk and Twitter have avoided a trial that was originally set to take place earlier this month. But Musk’s takeover, and the immediate firings of some of its top executives, now raises a host of new questions for the future of the social media platform, and the many corners of society impacted by it.\n\nIn addition to Agrawal, Musk on Thursday fired CFO Ned Segal and policy head Vijaya Gadde, according to the two sources. Musk also fired Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, according to a source.\n\nLeft to right, clockwise: Twitter former executives Vijaya Gadde, Parag Agrawal, Ned Segal, Sean Edgett. Andrew Harnik/AP/Kevin Dietsch/Patrick T. Fallon/Martina Albertazzi/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMusk has said he plans to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies in service of a more maximalist approach to “free speech.” The billionaire has also said he disagrees with Twitter’s practice of permanent bans for those who repeatedly violate its rules, raising the possibility that a number of previously banned, controversial users could reemerge on the platform.\n\nPerhaps most immediately, many will be watching to see how soon Musk could let former President Donald Trump back on the platform, as he has previously said he would do. Depending on the timing, such a move could have major implications for the upcoming US midterm elections, as well as the 2024 Presidential campaign.\n\nIn taking those steps, Musk could singlehandedly upend the media and political ecosystem, reshape public discourse online and disrupt the nascent sphere of conservative-leaning social media properties that emerged largely in response to grievances about bans and restrictions on Twitter and other mainstream services.\n\nEarlier this week, Musk visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters to meet with employees. He also posted an open letter to Twitter advertisers, saying he doesn’t want the platform to become a “free-for-all-hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences.”\n\nThe acquisition also promises to extend Musk’s influence. The billionaire already owns, oversees or has significant stakes in companies developing cars, rockets, robots and satellite internet, as well as more experimental ventures such as brain implants. Now he controls a social media platform that shapes how hundreds of millions of people communicate and get their news.\n\nA deal that went off the rails\n\nEven for Twitter, a company known for a certain amount of chaos over its history, the months-long deal process with Musk was turbulent.\n\nMusk, a prominent and controversial Twitter user, became involved with the company earlier this year when he built up a more than 9% stake in its shares. After announcing he had become Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk accepted and then pulled out of an offer to sit on the company’s board.\n\nMusk then offered to buy Twitter outright at a significant premium, threatened a hostile takeover and signed a “seller-friendly” deal to buy the company that involved waiving due diligence.\n\n“This is not a way to make money,” Musk said in an on-stage interview shortly after making an offer to buy Twitter. “My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization.”\n\nMusk also pledged to “defeat the spam bots or die trying,” referring to the fake and scam accounts that are often especially active in the replies to his tweets and those of others with large followings on the platform.\n\nWithin weeks of the acquisition agreement, however, Musk began raising concerns about the prevalence of those same fake and spam accounts on Twitter and ultimately attempted to terminate the deal.\n\nMusk visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters earlier this week before the acquisition closed to meet with employees. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nTwitter sued him to follow through with the agreement, alleging that Musk was using the bot argument as a pretense to get out of a deal for which he had developed buyer’s remorse. In the weeks after the deal was announced, much of the stock market, including social media companies, declined amid concerns about rising inflation and a looming recession. The downturn also hit Tesla and, in turn, Musk’s personal net worth.\n\nLegal experts widely believed that Twitter was on strong footing to have the deal enforced in court. Two weeks before the contentious legal battle was set to go to trial, Musk said he would follow through with the deal on its original terms after all. As the parties negotiated, Musk’s attorneys asked a judge to stay the legal proceedings, prompting pushback from Twitter, which feared that Musk might not stay true to his promise to close the deal.\n\nIn a sharp response, Twitter’s lawyers wrote that Musk had been attempting to exit the deal and “now, on the eve of trial, Defendants declare they intend to close after all. ‘Trust us,’ they say, ‘we mean it this time.’”\n\nDelaware Chancery Court chancellor Kathaleen St. Judge McCormick gave the parties until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close the deal or face a rescheduled trial.\n\nWhat’s next for Twitter\n\nWith the deal drama out of the way, attention now turns to Musk’s plans for Twitter.\n\nBeyond the removal of Twitter’s CEO and other executives, Musk’s takeover could also usher in the return of some measure of influence over the company by founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as CEO in November and left its board in May. While Dorsey has said he will not formally return to Twitter, he has privately discussed the takeover with Musk and offered advice.\n\nMusk has also reportedly told prospective investors in the deal that he planned to get rid of nearly 75% of the company’s staff, in a move that could disrupt every aspect of how Twitter operates. He previously discussed dramatically reducing Twitter’s workforce in personal text messages with friends about the deal, which were revealed in court filings, and didn’t dismiss the potential for layoffs in a call with Twitter employees in June.\n\nAmong the changes Musk could make to Twitter is restoring the account of former President Donald Trump, who was banned from the platform following the January 6 Capitol attack in 2021. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter may not have use for many of its existing staff. Musk has repeatedly made clear he would overhaul Twitter’s content moderation policies and bolster what he calls “free speech,” potentially undoing years of efforts from the company to address misinformation and harassment and to create “healthier” conversations on the platform.\n\nSuch a move could also have ripple effects across the social media landscape. Twitter, although smaller than many of its social media rivals, has sometimes acted as a model for how the industry handles problematic content, including when it was the first to ban then-President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nAnd in recent years, several alternative social networks have launched largely targeting conservatives who claim more mainstream services unduly restrict their speech. These services include Trump’s Truth Social and Parler, which Kanye West recently said he would acquire. While it’s unclear how far Musk could go in fulfilling his free speech dreams, any loosening of existing content moderation policies could effectively make Twitter, which provides a much larger audience, a more enticing service for some of the users who have fled to those smaller, fringe services. (Musk, however, could run into regulatory issues, especially in Europe, depending on how far he takes his efforts to loosen content restrictions.)\n\nApart from content moderation, Musk has also tossed out a wide range of other possible changes for the platform, from enabling end-to-end encryption for Twitter’s direct messaging feature to suggesting recently that Twitter become part of an “everything” app called X, possibly in the style of popular Chinese app WeChat.\n\nDespite his months-long attempt to get out of buying the company and his own recent remarks that he is “obviously overpaying” for it, Musk has tried to sound optimistic about Twitter’s potential.\n\n“The long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,” he said on Tesla’s earnings conference call last week.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan Clare Duffy", "Donie O'Sullivan", "Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-ukraine/index.html", "title": "Exclusive: Musk's SpaceX says it can no longer pay for critical ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nSince they first started arriving in Ukraine last spring, the Starlink satellite internet terminals made by Elon Musk’s SpaceX have been a vital source of communication for Ukraine’s military, allowing it to fight and stay connected even as cellular phone and internet networks have been destroyed in its war with Russia.\n\nSo far roughly 20,000 Starlink satellite units have been donated to Ukraine, with Musk tweeting on Friday the “operation has cost SpaceX $80 million and will exceed $100 million by the end of the year.”\n\nBut those charitable contributions could be coming to an end, as SpaceX has warned the Pentagon that it may stop funding the service in Ukraine unless the US military kicks in tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nDocuments obtained by CNN show that last month Musk’s SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon saying it can no longer continue to fund the Starlink service as it has. The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine’s government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n“We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” SpaceX’s director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military’s commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, “SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.”\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX’s own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk’s Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: “F*** off.”\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk’s claimed peace plan for Russia’s Ukraine war by saying: “F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.”\n\n“We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN’s reporting and Melnyk’s comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. “That has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,” said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “Starlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.”\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a “catastrophic” loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn’t dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX’s suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk’s allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he “still very much support[s] Ukraine” but fears “massive escalation.”\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn’t want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, “Russia would accept those terms,” according to a person who heard them.\n\n“Ukraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,” the person familiar with the discussions said. “The decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That’s Elon Musk. He hasn’t been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.”\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine’s infrastructure, Musk replied: “You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.”\n\n“The gall to look like heroes”\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it’s hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It’s not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Starlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,” said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “Without that they’d be really operating in the blind in many cases.”\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX’s request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has “the gall to look like heroes” while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid – or partially paid – for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units’ “exceptional utility” and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine’s new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, “The Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine’s armed forces as they repel Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.”\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level – $4,500 a month – to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink’s website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat’s just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n“You could say he’s trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‘I don’t want to be part of this anymore,’” said the person familiar with Ukraine’s requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk’s reputation for being unpredictable, “Feelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,” this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter – including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he’d made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called “The Weekend,” at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they’ve had recent victories.\n\n“This is the time to do it. They don’t want to do it, that’s for sure. But this is the time to do it,” he said, according to a person in the room. “Everyone wants to seek peace when they’re losing but they don’t want to seek peace when they’re winning.

When Forever stamps were introduced in 2007, the price per stamp was 41 cents. The price increase took effect on Jan. 21.\n\nThe stamps were called \"Forever\" stamps so that you knew when you bought them, the stamp would be good for sending mail \"forever.\" So any stamps you have that cost 66 cents or less, can still be used even though prices are now going up.\n\nFor example, a new Love stamp released Jan. 12 was initially sold at the first-class rate of 66 cents. When most postal offices start selling the stamp on Monday, Jan. 22, all Forever stamps, including the new Love stamp, will cost 68 cents.\n\nUSPS price hike:US Postal Service proposes new postage stamp price hikes set to begin in 2024\n\nWhy is the Postal Service raising the price of Forever stamps?\n\nThe price hike is part of a rate increase proposed in October and approved by the Postal Service Board of Governors in November 2023.\n\nThe increases are part of the Postal Services' 10-year Delivering for America plan, enacted in 2021 by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. The plan was \"absolutely necessary to put the Postal Service on the path to service excellence and financial stability,\" he told a U.S. House committee in May 2023.\n\nSome have criticized the plan saying that the rate increases – five in two years – have come as mail volume has declined and the Postal Service continues to lose money.\n\n\"The Postal Service just posted an operating loss of $6.5 billion in 2023 and is projecting a $6.3 billion loss in 2024 – all after receiving a $120 billion windfall from Congress in 2022,\" said Kevin Yoder, executive director of Keep US Posted, a non-profit advocacy group. \"It’s time for Louis DeJoy to abandon the Delivering for America plan’s twice-annual stamp increases. Traditional mail is still the biggest money-maker for USPS, and each rate hike just drives more mail from the system.”\n\nMore than a dozen members of Congress, led by Missouri Reps.

In August, Royal Mail introduced new barcoded stamps to \"improve security and efficiency\", said the Evening Standard . It means stamps with the late Queen's profile and without a barcode \"are now invalid\".\n\nWhy are stamp prices rising?\n\nThe main reason cited for the rise is the cost of Royal Mail maintaining its \"universal service obligation\" (USO).\n\nThe USO requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week across the country \"at affordable prices that are uniform throughout the UK\", explained the regulator, Ofcom.\n\nRoyal Mail argues that the USO is \"unsustainable\", said BBC News , \"as the number of letters being sent is falling while the number of households is growing\".\n\nWhy are barcodes being added to stamps?\n\nRoyal Mail has been moving to a new system of barcodes, which old stamps do not feature.\n\nThe last day standard non-barcoded stamps could be used to post items in the UK was 31 July.\n\nThe company says the new unique barcodes will \"help make operations smoother\" and enable the introduction of \"added security features\", said ITV News .\n\nCustomers will also be allowed to watch and share videos by scanning the barcoded stamps in the Royal Mail app.\n\nNon-barcoded stamps were originally due to expire at the end of January, \"but the scheme was extended by six months after people said they needed more time\", reported Sky News .\n\nCommemorative and non-barcoded Christmas stamps are still valid, said Royal Mail .\n\nAt the same time, Royal Mail has sought to change all the stamps in circulation following the death of the Queen , with a profile image of the new monarch, King Charles III, being used.\n\nHowever, the \"change will come as a shock to the many stamp-hoarders out there\", said Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com .\n\nHow do I trade in my non-barcoded stamps?\n\nPeople can swap their old stamps for barcoded ones through Royal Mail’s \"Stamp Swap Out\" scheme , where there is no deadline for exchange.\n\nThose stamps eligible for swapping are regular first- and second-class \"everyday\" stamps, featuring the profile of the late Queen.\n\nYou can send back up to £200 worth of unused, non-barcoded stamps to be swapped using Freepost, but if you intend to swap stamps worth more than £200, you are advised to return them to Royal Mail using a secure postage service.\n\nAlthough there is no deadline for the swap, it is worth doing it \"sooner rather than later\", added MoneySavingExpert, in case the scheme closes.\n\nWhat will happen if I try to use old stamps after the deadline?\n\nOld stamps will be treated as having \"insufficient postage\", much the same as if you forgot to put a stamp on the item. The recipient will have to pay an extra fee or the item will be returned to the sender.\n\nWhen did stamps start featuring King Charles?\n\nIt took around six months from the death of the Queen last year for the first stamps featuring King Charles to begin entering circulation.

That comes primarily from ending the requirement of the USPS paying into a health benefit fund for current and retired employees for 75 years into the future. Retired postal employees now are required to enroll in Medicare.\n\nGood Samaritans:Video shows strangers saving Florida woman who had a medical episode while driving\n\nCold case:She told police 26 years ago a Black man killed her boyfriend.

The USPS still expects to lose $110 billion over the next 10 years, DeJoy said while speaking to a Postal Service board of governors meeting.\n\nAdditional price increases are needed, DeJoy said, \"until such time as we have accomplished our objective of projecting a trajectory that shows us becoming self-sustaining – as required by law.\"\n\nUSPS mail prices expected to increase\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service has proposed the following price increases to take effect July 10.\n\nProduct Current Prices Planned Prices\n\nLetters (1 oz.) 58 cents 60 cents\n\nLetters (metered 1 oz.) 53 cents 57 cents\n\nLetters additional ounce(s) 20 cents 24 cents\n\nDomestic Postcards 40 cents 44 cents\n\nInternational Letter (1 oz.) $1.30 $1.40\n\nThe Postal Regulatory Commission is reviewing this price hike and is expected to approve it, said Stephen Kearney, executive director of the Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers, which estimates nonprofits account for about 10% of all USPS mail volume.\n\nThe PRC did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe last price hike for Forever stamps came in August 2021, when the USPS increased the price three cents to 58 cents.\n\nWhat other USPS prices have risen?\n\nEarlier this year, USPS raised rates on Priority Mail and Priority Mail Express by 2.7% (rates starting at $7.37, up from $7.16) and 4.3% (starting at $23.50, previously $22.75).\n\nWill there be more USPS price hikes?\n\nPostmaster General DeJoy has said they are needed.\n\nThe Postal Service will likely seek another price increase of 3% to 5% in January, but Kearney's organization opposes the current and future ones.\n\nThe Alliance of Nonprofit Mailers, along with the Association for Postal Commerce, petitioned the Postal Regulatory Commission last month to reconsider the USPS' rate increase leeway. \"They do not need these excessive rate hikes now,\" Kearney said.\n\nDoes the USPS need this price hike?\n\nMembers of Congress differ. Before approving the rate increase, the Postal Regulatory Commission should consider how the passage of the postal reform legislation has changed the financial situation of the USPS, said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who chairs the House Oversight Committee..\n\nA member of that committee, Rep. Gerry Connolly , D-Va., agrees. “Postmaster General DeJoy’s plan to raise prices while degrading service is a recipe for disaster,\" he said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"We just passed Postal Reform to restore financial stability to the Postal Service. We can’t undo that progress by making prices uncompetitive.”\n\nConnolly references concerns about the change in standards for first-class mail delivery times that went into effect in Oct. 1, 2021. Now USPS has a four- or five-day standard for mail traveling 931 miles or more. In the past, the agency had a standard of delivering all first-class mail in three days.\n\nBut most first-class mail (61%) and periodicals (93%) will be unaffected by these changes, while single-piece first-class mail within a local area will still arrive in two days, USPS says. Overall, 70% of the first-class mail volume should arrive in between 1-3 days.\n\n\"The Postal Service will increase time-in-transit standards by 1 or 2 days for certain mail that are traveling longer distances,\" said USPS spokesman David Coleman. \"By doing so, the Postal Service can entrust its ground network to deliver more (first-class mail), which will lead to greater consistency, reliability, and efficiency that benefits its customers.\"\n\nThe concern is that \"when mail service slows, people use the mail less,\" said Porter McConnell, co-founder of the Save the Post Office Coalition.\n\nDeclining volumes – and competitive pricing – are factored into the agency's 10-year strategic plan, announced in March 2021 by DeJoy. The USPS' rate increase takes into account inflation, too, said Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the ranking Republican on the committee.\n\n“The Postal Service must operate like a business to be financially sustainable,\" he told USA TODAY. \"A key component of the recently passed postal reform bill was to allow the Postal Service – not Congress – to make business decisions.”\n\nInstead of raising rates, the Postal Service should take advantage of abilities allowed within the reform act to partner with local and state agencies to provide services such as hunting and fishing licenses, providing broadband service – or even a Wi-Fi signal in the parking lot – electric vehicle charging and grocery delivery, McConnell said. \"Other government agencies often partner with the private sector to expand their presence, but nobody has more reach than USPS,\" she said.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The agency has gotten some backlash for its plan to replace its fleet of delivery trucks. The Environmental Protection Agency and Democratic lawmakers have argued the plan involves the purchase of too many gas-powered vehicles and too few electric ones.\n\nThe Postal Service has said it will make 20% of its new vehicles battery-powered in the initial $2.98 billion order for 50,000 vehicles. It plans to buy as many as 165,000 new trucks.\n\nBut earlier this week, Oversight chairwoman Maloney sent a letter to DeJoy seeking documents about the environmental analysis the USPS used in its decision. \"I am concerned that the Postal Service relied on flawed assumptions to justify the purchase of gas-powered trucks while underestimating the cost savings and environmental benefits from electric vehicles,” Maloney wrote.\n\nThis follows Government Accountability Office testimony during an April House hearing that a Postal Service analysis used to justify its purchasing plan was faulty, by overstating EV maintenance costs and understating gas prices. Meanwhile, 16 states including California and New York have sued to require the Postal Service to complete a more thorough environmental review before making the purchases.\n\nRegardless of these issues, DeJoy has done a good job setting up the Postal Service for success in the long-term, said Gaston Curk, of OSM Worldwide. The shipping company, headquartered near Chicago, partners with USPS for last-mile delivery.\n\n\"The viability of the post office is strong,\" he said. \"It's just going to take some years to really get it back in the shape that we need it to be in.\"\n\nBut there may be some short-term pain for USPS customers. \"Inflation and oil prices really have a huge effect (on the Postal Service),\" Curk said. \"Until that gets stabilized I think we are going to see some pretty unfortunate, but healthy increases in postage costs.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/12/21/forever-stamps-cost-increase-jan-21-usps-plan/71975253007/", "title": "USPS mail price increases: Forever stamps to cost 2 cents more Jan ...", "text": "You don't have forever to get Forever stamps at their current 66-cent price.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service, on Jan. 21, will raise the cost of Forever stamps from 66 cents to 68 cents.

You enter your personal information and credit card details.\n\n\"Later, you see the charge to your credit card was made by someone’s PayPal account − not USPS,\" the BBB warned.\n\nWhen you try to contact the customer service department, you might get an email back from a scammer who continues to impersonate someone from the post office.\n\nOne consumer told the BBB: “I called my bank and then emailed the helpline listed on the page about canceling my order. I received an email from uspsfaststamps@hotmail.com stating that I was being refunded. However, that pending refund transaction later disappeared from my credit card account.”\n\n$80 million scam:Nationwide 'pig butchering' scam bilked crypto victims out of $80 million, feds say\n\nHow can you tell if new stamps are fake?\n\nThe most frequently counterfeit stamp typically has the American flag on it.\n\nBut Andrea Avery, assistant inspector in charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, noted in a YouTube video that counterfeiters are using designs of other stamps, too, adding that one seizure included batches of the more colorful patriotic spiral or starburst stamps. These stamps were initially issued in 2016.\n\nI spotted an offer online for 100 of the spiral Forever USA stamps, stamps with a gold star in the middle of the design, selling for $29.99 − which amounts to roughly 30 cents a stamp at a time when the price of one Forever Stamp is now 66 cents.\n\nA Forever stamp bought years ago, even if you paid far less for it, can be used now to mail a one-ounce letter. That's true no matter how high the price of stamps goes in the future. It's \"Forever.\"\n\nThe first Forever Stamp was issued in April 2007 and it featured an image of the Liberty Bell.\n\nOne consumer reported to the BBB: “I ordered postage stamps online. They do not work and if you look at them closely, they are not legitimate.”\n\nThe postal service issued an alert in July to warn consumers to watch out for bogus stamps, noting that the number of counterfeit stamps being sold from online platforms has escalated. Other warnings about fake stamps were issued back during the 2021 holiday season too.\n\n\"Scammers peddle fake stamps on social media marketplaces, e-commerce sites via third-party vendors, and other websites,\" according to the 2023 alert from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.\n\nOnline promotions might offer fake stamps at 20% to 50% below their face value.\n\nIt's best to buy stamps from the post office or from approved vendors, which can include legitimate \"big box\" or warehouse retailers who can provide an extremely small but legitimate discount on postage stamps through resale agreements with the postal service.\n\nMajor retailers, such as Kroger, CVS and Walgreens, also sell books of stamps, if you're unable to get to a post office.\n\nCostco Wholesale had 100 stamps − five books of 20 stamps each − listed online for $65.75. That's a 25-cent savings total for Forever Stamps that cost 66 cents each. You're saving a quarter. Shipping and handling are included. The stamps are also sold at the stores.\n\nThe tips for avoiding the stamp scam are similar to those offered to avoid other online shopping scams: Check the website's URL for slightly misspelled words or other red flags of a fake site. Be extremely wary of deals you see promoted on social media.\n\nOne final tip that will last forever: Keep in mind that some deals really are way too good to be true.\n\nContact personal finance columnist Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com.

Here's how much more you'll pay ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nMaybe this counts as good news in a time of painful price increases for necessities such as food, fuel and housing: The cost of a US postage stamp just increased by a mere 2 cents.\n\nThat raises the cost of mailing a first-class letter by 3.4%, to 60 cents — unless you still have a bunch of “forever stamps” that you bought at a lower price. A price hike that modest seems almost quaint given that overall consumer prices are up 9.1% year over year, the fastest pace in 40 years.\n\nFirst-Class mail prices are up about 6.5% overall following the latest hikes. Metered mail went up 4 cents, or 7.5%; sending a postcard (remember those?) now costs 44 cents, a 10-cent hike; and overweight First-Class mail will increase 20%, to 24 cents per additional ounce.\n\n“As inflation and increased operating expenses continue, these price adjustments will help with the implementation of the Delivering for America plan,” the USPS said in a statement, referring to its plan to invest $40 billion in upgrading its infrastructure. “With the new prices, the Postal Service will continue to provide the lowest letter-mail postage rates in the industrialized world and offer a great value in shipping.”\n\nBut the 2-cent hike won’t bring in much more money for the USPS for one reason: Americans aren’t sending nearly as much mail as they used to. As a result, First-Class mail in general — and individual letters in particular — are far less important to the Postal Services’ revenue stream now than in years past.\n\nLast year 13.5 billion letters were mailed out. But that comes to only about two pieces of mail per US household per week.\n\nPeople have found other ways to communicate — and to pay their bills — than putting a stamp and an envelope and dropping it in a mailbox. The number of individual letters mailed last year fell 8.4% from the year prior, and is down 45% from where it was just a decade ago, in fiscal year 2011.\n\nThe number of individual First-Class letters doesn’t count most of the other mail jamming your mailbox, such as bank statements and other direct mail from businesses. There were 35.6 billion of those last year, or more than five per household per week.\n\nThen there were another 41 million pieces of what the USPS generously calls “marketing mail,” and most consumers know as junk mail.\n\nEven though senders of that marketing mail pay a much lower rate, the sector brought in $9 billion last year, compared to only $7.4 billion for individual First-Class letters, and $13.5 billion for presorted First-Class mail.\n\nAll in, First-Class mail accounted for only 30% of Postal Service revenue last year, with individual letters tallying less than 10%. As recently as 2011, about half of postal revenue came from First-Class mail, with 17% from individual letters.\n\nParcels and packages are where the Postal Service is really making its money today.

Star\n\nVENTURA, Calif. — Jorjana Jackson does not know the price of stamps or that it fell Sunday for the first time since July 1, 1919, when a stamp cost two pennies.\n\nThe 27-year-old from Ventura is a millennial who sends messages via text, email and Instagram. So when did she last buy a postage stamp?\n\n\"Probably high school,\" she said. \"No, that's a lie ... when we got married three years ago.\"\n\nThe drop — from 49 cents to 47 cents — has energized the riddle about a tree falling in the forest. If a price changes and no one knows it, did it really happen?\n\nPostal Service dropping mail prices for first time in 100 years\n\nThe receipt an automated machine spat out to Rick Chaidez that showed the Ventura bankruptcy lawyer saved 80 cents Monday on two books of stamps. He offered a single question.\n\n\"How?\" he said, noting inflation is so ingrained that companies add a surcharge for the simple act of sending him a bill. \"How could it go down when the price of everything is going up?\"\n\nThe answer is complicated. The Postal Regulatory Commission temporarily increased the price from 46 cents to 49 cents in January 2014 to help the U.S. Postal Service gain back more than $4 billion in losses.\n\nFour new stamps honor famous pickup trucks\n\nSunday's cut comes because the surcharge expired. The postal agency keeps the extra penny from the surcharge for inflation.\n\nThe new prices:\n\nDomestic letters, 1 ounce or less: 47 cents, down from 49 cents\n\n1 ounce or less: 47 cents, down from 49 cents Additional ounces: 21 cents, down from 22 cents\n\n21 cents, down from 22 cents International letters: $1.15, down from $1.20\n\n$1.15, down from $1.20 Postcards: 34 cents, down from 35 cents\n\nPostal officials aren't happy. They say the reduction in first-class postage, which also affects heavier mail, international letters and postcards, means they will lose $2 billion a year.\n\nThey've asked Congress to step in and make the entire surcharge permanent.\n\nSend last-minute Valentine's Day cards with love stamp\n\nThe postal agency is independent and does not use taxpayer money for operations. But federal law blocks it from increasing prices more than the rate of inflation without the OK of the regulatory commission.\n\n\"To properly compete for customers and continue to meet America's evolving mailing and shipping needs, the Postal Service needs the financial capability to invest in the future,\" Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan said.\n\nOn Monday, people came to a Ventura post office to mail everything from bills to a clothes rack for a granddaughter in college. One after another, they shrugged their shoulders when asked what a stamp cost.\n\nThey cited technology, stamps bought in bulk at a grocery store, a spouse who handles postal purchases and Forever stamps.\n\nEarl Gibson, holding a fistful of bills, offered a more philosophical reason.\n\n\"I'm at the point where it is what it is,\" said Gibson, 69, of Ventura, comparing the price of stamps to the price of gas. \"You don't have control. You can't do anything about it. You focus on the things you can control.\"\n\nChris Crice, a retired elementary school teacher from Ventura, was one of the few who knew.\n\n\"Whoo-hoo!\" she said of the 80 cents saved on 40 stamps.\n\nCrice used her credit card Monday but the coins she saves over time will go into a beer stein she uses as a piggy bank. When the glass is full, its contents will be turned into rolls of coins.\n\nThat money with other gifts will into an account for Crice's 4-year-old grandson, Noah.\n\n'Star Trek' 50th anniversary stars on postage stamps in 2016\n\n\"He can get himself a car when he's 18,\" she said.\n\nSome people complained about rolls of stamps bought at the old price. Others worried about the effect of the decrease.\n\n\"The post office is never going to recoup,\" said Patty LaBrado of Camarillo, Calif., who worked for the postal agency for more than 20 years. She cited texting, emails and other generational changes that affect the way people view traditional mail. \"It's kind of sad.\"\n\nPostal leaders want more than more flexibility in setting prices. They're also pushing for relief from a congressional mandate to pre-finance health benefits for retirees.\n\nBut most people Monday were focused on the immediate future.\n\nDaniel Saenz, who works in Camarillo and lives in Burbank, Calif., affixed one stamp after another to a stack of 100 wedding invitations. He's getting married in June; 400 people are invited.\n\nHe saved $2. He has a fair idea of where the money will go.\n\n\"Probably for more stamps,\" he said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.

It turns out that, amid staffing shortages, only two people in all of New York had a key to the station vault where the stamps are stored, and both were MIA since mid-August.\n\n“There was an unexpected retirement and another employee was on leave” at the branch, notes Xavier C. Hernandez, US Postal Service strategic communications officer.\n\nPlus, its “an industry-type safe,” he added. Government policy “requires locksmiths to submit request-for-proposals” before being hired to break in.\n\nSo when one man in a black polo shirt walked into the station Wednesday seeking “Picture, commemorative stamps…” the colorful, collectible kind of wildlife or art images that most people prefer for personal correspondence, the scene was something out of “Seinfeld.”\n\nHe asked, “I can’t buy stamps at the post office?” incredulously. He asked again (while declining CNNs request for an interview by waving frantic jazz hands.)\n\n“Not at this time,” came the answer.\n\n“When will I be able to buy stamps at the post office?” he asked, seeking a recently issued sheet of cartoon “Elephants Forever” stamps issued just last month, or “the tigers.”\n\n“I cannot tell you that at this moment,” the post office worker replied, gesturing tiredly at a handwritten sign noting the facility didn’t have stamps, or money orders.\n\nThe line of about seven people waiting rustled in confusion.\n\n“We’re short-staffed,” a red-haired woman described by other employees as the supervisor said to CNN.\n\nFor several years, the US Postal Service has been in crisis, losing money, longtime revenue sources and staff. It had a notoriously bad relationship with Donald Trump, who famously called it “a joke.”\n\nNow, “hiring is a priority,” explains Wanda Diaz, who is being sworn in as Manhattan’s new postmaster Friday. “We are currently recruiting 28,000 new employees” in New York alone, she said in an email regarding her appointment, which also addressed the missing stamps.\n\nIn 2021, the USPS had 655,000 workers, about 200,000 of whom are nearing retirement, and there’s a huge attrition rate of part-time and seasonal workers to boot. About 40% of people who do one holiday season don’t do another, according to the agency’s own research.\n\nPark West is a microcosm of the challenges facing the USPS. It’s hardly an ideal working situation there. The sanitizer dispenser at the door is empty, the “stand here” feet stickers are curling and strips of the floor are covered in in grey-blue rugs that are neither recognizably cloth or plastic. The air conditioning, on a day when the temperature was in the 70s, barely functioned. (A message to the American Postal Workers Union were not returned.)\n\nThe USPS, which generally receives no taxpayer funding, is responsible for its own revenue. But Americans just aren’t sending nearly as much mail as they used to given the ubiquity of texting, email, FaceTime and Zoom. Last year 13.5 billion letters were mailed, with the number of individual letters mailed last year falling 8.4% from the year prior. That’s down 45% from where it was just a decade ago.\n\nAn employee at the station says customers might be making too much of the lack of stamps.\n\n“You can buy stamps in the vending machine” she said, gesturing toward it. (Yes, you can, we checked, only with a credit or debit card) but these are generic stamps of the American flag. No tulips, no elephants, Star Trek commemorative or holiday themes. “People don’t want those as much,” she said.\n\nIndeed, the US Postal Service does a bustling business in the collectible stamps, offering one or more new series a month that are often bought up by collectors, not letter-mailers. (The USPS says its most popular commemorative stamp ever was the 1993 Elvis Presley.)\n\nThat said, the stamp problems at Park West appear to be an isolated incident. A handful of other city post offices are well-stocked with theme stamps. (Basic stamps just last month went up two cents; it now costs 60 cents to send a first-class letter). We checked.\n\nLast April, President Joe Biden signed a sweeping bill into law that will overhaul the agency’s finances and modernize its fleet of trucks; they’re going electric.\n\nBiden noted at the time that the Postal Service, founded in 1775 with Benjamin Franklin as its first postmaster general before becoming an official part of the government in 1792, “is fundamental to our economy, and the very sense of who we are as a nation.”\n\nAs for the Park West Post Office? On Friday morning, Postmaster Diaz could confirm “the situation has been resolved.” After about two weeks of scarcity, it has sheets of tiger, elephant, hearts, tulips and mariachi band commemorative stamps.

But first, actors will reward themselves with even more trophies at the 30th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nTruth be told, this weekend's show is likely to come loaded with extra sentiment for its card-carrying union members, many of whom hit the picket lines during last year's industry-threatening 118-day standoff with producers. The strike ended with concessions made in compensation, benefits and AI image protections.\n\nThe belle of the SAG ball is EGOT winner (and recent mammoth memoir author) Barbra Streisand, who will receive SAG's lifetime achievement award for her work in front of and behind the camera.\n\nLike the Golden Globes, SAG Awards are doled out to both movie and TV actors − in this case by their peers. Of course, the real reason to tune in is to help you handicap your Oscar picks: SAG wins are often solid predictors of who will take home Academy Award accolades, given the overlap in the two groups' voters.\n\nHere's all you need to know about this year's SAG Awards:\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhere can I watch the 2024 SAG Awards?\n\nAfter airing for a quarter-century on TBS and TNT, the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which take place Saturday, have again found a home at Netflix, where they'll stream at 8 p.m. EST/5 PST.\n\nThe two-hour live show will emanate from the Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall, a historic Los Angeles venue that has also been home to the Oscars in years past. That's a notable step up from last year's show, which took place at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel.\n\nWhere can I watch the SAG Awards red carpet pre-show?\n\n\"Queer Eye\" star Tan France and pioneering fashion editor Elaine Welteroth will host the SAG pre-show with an emphasis on critiquing the various fashion statements (or faux pas) that make their way down the red carpet. The pre-show will stream live on Netflix, YouTube, and TikTok at 7 p.m. EST/4 PST.\n\nFrance and Welteroth will team up to interview nominees, highlighting the best fashion looks of the night and giving viewers a look at the star-studded arrivals. Also, in a rarity, look for stunt performers to get their moment in the sun: During the pre-show, winners for best stunt ensemble performances in movies and TV will be revealed.\n\nAdditionally, People and Entertainment Weekly will stream a red carpet special, hosted by EW editor-in-chief Patrick Gomez, People editor at large Janine Rubenstein and EW editorial director Gerrad Hall. This live pre-show will stream at people.com and EW.com, as well as People's and EW’s YouTube, Facebook, X and TikTok pages, beginning at 6 p.m. EST/3 PST.\n\nFinally, \"E! Live From the Red Carpet\" will air on E! starting at 6 p.m. EST/3 PST, co-hosted by Laverne Cox, Loni Love and Keltie Knight.\n\nWho is hosting the SAG Awards in 2024?\n\nNo host has been announced for the awards, which have been host-free since 2021.\n\nWho is presenting at the 2024 SAG Awards?\n\nIdris Elbawill open the ceremony, while Jennifer Aniston will do the honors presenting the life achievement award to Barbra Streisand.\n\nFans of \"The Devil Wears Prada\" won't want to miss the reunion of three of its stars: Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt have been tapped to present together.\n\nAdditional presenters announced so far include SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher, Erika Alexander (\"American Fiction\"), Emily Blunt (\"Oppenheimer\"), Danielle Brooks (\"The Color Purple\"), Sterling K. Brown (\"American Fiction\"), Michael Cera (\"Barbie\"), Jessica Chastain(\"Mothers’ Instinct\"), Colman Domingo (\"Rustin,\" \"The Color Purple\"), Robert Downey Jr. (\"Oppenheimer\") and Phil Dunster (\"Ted Lasso\").\n\nOther stars slated to present are Billie Eilish(\"Swarm\"), America Ferrera (\"Barbie\"), Brendan Fraser (\"Killers of the Flower Moon\"), Taraji P. Henson (\"The Color Purple\"), Troy Kotsur (\"CODA\"), Greta Lee(\"The Morning Show\"), Melissa McCarthy (\"Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story\"), Cillian Murphy (\"Oppenheimer\"), Glen Powell(\"Hit Man\"), Issa Rae (\"American Fiction,\" \"Barbie\"), Storm Reid (\"The Last of Us\"), Margot Robbie (\"Barbie\"), Tracee Ellis Ross (\"American Fiction\"), Alexander Skarsgård (\"Succession\"), Omar Sy (\"Lupin\"), Hannah Waddingham (\"Ted Lasso\"), Naomi Watts (\"Feud: Capote vs. The Swans\") and Jeffrey Wright (\"American Fiction\").\n\nWhat award is Barbra Streisand getting at the 2024 SAG Awards?\n\nFew stars are really legends in their own time, but no one can deny Barbra Streisand is just that. Her industry friends are awarding her SAG's lifetime achievement award for both her career and humanitarian laurels. \"She is a colossal icon with a relentless work ethic, evolving with each stage of her remarkable journey,\" said Fran Drescher.\n\nStreisand has worked in nearly every conceivable medium, from stage to screen (large and small), in the studio and behind the camera. Among her honors are two Academy Awards, eight Grammys (plus the Grammy Legend and lifetime achievement awards), five Emmy Awards and a Tony Award.\n\nWant to know more about her? Last year's big book release, \"My Name Is Barbra,\" is 970 pages of Streisand telling you her life story. Consider the audiobook; it's read by Streisand herself.\n\nWho are the 2024 SAG Award nominees?\n\nThis year's SAG nominees are largely familiar names and faces, if you've paid attention to recent award shows such as the Golden Globes, where \"Oppenheimer\" outpaced \"Barbie.\"\n\nSAG nominees for outstanding ensemble cast include Oscar best picture nominees \"American Fiction,\" \"Barbie,\" \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" and \"Oppenheimer,\" plus \"The Color Purple.\" Best male performance will see if Cillian Murphy (\"Oppenheimer\") or Paul Giamatti (\"The Holdovers\") can steal the statue, with Bradley Cooper (\"Maestro\"), Colman Domingo (\"Rustin\") and Jeffrey Wright (\"American Fiction\") rounding out the pack.\n\nAmong the women, Oscar nominee Annette Bening (\"Nyad\") is up against Barbie herself, Margot Robbie, as well as Emma Stone (\"Poor Things\"), Carey Mulligan (\"Maestro\") and Golden Globe winner Lily Gladstone (\"Killers of the Fower Moon\").\n\nIn best supporting actor, look for Globe winner Robert Downey Jr. (\"Oppenheimer\") to duke it out with Robert De Niro (\"Killers of the Flower Moon\"), Sterling K. Brown (\"American Fiction\"), Willem Dafoe (\"Poor Things\") and Ryan Gosling (\"Barbie\"). Among the women, Globe winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph (\"The Holdovers\") is the front-runner in a field that includes Emily Blunt (\"Oppenheimer\"), Danielle Brooks (\"The Color Purple\"), Penélope Cruz (“Ferrari”) and Jodie Foster (\"Nyad\").\n\nWho has won the most SAG Awards?\n\nIf you're curious which actors have been rewarded the most by their peers, we've got you covered. According to the Screen Actors Guild, Julia Louis-Dreyfus leads that illustrious list. She has won nine best actor awards, including five individual awards and four ensemble awards for her work on both \"Veep\" and \"Seinfeld.\"\n\nWho's been nominated the most? That would be Edie Falco, with 22 total nods for individual and ensemble work largely for \"The Sopranos\" and also \"Nurse Jackie.\" She's won five times, all for \"The Sopranos.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2024/01/08/when-are-oscars-2024/72149972007/", "title": "Oscars 2024: Who is nominated and how to watch the show", "text": "With this year's Oscar nominations finally out, it's time to gear up for the biggest night in movies: the 2024 Academy Awards.\n\nThis year marks 96 years of celebrating the Oscars, and the categories for 2024 will likely be heavily stacked once the nominations are announced.\n\nWill Cillian Murphy sweep another best actor award from Bradley Cooper?

We are extremely proud to name Cameron Heyward as our 2023 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year.\"\n\nNFL MVP: Baltimore Ravens QB Lamar Jackson\n\nLamar Jackson did it again – and it was almost unanimous for a historic second time.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens quarterback was voted as the Associated Press NFL MVP, earning 49 of 50 first-place votes. One vote went to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen.\n\nJackson, 27, previously won the award in a unanimous decision – just the second in NFL history – in 2019.\n\nAfter a contentious standoff between Jackson and the Ravens engulfed much of the early portion of the offseason, the two sides agreed to a five-year, $260 million contract extension. Under first-year offensive coordinator Todd Monken, Jackson helped pilot the Ravens to an NFL-best 13-4 record in the regular season. Baltimore would ultimately fall to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC championship game.\n\nNFL Comeback Player of the Year: Cleveland Browns QB Joe Flacco\n\nJoe Flacco was talking with a small group of Cleveland-area writers the final Friday of the Browns' regular season when he was asked if he was having as much fun as at any point in the quarterback's 16-year NFL career.\n\nThe question led the former Super Bowl 47 Most Valuable Player back to where his season actually started, which was at his suburban Philadelphia home.\n\n\"Everybody always asks just about being at home,\" Flacco said at the time. \"And I think, just the last few years in general, just being a backup and feeling like I could play and then sitting at home and still feeling like I could play, it does give you a new perspective on things and how fortunate you are to do this. So when you're out there, I think it's impossible for that not to come through in certain ways. It's impossible to hold that, not that I'm out there actively thinking about that, but I think it's just impossible to not let that come out in some way.\"\n\nFor Flacco, it came out over an unforgettable final five-week stretch of the regular season that propelled the Browns into the playoffs. The recognition for that came Thursday night, when the 39-year-old quarterback was honored as the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nFlacco, who went 4-1 with 1,616 passing yards and 13 touchdowns in the regular season for the Browns, edged out the Buffalo Bills' Damar Hamlin. Hamlin, who went into cardiac arrest on the field during a 2022 game in Cincinnati, was inactive for 12 of Buffalo's 17 regular-season games. - Chris Easterling, Akron Beacon Journal\n\nNFL Offensive Player of the Year: San Francisco 49ers RB Christian McCaffrey\n\nAs he waits for Super Bowl 58 and the opportunity to hoist the Lombardi Trophy, Christian McCaffrey received some other hardware for his regular-season accomplishments.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers running back was voted the Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year on Thursday.\n\nPlaying in his first full season for Kyle Shanahan and Co. after being acquired in a trade-deadline deal in 2022, McCaffrey proved to be a lethal addition to an already prolific offense. His league-best totals for rushing yards (1,459) and yards from scrimmage (2,023) far outpaced the figures of all other players at his position, while he tied the Miami Dolphins' Raheem Mostert for the most total touchdowns (21).\n\nMcCaffrey beat out Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who led the NFL in receiving yards (1,799) but fell short of his stated goal of eclipsing the single-season record with 2,000.\n\nNFL Coach of the Year: Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski\n\nAfter an offseason of heavy speculation regarding his job status, Kevin Stefanski once again is being honored for outpacing expectations.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns coach won the Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year award on Thursday, taking home the honor for the second time in his career.\n\nStefanski finished with the same number of total points as first-year Houston Texans coach DeMeco Ryans but won out thanks to a 21-20 edge in first-place votes.\n\nStefanski faced heightened scrutiny coming off a 7-10 season in 2022 in which quarterback Deshaun Watson, whom the team landed in a blockbuster trade the previous offseason, struggled to acclimate after serving an 11-game suspension. Despite losing star running back Nick Chubb to a season-ending knee injury in Week 2 and Watson also being knocked out around midseason with a shoulder injury, the Browns managed to secure just their second playoff berth in two decades with an 11-6 record.\n\nStefanski also claimed the award in 2020, his first season as Cleveland's coach.\n\nNFL Defensive Rookie of the Year: Houston Texans defensive end Will Anderson Jr.\n\nCall it a clean sweep for the Houston Texans.\n\nAfter Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud took home Offensive Rookie of the Year honors on Thursday, defensive end Will Anderson Jr. was named Defensive Rookie of the Year later in the night.\n\nThe Alabama product, taken one pick after Stroud at No. 3 overall, recorded seven sacks in helping the Texans surge to an AFC South title under first-year coach DeMeco Ryans.\n\nAnderson earned 16 first-place votes, narrowly beating out Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter and Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Kobie Turner, who each had 14.\n\nNFL Defensive Player of the Year: Cleveland Browns DE Myles Garrett\n\nMyles Garrett is accustomed to beating his opponents to a spot. On Thursday, he once again found a way to finish first.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns defensive end emerged from a crowded field to win NFL Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nGarrett was the cornerstone of the NFL's stingiest defense, allowing a league-low 270.2 yards per game. The three-time All-Pro recorded 14 sacks, which was tied for seventh among all players.\n\nWinning the award for the first time in his career, Garrett edged out Pittsburgh Steelers outside linebacker and 2021 Defensive Player of the Year T.J. Watt, who led the league with 19 sacks. Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons, Cowboys cornerback DaRon Bland and Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby were the other finalists.\n\nGarrett had 23 first-place votes, while Watt finished with 19.\n\nPrior to the announcement, Parsons backed Garrett in response to a comparison among a trio of the finalists.\n\nNFL Offensive Rookie of the Year: Houston Texans QB C.J. Stroud\n\nIn the 2023 NFL draft, C.J. Stroud took a backseat to No. 1 overall pick Bryce Young. In his rookie season, however, Stroud stood above all his peers.\n\nThe Houston Texans quarterback capped his historic debut campaign by being voted the Associated Press NFL's Offensive Rookie of the Year on Thursday, beating out Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua, among others.\n\nAfter being selected with the No. 2 pick out of Ohio State, Stroud took little time to find his footing in the NFL. By October, he broke Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott's record for most passes without an interception to start a career, finishing with 191. In a Nov. 5 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Stroud set the single-game mark for passing yards by a rookie with 470, shattering the previous high (433) set by Andrew Luck in 2012.\n\nStroud served as the catalyst in the Texans' turnaround from a 3-13-1 campaign in 2022 to AFC South division champions. His 4,108 passing yards stands as the third-best total in history for any first-year passer. Stroud also tied a rookie record for touchdown passes in a playoff game (three) in the team's 45-14 wild-card victory over the Cleveland Browns, which also made him the youngest quarterback in league history to win a playoff game.\n\nStroud won by an overwhelming 48-2 vote, with Nacua claiming the only other two first-place marks.\n\nNacua, a fifth-round pick out of BYU, broke the longstanding NFL single-season record for receiving yards by a rookie (1,486) while also setting a new mark for catches (105).\n\nNFL Assistant Coach of the Year: Cleveland Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz\n\nThe offseason acquisition who set the Browns on the path back to the playoffs didn't score a single touchdown or make a single tackle. All he did was make sure their opponents didn't do the former, while running a defense that made a lot of the latter.\n\nJim Schwartz was hired as Browns defensive coordinator two weeks after the 2022 season ended to fix their defense. The veteran coach did that — at times at a historic rate — as Cleveland produced the best statistical defense in the league.\n\nFor that, Schwartz was recognized Thursday night as the NFL's Assistant Coach of the Year. The award, presented by the Associated Press, was announced during the NFL Honors program in Las Vegas.\n\n\"Just the Schwartz impact on our organization and our team,\" general manager Andrew Berry said in a statement. \"And not just what Jim and the defensive staff were able to do with a dominant and historic defense, but in the building his impact spans far beyond just getting the guys ready to play on the field. He's an incredible organizational partner, an incredible human being, cares about our players, cares about our staff. We are very, very fortunate to have him as a part of our team.”\n\nThe Browns essentially went wire-to-wire in the regular season as the league's No. 1 defense in total yards (270.2), third-down efficiency (29.1%) and passing yards (164.7). Those were significant improvements over the previous year, when they ranked 14th in total yards (331.5), 19th in third-down efficiency (39.1%) and fifth in passing yards (196.2). - Chris Easterling, Akron Beacon Journal", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2024/07/11/2024-espys-live-updates-award-winners-highlights/74360341007/", "title": "2024 ESPYs: Winners, top moments from ESPN award show", "text": "LOS ANGELES — It's time to celebrate and honor all the remarkable moments and people in sports from this past year with the 2024 ESPY Awards.\n\nHosted by tennis legend Serena Williams at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, the show will award athletes and teams across the world, with some fun sprinkled in between.

Williams did make sure to mention she beat her 20 times.\n\nArthur Ashe Award for Courage: Steve Gleason\n\nKnown for his iconic blocked punt in the New Orleans Saints’ first home game back in the Superdome after Hurricane Katrina, Steve Gleason was presented the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage by former teammate Drew Brees. In 2011, Gleason was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but he has continued to battle the disease and be an advocate for those dealing with ALS.\n\nGleason cried before he spoke and he even had some jokes for the audience. He talked about how he was only given three years to live when he was diagnosed but he didn't let him live his life as much as he could.\n\nAthletes who died honored\n\nThe ESPY Award show recognized the athletes who have died in the past year, including Willie Mays, Bill Walton and Jerry West.\n\nIcon award: Nick Saban\n\nThe legendary college football coach was given the ESPY icon award for all his achievements during his Alabama coaching tenure. Saban won six national championships at Alabama, and with the one title he won at LSU, he has the most for any coach in NCAA Division I history. He finishes his tenure in Tuscaloosa with a 201-29 record with nine SEC championships and eight College Football Playoff appearances, and he coached four Heisman Trophy winners, two of which − Mark Ingram II and Bryce Young − were on hand to present him the award.\n\nSaban reflected on his coaching career during his speech and said what he is most proud of is his program built the foundation where former players can help out their communities, and he reminded all the athletes in attendance they have to remember sports bring people together.\n\nFlau'jae Johnson performs\n\nRapper and LSU women's basketball player Flau'jae Johnson took the stage to drop some bars.\n\nSerena Williams takes dig at Harrison Butker\n\nThe Williams sisters and Quinta Brunson talked about the growth of women's sports, but there's one person they don't want to bask in it: Kansas Chiefs kicker Harrison Butler.\n\n\"So, go ahead and enjoy women's sports like you would any other sports, because they are sports,\" Venus Williams said.\n\n\"Except you, Harrison Butker. We don't need you,\" Serena Williams added.\n\nWilliams sisters show love\n\nJimmy V Award for Perseverance: Dawn Staley\n\nThe South Carolina women's basketball coach, who won her third national title in April, received the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance for her work in advocating for cancer research and bone marrow donors. Staley's sister, Tracey Underwood, received a transplant from their brother in 2020 after being diagnosed with leukemia.\n\nStaley said she's been just a spectator to people dealing with cancer and there are people that dealt with real challenges that have received the award. However, she said she draws inspiration from the people with cancer that continue to fight.\n\nBest athlete women's sports: A'ja Wilson\n\nA'ja Wilson was named best athlete in women's sports, beating Caitlin Clark in the category. Wilson is coming off winning back-to-back WNBA titles with the Las Vegas Aces, and she was named 2023 WNBA Finals MVP. She was recently named one of the cover athletes of NBA 2K25, and she's been off to a solid start of the 2024 season. Wilson is also off to a great start to the 2024 WNBA season, leading the league in points (26.9) and blocks (2.7) per game, while her 11.3 rebounds per game are second in the league behind Angel Reese.\n\nPat Tillman Award for Service: Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, received the Pat Tillman Award for Service for creating The Invictus Games, a sporting event for active duty and veteran servicemembers who have been wounded, injured or sick on the job.\n\nPrince Harry was in attendance with wife Duchess Meghan to accept the award and he was emotional going on the stage. He said it is a great honor to highlight all the athletes that participate in The Invictus Games and reminded people of the struggles military personnel face in and after their service.\n\nBest championship performance: Jaylen Brown\n\nAdd another award for the NBA Finals MVP as the Boston Celtics guard took home the award for best championship performance.

O’Connor said the President tested negative on Tuesday evening, Wednesday morning, Thursday morning and Friday morning before testing positive on Saturday morning.\n\n“However, given his positive antigen test, he will reinitiate strict isolation procedures,” the doctor noted. Biden ceased isolating on Wednesday after testing negative on successive antigen tests, celebrating his return in remarks from the White House Rose Garden.\n\nBiden’s physician said the President is not experiencing any symptoms but that he will isolate at the White House. He canceled plans to travel to his home in Delaware Sunday and to Michigan, where he was expected on Tuesday to tout the recently passed bill aimed at boosting US semiconductor production, the White House said Saturday.\n\n“Folks, today I tested positive for COVID again,” Biden wrote on Twitter. “This happens with a small minority of folks. I’ve got no symptoms but I am going to isolate for the safety of everyone around me. I’m still at work, and will be back on the road soon.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wrote Biden is “asymptomatic, feeling fine, and working in isolation from the Residence to protect others.”\n\nA White House official said contact tracing efforts were underway Saturday after Biden’s positive Covid-19 test.\n\nThe President had resumed events at the White House after testing negative this week, though he was seen wearing a mask more regularly. White House officials said they worked to ensure there was social distancing at the public events he held at the White House.\n\nBiden, 79, first tested positive on July 21. During his first bout with the disease, he experienced mild symptoms, including runny nose, fatigue, high temperature and a cough, according to his doctor. The President completed a five-day course of Paxlovid, which requires a doctor’s prescription and is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness.\n\nWhen Biden first tested positive last week, the White House said he’d had 17 close contacts, none of whom ended up testing positive themselves.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden remains in Delaware, where she has been since the President first tested positive for Covid-19, a White House official told CNN. She has not been back to the White House.\n\nThe first lady had been scheduled to join the President when he traveled to Wilmington on Sunday.\n\nRebound cases\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health alert to doctors on May 24 advising that Covid-19 symptoms sometimes come back, and that may just be how the infection plays out in some people, regardless of whether they’re vaccinated or treated with medications like Paxlovid. The CDC said most cases of rebound involve mild disease and that there have been no reports of serious illness.\n\nBiden is fully vaccinated and received two booster shots. He received his first two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ahead of his inauguration in January 2021, his first booster shot in September and his second booster vaccination in March.\n\nWhite House officials had previously suggested a rebound case of Covid was unlikely, based on reports of cases around the country. However, Biden continued to be tested and monitored.\n\nInfectious disease experts have been calling on the government to study instances of rebound more systematically, saying the phenomenon needs to be better characterized to understand who is most at risk and whether the standard five-day course of treatment with the drug should be lengthened to prevent it. Studies have shown that people can pass the infection to others during a rebound, which is another reason to better understand it.\n\nPfizer, the company that makes Paxlovid, has said its studies show rebounds are rare and happen in people who take the drug as well as those who took a placebo pill. Because investigators noted the phenomenon in both groups, the company doesn’t believe it is tied to the medication.\n\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci also experienced rebound Covid-19. His symptoms got worse when they returned after treatment, and his doctors prescribed another course of Paxlovid.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Donald Judd", "Kevin Liptak", "Donald Judd"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/politics/joe-biden-covid-19/index.html", "title": "Biden tests positive for Covid-19 and is experiencing mild symptoms ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday that he’s tested positive for Covid-19 but will continue to work while in isolation at the White House despite his mild symptoms.\n\nIn a video posted to Twitter, Biden told Americans that he is “doing well” and that his symptoms continue to be mild.\n\n“I guess you heard, this morning I tested positive for Covid. But I’ve been double vaccinated, double boosted. Symptoms are mild and I really appreciate your inquires and concerns. But I’m doing well, getting a lot of work done. Going to continue to get it done and in the meantime, thanks for your concern and keep the faith. It’s gonna be OK,” Biden, who was unmasked while standing outside on the Truman Balcony, said in the 20-second video the White House says was filmed by a masked and socially distanced videographer.\n\nThe mild symptoms and diagnosis protocol for Biden – a double-boosted 79-year-old at high risk for experiencing severe illness – will mean isolating and “working and resting” at the White House residence for the rest of the day, according to a senior administration official. This is the first time Biden has tested positive for Covid-19, and he last tested negative on Tuesday, per White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nBiden has called several people in the hours since his diagnosis. He wrote on Twitter Thursday afternoon that he is “doing great” following the positive test and said he called Pennsylvania politicians to send his regrets about having to cancel a scheduled trip to the commonwealth. The tweet was accompanied by an image of the President smiling at a desk, without a mask, in the residence of the White House.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is seen in this photo shared to Twitter, after he tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, July 21. White House\n\nIn a memo that was sent to staff obtained by CNN, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Biden will be working over the phone and on video conference for the next few days following the positive result.\n\n“I’ve spoken to him several times this morning already about an array of matters, and he is focused on our pending business,” Klain wrote on Thursday.\n\nDay Zero\n\nBiden tested positive for Covid-19 Thursday morning and has begun taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid, which is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. It requires a doctor’s prescription.\n\n“Consistent with (US Center for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines, he will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,” Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\nThursday marks “Day 0” of the President’s Covid-19 timeline – meaning he will be in isolation until at least next Tuesday in accordance to the CDC’s guidelines.\n\nThe President’s symptoms include “rhinorreha (or ‘runny nose’) and fatigue, with an occasional dry cough, which started yesterday evening,” according to a letter from the President’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor. Biden did not have a fever Thursday morning, White House coronavirus coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told CNN.\n\nJha later told reporters that Biden’s oxygen levels were “normal” as of Thursday morning and that Biden’s Covid-19 virus sample has been sent to a lab to identify the specific variant he is infected with. Results are expected in “less than a week.”\n\nBiden first tested positive for Covid-19 on an antigen test Thursday morning as part of routine screening, and the positive result was later was confirmed by a PCR test, his physician said.\n\nO’Connor also noted that the President met the FDA’s criteria for use of the antiviral Paxlovid, adding, “I anticipate that he will respond favorably, as most maximally protected patients do.”\n\nDue to his age, Biden is at an increased risk for a more severe case of Covid-19, although the CDC says older adults being fully vaccinated and boosted significantly reduces their risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nJha said Thursday that Biden has the “full set of protections” to deal with Covid-19 at his advanced age.\n\n“The bottom line is given how much immunity he has from vaccines, given that he was started on treatments right away … I think all of those things very dramatically reduce his risk of serious illness,” Jha told CNN’s Jeff Zeleny during the White House press briefing. “And that’s really the goal here, is to prevent serious illness, to keep that risk as low as possible. I think he’s gotten that full set of protections.”\n\nBiden received his first two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine ahead of his inauguration in January 2021, his first booster shot in September and his second booster vaccination on March 30.\n\nStaff takes measures to adapt, Harris and first lady keep their previous schedules\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden tested negative on Thursday.\n\nJean-Pierre indicated that the West Wing will continue to practice its current protocols but that the White House residential staff will be taking measures to create a “very minimal footprint” to avoid infecting others.\n\nThe number of aides who staff the White House residence will be reduced to the “bare minimum” in light of Biden’s positive Covid-19 diagnosis, an official told CNN.\n\nAnd a mid-level West Wing aide who works in close proximity to Biden and was on his recent trip to the Middle East also tested positive for Covid-19, according to two sources familiar. The person is not considered a close contact of the President and tested positive earlier this week.\n\nHarris is expected to keep her normal schedule while Biden isolates. The senior administration official said there are no plans and no need to transfer executive powers to Harris – as was done last November for 85 minutes, when Biden was under anesthesia for a routine colonoscopy.\n\nHarris has been identified as a close contact of Biden, a White House official told CNN. Harris last saw Biden on Tuesday and tested negative on Thursday. She is a close contact, an additional aide says, because they spent more than 15 minutes together while being briefed on the presidential daily brief. The White House official added that Harris will follow CDC guidelines for those who are vaccinated, including wearing a well-fitting mask while around people for 10 days from the date of the last close contact.\n\nThe first lady and the vice president said they had both spoken to the President on Thursday following the diagnosis.\n\nJill Biden told reporters in Detroit earlier Thursday that she had spoken to the President and that “he’s doing fine. He’s feeling good.”\n\nThe first lady, her spokesman Michael LaRosa told CNN, will keep her original schedule on Thursday, which includes a stop in Georgia before heading to Wilmington, Delaware. She is also double boosted, LaRosa said.\n\nAnd Thursday afternoon, Harris said at an event in North Carolina that the President “is in good spirits.”\n\n“He is working from the White House residence and when he spoke he was very pleased that we are all together today,” she told her audience, adding that Biden told her to “tell everybody hello.”\n\nUpcoming presidential travel canceled\n\nA White House official told CNN that Biden’s scheduled travel to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, later on Thursday for a speech on crime prevention has been canceled. A DNC fundraiser Biden was scheduled to headline Thursday night has been postponed, officials said.\n\nIt’s yet to be determined whether the event will be rescheduled or if donors will be asked to make their pledged contributions.\n\nBiden was also scheduled to travel to Orlando and Tampa, Florida, on Monday, but now he’s expected to be isolating.\n\nBiden has ramped up his engagement with the public over the past year as the White House has shifted its approach toward the pandemic. On Wednesday, Biden traveled to Somerset, Massachusetts, for an event on climate executive actions, where he was seen shaking hands and greeting attendees in the outdoor crowd.\n\nThe President’s positive diagnosis comes less than a week after a swing through the Middle East, where he held meetings with world leaders in Israel and Saudi Arabia. While abroad, Biden was seen shaking hands, bumping fists and embracing other leaders.\n\nThe White House is currently working on contact tracing for those who may have been close contacts of Biden, per an official, since his positive Covid test. They plan to inform any close contacts on Thursday, including members of Congress and the press.\n\nAt least one member of Congress who was a close contact after seeing Biden in Massachusetts received a contact tracing call from the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe White House reached out to the lawmaker’s office Thursday afternoon, according to a source familiar, and advised the member of Congress to follow the CDC recommendations for what an individual should do when they’re determined to be a close contact.\n\nOne of the recommendations, for example, for someone who is fully vaccinated and was a close contact is to wear a well-fitting mask while around other people for 10 days from the date of last close contact.\n\nWhite House prepared for this moment\n\nWhite House officials have been preparing for months for what many viewed as the inevitability that Biden would come down with Covid.\n\nA wave of cases – including among Harris, White House staffers and members of Congress – has swept Washington through the spring and summer. And as more and more of his top officials and members of his family contracted Covid, officials came to believe it was possible the President himself would get sick, even as they took steps to shield him from the virus.\n\nKlain, in his Thursday memo to staff, wrote that White House officials “have said for some time that there was a substantial possibility that the President – like anyone else – could get Covid, and we have prepared for this possibility. We are now executing on our plan so that the President can continue to work seamlessly from the Residence.”\n\nBiden last underwent an annual physical in November at Walter Reed National Medical Center. O’Connor wrote in a memo at the time that the President remained “fit for duty, and fully executes all of his responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations.”\n\nOfficials had a loose plan in place for the day Biden tested positive, including informing the public when the tests were confirmed and releasing a letter from Biden’s physician – which both took place on Thursday.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump issued a 1 a.m. ET tweet on October, 2, 2020, announcing that both he and then-first lady Melania Trump had tested positive for Covid-19. And Biden officials have been mindful of how the previous administration handled Trump’s diagnosis and have been intent on being more forthcoming about Biden’s condition.\n\nNow, more than two years into the pandemic, Biden has become the second sitting US president to test positive for Covid-19. His mild symptoms so far stand in stark contrast to Trump’s diagnosis before a vaccine was available in 2020 – a Covid infection that led to a multi-day hospitalization at Walter Reed.\n\nCovid emergency continues\n\nThe President’s infection comes as Covid cases are once again on the rise in the US, driven by the most contagious strain of the virus yet – BA.5. More than 1 million people have died of Covid-19 across the country since the pandemic began.\n\nThe Biden administration is continuing the Covid-19 public health emergency as it seeks new funding from Congress for treatments and vaccines. The public health emergency declaration allows many Americans to obtain free Covid-19 testing, therapeutic treatment and vaccines. Medicare has also relaxed the rules governing telehealth so that many more seniors can access such services during the declaration. And states are not involuntarily disenrolling residents from Medicaid during the declaration, in exchange for receiving more generous federal matching funds.\n\nThis story has been updated with further developments on Thursday.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Betsy Klein Kate Sullivan", "Maegan Vazquez", "Betsy Klein", "Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/politics/merrick-garland-covid-19/index.html", "title": "Two Biden Cabinet members among dozens of positive Covid-19 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTwo members of President Joe Biden’s Cabinet tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday, becoming some of the latest high-profile Washington figures to contract the virus in recent days.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced their positive diagnoses after having attended the elite Gridiron Club Dinner in Washington on Saturday. Other attendees, including first lady Jill Biden’s press secretary, Michael LaRosa; Vice President Kamala Harris’ communication director, Jamal Simmons; Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro; California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff; Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins; and the President’s sister, Valerie Biden Owens, have also announced positive tests.\n\nThe string of positive cases has turned attention in Washington to the Gridiron dinner, an event that brings together some of the city’s most prominent journalists, including from CNN, and the government officials they cover. Attendees had their vaccination status checked, but negative Covid-19 tests were not required to enter.\n\nAs of Thursday evening, 37 positive Covid-19 cases had been reported following Saturday’s dinner, according to a letter from the club to its members.\n\nTom DeFrank, the president of the Gridiron Club, said in a statement Wednesday that “there is no way of being certain about when they first contracted Covid,” DeFrank said.\n\n“But they did interact with other guests during the night and we have to be realistic and expect some more cases,” he continued. “Except in cases of public officials who have on their own disclosed their status, we will protect the privacy of guests who test positive.”\n\nGarland is not experiencing symptoms but asked to be tested after learning he may have been exposed to the virus, the Justice Department said. Earlier Wednesday, Garland had attended a news conference with other officials, including FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, to announce sanctions against Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev.\n\nRaimondo, meanwhile, is “experiencing mild symptoms” but is “confident that the vaccine has prevented her from experiencing more significant symptoms,” according to a statement from the Commerce Department Wednesday. Schiff said in a Tuesday tweet that he was “feeling fine,” and Castro reported in his own of “experiencing mild symptoms.” Owens did not have close contact with Biden or the first lady prior to her test, according to a statement from Celadon Books.\n\nLaRosa, who had tested negative earlier this week after attending the Gridiron dinner, confirmed to CNN on Thursday that he was experiencing mild symptoms and isolating at home.\n\nThough typically in close contact with the first lady, LaRosa only saw her briefly Thursday at the White House. He told CNN his interaction with Jill Biden had lasted less than 15 minutes and that they were several feet apart, which under CDC guidance means the first lady was not considered a close contact.\n\nHarris had been in close contact with Simmons, who tested positive on Wednesday, press secretary Kirsten Allen said.\n\n“The Vice President will follow CDC guidance for those that have been in close contact with a positive individual and will continue to consult with her physician. The Vice President plans to continue with her public schedule,” Allen said in a written statement.\n\nIn addition to having attended the dinner over the weekend, Simmons was also pictured in the East Room of the White House during the Affordable Care Act event with President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama.\n\nBiden is not considered to have been a close contact of Simmons, a White House official told CNN.\n\nInside the White House, in accordance with federal public health guidelines, officials and visitors have not been required to wear masks or social distance. Visitors are expected to be tested for Covid-19 before attending official White House events.\n\nSimmons’ case isn’t the first to touch the White House.\n\nLast month, second gentleman Doug Emhoff tested positive for the virus, marking the first known case of Covid-19 among the first or second families since Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took office in January 2021. And White House press secretary Jen Psaki and White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre have also tested positive in recent weeks.\n\nCovid-19 cases in Washington, DC, have declined since their peak in early January, when the country was facing a wave of Omicron variant cases. But Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser, said Wednesday that he thinks there will be an uptick in cases of Covid-19 in the US over the next few weeks, and that it is likely that there could be a surge in the fall.\n\n“I think we should expect … that over the next couple of weeks, we are going to see an uptick in cases. And hopefully there is enough background immunity so that we don’t wind up with a lot of hospitalizations,” said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, when asked by Bloomberg TV’s David Westin about the prospect of another wave of Covid-19 from BA.2 or another variant, given the level of immunity believed to exist in the US today.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments Thursday.", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc Jasmine Wright Sam Fossum", "Paul Leblanc", "Jasmine Wright", "Sam Fossum"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/17/president-biden-has-covid-for-a-third-time/74448073007/", "title": "President Biden tests positive for COVID, taking him off campaign ...", "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Joe Biden has again tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nBiden tested positive following an event Wednesday in Las Vegas, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\n“He is vaccinated and boosted, and he is experiencing mild symptoms,” she said.\n\nBiden will return to his home in Delaware, where he will self-isolate, Jean-Pierre said. \"The White House will provide regular updates on the president’s status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation,\" she said.\n\nBiden gave a thumbs up to reporters from the window of his presidential vehicle as his motorcade arrived at the tarmac at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas to head to Delaware.

Nine days later, he tested positive again in a virus “rebound” that patients treated with the antiviral medicationPaxlovid sometimes experience, his doctor said.\n\nThe latest positive test came while Biden was in Nevada for a series of events, including the UnidosUS annual conference in Las Vegas. Biden was scheduled to speak to the group, which is the nation’s largest Latino civil rights organization. But he did not come to the podium as scheduled.\n\n“Regrettably, I was just on the phone with President Biden, and he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon. The president has been at many events as we all know, and just tested positive for COVD,” said Janet Murguía, president and CEO of UnidosUS.\n\n\"We understand that he needs to take the precautions that have been recommended, and he did not obviously want to put anybody at risk,” Murguía said.\n\nMore:Biden's age makes COVID risky. Is his health in danger?\n\nShortly before testing positive, Biden was taking selfies and talking to customers at The Original Lindo Michoácan Restaurant as he campaigned in Las Vegas before he was set to appear at the UnidosUS conference.\n\nThe White House released a note from Biden’s doctor, Kevin O’Connor, who said the president had upper respiratory symptoms including a runny nose and non-productive cough, with general malaise. Biden’s symptoms remain mild, the doctor said, and his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97%.\n\n“He felt okay for his first event of the day, but given that he was not feeling better, point of care testing for COVID-19 was conducted, and the results were positive for the COVID-19 virus,” O’Connor said in the note.\n\nMore:Full-blown crisis puts Biden on his heels. An inside look at campaign's pitfalls.\n\nBiden's positive COVID test comes amid a crucial period in his reelection campaign against former President Donald Trump, who on Monday was formally handed the GOP nomination at the party's national convention in Milwaukee.\n\nBiden's diagnosis – which could take him off the campaign trail for several days – punctuates what’s been a brutal stretch for him that began with a disastrous June 27 debate against Trump. Biden's uneven performance during the debate ignited calls from Democrats for him to withdraw from the race.\n\nBiden has repeatedly rejected calls to quit, saying he's in the race to stay. He has increased his campaign appearances and interviews on television and radio to try to reassure Americans that he is up for a second term while many Democrats push for a new nominee.\n\nBiden said in an interview with BET on Tuesday that he would consider dropping out only \"if I had some medical condition that emerged, if the doctors came to me and said you got this problem or that problem.\"\n\nOlder adults face greater risk from COVID\n\nOlder adults face the highest risk of serious illness from COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People over 65 account for more than 81% of COVID deaths – and the number of deaths among the age group is 97 times higher than for people aged 18 to 29. The odds of getting acutely ill also go up for people with other illnesses.\n\n“Your risk of severe illness from COVID-19 increases as the number of your underlying medical conditions increase,” the CDC said.\n\nHospitalizations and emergency room visits are far less frequent than in January when more than 2,000 people a week died from COVID.

President Joe Biden, she said in a statement, is not a close contact.\n\n“This morning, I tested positive for COVID-19. I last saw the President Wednesday in a socially-distanced meeting while wearing an N-95 mask, and he is not considered a close contact as defined by the CDC,” she said in a tweet.\n\nBedingfield said she is experiencing mild symptoms and is “fully vaccinated and boosted,” in a subsequent tweet, adding that she would work from home and return to in-person work after a five-day isolation period and negative test.\n\nThe news comes the same week Vice President Kamala Harris tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nHarris, who is fully vaccinated and not experiencing symptoms, tested positive on Tuesday after returning from a weeklong trip to California. Her spokesperson Kirsten Allen saidthat the President was not a close contact and that Harris would work from the vice president’s residence until she tests negative.\n\nHarris has been taking the antiviral coronavirus treatment Paxlovid after consulting her physicians, according to Allen. Paxlovid is available via emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe illness. It requires a doctor’s prescription.\n\nCovid-19 has been spreading among White House officials over the past couple of months. In late March, White House press secretary Jen Psaki canceled her plans to travel with the President to Belgium and Poland after testing positive for Covid-19 for the second time. Her replacement on the Europe trip, White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, tested positive shortly after returning from the trip. Harris’ husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, tested positive for Covid-19 earlier in March.\n\nWhite House officials have acknowledged that it is “possible” the President will at some point contract Covid-19 but have emphasized the precautions being taken to prevent infection.\n\n“The bottom line is he is vaccinated and boosted. He is very well protected. He’s got very good protocols around him to protect him from getting infected. But there is no 100% anything,” White House Covid-19 response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said on Tuesday.\n\nThe President is scheduled to attend two high-profile events this weekend – the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in Washington and a memorial for former Vice President Walter Mondale in Minneapolis.\n\nWhite House officials argue the nation is in a much better position than it was at the beginning of the pandemic because of the availability of vaccines, boosters, at-home tests, treatments and masks.

From the momentous to the tragic, here are the stories that resonated the most with RGJ readers in 2020.\n\nJANUARY\n\nReno twins became face of rare genetic diseases, fighting the FDA and battling big pharma: Addi and Cassi Hempel died in 2019 after an aggressive virus attacked their fragile lungs, causing difficulty breathing and high fevers. They were 15. Their parents, Chris and Hugh Hempel, said biotech and pharmaceutical companies stole the lifesaving treatment they pioneered.\n\nHarrah’s Reno sold: The longstanding gaming icon in the heart of downtown Reno was sold to Las Vegas-based real estate group CAI investments, and is set to be remodeled into a mixed-use development with apartments, office space and retail.\n\nDeadly avalanche at Alpine Meadows: A 34-year-old skier died and another man sustained severe injuries after an avalanche on Jan. 17 at the Alpine Meadows ski resort. It was the fifth avalanche fatality of the year and the 10th during the 2019-20 ski season in the United States.\n\nPossible coronavirus case surfaces in Southern Nevada: As of Jan. 29, there were no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Nevada, but the Southern Nevada Health District was monitoring a possible case of coronavirus in a Clark County resident. After returning from more than a month in China and experiencing respiratory issues, the patient was isolated at a local hospital, according to health officials. The patient later tested negative.\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nFormer Reno Mayor Bob Cashell dies: Cashell, who grew up a Texan but became one of Nevada's favorite sons, died Feb. 11 with his wife of 55 years by his side and a steady parade of city leaders streaming through his hospital room to pay their respects. The three-term mayor brought a knack for bridging intractable divides — either through cajoling, the force of his larger-than-life personality or political shrewdness — to usher in a period of tremendous growth for the city.\n\nUndisclosed number of Southern Nevada residents quarantined for coronavirus: As of Feb. 12, Southern Nevada health officials were monitoring an undisclosed number of Clark County residents quarantined at home after trips to mainland China to determine whether they are infected with coronavirus. The patients were allowed to return home to be monitored under a 14-day self-quarantine.\n\nSanders wins Nevada caucuses: All eyes were on Nevada for the third-in-the-nation Democratic nominating contest on Feb. 22 after caucus chaos in Iowa earlier in the month. Sen. Bernie Sanders won the Nevada caucuses, garnering 47 percent of the vote. Former Vice President Joe Biden came in second with 20 percent of the vote, and former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg came in third with 14 percent of the vote.

Gov. Sisolak announced that Nevada was boosting its staffing numbers to deal with the unprecedented number of claims.\n\nWith $200 left in the bank, barber says she has no choice but to reopen her Reno shop: The space that barbershop proprietor Dee Goodman rents had been closed since mid-March. While Goodman’s income dried up, however, her financial responsibilities did not; and financial assistance that was provided to most workers was not made available to self-employed entrepreneurs such as herself. With no money, no unemployment insurance and no small business loans to turn to, Goodman says she no longer has a choice if she wants to survive. She announced she would reopen her business on May 1.\n\nMAY\n\nBarbershops, restaurants, more: Nevada's Phase 1 reopening announced: Gov.

Several sections of US 95 were damaged, but no other significant damage was reported.\n\nA peaceful protest, then riots: Reno residents joined in a nationwide movement on May 30, protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Loomis are scheduled to go to trial March 8, 2021.\n\nPoeville Fire destroys homes near Peavine: Two hundred seventy firefighters battled a wildfire on the east side of Peavine Mountain, a task made more difficult by high winds, dry conditions and at least one amateur drone pilot.

John Locher/AP\n\nLas Vegans are no longer allowed to build giant swimming pools or spas at single-family homes.\n\nThe Southern Nevada Water Authority says there’s been a proliferation of giant pools – some larger than 3,000 square feet – in recent years. The new building code limits new pools to no more than 600 square feet – a move the Las Vegas Valley Water District says will save more than 32 million gallons of water over the next decade. The average pool size in southern Nevada is 470 square feet.\n\nThe idea was to prevent people from building pools that were more like “water features” at some homes, rather than recreational swimming pools, said Bronson Mack, public outreach officer for the Water Authority, which manages water resources for 2.2 million people including Las Vegas.\n\n“A lot of these more affluent homes, they’re not even occupied year-round,” Mack told CNN. “And yet they have all of this water in their backyard.”\n\nBet 2: Reclaiming all indoor water for reuse\n\nThe \"bathtub rings\" are seen around Lake Mead, a sign of how far the water level has dropped. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nMost of the Water Authority’s conservation efforts focus on outdoor water. But indoor water can be recycled.\n\n“Water that we used indoors all gets reclaimed,” Mack said. “We treat that water to clean water standards, then return it to Lake Mead, our primary water source. Every gallon that we return to Lake Mead allows us to take another gallon out of the lake without counting against our limited water allocation.”\n\nAccording to the Water Authority, only 10% of its water comes from local groundwater. The other 90% comes from the Colorado River’s Lake Mead, the largest man-made reservoir in the country, which continues to fall to record lows. In April, the Water Authority had to decommission one of the original intake valves in the lake because the water level had fallen so low.\n\nAnd in August, the federal government enacted a Tier 2 shortage, which will limit the amount of water southern Nevada can pull from Lake Mead beginning in January by about 8.1 billion gallons a year.\n\nYet, on the Las Vegas Strip, glasses of water may still be served to restaurant customers since all that water will be recycled.\n\n“Even if you don’t drink that glass of water … they’re going to dump that down the drain, and all of that water gets reclaimed,” Mack said, noting this practice began in the 1950s. “That dish is going to go through the dishwasher – all of the dishwasher water gets reclaimed and recycled back to Lake Mead.”\n\nBet 3: Keeping the Vegas Strip water-savvy\n\nThe Bellagio fountain is an iconic feature of Las Vegas. It can lose up to 48 gallons of water per square foot per year due to evaporation alone. L.E. Baskow/AP\n\nAs for the Strip, the economic engine of southern Nevada, Mack said the region’s resort, casino and hotel sector is not as water-wasteful as it seems, despite its reputation for excess.\n\nMack said it only uses 5% of the community’s total water supply, while also making up its largest employment base, supporting some 40 million visitors a year.\n\nThere are also limitations on swimming pool size for the resorts based on the number of hotel rooms and guests they serve.\n\n“We could turn on every shower and every sink in every hotel room on the Las Vegas Strip, and it wouldn’t increase the amount of water we deplete from the Colorado River because all of that gets cycled back through our wastewater system, gets treated and returned to Lake Mead,” Mack explained.\n\nAs for the Las Vegas strip’s iconic fountains? They lose a lot of water to evaporation. According to the Water Authority, the fountain at the Bellagio is fed from a privately owned groundwater well and doesn’t use water from the Colorado River. But it estimates those outdoor water features can lose 48 gallons of water per square foot a year to evaporation – in a place where every drop counts.\n\nThe canals in the Venetian Resort recirculate their water, which does come from Colorado River. However, since the water is used indoors it can be reclaimed, Mack said.\n\nAs the climate crisis intensifies and water resources decline, the Las Vegas Valley Water District is considering a ban on all new ornamental water features at resort hotels, unless the feature is completely indoors and supplied by a privately owned water source.\n\nBet 4: Tearing out ‘nonfunctional’ grass\n\nLas Vegas has removed more than 200 million square feet of grass, incuding in residential front yards. Roger Kisby/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nGrass has been a major focus for conservation efforts in Las Vegas – especially grass that tends to be “nonfunctional,” or is merely ornamental, on medians, in front of commercial buildings and even in front yards.\n\nSince April, the Las Vegas Valley Water District has banned grass and spray-irrigation systems at all new properties. Schools, parks and cemeteries are exempt. Single-family homes built after 2003 are prohibited from having grass in front yards and limited on how much they can have in side and back yards.\n\n“We have removed more than 200 million square feet of grass from this valley, but there’s still about that much grass that remains,” Mack said.\n\nWhile getting rid of grass has been more widely embraced by homeowners, businesses have been slower to adapt. However, in 2021 the Nevada legislature passed a law that bans irrigating nonfunctional grass with water from the Colorado River.\n\nSNWA estimates the grass law will ultimately save 10% of its total water supply.\n\n“That’s more water than is consumed by the entire Las Vegas Strip,” Mack said, explaining that it takes 73 gallons of water per square foot every year to keep grass alive in the Mojave Desert. But drip-irrigated and drought-tolerant landscaping only requires 18 gallons per square foot a year.\n\nWatering grass “is the least efficient way” we can use water, Mack said.\n\nBet 5: Strict irrigation schedules year-round\n\nThe Water Authority also has a rotating watering schedule based on the time of the year.\n\nAs of September 1, outdoor watering is limited to three assigned days a week for the fall. On November 1, the winter schedule drops to one day a week before going back to three days for the spring, beginning March 1.\n\nIn the summer months, watering is permitted six days a week starting May 1, but never during the hottest time of day – between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. – when the water is prone to evaporation in the desert heat.\n\nWatering is always scheduled by neighborhood and is never permitted on Sunday.\n\nBet 6: Identifying water wasters\n\nSince everyone in a community is on the same watering schedule, it makes it easy to identify the people and businesses flouting the rules.\n\nThe Water Authority has water waste investigators who will contact property owners, highlight the waste and give them a chance to fix the issue. If the problem isn’t addressed, the owners will be fined, starting at $80 and then doubling for every subsequent violation.\n\nMack said there’s still water waste happening daily, but the water authority has enforced these rules for about a decade.\n\n“We had to be early adopters of that kind of activity,” Mack said.\n\nBet 7: Taking advantage of Mother Nature\n\nPeople navigate the rainy walkways at the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas during a storm in late July. L.E. Baskow/AP\n\nWhen Mother Nature makes it rain, Las Vegas goes all in.\n\nThis summer, Las Vegas was hit with a couple of monsoonal rain storms that helped ease some of the region’s drought, but also left incredible damage in their wake. It only took a couple inches of rain for water to pour into casinos on the Strip.\n\nMuch of that storm water gets funneled into the Las Vegas Wash which flows out to Lake Mead. But even though it was a lot of water all at once, Lake Mead is huge, and it may only increase the lake level by fractions of an inch, Mack said.\n\nWhat’s most important when it does rain in the Las Vegas Valley, Mack explained, is getting customers to shut their irrigation off.\n\nDuring one week of extreme rain in August, the community turned off its irrigation systems and some of its air conditioning systems, which also use water.\n\n“That collectively saved about 250 million gallons of water,” Mack said. “Saving water is desert living and we are in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Our community has been a city in the desert and now we are finally becoming a desert city.”", "authors": ["Stephanie Elam"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/10/06/here-all-victims-las-vegas-shooting/733236001/", "title": "Here are all the victims of the Las Vegas shooting", "text": "The massacre in Las Vegas killed 58 people and wounded 489 who were crowded together into one field, but those deaths have been felt across the entire continent.\n\nThe Clark County Coroner released the names of all 58 victims on Thursday.

The bathrooms, bigger than some one-bedroom apartments, have adjoining massage rooms.\n\nThere’s a gym, a “salt relaxation room,” a fully stocked bar and a pair of foosball and pool tables. On the balcony is a pool and Jacuzzi that overlooks the Strip.\n\nIn the room next door, there’s a butler. Always dressed in a suit, he's on call 24/7.\n\nWho stays here?\n\nSome celebrities. Some royalty from abroad.\n\nBut mostly the ones who inhabit this fantasy suite are the whales.\n\nThat’s what they call high-rollers in Vegas casinos. They’re the ones known to bet heavy – like $300,000 on a single hand of baccarat – and keep betting that way.\n\nIn return for their loyal play, these whales are given complimentary suites like the Empathy.\n\nBut not just anyone gets access. You must first qualify as a $1 million player and go through background and credit checks.\n\nThose that choose to book the Empathy Suite – say a foreign dignitary who is also a fan of Damien Hirst’s art – must also go through a background check and put up a security deposit of $10,000 at check-in.\n\nVegas billionaire:Billionaire, friend get no-jail plea deal in Las Vegas drug case\n\n“We’ve had some royalty come through,” Gray said. “Most of our guests have been international.”\n\nPianist-singer Alicia Keys stayed here with her husband.

Over a whirlwind 10-day period, the adventuresome couple logged 6,300 miles in his Mazda sedan, visited 15 states, took more than 1,000 pictures, and returned home with a renewed respect for the nation’s breadth and depth as well as memories to last a lifetime.\n\nHitting the open road\n\nStarting out from Klaas’ home in Pennsylvania, the couple headed west on Route 80 on a planned course that took them through Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, though they almost didn’t get out of the gate.\n\n“On our very first day, we hit a snowstorm and a detour in Ohio that delayed us – it could have been an omen!” DiGiovine laughed.\n\nHappily, the couple plowed onward, driving the scheduled 800 miles from Pennsylvania to Iowa on that first day, one of the trip’s more ambitious — and least fun — itinerary items. Beyond that, “Iowa and Nebraska were pretty flat and we saw cows and wind turbines everywhere — I was surprised by the number of both of those things that we encountered,” DiGiovine said.\n\nREAD: Taking a vacation road trip?

Visits to six of America’s national parks, including Arches National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, and Zion National Park in Utah and Grand Canyon National Park and Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. “Utah was incredibly beautiful and almost other-worldly, with tall, colorful mountains in different and interesting shapes all around,” she said.\n\n“And the Utah landscape changed so drastically — every 15 to 20 minutes, you could go from red-rocked mountains to evergreens, grass, and snow. I was just blown away.” The two also checked out the famous Las Vegas strip while in Nevada (“I didn’t know where to look first!” DiGiovine said), stargazed from their lodge inside Grand Canyon National Park at night and woke the next morning to catch the 6:28 a.m. sunrise, and made sure to commemorate their arrival in California.\n\n“After driving for 3,200 miles, we got a real feeling for how far California is from our home and felt like we’d earned it,” she said. “We walked on the beach in Del Mar and touched our feet in the water so we could say that we drove all this way to experience the Pacific Ocean. Even though we still had half of the trip to go, we felt like we’d made it!”\n\nA life-changing trip\n\nBooking hotels along the way and enjoying the 75-80 mile-per-hour speed limits they encountered from the Midwest to California — “it really helps you get from Point A to Point B faster!” DiGiovine said — the couple cruised iconic Route 66, took a tour of a craft brewery in California, enjoyed great burgers and local cuisine all along the way, stopped off at several of America’s more unusual landmarks, tuned into local radio stations to get a feel for each area (“it was especially funny to hear a rap station in the middle of the farmlands of Missouri,” she said), and marveled at how different — and similar — Americans are.\n\n“We saw a lot of cowboy hats across the Midwest and Texas and more hip, artsy, long-hair looks on guys in California. I’d always heard that Californians were so relaxed and chill and stress-free, and they really are,” she said. “But everyone we met across the U.S., especially in the national parks, was so friendly and accommodating.”\n\nArriving back home, “I felt like I’d achieved something I’d always wanted to do and that it had been a success, which was extremely fulfilling,” DiGiovine said of their life-changing road trip. “America is very vast, larger than you’d ever think, and everybody always flies but when you drive it you get a real sense of the actual magnitude from east to west.\n\n\"There were so many scenic highlights and photo opportunities and we feel so lucky to have been able to take this trip,” she added. “Being out on the open road is so liberating and I encourage other people to bite the bullet, be spontaneous, and do it. There’s nothing like exploring America first-hand.”\n\n“Olivia’s Observations”\n\nFollowing, Olivia DiGiovine shares her top travel tips for taking a cross-country road trip:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/03/21/bad-bars-indianapolis-club-onyx-owners/70007623007/", "title": "Character matters. It's a state law. So what about owners of strip club ...", "text": "Update: The Indiana Alcohol & Tobacco Commission voted Tuesday to effectively shut down three bars with lengthy histories of shootings, assaults and other problems.\n\nAs violence went largely unchecked at Club Onyx, a south side strip club that drew as many as 100,000 visitors a year, a group of secretive out-of-state owners quietly raked in the cash.\n\nOne of them is a former political consultant accused of embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars while working for a California casino in the 1990s. He was convicted of tax evasion and forgery, but later had his record expunged.\n\nAnother is a 60-year-old woman in rural Illinois with seemingly no experience in the adult entertainment industry.\n\nBad bars:Indianapolis strip club closes after police raid\n\nHer son, however, is an executive with one of the nation's largest strip club chains. He was accused of trying to hide his assets after being hit with a $7 million court judgment for defrauding a former employer. He denies those accusations and has never been charged criminally.\n\nThen there is RCI Hospitality Holdings, a publicly traded adult entertainment company that has contributed to the campaigns of top Indiana Senate leaders. Its lobbyist claims RCI has nothing to do with Club Onyx in Indianapolis, even though it owns the Onyx brand and listed the Indianapolis club as \"licensed location\" until IndyStar began making inquiries.\n\nEven the club's hired attorney seemed confused about who's calling the shots.\n\n“I'm still trying to sort out the ownership of that as well,” said Mark Webb, an influential Statehouse lobbyist and former ATC official who began representing the club several weeks ago.\n\nRead IndyStar's investigation:49 killed, 154 shot or stabbed: How Indiana law protects bad bars\n\nThe club closed last month after a police raid that led to the arrest of several workers on drug, alcohol, gun and prostitution charges. Now, the future of its liquor license is uncertain. The backgrounds of its owners is raising new questions about whether they meet the state's licensing requirements for a \"high and fine reputation\" and \"good moral character.\"\n\nThe Indiana Alcohol & Tobacco Commission is scheduled to decide Tuesday whether to uphold a Marion County board's recommendation to deny the club's license renewal.\n\nThe club has come under scrutiny because of rampant violence and other problems. Police have connected at least six shootings to the club since 2021. The gunfire left one person dead and five wounded. At least 10 other people reported being assaulted, sometimes by the club's security or employees.\n\nDespite the problems, the club prospered handsomely. One of its owners, who lives in a $2 million home on a private golf course in Tennessee, said the club drew more than 100,000 patrons annually. Another representative for the club valued it at $7 million.\n\nPolice and local alcohol board members say the lack of clear leadership has contributed to the mayhem. A tangle of at least five limited liability companies and three trusts comprise the club's ownership. Public information for those entities is limited, making it impossible to identify all of the parties involved. The confusion also has made it difficult to determine who to hold accountable.\n\nBut IndyStar's ongoing investigation into violence-plagued bars was able to trace details about the ownership — and some of the people behind those obscure groups. The new revelations came from Alcohol & Tobacco Commission documents obtained through a public records request, as well as state and federal court records, campaign finance reports and other sources.\n\nJerry Westlund: From indicted casino consultant to strip club mogul\n\nCharles G. “Jerry” Westlund Jr. acquired what had been the Classy Chassy strip club at 4444 S. Harding Street in 2020.\n\nWestlund is a former political consultant who was indicted in 1997. He was accused of embezzling $380,000 from a Southern California casino and its campaign to fend off ballot measures that would have allowed rival casinos.\n\nAuthorities claimed he used some of the casino’s campaign cash to buy low-rent apartment houses in Long Beach and Compton, according to a Los Angeles Times article.\n\nClub Onyx Indianapolis:5 things to know about the troubled strip club facing loss of its alcohol permit\n\nA Los Angeles jury found Westlund guilty on six counts of evading state income tax and two counts of forgery, but acquitted him of embezzlement charges. He was ordered to pay more than $240,000 in back taxes, interest and penalties, California tax officials told the Times.\n\nWestlund later had the convictions expunged.\n\nAfter consulting casinos, he turned to strip clubs. As of 2021, he owned or partially owned 34 clubs across the country, he said in an interview with the Professional Adult Nightclub DJ Association.\n\nIn Indiana, he owns at least five clubs including: The Pony near Indianapolis Motor Speedway; Jiggles and Jaguars on Pendleton Pike; Club Onyx on the southside; and Ponytails in Evansville. In the summer of 2018, Westlund brought Stormy Daniels to Indianapolis for two shows at The Pony.\n\nHe lives in an 8,000 square-foot house on a prestigious golf course called The Governor’s Club in Brentwood, Tenn., a suburb of Nashville, according to paperwork filed with the Indiana Alcohol & Tobacco Commission. The home was briefly listed for $2.9 million in 2021.\n\nRecords show the ATC knew about Westlund’s criminal history. He and his attorney at the time, former ATC Chairman Bart Herriman, disclosed the convictions on Westlund’s liquor license application, even though it wasn’t required.\n\nIndyStar reviewed the club’s liquor license filings and a recording of Westlund’s Aug. 3, 2020, appearance before the Alcoholic Beverage Board of Marion County. There is no indication that the ATC or local board members questioned him about the past conviction.\n\nAlmost as soon as his license was approved, Westlund transferred half of his ownership interest to another company. He alerted the ATC, but it's unclear what scrutiny the agency gave to the new owners.\n\nATC General Counsel Ashley Merritt did not answer specific questions about Club Onyx, but said ownership changes are \"reviewed by Commission staff.\" Any new owners must comply with the state's “high and fine” reputation requirement, she said.\n\nWestlund did not return phone messages from IndyStar.\n\nRyan Carlson: 'Owner's representative' accused of fraud, hiding assets\n\nOn paper, Westlund’s co-owner is an obscure limited liability company incorporated in Wyoming that appears to be controlled by Janet Carlson. The 60-year-old woman lives in a modest home in a neighborhood surrounded by farms in the small village of Viola, Illinois. She has no other known connections to the adult entertainment world.\n\nBut she's not the one who showed up at the Indianapolis City-County Building to defend the club’s liquor license at a Marion County alcohol board hearing earlier this month. Instead, it was her son, Ryan D. Carlson, chief executive officer for Deja Vu Services, one of the nation’s largest strip club owners.\n\nCarlson, who arrived at the meeting in an open-collar shiny red shirt with a gold chain around his neck and a large ring on his pinky finger, has a controversial history in the industry, court records show.\n\nThe 31-year-old previously managed a Las Vegas topless club called Club Paradise.\n\nIn June 2014, Las Vegas Metro Police and IRS agents raided the establishment as part of a credit card fraud investigation. Several people were indicted, but Carlson was not among them.\n\nRoughly five months later, Club Paradise’s owners sued Carlson, two other managers and three dancers. The club accused the group of defrauding the club through an elaborate racketeering scheme from May 2013 to June 2014.\n\nCarlson and the other defendants created and inflated hundreds of unauthorized credit card transactions for unsuspecting patrons, the club claimed. They then pocketed the overcharges.\n\nIn one instance described in court documents, Carlson and his co-defendants allegedly created, forged and inflated 12 transactions related to one patron by more than $35,900.\n\nThe club also accused Carlson and the other managers of stealing $50,000 from a safe. They tampered with security cameras, then replaced stacks of $100 bills with singles, taking care to leave a single $100 bill on each end, according to an affidavit from one of the club’s owners.\n\nWhen the club pressed Carlson and others to take a polygraph test shortly before the raid, they refused and resigned, the club said.\n\nIn 2017, a Nevada state court entered a default civil judgment against Carlson and his co-defendants in the amount of $7.3 million, clearing the way for Club Paradise to garnish his wages in an attempt to collect on the debt, court documents show.\n\nThat's when Carlson began looking for ways to hide his income, according to Club Paradise. He began to work with one of Club Paradise’s rivals, Deja Vu Services, at one point managing the company's club, brothel and hotel in Tijuana, Mexico, according to Club Paradise’s lawsuit.\n\nHe then reduced his income to zero by increasing his federal tax withholding rate to 100%, the lawsuit says. This resulted in his entire net income being paid in a single, lump-sum tax refund, which is not subject to garnishment. He also explored renting a New York City apartment through his employer at their expense.\n\nClub Paradise sought a judge’s permission to more closely examine Carlson’s finances, but he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy a day before the hearing.\n\nClub Paradise argued Carlson’s debt to the club should not be discharged in the bankruptcy because it was the result of fraud.\n\nAn email that surfaced as part of the bankruptcy case described a trust that Deja Vu's accountant suspected he was using to hide income and circumvent the garnishment.\n\n“You have been angling to find SOME way to get around the garnishment for months now. This is not the first attempt, far from it,” the accountant wrote in a Jan. 25, 2019, email to Carlson.\n\nThe trust would not have any business dealings outside of Carlson's presence, the accountant wrote.\n\n“This has been structured to place 2-3 layers between the clubs and yourself, but that is still what it comes down to,\" she said. \"This is structured to get you compensation without the compensation being traceable by (Club Paradise owner) Sam (Cecola) or subject to garnishment.”\n\nIn another email, Carlson acknowledged a trust that he said “lists him nowhere in the trust documents.” The name of the trust is not disclosed in the emails.\n\nCarlson eventually settled the case with Club Paradise's owner for $400,000. He admitted no wrongdoing.\n\nThe email’s description of Carlson’s trust bears a striking resemblance to the ownership structure of the LLC that co-owns Club Onyx with Westlund.\n\nWhile still under the cloud of the $7.3 million judgment, a new limited liability company, CDR Indianapolis LLC, was formed in Wyoming. The new company is owned by three other LLC’s. Those LLC’s, in turn, are owned by trusts. The trust that holds a controlling stake is called The Tiger Trust.\n\nIts sole beneficiary is Carlson’s mother.\n\nThe trust, through those same LLC's, also co-owns three other Central Indiana strip clubs with Westlund — The Pony, Jaguars and Jiggles.\n\nAt the recent Marion County alcohol board hearing, Carlson referred to himself as the “owner’s representative.” He told the board his mother is an “invalid” and “elderly.” When asked if he had power of attorney, he said, \"I could get it if needed.\"\n\nIndyStar sought to confirm Carlson’s description of his mother. When reached by phone, she hung up when a reporter identified herself and explained the reason for the call.\n\nCarlson did not respond to phone calls and emails from IndyStar. Webb, his attorney, said his client “has nothing more to add.”\n\nRCI: Strip club chain contributed to Indiana Senate leader Rod Bray\n\nThere’s yet another player in the Club Onyx saga, but its name doesn’t appear anywhere on the club’s liquor license. Its financial ties to the club remain unclear.\n\nRCI Hospitality Holdings, a publicly traded company with more than 40 strip clubs across the country, owns the Club Onyx brand, which it describes as the “Nation’s No. 1 Hip Hop Strip Club.”\n\nPrior to the club’s closure last month in the wake of an IMPD raid, RCI Hospitality listed the Indianapolis club on its website, calling it a “Licensed Location of the Onyx Brand.” But after an IndyStar article about the police raid, the Indianapolis location was removed from the company’s website.\n\nIn an email, a spokesperson for RCI said it does not own the Club Onyx in Indianapolis, but did not answer follow-up questions about whether it had a branding agreement with the owners. The Indianapolis location, however, operated in a manner similar to RCI's other Club Onyx locations, hosting rap battles and featuring hip hop artists and influencers.\n\nAt the Marion County alcohol board meeting, Carlson blamed the concept for the club's problems, which he attributed to the \"old regime.\" He pledged to rebrand the club if allowed to retain its license, prompting a sharp response from board chairman Tyler Graves.\n\n\"Just to be clear,\" Graves said. \"You are the old regime.\"\n\nCampaign finance records suggest RCI, which also owns PT’s Showclub on Pendleton Pike in Lawrence, recently stepped up its lobbying efforts at the Indiana Statehouse.\n\nThe company contributed $1,000 each last year to Indiana Senate leader Rod Bray, R-Martinsville, and his No. 2 at the time, Sen. Mark Messmer, R-Jasper.\n\nThe contributions highlight the deep influence alcohol interests have at the Statehouse.\n\nWebb, who represents Club Onyx and PT’s Showclub, said he made the contribution on behalf of RCI during a fundraiser for Bray at Mallow Run Winery in Bargersville. Bray’s campaign reported collecting nearly $55,000 from about 25 contributors on the day of the event, which was paid for by Wine & Spirits Distributors of Indiana.\n\nThe contribution to Messmer, who did not respond to a message from IndyStar, was made during a fundraiser at another alcohol establishment: the 1933 Lounge at St. Elmo’s Steakhouse.\n\nWebb said his lobbying activities on behalf of RCI and PT’s Showclub had nothing to do with Club Onyx, even though Club Onyx was listed on the company’s website at the time.\n\n“I've only been asked to represent Onyx in the last probably four weeks,” he said earlier this month.\n\nDespite IndyStar's ongoing investigation — which revealed an unusual state law protects bars from cities and local police, even when they have lengthy histories of violence — Bray has dismissed the need for reform. The investigation also found that lax oversight, understaffing and poor enforcement by the ATC allowed violence at bars and clubs to fester.\n\n\"They're not there to enforce or prevent murders or fights or violence,” Bray said of the ATC. “You know if the city is serious about that they'll put a law enforcement officer outside of those bars and the prosecutor will take those very seriously.\"\n\nWhen asked about the strip club campaign contribution, Bray said through a spokeswoman that he “was not aware of the business dealings of RCI Management when he received their donation to his campaign last year.”\n\nIndyStar asked Bray’s spokeswoman what he planned to do with the campaign contribution now that he knows it came from a strip club company.\n\nShe replied: “He said he hadn't considered what to do with the contribution.”\n\nContact IndyStar reporter Tony Cook at 317-444-6081 or tony.cook@indystar.com.

Businesses are relocating here. Top Chef launched its latest season in the city, complete with footage of the Milwaukee Public Market, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Hoan Bridge and other landmarks. And while Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much these days, they both decided to hold their conventions in Milwaukee in recent years – or at least try to.\n\nWe wanted to celebrate our great city by honoring some of the things we love about it. The trouble is, there’s so much to love about Milwaukee that it was tough to decide which objects to highlight. (We settled on 100 objects; a push to do 414 was quickly shot down by editors.)\n\nSome of the objects are stunningly beautiful, like the art museum’s wings and the Basilica of St. Josaphat dome. Others are delicious – like a Sobelman’s Bloody Mary, frozen custard and cheese curds. More than a few involve beer and sports, because of course they do. And we included some things that are just so Milwaukee – like racing sausages, Kohl’s Cash and “I Closed Wolski’s” stickers.\n\nWe also know Milwaukee isn’t perfect and has long faced deep problems like racism, segregation and inequality. So we also wanted to focus on the struggle for a better future by including key locations in the city, such as the 16th Street Viaduct, in an effort to honor the fair housing marches of the 1960s.\n\nNext time somebody starts trashing Milwaukee, please tell them the city’s brightest days are still ahead. And maybe send them this list of 100 objects as a reminder that Milwaukee is indeed “the good land” full of promise – and some pretty great things.\n\n—Mary Spicuzza\n\n100 objects that make Milwaukee\n\nArchitecture\n\nCulture\n\nEntertainment\n\nEnvironment\n\nFood & drink\n\nHistory\n\nSports\n\nHow did we come up with these 100 objects? Here's an explanation.\n\nWhat did we miss? What doesn’t belong? Let us know here: bit.ly/MKE100More.\n\nThe Polish immigrants who poured into Milwaukee in the late 19th century wanted a beautiful church that telegraphed their strong Catholic faith and ethnic heritage. And they were willing to do anything for it.\n\nThey mortgaged their homes to raise money. They volunteered their labor. Fr. Wilhelm Grutza, the blacksmith-turned-pastor, shipped 500 rail cars of salvaged materials from a shuttered Chicago post office. He died five weeks after the church's dedication in 1901, exhausted from overwork.\n\nIn a city dotted with steeples and infused with Catholic tradition, the Basilica of St. Josaphat stood out. Modeled after St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, its 220-foot-high copper dome was only second in size to the U.S. Capitol at the time.\n\nToday, 123 years later, the ornate basilica is still larger-than-life. It’s a tourist destination as well as a hallowed space. The faithful who gather understand they’re among tens of thousands who have knelt in the pews for prayer, and heard the acoustics echo, and craned their necks to take in the intricately decorated cupola.\n\nIt’s Milwaukee’s largest church. It’s always been an anchor of the south side. But its dome – first illuminated at night in 2019 – cemented the basilica’s place in Milwaukee’s skyline for years to come.\n\nEven as church attendance and religious belief decline, the dome is a reminder of Catholics’ indelible impact on the city.\n\nIt calls to drivers passing on Interstate 43: I’ve been here over a century, and I’m here to stay.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nMilwaukee has a contentious history with public art (Google “Blue Shirt” if you need a reminder). Ensconced in O’Donnell Park at the lakefront, Mark di Suvero’s steel-beam sculpture “The Calling” has survived several rounds of controversy with the staying power of the sun that it abstractly mimics.\n\nFunded by an anonymous donor, it is made of steel I-beams painted orange and stands 40 feet tall. After 11 argumentative public hearings and much political grandstanding, the Common Council approved the artwork, which was dedicated in April 1982.\n\n“Di Suvero certainly was aware that many people would see his work from great distances and from the windows of rushing cars, buses and trucks,” Milwaukee Sentinel art critic Dean Jensen wrote in 1982. “Through its great size, its garish color and the grammar of its simple forms, it asserts its essence quickly and directly.”\n\n“The Calling” enjoyed a bonus kerfuffle in 2001 when architect Santiago Calatrava’s gleaming white addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum opened. Killjoys wanted the di Suvero away from the Calatrava sightline. The artist responded bluntly: “If you don’t want it, take it apart and ship it to me.”\n\nAs for the architect, he told Journal critic Whitney Gould that he designed the MAM addition with “The Calling” in mind. And if you stand along Wisconsin Avenue in the right spots, you’ll see that “The Calling” and the Calatrava addition line up perfectly.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of spring, when warmer weather finally thaws the winter roads. It’s the sound of the wind blowing across your face and through your hair. It’s the sound of speed, freedom, the open road. It’s the sound of summer, long rides cross-country or a short trip to the beach.\n\nIt’s the sound of friends William Harley and Arthur Davidson’s turn-of-the-20th-century ingenuity that grew from tinkering in a backyard shed to the construction of a two-wheeled, motor-powered bike and the desire to make it go fast, then faster. It’s the sound of a business born in 1903 and raised in Milwaukee, then taking off to become an internationally known brand. It’s the sound linked to leather, and the smell of gasoline. It’s the sound of putting the pedal to the metal.\n\nYou know that sound. It’s the sound of a Harley.\n\n-Jessica Van Egeren\n\nJune 19, 1865, is the most crucial day in African American history. On that day, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and declared that the Civil War was over and all 250,000 enslaved people in the state — the last remaining slaves in the South — were now free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 1997, a flag was designed to commemorate Juneteenth and was later revised.\n\nThe flag features red, white, and blue colors — from the American flag — with a white bursting star of freedom in the middle. An arc runs through the flag’s center to symbolize the new horizon of opportunity for African Americans. The blue is above the red because the red represents the ground soaked with blood from all those who came before us and fought for freedom.\n\nMilwaukee’s annual Juneteenth celebration is one of the country’s oldest — the city was one of the first in the northern states to began officially celebrating Juneteenth, in 1971.\n\nJuneteenth and its flag are significant for me as an African American. My grandparents, who lived in Mississippi, referred to it as “Jubilee Day,” and they celebrated it by enjoying strawberry soda and red velvet cake that symbolized the blood shed by enslaved West African ancestors.\n\nThis flag should be flown on Juneteenth and every day in our country.\n\n-James E. Causey\n\nIf you live anywhere in the Milwaukee area, you’ve almost definitely seen an Oak Leaf Trail sign. The over 135-mile multi-use trail traverses throughout Milwaukee County and is beloved by cyclists, runners, walkers, birders, skateboarders, rollerbladers and more. It’s a mainstay in numerous local running races throughout the year.\n\nThe Oak Leaf can take you pretty much anywhere in Milwaukee and offers beautiful views; nearly a quarter travels along the Lake Michigan shoreline. The trail’s nine branch lines connect users to dozens of county parks, beer gardens and attractions in the area.\n\nThe Oak Leaf also intersects with various other municipal trails, allowing for travel beyond the county. The northern terminus connects to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which users can take all the way to Sheboygan County.\n\nWhile it’s hard to imagine the Oak Leaf without its variety of users today, it was not open for non-cycling use (or given its current name) until 1996. The trail’s origins date back to the late 1930s, when local cycling enthusiasts established an about-65-mile bike route around Milwaukee County.\n\nThree decades later, the trail was officially recognized by the county parks department. In 1976, it was christened the “76 Bike Trail” in honor of the national bicentennial.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nFor more than 150 years, few objects have represented the city of Milwaukee better than a mug of beer – the key component of gemütlichkeit, which Milwaukeeans have pursued since long before prohibition.\n\nBeer steins clutched in the hands of dozens of strangers crowded together at long wooden tables under tree canopies represents the city’s long devotion to the craft of beer brewing and community, and pays tribute to the city’s sturdy Germanic roots.\n\nGerman immigrants inspired the creation of the city’s breweries and made beer gardens the quintessential gathering spot of Milwaukee. According to the Milwaukee County Parks Department, more than two dozen breweries were in operation by 1856, making way for beer gardens along the Milwaukee River.\n\nProhibition in the 1920s curtailed such gatherings, but the idea has experienced a revival in recent years.\n\nThe city has several permanent beer gardens, including the popular Estabrook Beer Garden along the river greenway in the city’s northeast side, between Shorewood and Whitefish Bay. And the county’s Traveling Beer Garden tours bring the beer garden experience to neighborhood parks around the city throughout the summer.\n\nHere, you can fill your beer stein with Hofbrau, wash down bratwurst or a soft pretzel, and watch your neighbors polka – just like Milwaukeeans did generations before.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nMusic can bring a community together.\n\nWant proof? Just visit Washington Park’s bandshell on a Wednesday evening in the summer.\n\nYou’ll see families and friends spreading out blankets and popping open lawn chairs on the grassy amphitheater.\n\nYou’ll smell barbecue, wood-fired pizza and popcorn wafting from local vendors’ food trucks.\n\nAnd depending on the night, you’ll hear classical, jazz, reggae, opera, folk, rock, punk or a fusion of genres.\n\nThe stunning art deco bandshell is formally known as the Emil Blatz Temple of Music, named for the man who came from a brewing dynasty and donated $100,000 for its construction in the city’s largest park.\n\nAt its dedication in 1938, a crowd of 40,000 – “a mass of mothers, fathers, maidens, swains and wide-eyed children” – heard a performance from the Wisconsin Symphony Orchestra and singer Jessica Dragonette, The Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\n“If this temple of music gives you as much pleasure as it has given me in donating it, I am fully repaid,” Blatz told those who gathered on the lawn.\n\nIn the 86 years since, the bandshell has hosted musical legends like Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Lily Pons, often as part of its “Music Under the Stars” program, which ran for 55 years.\n\nToday, Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on the tradition, providing a welcoming space for neighbors of all ages to sing, dance and listen.\n\n-Ashley Luthern\n\nWhen it comes to Frank Lloyd Wright, most Wisconsinites think of Taliesin, the architect’s home and workshop in Spring Green, the S.C. Johnson headquarters building in Racine or Monona Terrace in Madison.\n\nBut did you know there’s an entire block on the city’s south side that’s a showcase for Wright’s more modest designs?\n\nThe Burnham Block is a one-of-a-kind collection of six buildings constructed in 1916 as models for affordable housing for working-class people. The collection of single-family homes and duplexes on the 2700 block of West Burnham Street have the typical Wright touches of rich woodwork, tall vertical windows and natural construction materials, but they’re substantially smaller than the homes Wright had previously designed.\n\n“These are Frank Lloyd Wright’s vision to house every person, every American in a beautiful, artistic place to call home,” said Mike Lilek, curator for Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block, Inc., the nonprofit that owns five of the six buildings.\n\nThe organization has restored two buildings, which now function as a museum that is open for public tours. Plans are being developed for restoring the home on the northwest corner of South Layton Boulevard and West Burnham Street.\n\nYou can make reservations for a guided tour at wrightinmilwaukee.org.\n\n-Karl Ebert\n\nGreeting visitors by water from the east, the Hoan Bridge is both Milwaukee’s iconic and ironic symbol for the city’s socialist history.\n\nFormer Mayor Daniel Hoan, the city’s longest serving socialist mayor, had much of Milwaukee onboard with his policies, but when the bridge for part of Interstate 794 was erected in his honor, many were dismayed.\n\n“Where transportation was concerned, Dan Hoan was no fan of car culture,” said Phil Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University. “Quite the opposite. He often bitterly complained that cars locked the city into a dynamic of ever-greater spending on ever-widening streets and that greater traffic jeopardized public safety.”\n\nThe public gets an up close and personal view of the Hoan, which opened for traffic in 1977, during the highlight of Milwaukee’s warm months — Summerfest.\n\nIt crosses over the Milwaukee Harbor, welcoming shipping, and connects downtown to Bay View and other parts of southern Milwaukee County. It’s in the foreground of many photographers’ shots of the city skyline, and is lit every night, often to honor an event or person.\n\nCoined the “bridge to nowhere” during construction, the Hoan has very much become part of Milwaukee’s image.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nYou don’t have to be the commissioner of Major League Baseball or owner of the Milwaukee Bucks to eat like them.\n\nAt Jake’s Delicatessen, 1634 W. North Ave., patrons can walk and eat in the shadow of former MLB Commissioner Allan H. “Bud” Selig and late Bucks owner Herb Kohl, who frequented the deli.\n\nJake’s Deli opened in 1955 and catered to the many Jewish families who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to the Haymarket and Sherman Park neighborhoods. In 1969, Selig bought an ownership stake in the business and held it until Wajeeh Alturkman bought it in 2021.\n\nJake’s has a modest appearance with a vertical street sign that reads “Jake’s.” Those in search of a good sandwich don’t need any further description.\n\nJake’s is known for its corned beef, but it’s the pastrami sandwich that gets people talking. Patrons have a choice to get the rye bread toasted or keep it plain, with yellow or brown mustard and their choice of cheese.\n\nIf they take a seat on the bench by the counter, the meat is cut slowly right in front of them. And a pickle spear is served on the side.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nLike its subject, downtown’s mural of Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is larger than life — covering the three-story back wall of a historic office building at 600-606 E. Wisconsin Ave. It was painted there in spring 2022 by local artist Mauricio Ramirez. The building is owned by Dan Nelson Jr., a Bucks season ticket holder and president and chief executive officer of Nelson Schmidt Inc., a marketing communications agency that operates at the building.\n\nFor Giannis fans, it’s a must-stop photo op, and perhaps Milwaukee’s best-known mural.\n\nHis legacy is still being written, but already includes being named Most Valuable Player in the 2021 NBA championship series and two regular season MVP awards in 2019 and 2020. And it will always include Milwaukee, where we’ve watched him grow from a teenager to a dominant player, an involved father and a noted fan of chicken nuggets.\n\nBucks in six!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nHow do you decide on an iconic symbol to symbolize a place that is so iconic?\n\nI’m speaking of the Milwaukee Public Museum. And, if you’re in a roomful of Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, the answer is, not without a fight.\n\nThe museum has been around (in various iterations and locations) since 1851. And it’s become a go-to place for field trips and weekend excursions.\n\nSo this reporter (having been on many such field trips and excursions) suggested the rattlesnake button for MPM’s symbol. Because how could you possibly end a trip to the museum without sitting on the ledge surrounding the bison hunt exhibit, reaching your hand underneath and flicking the switch? The answer is, you cannot.\n\nAnother reporter proposed the T-Rex, which for decades has been famously munching on the remains of his fallen prey in the museum’s strikingly realistic (and scary) dinosaur diorama.\n\nAfter vigorous debate, we were outvoted by proponents of Granny, who calmly rocks in her chair on the porch of her house in the Streets of Old Milwaukee. Granted, she does live in possibly the most popular exhibit ever at the museum. And (especially impressive for someone her age), she has her own social media accounts. So who is this reporter to argue?\n\nBut MPM apparently agrees the rattlesnake button and T-Rex are iconic since they’ll be making the trek to the new museum, slated to open in 2027. Granny will be there, too.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nMost will agree that a trip (or two or several) to the Milwaukee County Zoo is necessary if you want to call yourself a true Milwaukeean.\n\nAnd many Milwaukee children (or grownups waxing nostalgic about their childhoods) will agree that a trip to the zoo is not complete without a ride on the train and a Mold-a-Rama souvenir of their favorite animal. This is universal.\n\nLess universal is choosing your favorite zoo animal. Milwaukee has had some famous ones over the years, from Gordy the groundhog to Chandar the Bengal tiger to Onassis the geriatric Giant South American River turtle.\n\nPerhaps the most famous is an animal that members of the Millennial generation and afterward never even met. But he lives in the memories of middle-age and older Milwaukeeans.\n\nAccording to the Milwaukee Public Library, Samson the gorilla arrived as a baby in Milwaukee in 1950 (back when the zoo was located in Washington Park). He moved to the zoo’s current location in 1959, and would for years grab the attention of delighted, fascinated and (sometimes) terrified zoo visitors when he pounded on the glass of his enclosure.\n\nSamson died of a heart attack in 1981, but Milwaukeeans can pay homage to him with a visit to the Milwaukee Public Museum, where there is a lifelike re-creation of the famous gorilla.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nIf you’ve never lived outside Milwaukee, you may be wondering why a clearly universal celebration like St. Nick’s Day — that perfectly timed mini-holiday to tide you over till Christmas with a few little treats in your stocking or shoes — is being honored in a dedication to Milwaukee things.\n\nBut Milwaukee is one of relatively few places that have been lucky enough to hold on to the tradition, along with other cities with large German or Dutch influence, such as Cincinnati; Holland, Michigan; and St. Louis.\n\nThe feast of 4th-century bishop St. Nicholas is celebrated Dec. 6. Traditionally, St. Nick is thought to go from house to house on the night of Dec. 5, leaving treats in the shoes of children.\n\nIn most places, St. Nick has become synonymous with Santa Claus, and everybody knows he brings treats and gifts just once a year — on Christmas Eve.\n\nFor kids new to the city (and their parents), now you know: Milwaukee kids get two mornings in December to wake up to find gifts.\n\n-Amy Schwabe\n\nThe Milwaukee County War Memorial is one of the most recognizable buildings on the city’s Lake Michigan shoreline.\n\nSituated just north of the Milwaukee Art Museum, the War Memorial overlooks the lake from the east side of downtown on East Mason Street, and its plaza is a popular spot for gathering to see lakefront fireworks.\n\nIts mission comes down to six words: “Honor the Dead. Serve the Living.”\n\nThe building was dedicated on Veterans Day 1957, the work of Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, according to the War Memorial’s website.\n\nThe building’s design was “influenced by the abstract geometry of modern French architect Le Corbusier,” according to the Milwaukee Art Museum website.\n\nThe building is not only a memorial but a “hub for veteran activities,” the War Memorial website states.\n\nAn eternal flame memorial sits in a small pool, illuminating a black granite honor roll that includes names of Milwaukee County residents who have died while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nOn your way to a fancy night out in the Third Ward, take the right path and you’ll come across a permanent trio of massive ladybugs that look like they could be headed the same direction as you.\n\nIt’s hard to tell how massive they are, exactly: They’re perched way up on the side of the Milwaukee Building on North Water Street.\n\nAt least, it’s a hard calculation looking up at them from the sidewalk or from a car whizzing by.\n\nThe fiberglass bugs are each about 6 feet long and 3 feet deep and have been hanging there since July 1999.\n\nThey were thought up by John J. Burke to decorate the building that houses the company he started, Burke Properties, according to his obituary.\n\nNot much has been written about them, which is a testament to how many interesting things Milwaukee offers — we take even giant beetles for granted.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nThe most quintessentially Milwaukee treat, especially on a hot summer day. (But, let’s be honest: We Midwesterners enjoy a cold cone even when it’s below zero.)\n\nFrozen custard is a step up from your average ice cream because it includes egg yolks that make for a richer texture.\n\nTravel Wisconsin lists Milwaukee as the unofficial “frozen custard capital of the world,” a kind way of saying no visitor should leave the city without trying frozen custard from at least one, if not multiple, locations.\n\nMight we suggest a formal custard tasting?\n\nThree places to start: Gilles, Leon’s and Kopp’s. Each serves a couple of basic flavors every day, plus a Flavor of the Day that’s often more unique.\n\nGilles Frozen Custard opened in 1938, making it the oldest operating stand in the city, according to Travel Wisconsin. Find it at 7515 W. Bluemound Road, and don’t be shy about taking a look at the full menu of non-frozen treats.\n\nLeon’s Frozen Custard popped up just a few years later, in 1942, and is still operated by the original family, according to its website. The year-round business at 3131 S. 27th St. bills itself as a “classic 1950s-style family owned drive-in, specializing in frozen custard.”\n\nKopp’s Frozen Custard: Come for dessert, stay for dinner. With locations in Glendale, Brookfield and Greenfield, you’re never too far from the custard shop that’s also known for its massive burgers.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nYou might know it from the 1970s and 80s sitcom Laverne & Shirley, in which “Welcome Milwaukee visitors” is displayed in all-caps across the bell tower in the opening credits.Or, you might just be familiar from passing the iconic building that sits on a triangular slice of land with its north end at the intersection of East Kilbourn Avenue and North Water Street.\n\nThe Flemish Renaissance-inspired structure in the heart of downtown Milwaukee was completed in 1895, becoming a fixture of the city’s skyline. It cost about $1 million to construct, according to the city.\n\nIts atrium in the building’s center rises eight stories and serves as the site of city functions and news conferences by officials and those challenging their actions.\n\nOn the floors that ascend from the atrium are various city offices, including the Mayor’s Office and the Common Council Chambers where the 15-member council conducts its public meetings. Others include the Assessor’s Office and City Attorney’s Offices.\n\nFrom the base of the bell tower to the top of the flagpole, the building ascends 393 feet in the air. For a few years after City Hall opened in 1895, it was one of the tallest habitable buildings – if not the tallest – in the nation and world.\n\nThe tower holds the bell known as “Solomon Juneau” after Milwaukee’s first mayor, according to the city. The bell was made from church and firehouse bells from around the city and first rang on New Year’s Eve 1896.\n\n-Alison Dirr\n\nIn the heart of Marquette University’s bustling campus, a medieval remnant offers respite for the soul.\n\nJoan of Arc Chapel began its life as a place of worship circa 1420 in the village of Chasse, southeast of Lyon, France. Named then after St. Martin de Seysseul, it served the people of Chasse-sur-Rhône for hundreds of years before falling into disrepair.\n\nJoan of Arc, the legendary warrior and patron saint of France, is said to have prayed at the chapel in 1429. That was part of its attraction to Gertrude Hill Gavin, who bought it in 1927 and had it moved to her estate in Long Island, N.Y.\n\nMarc Rotjman, a former president of Racine’s J.I. Case Co., and his wife, Lillian, bought the chapel in 1962 and later donated it to Marquette. Over nine months, its 30 tons of stone and 18,000 terracotta roof tiles were carefully disassembled, labeled and shipped to Milwaukee. The reassembled and renamed chapel opened here in 1966. Its nave was lengthened to allow seating up to 60 people; radiant floor heating and electricity were also added.\n\nThe Gothic chapel is a striking landmark amid so many buildings centuries younger. But it continues to be an active worship site, with as many as seven Masses a week when classes are in session, including a Sunday afternoon liturgy in Spanish.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nFor many people, just balancing on ice skates is hard ... now imagine maintaining control while skating at 30 miles per hour and racing fellow skaters. That’s the sport of speedskating.\n\nMilwaukee is home to one of the top speedskating facilities in the world: the Pettit National Ice Center. The Pettit is one of only two 400-meter indoor speedskating ovals in the country and is an official U.S. Speedskating training facility. It opened in 1992 and replaced the outdoor Wisconsin Olympic Ice Rink, which occupied the site from 1967 to 1991.\n\nAll of the U.S. speedskaters to compete in the past six Winter Olympics have raced or trained at the Pettit Center. The facility has hosted the 2018 and 2022 Olympic Trials and other elite competitions. Over the years, the Pettit has been the home training facility of numerous speedskating greats, including five-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, 1994 gold medalist Dan Jansen and four-time Olympic medalist Shani Davis.\n\nThe Pettit also boasts two international-size hockey rinks and a 443-meter walking and running track. It is the home of multiple local hockey and skating clubs and offers figure skating, speedskating and hockey lessons for children and adults.\n\nThe track is a popular winter training spot for high school, college and adult runners. It hosts track practices, meets and even a 95-lap indoor marathon.\n\nBut, if you’re looking for something a little less athletically intense, the Pettit also has ample public skate hours with skate rentals ... perfect for date night or a fun family activity.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nPecan fingers, snickerdoodles, butterscotch bars and more.\n\nWisconsin residents have been making Christmas treats published in the annual We Energies Cookie Book for nearly a hundred years.\n\nEvery year, the company compiles recipes submitted by residents in a book celebrating themes like military service and hometown favorites.\n\nPicking up a copy of the book has become a Christmas tradition in many Wisconsin households. Some longtime Wisconsinites collect copies for years, passing them down through generations.\n\nThe We Energies Cookie Book was introduced in 1928, back when the company was known as the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co.\n\nThe book was sent to customers to promote the company’s appliances. Through the 1930s, the book grew in popularity and was distributed at the Public Service Building in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nThe book has gone through temporary changes over the years. During World War II, the 1942 edition had 14 recipes for wartime cookies, featuring cookie low in shortening and sugar to accommodate for rationing ingredients during the war.\n\nAfter the 1973 book, the company stopped publishing the book until 1984 due to rising energy costs. The book was published in 1991, 1998, 2002 and restored to its annual printing tradition in 2006. You can find each cookie book digitally archived at we-energies.com/recipes/archive.\n\n-Alex Groth\n\nIf you’ve dined at a Wisconsin supper club or visited a traditional cocktail lounge, chances are you’ve heard of (or enjoyed) the Pink Squirrel. In the family of ice cream drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, the Pink Squirrel has a special Milwaukee connection: it was, as far as anyone can tell, invented at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge, 1579 S. 9th St., in the 1940s.\n\nWith just three ingredients — vanilla ice cream, creme de cacao (chocolate liqueur) and creme de noyaux (almond-flavored liqueur) — the Pink Squirrel is a sweet, nutty, creamy way to drink your dessert.\n\nBoth the rosy hue and nutty flavor can be attributed to the creme de noyaux, a liqueur made from apricot, peach or cherry kernels and originally colored with cochineal.\n\nAs the story goes, Bryant and Edna Sharp opened Bryant’s as a Miller Brewing tied house in 1936. Within a few years, Bryant abandoned the beer hall approach and transformed the business into the first cocktail lounge in Milwaukee and, quite likely, Wisconsin.\n\n“People who knew him described him as quiet and serious, with a talent and passion for mixology,” a history of the bar says of Bryant Sharp. “He also was known for putting together unique flavors, which he sold to cordial companies.”\n\nIt’s only fitting that this classic ice cream cocktail can trace its roots to one of the Dairy State’s favorite drinking establishments.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nSince 1994, drivers traveling north on I-43 have seen the giant eagle and only slightly smaller dove on the wall of a National Avenue building. Back then, Esperanza Unida director Richard Oulahan commissioned artist Reynaldo Hernandez to create a mural to reflect the heritage and aspirations of the south-side community. “The Mural of Peace,” about 80 feet by 150 feet, shows both birds with an olive branch, with a bolt of lightning between them and a background of colored stripes representing flags of different lands.\n\nThe mural is painted not on the building’s cream city brick, but on nearly 300 panels affixed to it. After a few years, weather damaged some panels. Contributors to a fund drive to restore the mural included Tippecanoe Elementary students, who raised more than $566 in a penny drive.\n\nThe Walker’s Point building at 611 W. National Ave. is now the Mercantile Lofts Apartments. During its conversion to living spaces, modifications were made that created windows on that wall for inhabitants but still kept the bold colors of Hernandez’s design visible.\n\n-Jim Higgins\n\nThe Allen-Bradley Clock Tower, located on South 2nd Street and just north of Greenfield Avenue, has been a staple of Milwaukee’s skyline and for decades was the largest four-sided clock tower in the world.\n\nSitting atop what is now Rockwell Automation, the 283-foot-tall clock was revealed on Halloween 1962. The clockworks were built by the Allen-Bradley company, which specialized in electrical controls.\n\nThe tower is four separate clocks running on individual motors. About once a month its gears require greasing, but it’s lit by LED bulbs that rarely need to be replaced.\n\nTwice a year everyone moves their clocks forward or back an hour, usually by pushing a button. Changing the Allen-Bradley clock requires a security guard on the outside with a radio looking up at each face while someone with a special key turns four switches inside a room on the first floor.\n\nIn its early years it was referred to as the “Polish moon” because of the bright display in a predominantly Polish neighborhood. But over time more Mexican immigrants and families moved to the south side and the nickname was changed to the “Mexican moon” to recognize how the neighborhood has changed.\n\nThe clock also illuminated the fight against discrimination in labor in 1968, when the Latino and Black communities joined efforts to fight discriminatory hiring practices at the Allen-Bradley Company.\n\nThe protest was started by Father James E. Groppi. Younger Latino residents took up the cause and more activism against the company continued for another year. The march on Allen-Bradley is considered a success, given the consciousness it created and the progress Latinos in Milwaukee have made in the half-century since.\n\n-Ricardo Torres\n\nFirst things first: The correct pronunciation is poonch-ka, says Joe Parajecki, a chef at the Polish Center in Franklin.\n\nAnd yes, they are similar to jelly-filled donuts, but they’re much richer. Ingredients like sugar, butter, eggs and yeast are put into the dough before giving them up for Lent.\n\nPaczki is traditionally eaten on Fat Tuesday in Milwaukee, though in Poland, it’s actually celebrated on the Thursday before Lent.\n\n“You can’t believe the lines in Poland to get paczki on Fat Thursday. People eat a dozen or more each,” Parajecki said.\n\nMilwaukee is one of the “capital cities of Polish America,” according to Milwaukee historian John Gurda. Two decades after the city was founded, 30 families organized the first Polish Catholic congregation in urban America.\n\nA traditional paczki is the size of a walnut and doesn’t look like a donut at all, Parajecki said. It’s sweet dough wrapped around a prune or filled with rose jam, which is “a very acquired taste. It’s like eating a jar of perfume.”\n\nPrune and raspberry are the most common fillings in America, but there are newer flavors like Nutella and lemon. Parajecki is amazed by how many people who celebrate paczki, even those who aren’t Polish.\n\nHe doesn’t care about the paczki vs. donut discussion — more important is tying it to a memory, like sitting around grandma’s table.\n\n“We’re not eating it to debate those things. We’re eating it to remember, we’re eating it to have a good time.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nYou just got through TSA at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. You’re missing a shoe, toiletries are bursting from your carry-on, and where is that boarding pass again?\n\nA sign past the security checkpoint: Recombobulation Area. An invitation and a space to put your things back in order.\n\nIt all started in 2008, when former airport director Barry Bateman told the sign shop he had a great idea.\n\nHe was told “recombobulation” wasn’t an actual word, the airport’s director of public affairs and marketing Harold Mester said. Bateman knew that.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s try to make this a little bit more fun during this stressful experience. If someone gets a chuckle when they go through the checkpoint, then we’ve done our job.’”\n\nAs far as Mester is aware, Milwaukee is the only airport to use the “recombobulation” phrase. “Recomposure” is the more technical term, but as Mester pointed out, “that’s an actual word.”\n\nThe American Dialect Society once declared “recombobulation” the most creative word of the year. And the term has inspired other branding efforts in Milwaukee, from billboards to beer.\n\nIt’s also the namesake of a blog by Dan Shafer. As he put it, recombobulation is the “opposite of discombobulation.” He is often tagged in the many selfies taken in front of the sign.\n\nThe sign represents Milwaukee’s sense of humor about itself, Shafer said.\n\n“It’s just one of those quintessentially Milwaukee types of things. It’s just quirky and weird enough and resonates with people.”\n\n-Hope Karnopp\n\nWalk into a Milwaukee supper club or bar on a Friday night and you’ll likely see bartenders lining up rocks glasses and filling each with maraschino cherries, orange slices and a dash of sugar. Next comes a shot of soda water and a muddler. Then, the brandy.\n\nThe Old Fashioned cocktail isn’t supposed to be made with brandy, but like anything in Wisconsin, we’ve taken an idea and made it our own. And boy, do we own it.\n\nDuring an average weekend at the Five O’ Clock Steakhouse on West State Street, bartenders serve more than 100 brandy Old Fashioneds, general manager Hegel Terron told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nDuring the week, the daily average probably tops at 75, he said.\n\nAt the Packing House supper club on East Layton Avenue, general manager Chris Wiken said he’s ordering two cases of Korbel brandy per week.\n\nThe vast majority of customers are asking for brandy Old Fashioneds sweet, Wiken said. But in recent years, customers are getting a bit more picky about which brandy they want – ordering Milwaukee’s Central Standard or even comedian Charlie Berens’ spirit.\n\nOn a good Friday night, the Packing House is filling a couple hundred rocks glasses with Wisconsin’s favorite cocktail. In a year’s time, that’s tens of thousands, Wiken said.\n\n“I cannot keep Korbel on hand. It just flies out the door,” he said. “Friday night is probably when we sell the most because the pairing with the fish fry is a really good pairing.”\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, there are a few ways to give yourself away. First: Order a bourbon Old Fashioned instead of brandy sweet. Second: Wear a Cardinals hat. Third: Ask for directions to the nearest water fountain.\n\nInexplicably, public water fountains here are called bubblers and pretty much only here. There are some in Rhode Island, for some reason, but the vast, vast majority of the nation adopted “drinking fountains” and “water fountains.”\n\nMilwaukee appears to be ground zero for the use of bubbler, according to UW-Madison’s Dictionary of American Regional English. Its origins are fuzzy but may be tied to its use by Kohler Co., one of Wisconsin’s most famous brands – a manufacturer of faucets among other water-related products.\n\nThe company in 1914 promoted a water fountain created by Kohler as being fitted with a “continuous flow bubbler,” according to the UW-Madison dictionary.\n\nA former dictionary editor in 2015 told Wisconsin Public Radio that “bubbler” was used especially in the southeastern area of the state starting in the mid 1910s. More than a century later, we’re still using bubblers.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nSundays in Milwaukee have a smell: buttery, fresh-baked rolls.\n\nAfter church, it’s tradition to pick up what’s known as hot ham and rolls – an end-of-weekend feast with origins in the cream city’s German or Polish roots, depending on which bakery owner you speak to.\n\nFor less than $30 at Grebe Bakery, for example, you can get three pounds of ham, 18 rolls and two pounds of potato salad.\n\nThe meal is part of Milwaukee’s identity, so much so that former Gov. Scott Walker made it part of his politico persona along with other attributes Walker promoted to assure voters he was as Wisconsin as they were.\n\nHe tweeted nearly 20 times about procuring hot ham and rolls from now-shuttered Fattoni’s deli after church in Wauwatosa during his first term as governor.\n\nBrian Schwellinger, president of Badger Ham, which provides the hams for many bakeries’ meal deals, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2021 the hot ham and rolls tradition is likely rooted in religion.\n\n“There were so many churches that the church tradition was a strong part of the community, and after service is when you had your first meal of the day,” Schwellinger said.\n\n-Molly Beck\n\nThe Great Lakes may seem like an limitless resource, but the world’s largest surface freshwater system faces major threats from pollution, climate change, invasive species and overexploitation.\n\nAnd to understand and protect it, scientists need to be out on the water.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences has made its mark on Great Lakes research. It’s the only graduate school of freshwater sciences in the country and one of only three in the world.\n\nUW-Milwaukee’s main research vessel, the Neeskay, is the only research vessel out on the lakes year-round.\n\nBefore the Neeskay started powering scientific expeditions in 1970, it was an Army T-boat used during the Korean War. Its name comes from the Ho-Chunk word for “pure, clean water.”\n\nScientists use the Neeskay to study algae blooms, invasive quagga and zebra mussels, and microbes that live out in the lakes. It’s also used to deploy buoys that monitor weather and lake characteristics, like temperature and nutrients.\n\nBut the Neeskay, along with a fleet of small boats, are only just the start. The university has been raising money since 2016 to build the Maggi Sue, which will become the most technologically advanced freshwater research ship in the country.\n\nThe Maggi Sue is expected to open many doors in understanding what’s going on out in the Great Lakes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe Bucks’ mascot has delighted crowds with dunks and stunts, from the Milwaukee Arena to the Bradley Center to Fiserv Forum, for almost 50 years.\n\nBango made his debut in the team’s 1977-78 home opener — which pitted the Bucks against the Los Angeles Lakers two years after NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar left Milwaukee for L.A.\n\nNamed for the call the team’s original radio announcer, Eddie Doucette, made when players made a long-range basket, Bango was the moniker chosen by fans in a contest.\n\nIn the decades since, he’s gone through several makeovers and celebrated many milestones.\n\nIn 1984, he got his first car (it’s unclear whether he was old enough to drive; we’re not sure how deer aging equates here). He got married in 2002, and welcomed Bango Jr. in 2005. Two years later, Bango and Bango Jr. first appeared in their inflatable forms. 2010 was a big year for Bango: he nailed a few new dunks and was honored as the NBA Mascot of the Year.\n\nThe next few years brought more cervid celebrations: Cartoon Network’s “Most Awesome Mascot,” a human hamster ball dunk and a featured role on the Hulu “Behind the Mask” documentary. There were also a few mishaps along the way — a torn ACL and a broken rim during a Badgers halftime show.\n\nWhether he’s wearing a sweater or a full uniform with the number 68 (for the team’s first season), doing acrobatics on the court or making appearances in the community, Bango is Milwaukee’s most dominant deer.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nOne call, that’s all.\n\nIt’s not a particularly unusual slogan. Milwaukee isn’t home to the only law firm that has used it. But say those words around Milwaukee, and you’ll get immediate recognition, and probably a smile. Is it weird that simply saying the slogan or name of a personal injury lawyer, albeit a locally famous one, can cultivate ... joy?\n\nDavid Gruber, the lawyer in question, has been using the slogan in TV advertisements since the late 1990s, born from a collaboration with a Dallas media company.\n\nHe looks into the camera and punctuates every ad with those famous four words, a catchphrase that has become the dictum around which his entire brand has been constructed.\n\nThe celebrity lawyer can be found in the first few rows of Milwaukee sporting events and has partnered with just about every major sports operation in the city, a nod to his lengthy interest in athletics.\n\nAnd it’s not hard to score a “Gruber Law Office” T-shirt at a sporting event or at street fairs around the city, the perfect giveaway to spread the Gruber gospel and let everyone around you know how Milwaukee you are.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIn Milwaukee, the herald of winter’s thaw is not that growing patch of green on a lawn or the first magnolia blossom peeling open or that last crusty pile of parking lot snow.\n\nNo: It’s the first aroma of match meeting propane, that sizzle of cold meat on hot grates, the collective tower of smoke rising above the interchange at American Family Field.\n\nIt’s spring. It’s grilling season.\n\nYou don’t have to be the one grilling to enjoy its benefits. The first sunny day in March when it’s light past 5 p.m. — that’s when it happens. The first smells of a neighbor lighting charcoal and laying down some hamburger patties.\n\n“Someone’s grilling,” you say, and you smile.\n\nGrill smells permeate the air in Milwaukee from spring to fall. On a summer day, you can drive around with the windows down and you know when the neighbors are gathering. You can be sure there’s a cold beer in a koozy and the charcoal is heating up.\n\nAnd then there’s the tailgate, that communal grilling session. Many urban ballparks have parking garages or no parking at all, thus no opportunity to truly enjoy the baseball experience. But the tailgate endures in Milwaukee. On a sunny day (or rainy or snowy, we’re hardy people), the American Family Field parking lots are packed with canopies, games of corn hole and folding chairs all huddled around one thing: the grill.\n\n-Lainey Seyler\n\nAre you a “call an ace” player or a “picker and jack of diamond” player when you sit down at the sheepshead table? And if you don’t know what those phrases mean, you probably aren’t familiar with “leaster,” “re-crack” or “schmear.” To know the card game is to speak a certain kind of Milwaukee dialect.\n\nThe trick-taking game often features five players but has its share of variants, with different rules and terminology for different parts of the state. But this isn’t a pastime that’s achieved a high level of popularity outside the state’s borders.\n\nLike Milwaukee, sheepshead’s roots are deeply German — the game is Schakopf in its native country, and the unofficial history involves disgruntled peasants inventing the game that gave kings a lower ranking. Sheepshead arrived in Milwaukee with a large population of German immigrants, many of whom worked in brewing.\n\nThe card game’s patron saint, Bob Strupp, published “How To Play ‘Winning’ 5 Handed Sheepshead” in 1983. The lifelong Milwaukeean attended Common Council meetings to advocate that the game should be declared Milwaukee’s official card game, a campaign that proved successful.\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Glendale has claimed to serve as home to the largest sheepshead tournament in the world; a nurse from Kewaskum won in 2024.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere was a time when Milwaukee had earned the title as “The Bowling Capital of America.”\n\nEvolving from German “kegling,” German-Americans helped raise the game’s popularity in the states, and a city like Milwaukee with a deep German heritage was quick to adopt. But as nationwide popularity fell, Milwaukee’s bowling culture wasn’t ... well, uh, spared.\n\nThe United States Bowling Congress, which once called Greendale home, moved to Texas in 2008. The PBA Tour, once sponsored by Miller Brewing, stopped making the city a regular tour stop after 1990, bowling centers closed and WTMJ’s wildly popular “Bowling With the Champs” TV series, which made local celebrities out of top bowlers and served as a precursor to reality competition television, ended after 41 years in 1995.\n\nBut bowling’s history remains visible around the city and state. Milwaukee tavern The Holler House houses the oldest sanctioned bowling alley in the United States, and the miniature version of the sport still has a place at legendary Koz’s Mini Bowl, home to “the last duckpin bowling in the U.S.” The Vulcan Corporation in northern Wisconsin became a major manufacturer of bowling pins.\n\nAnd the PBA even returned for a stop in Wauwatosa in 2023.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nIt’s the floor that made Milwaukee famous.\n\nDesigned for $27,500 by New York pop artist Robert Indiana — a man with the perfect name to match the flamboyance of the masterpiece — the MECCA floor was a controversial addition in 1977. The Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center (known today as the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, but then abbreviated as the MECCA) served as home to the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette men’s basketball team. Marquette basketball, known for its eclectic uniforms and the fiery personality of recently retired head coach Al McGuire, was the perfect match for the look.\n\nThe floor featured two giant Ms consuming either half of the court, somewhat hidden in the two-toned yellow paint scheme, a red bull’s eye at center court and blue lettering for “MECCA” wrapped twice around the center circle. Dark red for the lanes, dark blue for the sideline and dark green for the perimeter.\n\nThe gaudy floor didn’t quite fit everyone’s aesthetic tastes immediately (including new MU head coach Hank Raymonds), but it was a hit with plenty of fans (and Bucks coach Don Nelson). It became part of the Milwaukee color palette until the Bucks moved into the Bradley Center in 1988. The Bucks re-created the floor for a “Return to the MECCA” game in 2017, a return to the building that harbored the 1971 NBA champion and 1977 NCAA champion.\n\nIndiana rose to fame because of his “LOVE” sculpture, but the MECCA floor remains a distinctly Milwaukee concept.\n\n-JR Radcliffe\n\nThere are many places around Milwaukee where you can take a drink of history, including many brewery tours.\n\nBut there is also a non-alcoholic option nestled between Wentworth Avenue and Superior Street in Bay View:\n\nThe Pryor Avenue Iron Well, a source of drinking water since 1882.\n\nOriginally drilled to provide drinking water and fire protection, it’s the last surviving public well in the city, according to the Historical Preservation Committee. The city named it a historic structure in 1987.\n\nWhile the well is just a short walk from Lake Michigan, the water actually comes from an aquifer nearly 120 feet underground.\n\nThe iron-rich water tastes a bit different than city water. The water is clear with a distinct metallic taste. Sometimes there might be a faint smell of sulfur.\n\nElevated levels of strontium, a natural element found in bedrock, were detected in 2015. But according to the EPA, the levels are only an issue for sensitive populations after drinking the water over the course of a lifetime.\n\nOverall the water is safe to drink, according to Milwaukee Water Works and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn fact, the well was a lifeline for many during the 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak that ravaged the municipal water supply.\n\nSo fill a jug or take a sip from the bubbler. Just ignore the penny-like metallic notes.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nThe drive along the Hoan Bridge offers some of the best views of the Milwaukee skyline and Lake Michigan.\n\nAnd if the wind blows in the right direction, it’s also where you can get a good whiff of Milwaukee’s signature funky scent.\n\nNo, Eau de Milwaukee isn’t hops, brats or cheese curds. It’s Milorganite, a lawn and garden fertilizer made from our very own wastewater.\n\nThe Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District started making Milorganite – named after Milwaukee organic nitrogen – at the city’s sewage treatment plant on Jones Island in 1926.\n\nThe city used a new method to treat wastewater, called the activated sludge method, which mixed microbes with sewage and air to remove 95% of the bacteria from the city’s sewage and 90% of the solids.\n\nAfter wastewater enters the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility, microbes are added that feast on the organic material. When the microbes die they settle to the bottom, leaving clean water above that is returned to Lake Michigan.\n\nWater is squeezed out of the microbes before they are dried and turned into pellets that become the nitrogen-rich fertilizer sold around the country.\n\nTurning this waste into fertilizer has kept 10 billion pounds of waste out of landfills since 1926, according to the sewerage district.\n\n-Caitlin Looby\n\nA mark of Milwaukee’s annual celebration of Bastille Day, the 43-foot Eiffel Tower that appears each year in Cathedral Square Park is a testament to the city’s determination.\n\nThe tower has had to go through several rounds of repairs and reinforcement to keep up its yearly appearances. There have been a few years that an inflatable Eiffel Tower took the real one’s place, but it always returns, as it did in 2023 after a year of repairs.\n\nThe tower was initially built as part of an indoor department store display in the late 1980s, possibly in Minneapolis, according to a 2022 OnMilwaukee report.\n\nThe tower was never supposed to be permanent, and it definitely wasn’t meant to be assembled and disassembled each year for its appearance at the festival. But that won’t stop the tower, nor the organizers of the Bastille Day celebration, who are asking for donations to complete more repairs and restoration.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is far from the only French-themed activity of the weekend. There’s also the Storm the Bastille 5K run and walk, in addition to can-can dancers and plenty of French fare. The celebration is meant to honor the storming of the Bastille, the 19th-century French prison, an event that helped to start the French Revolution.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nGo into about any Milwaukee restaurant, tavern or even the corner bar on a Friday after work, and you’re likely to see diners enjoying fish alongside a classic Wisconsin Old Fashioned.\n\nThe crisp crunch of walleye, perch, cod or maybe even bluegill, paired with some type of potato, coleslaw, tartar sauce, a lemon wedge and perhaps a slice of rye bread.\n\nFish fries are actually so popular in Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers declared Feb. 16, 2024, as Friday Fish Fry Day, honoring the history of the meal. According to his proclamation, the fish fry became popular when a large population of Catholic European immigrants settled in Wisconsin in the 1800s and needed something meat-free to eat on Fridays during Lent.\n\nThen, during Prohibition, the meal helped to keep Wisconsin’s breweries and taverns alive, too, further cementing the tradition.\n\nToday, fish fries in Milwaukee and throughout Wisconsin serve as a weekly opportunity to gather with friends and family at your favorite establishment, catch up and swap stories over a plate of deep-fried fish.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nA piece of Milwaukee’s baseball history, Bernie Brewer’s Chalet was once one of the crowning jewels at County Stadium. Bernie Brewer would slide out of the chalet and into a giant stein of beer after every home run or if the Brewers won the game, setting the stage for celebration.\n\nNow, the chalet is a part of another popular Milwaukee stop: Lakefront Brewery. It’s a stop on the brewery’s tour through the facility, and now it can even be booked for a romantic dinner for two, overlooking the kettles of the brewery.\n\nLakefront Brewery was born in 1987 out of something distinctly Wisconsin: some 55-gallon stainless steel drums and used dairy equipment. Jim and Russ Klisch, the founders, sold one barrel of beer to a tavern within rolling distance of the brewery.\n\nLakefront has come a long way. Now housed at 1872 N. Commerce St., the brewery has produced as many as 46,848 barrels in one year (2017) and offers 20 different beers across 30 states, and even some other countries, according to the brewery’s website. The brewery also offers tours for over 80,000 people a year, and was the first to offer beer before, during and after the tour.\n\n-Laura Schulte\n\nIf you’re not from Wisconsin, this food item may repulse you – or at least make you do a double take.\n\nBut here in Milwaukee, it’s a delicacy.\n\nWe’re talking about the cannibal sandwich: a base of rye bread topped with fresh raw beef, chopped onion and a little salt and pepper. It’s deeply rooted in the state’s history and still enjoyed today.\n\nVersions of the sandwich also exist in Germany, where it’s called mett or hackepeter. The idea is thought to have been brought over by German immigrants to Wisconsin when they arrived and began to establish cattle farms, giving them easy access to fresh meat.\n\nToday, it’s still a popular tradition served during holidays and family gatherings — though not without a little scrutiny. Eating raw meat, after all, is a health risk. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reminded residents of as much in a 2020 tweet that went viral as those unfamiliar with the sandwich gawked.\n\nBut those who enjoy it are likely to keep paying homage to their heritage. Some Milwaukee delis and butcher shops sell thousands of pounds of high-grade raw beef around the holidays to eager customers.\n\nTasty or mildly terrifying, it’s one of the city’s cultural staples.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nIf you’re looking for a home away from home, look no further than Mr. Perkins Family Restaurant.\n\nWhile the fried chicken and collard greens are rave-worthy, the real showstopper at this 55-year-old establishment is the customer service.\n\nWhen the restaurant, located on the corner of West Atkinson Avenue and North 20th Street, opened in 1969, owners Willie Sr. and Hilda Perkins created a family feeling that brings in regulars and even politicians and celebrities like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley.\n\nA staple for the Black community in Milwaukee, the restaurant serves comforting southern flavors that can be hard to find here in the Midwest.\n\nWhen Willie Perkins Jr. took over in 1999, he continued creating that feeling, filling customers in on the latest news about the Green Bay Packers and the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nWhen Willie died in 2010, his wife, Cherry, took over. Now, Cherry and a small team — her sister, her son and one other worker who might as well be family — continue the legacy, remembering regulars’ names and orders and creating community in addition to delicious food.\n\n-Zoe Takaki\n\nIt’s synonymous with Green Bay Packers fandom today, but the Cheesehead made its first appearance at a 1987 Milwaukee Brewers game — a completely, ahem, organic creation.\n\nThe legend is well-known now: Ralph Bruno went to his mother’s south-side Milwaukee home to help her reupholster a couch. When he took it apart, he thought the foam inside looked like cheese — so, naturally, he cut a piece into a triangle, burned some holes into it and spray-painted it yellow. It was a self-deprecating homage to an insult Wisconsin sports fans received from their neighbors in Illinois.\n\nTo Bruno’s friends’ surprise, the hats were a hit. So he made more, and sold them from a garbage bag at the next game he attended. That led to neighborhood retail sales and, eventually, the creation of Foamation Inc. — and a robust variety of Cheesehead variations including cowboy hats, baseball caps and koozies. The Packers acquired Foamation in 2023, solidifying the relationship just like a good curd.\n\nOver time, the Cheesehead has inspired song parodies and been featured in a Lil’ Wayne tribute to the Green & Gold (er, Yellow). It’s been worn or displayed by famous figures including George W. Bush, Jodie Foster, Phoebe Bridgers and John F. Kennedy Jr. And despite Chicago Bears fans’ efforts to shred them with their answer — the Graterhead — Cheeseheads are here to stay.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nTwo parallel metal tracks stretch across the roads in downtown Milwaukee, soaking up the heat of the summer and the frost of the winter. You wait a bit, a streetcar the length of two buses slides slowly toward you.\n\nYou wonder if it’s automatic, running robotically and beeping like that, until you see a conductor in the front seat and you let out the breath you’d been holding — it will stop at traffic lights and behind cars. On the side of the car golden letters read in all caps: “THE HOP.”\n\nThe Hop is a fixed-transit network that gives a ride to more than 1,000 people a day, going to various destinations in downtown Milwaukee. Its route stretches from Veterans Park to Milwaukee Public Market and expanded to the lakefront in spring 2024.\n\nThe Hop is a relatively new addition to the city, having started running in 2018. But it’s a continuation of a long history of streetcars in the city — the first electric streetcar started giving rides in 1890 and for decades was the primary form of transportation.\n\nToday, The Hop has become a staple of downtown life, whether or not you ride it.\n\n-Eva Wen\n\nIf Milwaukee was going to have a mountain, it’s fitting that that mountain would be made of the thing that keeps the city moving during its cold, icy winters: road salt.\n\nAlong with the pungent aroma of Milorganite, the gigantic salt piles are likely what most Milwaukeeans associate with the city’s Jones Island, once home to a commercial fishing village of Polish immigrants.\n\nToday, the island holds tens of thousands of tons of road salt delivered to the Port of Milwaukee for use in melting icy streets, highways and interstates across Wisconsin.\n\nIn recent years, concern has grown about excess road salt washing off of streets and into nearby bodies of water, including Lake Michigan.\n\nRoughly 2.2 billion pounds of chloride (a component of road salt) flush into the lake each year, according to a December 2021 study. And while the size of the lake helps dilute the salty pollutant, smaller tributaries aren’t so lucky. In the Milwaukee River basin alone, for example, over 100 miles of waterway are impaired by chloride, some with levels several times that which can be toxic to fish and aquatic life.\n\nMany municipalities and private businesses, including some in the Milwaukee area, have made adjustments to reduce their salt use in the name of protecting freshwater, including brining, where salt is mixed with water before being applied to roads.\n\n-Madeline Heim\n\nA Milwaukee sub sandwich staple, Cousins Subs began in 1972 when cousins Bill Specht and Jim Sheppard opened their first shop at 60th Street and Silver Spring Drive to “bring their favorite style of sub sandwich from the East Coast to their new hometown of Milwaukee,” the company’s official story reads.\n\nCousins offers classics like the Italian Special, Pepperoni Melt and Tuna, plus specialties like Wisconsin Cheese Steak. And in Milwaukee, Cousins stands apart from national sandwich chains — not only for its local roots but its very-us offerings like Wisconsin mac and cheese, shakes and fried cheese curds.\n\nThe Cousins sandwich — carrying the slogan “Better bread. Better subs” — is so popular the company had to cancel a free sub promotion in early 2024 when restaurants couldn’t keep up with the overwhelming response.\n\n-Erik S. Hanley\n\nWouldn’t you like to go to Orlando in mid-February? Not for Disney, but for the greenery, the smell, the sense that things are alive.\n\nThat’s what you’ll find in the Tropical Dome — where you can sit in the sun with a book in hand, no matter the season. Roll up your sleeves, find a bench and relax.\n\nIn contrast, if you’re always too hot, the Desert Dome stays 50 degrees through the winter. If you have kids with you, think Show Dome and occasional choo-choos.\n\nThe three beehive-shaped Domes, aka Mitchell Park Horticultural Conservatory, sometimes seem the forgotten child of Milwaukee attractions. They’re fighting for their future. Yet even the common name – Domes – has a Milwaukee humility about it.\n\nWith more than 1,800 plant species, cleverly described with signage, the Domes are worth a walk.\n\nSince Lady Bird Johnson dedicated the Domes in the fall of 1965, other accolades have followed. In 2017, the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave “National Treasure” status to the Domes.\n\nAnd the Domes have a characteristic that Milwaukeeans love: They’re cheap.\n\nThe priciest admission costs $9, and parking is free, unlike at the stadium, the zoo, or almost the entire downtown.\n\n-Pete Sullivan\n\nBratwurst. Polish. Italian. Hot Dog. Chorizo.\n\nBrewers fans have been cheering for one sausage or another during their race at the bottom of the sixth inning for more than 30 years. What started as a cartoon competition on a County Stadium scoreboard made its way to Miller Park (now American Family Field) as a treasured Milwaukee tradition.\n\nThe real-life Racing Sausages debuted June 27, 1993, and gave rise to live-action mascot races throughout Major League Baseball, such as racing presidents and pierogis. The idea to take the links from the scoreboard to the field came from Michael Dillon, who worked as a graphic designer with McDill Design at the time, and their first appearance was a surprise to almost everyone in the ballpark.\n\nThe matchup of 7-foot-tall encased meats was sponsored by Klement’s until 2018, when Johnsonville took the reins.\n\nThe sausages have had their ups and downs over time. Among the wurst: In 2003, then-Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Randall Simon whacked the Italian Sausage with a bat, causing the Hot Dog to tumble as well. Both finished the race, thanks to an assist from the Polish (the Bratwurst won). There was also the time in 2013 that the Italian Sausage’s casing (er, costume) was stolen (and ultimately returned) in Cedarburg. A few years later, Hot Dog took a tumble and brought Chorizo and Bratwurst along with him. And as recently as the team’s 2024 season opener, Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton narrowly missed being taken out by Bratwurst.\n\nNo matter the wiener, Milwaukee will always love its Racing Sausages.\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nLegend has it George Webb first predicted Milwaukee’s baseball team would win 12 games in a row back in the 1940s – and maybe even hinted that his namesake restaurant would give out free hamburgers to celebrate the winning streak.\n\nDecades passed before his prophecy came true, but in April 1987, the Milwaukee Brewers finally pulled off the feat – and some 168,194 people lined up outside George Webb Restaurants for free burgers. It’s hard to describe how big of a deal it was to those who didn’t experience it firsthand, but trust us, there are few things us frugal Wisconsinites love more than free stuff. Combine that with baseball and burgers, and it basically felt like a street festival.\n\nWhile most people ate their free burgers, some decided to save the historic freebies for posterity. One man even had his bronzed for his father. Others threw theirs in basement freezers, only to find them decades later. (This reporter would like to apologize to her older brother, Paul, for throwing out his 20-year-old frozen burger instead of bronzing it.)\n\nThe Brewers did it again in 2018, and for only the second time in Milwaukee history people lined up to celebrate and claim their free burgers.\n\nEven when it’s not promising free burgers, George Webb is a beloved burger joint open 24 hours a day. Still, any long Brewers winning streak definitely starts to feel like a free-burger watch party.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nBob Uecker didn’t sign a broadcasting contract with the Milwaukee Brewers until 2021.\n\nBefore then, it was handshake agreements with owners Bud Selig and Mark Attanasio.\n\nUeck tries not to take himself too seriously. It’s part of the reason why he is such a revered figure among Americans, specifically Milwaukee natives and Brewers fans.\n\n“Mr. Baseball” being the butt of the joke is why the “Uecker seats” named in his honor are considered the best worst seats in baseball. “I must be in the front row,” Uecker said to a stadium usher in a mid-’80s Miller Lite commercial who told him to move to where his ticket was located — way up high.\n\nUecker seats used to be sold for as little as $1, but there was a catch: Fans would need to wait hours before first pitch at the box office to get their hands on the tickets, and the seats were less than desired — up in the nosebleeds with an obstructed view, but near Uecker’s statue.\n\nUecker, 91, has been speaking into his microphone for the Brewers radio broadcast since 1971. He wouldn’t want to hear it, but his mic serves as a symbolic gold standard for not only sportscasters but also the entertainment figures we allow into our living rooms.\n\nHe’s been a regular guest on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” hosted “Saturday Night Live” in 1984 and had roles in Hollywood films — his delivery of “Juuust a bit outside” in the 1989 cult classic film “Major League” (filmed at County Stadium) endures today.\n\nUltimately, the reason he finally signed a contract with the Brewers was because he lost benefits from the Screen Actors Guild.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nWhen she was a teenager, UW-Milwaukee professor Chia Youyee Vang remembers how her mother and aunt wrapped a long, purple cloth into a turban around her head. Then decorated with a black-and-white striped ribbon, it was one piece of the elaborate traditional clothing Vang would wear to celebrate the Hmong New Year.\n\nToday, the phuam txoo suab is more hat than headwrap. It’s often sold pre-wrapped, and it might be embroidered with silver coins or shiny beads. At annual New Year celebrations at Wisconsin State Fair Park, it’s a common headpiece for girls and women.\n\nThe headwrap’s evolution parallels Milwaukee’s Hmong community in some ways. Today’s young generation fuses American culture with the traditions of their parents and grandparents, who fled Laos as refugees in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nOlder immigrants worry about language and culture fading. But they also see their descendants blossoming: earning degrees, running businesses and buying homes in neighborhoods across the area.\n\nMilwaukee County is home to about 13,000 Hmong, census data shows. That’s nearly one-third of all Asian residents in the county.\n\nLike the Germans, Poles and Italians before them, the Hmong have made their mark on Milwaukee. The ways they’ll express and share their traditions with the city will only become more intricate as their roots deepen.\n\n-Sophie Carson\n\nOpening a box of Italian cookies from Peter Sciortino Bakery has an undeniable sweetness – like a mix of happy family memories and buttery goodness.\n\nSince Peter Sciortino and his wife, Grace, opened the bakery in 1947, it has grown into a beloved fixture on Brady Street. It opened just one year after Glorioso’s Italian Market, another legendary business that still calls Brady Street home. Both first became institutions as Italians began moving north from the Third Ward to the east side neighborhood decades ago, and have since become a tradition for families throughout Milwaukee.\n\nThe aroma of fresh-baked bread and cookies typically surrounds Peter Sciortino Bakery, and inside, cannoli is made fresh with each order.\n\nLuckily the cookies are sold by the pound, so there’s no need to choose between cimino, biscotti, amaretti, chocolate mezza luna, or any of the other varieties – just make sure you get a big enough box to try as many as possible.\n\n-Mary Spicuzza\n\nWhere Russell Avenue meets Superior Street in Bay View, an understated brown sign pays homage to one of the most significant sites in Milwaukee’s history: a 19th-century iron mill where a march for an eight-hour work day turned deadly.\n\nThe historical marker recalls the events of May 5, 1886: the Bay View Massacre.\n\nThat year, labor organizations nationwide were demanding an eight-hour work day, and they wanted it by May 1. Many Milwaukeeans were working 10-hour days, six days a week for paltry wages, Milwaukee historian John Gurda noted in his book “The Making of Milwaukee.”\n\nAs companies balked at the demand, strikes grew. By May 3, about half of Milwaukee’s men were on strike, Gurda found. They marched through the city, urging more workers to join them. Panicked officials called in militia from across the state after police were unable to “quell the disturbance,” the Milwaukee Journal reported.\n\nOn May 4, tension mounted at the Bay View mill where executives refused the eight-hour demand. Militia forcefully dispersed a crowd of protesters.\n\nOn the morning of May 5, about 1,500 marchers returned to the mill. When they were about 200 yards out, the militia fired. Among the seven dead was a 12-year-old boy.\n\nThe next day, streets were deserted. Local officials conferred about how to prevent “socialistic agitation,” deciding to arrest as many demonstrators as they could, the Journal reported.\n\nLabor leaders, meanwhile, had public opinion on their side. They turned their focus to winning elections.\n\nThat year, the labor-backed People’s Party of Wisconsin won elections up and down the ballot, with priorities including progressive taxes, child labor restrictions, and arbitration of labor disputes, Gurda wrote. While socialist leaders initially supported that party, they later split and ran their own candidates, launching Milwaukee’s socialist era in 1910.\n\n-Rory Linnane\n\nYou just moved to Milwaukee. You are sitting in your bungalow in Bay View and staring at the blank walls. You are a full-fledged grown-up, so those leftover posters from your college dorm don’t cut it anymore.\n\nFor generations, the Milwaukee neighborhood posters have provided an easy and classy way to decorate your new space. They were unveiled in 1983 by the City of Milwaukee’s Discover Milwaukee program, with colorful, eye-catching artwork by Jan Kotowicz of local landmarks, like the lower east side’s Oriental Theatre and Washington Park’s bandshell. Wait, what is Pigsville? Thankfully, local historian John Gurda provided illuminating text on the back of the posters about each neighborhood. The posters even popped up in “Wayne’s World” to lend authenticity to Alice Cooper’s Milwaukee-centric cameo.\n\nBest of all, the posters follow the egalitarian spirit of the city. The original run of 21 neighborhoods initially cost just $2 apiece. Now there are 39 options available from Historic Milwaukee, Inc., including one with all the neighborhoods, for only $10. There’s no excuse for those blank walls.\n\n-Ben Steele\n\nAmerica’s Black Holocaust Museum is the first and only museum of its kind in the U.S. It’s an unflinching look at more than 400 years of slavery, dehumanization, lynching and mass incarceration of Black Americans.\n\nThe dream for the museum began as a small collection in Dr. James Cameron’s basement. In 1930, when he was 16, Cameron narrowly survived a lynching in Marion, Indiana. He spent the rest of his life in Milwaukee collecting photos, artifacts and books that shed light on the histories of African Americans. He regularly welcomed guests into his home to learn this history.\n\nThe museum moved to its first official location in the Sultan Muhammad Islamic Center. Its grand opening was Juneteenth Day in 1988.\n\nCameron passed away in 2006. The museum subsequently moved buildings and briefly closed, and now resides at 401 W. North Ave., part of a redevelopment project in the heart of Bronzeville called the Griot — a West African term for “storyteller” — in honor of Cameron.\n\nThe museum starts in Africa in 300 CE, long before Europeans arrived, and ends with issues impacting Black people today, like police brutality and mass incarceration — covering the 16 generations of slavery in the U.S., reconstruction, 100 years of Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA tree with branches stretching along the ceiling pays homage to the powerful song “Strange Fruit,” made popular by artist Billie Holiday, that fearlessly protested the widespread lynchings of Black Americans.\n\n-Gina Castro\n\nPabst Brewing Co. shut down its Milwaukee operations in 1996. But the huge “Pabst” sign that’s stretched far above West Juneau Avenue for several decades has remained a constant — even as the former brewery was redeveloped over the past decade or so into offices, housing, a craft brewery and other new uses.\n\nThe sign is attached to an iron footbridge that is anchored by Pabst’s former malt house, now The Malt House apartments, and the old brew house, now the Brewhouse Inn & Suites. The glowing red sign has undergone repairs in recent years, with the iron bridge’s restoration being completed this spring, according to Erin Stenum, manager of the neighborhood improvement district at the former Pabst complex, now known as The Brewery. Ein Prosit!\n\n-Tom Daykin\n\nThe soundtrack to most city parks includes the ping of a bouncing basketball, the tinny reverb of a faraway stereo or the sizzle of a grill fired up for sausages.\n\nYou’ll hear those at Burnham Park, too, but there’s another layer to the score: the soothing hum of a handful of taco trucks parked just outside, and the chatter from hungry hoards waiting in the wings for a carne asada taco, a lengua huarache or a cooling horchata on a hot summer night.\n\nThese food trucks are part of the fabric of Burnham Park. Beyond the neighborhood, the south side is dotted with family-owned fleets carrying specialties all their own, parked on Historic Mitchell Street, West Lincoln Avenue, West Becher Street and across the neighborhoods tucked in between.\n\nYou could stop at one to satisfy a craving or you could go on a full expedition, grabbing an al pastor taco shaved straight off the spit at La Guelaguetza (go on Wednesdays to nab ’em for a dollar each), head to Marta’s Tamales Food Truck for a juicy pambazo dipped in red pepper sauce, and finish at Isa’s Ice Cream for a creamy scoop of mango or passionfruit nieve de garrafa to round out the night.\n\nThey’re the tastes of the neighborhood and the passion from a piece of Milwaukee with undeniable flavor all its own.\n\n-Rachel Bernhard\n\nThey only surface for one week.\n\nBut for that one week, they’re everywhere.\n\nThey are the ribbons worn by Northwestern Mutual agents during the company’s annual gathering in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nEach summer, the Milwaukee insurance and financial services company brings more than 12,000 employees and agents together for a week of meetings and events; ground zero is usually the Baird Center and Fiserv Forum, but they can be seen all over downtown.\n\nAnd every agent wears a nametag lanyard with attached ribbons denoting sales goals achieved, landmarks passed, accomplishments reached.\n\nSome agents have two or three ribbons. A few sport a ribbon that goes down to the floor.\n\nTo outsiders, the ribbons might look like scout badges or sashes from a secret society — swag from a party they weren’t invited to.\n\nTo the agents, the ribbons are an expression of how far they’ve come in the business — and where they rank among their colleagues. After the week’s meetings are over, they’re put away.\n\nIn a way, they’re like cicadas: They swarm the city for a brief period, and then they’re gone.\n\nBut we know they’ll be back.\n\n-Chris Foran\n\nJust over a year after moving to Milwaukee, I arrived at Wolski’s Tavern with a singular goal: Get that damn sticker. You know the one. The ubiquitous capital-letter “I CLOSED WOLSKI’S” sticker plastered on dive bar bathroom walls and 20-somethings’ water bottles.\n\nEven if you don’t know what Wolski’s is, exactly, it’s still likely you know about the stickers. The fantastic marketing strategy has worked wonders for the more-than-a-century-old bar.\n\nWhen we arrive that night, we sit outside despite the evening’s light rain. I find myself tiring long before 1 a.m. But the lure of the sticker provides energy as the night goes on.\n\nAs 2 a.m. passes, a man urinates off a tree-shielded wall and an employee yells it’s time to go. A sloppy early-20s crowd, a few stray middle-age folks and I begin to filter inside. The crowd lingers, holding glass beer mugs and Miller High Lifes.\n\nTen minutes later, another call to leave rings out. This time, people form a line to a door guarded by a young doorman holding a stack of stickers. One in front of me doesn’t take it, but later reverses her decision. The doorman teases she can’t have one, and receives a kiss on the cheek when he concedes.\n\nI give him a nod and thank-you, taking my prize.\n\nI closed Wolski’s — now I just need to find where to put the sticker. Any ideas?\n\n-David Clarey\n\nIn Milwaukee, seemingly every component of the gooey globules known as cheese curds — pieces of young cheese that during the cheesemaking process become separated from the whey — is as malleable as the cheddar itself.\n\nA simple scan of the city’s pubs, bars and even fine-dining restaurants is evidence of an oft-repeated Wisconsin stereotype: It’s the cheese curd capital of the world. And per usual, Milwaukee isn’t going to skimp on the party.\n\nRestaurants generally buy fresh curds of white or yellow cheddar — in rarer cases, mozzarella or pepper jack — before adding their own personality via batters, sauces and names. Milwaukeeans take pride in experimenting with curd coatings: they might be buttermilk-battered, pancake-battered, beer-battered, honey lager-battered, Lakefront Riverwest Stein-battered, or slathered in an ambiguous “house-made batter.”\n\nThose curds are then “fried up squeaky clean” (at the Wicked Hop), turned into “mini explosives” disguised as curds (at Safehouse Milwaukee), or transfigured into “little pillows of cheesy heaven” (at Joe Mama’s Bar). Many restaurants serve up half-pound portions; some, like Steny’s, offer a full pound of cheese.\n\nNotably, the Journal Sentinel didn’t come across any menus advertising curds served with ketchup. But various varieties of tomato, like marinara sauce and tomato jam, made appearances. Many menus experiment with ranch varieties like buttermilk, garlic, chipotle or jalapeño, or specialty sauces like buffalo blue cheese aioli, maple syrup, Bloody Mary buffalo, or sweet and spicy pineapple.\n\nAs Brothers Bar and Grill puts it, the final step is up to you: transporting the morsels “from the cheese curd capital of the world to your mouth!”\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nRyan Putskey isn’t fazed by calls to the Oriental Theatre asking if “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is “appropriate.” Or, calls telling him it’s not.\n\n“To be fair, it can be kind of graphic. But, I mentioned this to the cast — it’s been like this for probaby 40 years,” said Putskey, the theater’s longtime caretaker.\n\nA quick Google search confirms the historic East Side theater gets national kudos for its longstanding commitment to Rocky Horror. In some tellings, the Oriental takes the crown for the longest single run of the movie since its release in 1975.\n\nPutskey humbly said that’s a point of contention: the Oriental’s tradition dates back to January 1978 — before its rival for Rocky Horror longevity, the Clinton Street Theater in Oregon — but has logged fewer individual shows.\n\nRegardless, Rocky Horror devotees consistently show up for the movie and live stage performance at midnight on the second Saturday of each month to call out virgins in the audience and throw toast at the stage. They never tire of watching the transformation of an under-sexualized engaged couple, Brad and Janet, as they wander into a castle and are soon seduced by a mad scientist from the planet Transsexual and his Frankenstein-esque creation, Rocky.\n\nThose details aren’t unique to Milwaukee. But the Oriental’s minaret towers and lioness statutes add an otherworldly, in-person touch to the celebration of madness, weirdness and sexuality that demands to be taken seriously.\n\n“You’ll consistently be there with — and I say this will all due respect to all of them — a bunch of weirdos,” Putskey said.\n\n-Cleo Krejci\n\nNobody has to be from Cleveland to know that the city has been the subject of more than a few one-liners over the years.\n\n“Attention Cleveland, your river is on fire!”\n\nOr ...\n\n“In Cleveland, Velveeta cheese can be found in the gourmet section of the supermarket.”\n\nBut here’s a burning question, why did Cleveland become the butt of a zinger of a gag in Milwaukee’s Bay View, of all places?\n\nIn 1978, while having lunch with his assistant, now retired photographer and artist Mark Gubin decided to have some fun with air travelers flying into Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport.\n\nRealizing that low-level planes coasted over his studio and home (the former Bay Theater) in the path of a runway, he painted “Welcome to Cleveland”on his roof.\n\nWas there any specific reason behind the Cleveland tomfoolery, these 6-foot high letters that have given more than a few air travelers an uneasy, eerie (or Erie) feeling?\n\nNope, it was just Gubin’s wicked sense of humor, the right time to welcome visitors to the wrong place.\n\n“I never did it as any kind of thing to help my business or anything like that. It was just plain madness. You need that in the world,” Gubin told former Journal Sentinel columnist Jim Stingl in 2015.\n\nThe internet, cyberspace and social media have helped Gubin’s prank reach a sort of rock star quality.\n\nNow 46 years later, the gag certainly hasn’t gotten old … it’s still flying.\n\n-Emmett Prosser\n\nIn the 1980s, many members of the Forest County Potawatomi tribe lived in poverty.\n\nNo more.\n\nToday, members of the tribe receive tens of thousands of dollars in dividends.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Potawatomi Casino in the Menomonee River Valley happened.\n\nWhen it first opened around 1990 at 1720 W. Canal St., the facility was a large bingo hall with a few hundred slot machines of questionable legality and little outside regulation.\n\nThe tribe’s reservation is in northern Wisconsin, making the Milwaukee casino the nation’s first off-reservation tribal casino. The land where the casino is located is believed to have once been a Potawatomi village, according to a Milwaukee Public Museum history of the tribe.\n\nIn its initial years, the tribe shared its gaming revenue with the Indian Community School and a non-Indian management company. Those deals have since expired.\n\nToday, the casino is a major Milwaukee tourist attraction and an unmissable part of the city’s skyline. It rakes in more than $400 million in gambling winnings a year. A chunk of those winnings goes to members of the tribe in the form of per-capita payments estimated to be more than $70,000 per member.\n\nThe gambling hall draws nearly 6 million visitors a year and the 784,000-square-foot casino offers a range of ways to win or lose money, including about 3,000 slot machines, sports book, craps and a variety of table games including poker and blackjack.\n\nAnd since 1999, The Forest County Potawatomi Foundation has donated about $75 million to Milwaukee-area nonprofits, according to a spokesperson for the tribe.\n\n-Cary Spivak\n\nDo you know where you were in 1880?\n\nThat’s a trick question — you were surely not born, but if you were, you could’ve been among the first to munch on some of the finest sausage to come out of Milwaukee at that time.\n\nLuckily, you still can enjoy it. That’s because Usinger’s Famous Sausage has stood the test of time since founder Fred Usinger moved to Milwaukee from Germany and started his own successful sausage shop in 1880.\n\nIn the nearly century and a half since, the company has grown to have a wide shipping network while retaining its beloved place in Milwaukee, with its vintage-style building, tasty and bountiful meats and a rather helpful staff. Don’t forget about the storied elves — prominent in local advertisements and in the deli’s window displays, the company touts them as the invisible makers of its beloved sausage.\n\nUsinger’s sausage earned a spot in the Milwaukee Public Museum’s Streets of Milwaukee exhibit and in an episode of “Top Chef.” There’s even an annual Fred Usinger Day on Feb. 23.\n\nPerhaps a 1980 ad in the Milwaukee Journal put it best: “In 1880, Milwaukee got its first electric street lights, its first native mayor, and its first taste of Usinger’s sausage. It was a very good year.”\n\nIt was a very good year, indeed. And, thankfully, those tastes have continued for 144 years.\n\n-David Clarey\n\nWisconsin’s oldest continually operating gay bar wasn’t always easy to spot. When June Brehm opened This Is It! at 418 E. Wells St. in 1968, Milwaukee’s LGBTQ+ scene operated under the radar, and closeted patrons made use of the bar’s rear entrance to avoid being identified.\n\nToday, This Is It! welcomes patrons with a concrete facade adorned with a diamond pattern in the colors of the rainbow.\n\nDrag superstar and Wisconsin native Trixie Mattel became a co-owner with George Schneider in 2021.\n\nNot only is This Is It! a Milwaukee institution — it’s one of the country’s oldest LGBTQ+ bars. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin recognized Brehm and her son Joseph for their contributions to Wisconsin’s LGBTQ+ community, and the bar became the site of the Wisconsin LGBTQ History Project’s first permanent public display in 2019.\n\n“This Is It! is not Milwaukee’s favorite gay bar, it is Milwaukee’s favorite bar,” Mattel said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Everyone in town has a personal story or anecdote, or sometimes even a night they can barely remember. The exterior has rainbow accents that invite all walks of life into the space, and remind people to come in and act right. It reminds people that even if you’re homophobic, not in this (expletive) building you’re not.”\n\n-Jessie Opoien\n\nA symbol of Milwaukee’s proud brewing history, bottles of Miller Lite can be seen in the hands of drinkers at dive bars and tailgates across Milwaukee.\n\nIt’s probably the most ubiquitous of the Miller beers — Miller Chill, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life and Miller 64 Extra Light — in a town where the Miller name still looms large (literally — the large red Miller sign can be seen by anyone driving into downtown from the west on Interstate 94).\n\nIn 1973, Miller Brewing bought a low-calorie “Lite” brand of beer from Chicago-based Meister Brau Inc. and turned it into what’s now known as Miller Lite. From there, the company advertised the beer with the help of sports stars like Mickey Mantle, John Madden and Bob Uecker with the popular line “Tastes great … less filling.”\n\nToday, Miller Lite and other Miller beers are under the MolsonCoors’ list of brands.\n\nIn 1996, Miller acquired the naming rights to the Milwaukee Brewers’ yet-to-be-built stadium, which opened in 2001. It was called Miller Park until the naming rights agreement expired in 2020 and American Family Insurance took over, renaming the stadium American Family Field.\n\nBut naturally, Miller Lite can still be found for sale at the stadium during Brewers’ games.\n\n-Alec Johnson\n\nCathedral Square is home to many summer festivals.\n\nThere’s Jazz in the Park, Bastille Days and the dazzling Christmas tree display that wash Cathedral Square in lights at night.\n\nBut on the corner of Kilbourn and Jackson stands a metal plaque that marks a little-known event that occurred more than a century and a half ago. Passersby rarely stop to note the significance of that historical marker, erected in 2001 by the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n\nIt tells the story of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave from Missouri. Glover found refuge and freedom in Wisconsin until he was captured and jailed under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. His imprisonment stirred nearly 5,000 anti-slavery demonstrators who stormed the Milwaukee County Jail — which stood on present-day Cathedral Square — to break Glover out on March 10, 1854.\n\nBut Glover was still a wanted man.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act called for the recapture of freedom seekers or escaped slaves like Glover to be returned to their owners. Glover was on the run for years fearing recapture by his slave owner, a man named Benammi Stone Garland.\n\nWith the help of Wisconsin’s Underground Railroad, a network of safehouses manned by abolitionists who offered safety and shelter to runaway slaves, Glover eventually made his way to Canada and to freedom.\n\nGlover’s story is also depicted on a mural on the I-43 overpass on Fond du Lac Avenue.\n\n-LaRisa R. Lynch\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. visited Milwaukee at least twice. Now, Milwaukee honors King’s legacy with a statue in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nKing’s first recorded speech in Milwaukee was in August 1957 at the Grand Avenue Congressional Church, now the Irish Cultural & Heritage Center on West Wisconsin Avenue.\n\nHe returned during a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement in January 1964, where he spoke to over 6,000 at the Milwaukee Auditorium (now the Miller High Life Theatre).\n\nIn the biggest showing of support for King, an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people marched on Milwaukee just a few days removed from his assassination. The march was considered the largest civil rights demonstration in the city’s history.\n\nKing’s Milwaukee sculpture is located at North King Drive and West Vine Street. The sculptor, Erik Blome, once said he hoped to capture King animated as if he was giving a speech.\n\n-Drake Bentley\n\nHow things have changed.\n\nMarquette won the NCAA basketball trophy on March 28, 1977, with a 67-59 victory over the North Carolina Tar Heels, which sent students streaming down Wisconsin Avenue in an impromptu party-parade to the lake.\n\nUnder the brash, colorful (and quotable) Coach Al McGuire, the team – which famously took its team photo in tuxedos while sitting in a classic car – had captured the attention of the city, and the nation.\n\nThe teams were unseeded — it was the last year before teams came into the tournament with a ranking. And the term “March Madness” — describing the unpredictability of upsets and bracket busters — was not widely used until the ’80s.\n\nIt was legendary coach Al McGuire’s last game leading Marquette. He came into the game with a 25-7 record, after sneaking into the tournament, to the Tar Heels’ 28-5 record.\n\nOne of McGuire’s key strategies was to not give North Carolina any lead. If they led, the Tar Heels were sure to do the dreaded Four Corners Offense, a “stall offense” where the players would pass the ball to kill time.\n\nThe teams could take 10 minutes for one possession — there was no 30-second shot clock to keep the game moving. There was no 3-point line.\n\nDespite the fact basketball was played so much differently then, it is still remembered each year when Marquette plays in the NCAA tourney — as the only time Marquette men’s basketball won it all.\n\nIf anyone needs any reminding, the original trophy is in the Walk of Champions display at Marquette’s Al McGuire Center.\n\n-Cathy Kozlowicz\n\nCue the “Happy Days” theme song. The Bronze Fonz, a life-size statue that pays tribute to Arthur Fonzarelli, is a pillar of the city’s downtown RiverWalk.\n\nThe set-in-Milwaukee sitcom ran in the ’70s and ‘80s, but Fonzie — played by Henry Winkler — remains a beloved Brew City icon.\n\nVisit Milwaukee had spearheaded an effort that raised $75,000 for the statue, and artist Gerald Sawyer brought it to life. The statue arrived in 2008 with a lot of fanfare, including a parade, the king of cool himself, other castmates and the stars of “Happy Days” spinoff “Laverne & Shirley.”\n\n“It is a great honor,” Winkler said in a previous Journal Sentinel interview. “You cannot be blase about that, no matter how much time goes by.”\n\nWhen the statue disappeared to undergo routine maintenance a couple years back, it caused quite the stir. About 40 people attended a ceremony marking its return.\n\nWant to see the Bronze Fonz for yourself? It’s located on the east side of the RiverWalk just south of Wells Street. And while you’re there, you might want to snap a pic. The statue is one of the city’s most selfied landmarks.\n\n-Hannah Kirby\n\nTomatoes are just one of the many vegetables you’ll find planted at Alice’s Garden, one of the city’s best-known community gardens, on the city’s north side at North 21st Street and West Garfield Avenue.\n\nBorn out of an abandoned highway project, the 2-acre garden is located along a larger, 3-mile corridor where entire blocks of houses were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Park West Freeway. The project cut through the city’s west and north sides, displacing several thousand residents and disrupting the community’s economy. Ultimately, the highway was never built, largely because of sustained neighborhood opposition. In its wake, large swaths of empty land were left.\n\nOut of that empty land sprang Alice’s Garden, now a thriving community garden and gathering place. The garden is there to reconnect city residents to the land and to oft-lost traditions of growing fresh, healthy food.\n\nGardeners come from all ethnicities and cultures, and their plots often speak to their heritage. In a Native American’s garden might be corn, beans and squash, known as “the three sisters” for how they are planted close together, for mutual benefit. A Black gardener might grow black-eyed peas, collard greens and okra in homage to past ancestors.\n\nNot only is the garden a place to cultivate food, but also relationships. Walking paths lined with herbs invite visitors for a stroll. Kids race across the grass or sit on picnic blankets for monthly storytimes. The pavilion shelters people sharing fellowship and a meal.\n\n-Sarah Volpenhein\n\nOne sign that summer is here in Milwaukee is the volleyball nets going up at Bradford Beach. Once the weather gets nice, it’s common to see people of all skill levels bumping, setting and spiking at the city’s largest beach during the afternoons and evenings pretty much any day of the week.\n\nFrom late May until September, the beach is home to more than 30 volleyball nets. The nets are currently managed by Volley Life, a local company that organizes beach volleyball clinics, tournaments and leagues.\n\nIn 2016, the beach hosted the USA Volleyball Junior Beach National Championships, and, at the end of this summer, it will host the Badger Region Beach Championships.\n\nBut, you don’t need to be a former high school volleyball star to join in on the summer fun.\n\nVolley Life has multiple leagues nearly every day of the week encompassing skill levels from those just learning the game to experienced players competing for prize money. When leagues are not playing, nets are open to the public on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\n-Claire Reid\n\nThe nickname “Cream City” might make some think of milk.\n\nBut Milwaukee’s popular moniker does not stem from the dairy or beer typically associated with Wisconsin. It has to do with brick.\n\nLook around and you’ll see them. The light-colored, yellowish bricks are the main material in a number of old buildings across the city: the former Schlitz brewery, Holy Trinity Church (now known as Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church), the Woman’s Club of Wisconsin and other industrial buildings and row houses.\n\nThe so-called cream city bricks were first used in the Milwaukee area in the 1830s. The material came from a clay found in the Menomonee River Valley filled with magnesium and lime. When put to fire, the clay produced a yellowy, cream-colored brick.\n\nThe bricks were widely exported and made it to major U.S. cities like Chicago and New York. But they remain a distinctly Milwaukee look and give the state’s largest city its name: Cream City.\n\n-Lawrence Andrea\n\nA hidden gem in Milwaukee’s premier lakefront property, Lake Park, is a 2,000-year-old ancient Indigenous burial mound.\n\nIt is a large conical mound about 40 feet in diameter and 2 feet high overlooking Lake Michigan near Lake Drive and Locust Street.\n\nThe mound was built by Indigenous people during what archaeologists call the Middle Woodland Culture between 300 B.C. and 400 A.D.\n\nMilwaukee was once home to hundreds, or even thousands, of these ancient mounds, but they were destroyed by development. The Lake Park mound is the last one left in the city.\n\n-Frank Vaisvilas\n\nFew signs bring as much joy as the one that reads “MILWAUKEE PUBLIC MARKET.”\n\nThe large red neon sign hovers above the market’s west entrance, beckoning to passersby and serving as a de facto billboard for downtown and the Third Ward. It glows at night, and casts a shimmering reflection even on the rainiest of days. Get off that concrete freeway, it tells visitors. (Who among us hasn’t driven past the sign and wondered why they’re still on I-794 instead of walking through the public market, stopping by the lakefront, or visiting one of the city’s many festivals?)\n\nThe sign alone has basically become a local landmark. And the market itself, which opened in 2005, is a sleek space full of natural light and packed with local vendors selling an impressive range of goods – including cheese, spices, wine, fresh fish on ice, flowers, chocolate and Milwaukee merch.\n\nThe Milwaukee Public Market sits at the corner of what was once known as Commission Row, a stretch of Broadway that was once packed with Italian fruit and v", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/people/elvis-presley/2017/08/14/elvis-presleys-songs-ranking-kings-40-best-hits/417692001/", "title": "Elvis Presley's songs: Ranking the King's 40 best hits", "text": "Forty years after his death, Elvis Presley remains a global icon. As the years pass, it’s perhaps too easy for Elvis’ image to obscure his artistry. In Memphis, especially, Elvis the revolutionary artist, the “sing all kinds” boundary smasher and the versatile vocalist shouldn’t be forgotten. To celebrate his music, here are our picks for his 40 greatest recordings:\n\nMore:Eternal Fame: Join us over the next week as we celebrate the legacy of Elvis\n\n1. “That’s All Right” (1954):\n\nOriginally written and recorded by Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup in 1946, this is Elvis’ first single, recorded at Sun Studio on July 5, 1954. It’s nothing more than “the great wedding ceremony,” the product of four men messing around in a small room on Union Avenue and remaking global culture. And while you can argue whether Elvis was the first to blend pre-existing styles into this new thing called rock 'n' roll, his synthesis of country and blues here sounds more effortless and more complete than any of his contemporaries, or his inheritors. It clocks in at under two minutes and sounds so simple, so inevitable now. But its grace still startles. — Chris Herrington\n\n2. “Mystery Train” (1955):\n\nA 1953 number recorded by bluesman Junior Parker and the Blue Flames, and produced by Sam Phillips for Sun Records. Elvis reinvented it in the same room two years later for his final Sun single, imbuing the song with a deeper Americana. The song’s first line, “Train I ride, sixteen coaches long … ,” had turned up in tunes by the Carter Family and Leadbelly, among others. Elvis’ rendition — faster and somehow more haunting than Parker’s original — augured big changes. — Bob Mehr\n\n3. “Hound Dog” (1956):\n\n“Hound Dog” was first recorded by Willie Mae “Big Mama” Thornton and was a No. 1 rhythm & blues hit in 1953. But the song is synonymous with Elvis, whose version sold 10 million copies and spent 11 weeks atop the pop chart. Thornton stood something like 10 feet tall and could drop whole armies with a stare; when she sang a song, it stayed sung. But don’t buy the myth that her original was superior to Elvis’ cover. Essentially acting as his own producer, he swapped out words, souped up the tempo and created, as cultural critic Greil Marcus wrote, “a sound for which no one was prepared.” Little wonder it topped the pop, R&B and country charts simultaneously. — David Williams\n\n4. “Don’t Be Cruel” (1956):\n\nThis Otis Blackwell-penned song was the other side of the same 45 as “Hound Dog.” With Bill Black and D.J. Fontana popping from the jump and the Jordanaires having perhaps their finest backup vocal moment, “Don’t Be Cruel” positively swings before Elvis really gets ahold of it. But when he does, it’s as easeful a vocal as he ever recorded. At his best, Elvis sang like genius athletes often play, with casual command and self-aware delight. That “mmmmm” transition from the second to the third verse and the faint chuckle as he comes out it? The in-song equivalent of Marc Gasol (himself an Elvis fan) giving himself a little slap on the butt during a game. (CH)\n\n5. “Heartbreak Hotel” (1956):\n\nElvis’ first single for RCA was the big one, the song that really introduced him to the world. “Heartbreak Hotel” is utterly distinctive, not at all a harbinger of Hound Dogs and Teddy Bears; instead, it’s a noirish environmental portrait inspired by a real-life suicide, an evocation of “gloom” populated by “broken-hearted lovers,” a crying bellhop, a dress clerk “dressed in black” — people so lonely “they could die,” including the singer himself. Steve Sholes’ production — from Floyd Cramer’s cocktail lounge piano to Chet Atkins’ guitar to Bill Black’s tiptoe bass line, creeping like Peter Lorre past a corpse in the lobby — is night-dark perfection. — John Beifuss\n\n6. “Suspicious Minds” (1969):\n\nIt can be difficult to reconcile for those of us who still delight in Elvis’ Sun sides, but sometimes modern ears struggle to hear that music clearly, as more than a time capsule. Not so on “Suspicious Minds,” which is Elvis’ most modern hit. It sounds more contemporary, even, than the remixed “A Little Less Conversation,” which came more than 30 years later. Elvis built his legend fusing country, blues and gospel — you know, helping create rock 'n' roll — but this tempest of longing and recrimination (first line: “We’re caught in a trap”) is a grown-up soul music all his own. You want an Elvis song a room of people are most likely to respond to today, free of irony? This is it. (CH)\n\n7. “Good Rockin’ Tonight” (1954):\n\nElvis’ second Sun single. The original version, by Roy Brown, is good, the Wynonie Harris version better. But they both sound like guys getting ready for a good time they’ve had plenty of times before. Only 19, Elvis sings it with more shock, and more delight. With Bill Black’s thumping acoustic bass and Scotty Moore’s country guitar replacing the horn-based jump blues sound, the Sun Records remake is more rural, hinting at wild things happening in the woods. Elvis testifies like the town crier of the rock 'n' roll revolution — “We’re gonna rock all our blues away” is a generational promise — calling everyone to the show, even if he, himself, was the show. (CH)\n\n8. “Blue Moon of Kentucky” (1954):\n\nOriginally recorded as a waltz in 1947 by bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe, the song was a familiar hit in the South. Seven years later, at the suggestion of bassist Bill Black, Elvis would cut it himself, tarting up the tune with a hiccupy blues-pop reading during his famed July 1954 session at Sun (the same one that yielded “That’s All Right”), thus earning his sobriquet as the “Hillbilly Cat.” (BM)\n\n9. “Blue Moon” (1956):\n\nFilmmaker Jim Jarmusch named his Memphis movie “Mystery Train,” but it was this Sun recording he used as a connecting thread among the film’s four portraits of lost souls on one Memphis night. Elvis’ singing is the most ethereal of his career and, though it’s a ballad, a standard even, maybe the wildest. He sings like a spirit. Here’s the ghost of Elvis, more than 20 years before his actual death. It’s the oddest recording on this list, maybe the oddest — in a good way — in the Elvis canon. Rather than timeless, it sounds out of time. (CH)\n\n10. “Stranger in My Own Hometown” (1969):\n\nElvis’ hometown “comeback” sessions at American are richly represented on this list. “Stranger in My Own Hometown” isn’t the highest-ranking record from that period or, certainly, the most familiar. But though it was passed over for inclusion on “From Elvis in Memphis,” it captures the essential meaning of that session — and of that moment in Elvis’ career. Percy Mayfield’s original version is a fine record, but Elvis, finally unleashed, blows it away, with power, desperation and, crucially, a self-aware black humor culled from his own artistic exile to Hollywood and transformative return to a city whose music scene had evolved just fine in his absence. Here the King, not his hit-making producer and ace session band, has something to prove. (CH)\n\n11. “One Night” (1957):\n\nA month before recording the released version of “One Night,” Presley and the band cut a more faithful cover of Smiley Lewis’ 1956 R&B hit, “One Night (of Sin)”; when Elvis’ publishing company balked at the unmistakable intent of the title, a more radio-friendly rewrite was ordered. Purists and bad boys may demur, but in the case of Presley’s performances, the bowdlerized version is superior to Elvis’ earlier take (which remained unreleased until 1983). “One night of sin/ Is what I’m now paying for,” sang Lewis, and later, Elvis; the rewrite changes the opening to: “One night with you/ Is what I’m now praying for.” This is more than an edit: What was intended, for all its salaciousness, as a caution against the wages of “sin” becomes an affirmation of love (physical and otherwise) — something you can pray for, without shame. And Elvis’ exuberant, bluesy performance embraces its full promise. (JB)\n\n12. “Baby Let’s Play House” (1955):\n\nThe fourth of Elvis’ Sun singles, “Baby, Let’s Play House” was the first to chart — a No. 5 country single in a year when Webb Pierce was the man. In the original from just a few months before, Nashville-born R&B man Arthur Gunter sang “You may go to college/ May go to school/ You may get religion/ Baby, don’t you be nobody’s fool.” Elvis changed “religion” to “a pink Cadillac” and goosed the tempo to a bank heist getaway pace. The result may be the wildest good time ever had on record, by anybody. Elvis whoops, stutters, wails and hiccups — and late in the song, somewhere around the 43rd “baby” — seems about to bust out laughing before he catches himself. It’s the only restraint in the whole thing. Mercy. (DW)\n\n13. “All Shook Up” (1957):\n\n“All Shook Up” is a title begging for a song, and songwriter Otis Blackwell (who also penned “Don’t Be Cruel”) crafted one worthy of the phrase. It’s an irresistible composition made more so by some of Elvis’ most irresistible pure-pop singing, ending verses — “My heart beats so it scares me to death,” “That’s to have that girl that I love so fine” — with vocal flourishes that take flight. (CH)\n\n14. “Milkcow Blues Boogie” (1955):\n\nYou could debate which Elvis record to put in a time capsule and shoot into outer space, to explain the Presley phenomenon to whatever life forms reside in the vast cosmos. But you could melt down a 45 rpm copy of Sun Records No. 215 and use it as rocket fuel. “Hold it, fellas,” Elvis says to Scotty and Bill, seconds into the song. “That don’t move me. Let’s get real, real gone for a change.” “Milkcow Blues Boogie” is Elvis unhinged. It’s rockabilly on a bender, with falsetto cries, barnyard double entendre and some moments of true vocal menace. (DW)\n\n15. “Jailhouse Rock” (1957):\n\nThere are half a dozen songs from the songwriting team of Leiber & Stoller on this list, but this is the only one as mischievous as their best titles for R&B vocal group The Coasters, putting love song convention into a (male only) prison setting: “Number 47 said to number 3/ You’re the cutest jailbird I ever did see.” Elvis rips into the lyric without hesitation, but this is also perhaps the freest, heaviest movie music he ever made. The thundering power chords set a tone, while D.J. Fontana’s drumming is, in the words of rock critic Dave Marsh, “halfway between strip joint rhumba and the perfect New Orleans shuffle.” Elvis cuts so loose that he’s overcome, his “rockrockrock” at the song’s midpoint descending into babble that only Scotty Moore’s guitar can put back together. All hands on deck. If you can’t find a partner use a wooden chair. (CH)\n\n16. “Trying to Get to You” (1955):\n\nIn comparison to some of Elvis’ raw or “hillbilly” Sun recordings, “Trying to Get to You” sounds unusually sophisticated — so much so that it was among the Sun releases included on his debut RCA album in 1956, alongside songs cut in Nashville and New York with A-list session aces. “I’ve been traveling over mountains/ Even through the valleys, too,” reports the song’s narrator, detailing his efforts to reunite with his baby, “in spite of all that I’ve been through.” Like some sort of sidekick or wingman, Scotty Moore’s chatty guitar reinforces each of Elvis’ lines, as if to reassure the listener of the singer’s sincerity — not that any additional affirmation is needed when Elvis’ vocals are this assured and resourceful. (JB)\n\n17. “Wearin’ That Loved On Look” (1969):\n\nThis is Elvis music for grown folk — a naughty tragicomedy that might be heard on WDIA’s “All Blues Saturday,” if only it had been covered by Marvin Sease or Theodis Ealey. The narrative presents the King as cuckold, as Elvis returns home from an out-of-town trip to discover such evidence of party-hearty “carrying on” as ash trays “all full of ashes”; an apparently too-stoned-to-leave “man downstairs with long bushy hair”; and, worst of all, his “baby,” who is (cue the title lyric). Also, this is Elvis soul music: The emphatic backup vocals and the wiggly tease of organist Bobby Emmons’ keyboards keep everything percolating, no matter the post-Summer of Love, late 1960s weariness of the narrator, who seems to be longing for a time when free love wasn’t so free. (JB)\n\n18. “Reconsider Baby” (1960):\n\nAs Peter Guralnick notes in his biography “Last Train to Memphis,” a still-teenaged Elvis had seen Lowell Fulson perform “Reconsider Baby” at the Club Handy on Beale in 1954. When he got around to cutting it himself six years later, fresh from the Army, he dug as deeply into the song’s slow-burn sexual swagger as Fulson had. Unlike at Sun, this wasn’t blues reimagined into rock 'n' roll, with quickness, brashness, release. This was just blues, played straight, arguably the best of his life, augmented by Scotty Moore’s razor guitar and Boots Randolph’s dirty saxophone. Here, when Elvis commands “Play the blues, boys, play the blues,” he means it, and he gets what he wants. (CH)\n\n19. “Love Me Tender” (1956):\n\nArranged for voice and guitar, this simple, tender pledge of devotion (and plea for affection in return) is one of the great love songs, as well as one of Elvis’ signature recordings. It is updated from an old Civil War song for the film of the same title, and the vocals have an innocence, sincerity, directness and vulnerability that may be unmatched in the Elvis catalog. (JB)\n\n20. “Little Sister” (1961):\n\nThe rare B-side that has eclipsed its A-side (“His Latest Flame,” see No. 29), “Little Sister” owes its rock 'n' roll immortality primarily to Hank Garland’s guitar riff, a twangy Greek chorus of a G note that adds swampy heat and cheeky punctuation to the lyrics’ tale of a spurned Romeo transferring his horndog affection from a presumably age-appropriate target to a ripening youngster. The result is something of a Southern-fried teen screwball comedy, with Jordanaire Culley Holt adding a mocking froggy bass echo to Elvis’ perfectly modulated vocals during the fade-out that comes all too soon.(JB)\n\n21. “Power of My Love” (1969):\n\nA re-energized and indisputably mature Elvis transforms this uncompromisingly adult sex song into one of the bluesiest and most, yes, powerful performances of his historic 1969 Memphis sessions — it’s an underrated monster fit for a King (or a King Kong). (JB)\n\n22. “A Mess of Blues” (1960):\n\nThis B-side to “It’s Now or Never” is a gritty, grinding little R&B number with Elvis recapturing some of his ’50s loucheness — and a nice counterpoint to the A-side’s decidedly melodramatic pop. (BM)\n\n23. “Long Black Limousine” (1969):\n\nThe first song recorded at the historic 1969 American Studio sessions, “Long Black Limousine” was a crucial cut on what might be the essential Elvis album, “From Elvis in Memphis.” “Rarely has Elvis sung so passionately in the studio,” wrote biographer Peter Guralnick, “rarely has he revealed himself so nakedly.” Fourteen years after singing about a pink Cadillac in his classic version of “Baby, Let’s Play House,” and just six years removed from the soundtrack clowning of “(There’s) No Room to Rhumba in a Sports Car,” it was as if the joy ride was over. (DW)\n\n24. “Like a Baby” (1960):\n\nWritten by R&B artist Jesse Stone and later recorded by James Brown, this slow march through betrayal, regret and self-pity is one of Elvis’ most soulful, disturbed and — never mind the title — sexual recordings. (JB)\n\n25. “Burning Love” (1972):\n\n“Lord Almighty, I feel my temperature rising,” Elvis sings, responding to the song’s churning — burning — rhythm the way many a listener would. A rocker in a time of (often overwrought) ballads, played and sung with more weight and passion than in the original Arthur Alexander version, this was an update of the original Southern rock 'n' roll sound that didn’t sound creaky or nostalgic. Elvis’ last real hit and, arguably, his last great record. (CH)\n\n26. “Only the Strong Survive” (1969):\n\nThe reason Elvis’ faithful version of Jerry Butler’s hit stands as one of his best records rather than a superfluous cover is twofold: The song feels written to order, a pitch-perfect fit for Elvis’ more contemporary, more mature, more soul-influenced new sound. And if Elvis’ take lacks the civil rights subtext of Butler’s, it carries a personal resonance. As a hymn to perseverance in a moment of romantic loss, written in the voice of a son remembering his mother’s advice, “Only the Strong Survive” also fit Elvis’ public narrative and, one imagines, his private self-conception. (CH)\n\n27. “Lawdy Miss Clawdy” (1956):\n\nA 1952 smash for New Orleans’ Lloyd Price, it was redone by Elvis as part of his first burst of work for RCA. Elvis’ version is more playful than pleading. But it's a meaningful reinterpretation nonetheless. Price’s song was one of the first crossover R&B numbers to be embraced widely by white teens — Elvis included — and the song would remain close to Presley throughout his career. (BM)\n\n28. “I’m Left, You’re Right, She’s Gone” (1955):\n\nA lightweight composition, built around some fun wordplay, this Sun-era recording is elevated by Elvis’ jaunty reading and Scotty Moore’s signature dancing guitar lines. (BM)\n\n29. “(Marie’s the Name) His Latest Flame” (1961):\n\nThe rockabillified Bo Diddley beat is intense, almost nervous (is that a pounding piano or a heart palpitation?), but Elvis, uncharacteristically, undersells the performance, lending surprising poignancy. (JB)\n\n30. “Kentucky Rain” (1970):\n\nBuoyed by Chips Moman’s atmospheric production touches and tempo shifts, as well as the piano playing of a then-unknown Ronnie Milsap, the track is defined by the vaulting, dramatic vocals that became Presley’s signature during his post-’60s career. (BM)\n\n31. “Love Me” (1956):\n\n“Love Me” may have been the first song to acknowledge the helpless and intense ardor of Elvis’ female fans, indeed to make that the song’s subtext. In Elvis’ hands, Leiber & Stoller’s intended-to-be-wry opening lines (“Treat me like a fool/ Treat me mean and cruel/ But love me”) are instead an invitation for bedlam. (CH)\n\n32. “Guitar Man” (1967):\n\nGeorgia-bred guitarist and songwriter Jerry Reed scored a small country hit with this snappy 1967 number about a musician making his way from Memphis to Macon to Mobile leading a swingin' five-piece band. But the tune would be redone memorably — not once, but twice — by Elvis. (BM)\n\n33. “Tomorrow is a Long Time” (1966):\n\nThe King meets The Bard as Elvis cuts a Bob Dylan rarity. It’s a spare and moving piece that makes one wish the King had dug deeper into the Dylan songbook, and more often. (BM)\n\n34. “Blue Christmas” (1957):\n\nElvis’ contribution to the holidays is as loaded with goodies as a Christmas stocking, from the plunk-a-plunk-plunk of the guitar to the almost doo-wop background vocals of Millie Kirkham and the Jordanaires, which move from high to low pitch like garlands wrapped in waves around a Douglas fir. With a quintessential Elvis vocal performance (“I’ll have a bluuuuue blue-blue-blue Criss-muss,” the singer concludes), this Christmas classic seems to become more ubiquitous every season. (JB)\n\n35. “My Baby Left Me” (1956):\n\nElvis’ career-launching take on Arthur Crudup’s “That’s All Right” tops our list, but this follow-up dip into the bluesman’s catalog is every bit as energetic if not as epochal as its predecessor. (JB)\n\n36. “Baby What You Want Me to Do” (1968):\n\nPlayed as part of an “in-the-round” picking session with his pals on the “’68 Comeback” special, Elvis’ cover of the Jimmy Reed blues tune may be among his most joyous performances. Clad in black leather, biting his lip, stomping and sweating his way through the song and several reprises, Elvis’ affection for this dirty groover is palpable, electric and contagious. (BM)\n\n37. “A Little Less Conversation” (1968/2002):\n\nAn apparently minor Elvis song when it first appeared, this became Elvis’ most unexpected hit a full generation after his death via a remix by producer Junkie XL, who realized two essential things: The hopped-up rhythm motorvates across eras, and the King has full command over that groovy groove. (CH)\n\n38. “An American Trilogy” (1972):\n\nA medley of 19th-century tunes — the Southern anthem “Dixie,” the African-American connected folk number “All My Trials” and the Union Army’s marching song “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” — in a grandiloquent arrangement would become the centerpiece of Elvis’ concerts. (BM)\n\n39. “True Love Travels on a Gravel Road” (1969):\n\nThe King’s gospel-soul reading of this “love over money” ballad matches the vulnerability that Chips Moman’s “Memphis Boys” session players gave it, and it’s among the many standouts from his late ‘60s studio comeback, \"From Elvis in Memphis.\" (BM)\n\n40. “Are You Lonesome Tonight?” (1960):\n\nThe tune dates back to the 1920s, but was associated with only one man after Elvis was through with it. Elvis was always as much of a balladeer as a rocker, and this was one of his most successful and most enduring big ballads, his pleading, questioning verses (“Is your heart filled with pain?/ Shall I come back again?”) broken up by a spoken-word bridge that tip-toes along the edge of camp.

Nobody was convicted for, or confessed to, the fatal stabbings of two men outside a nightclub in the city’s Buckhead district. Only one person – Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Lewis – pleaded guilty to a crime related to their deaths, for obstructing justice.\n\nLewis, then a standout for the Baltimore Ravens, didn’t play in that game on Jan. 30, 2000. He came to Atlanta to party instead, dressing for the nightlife afterward in a cream-colored suit with a mock neck sweater and Stetson hat. But that suit hasn't been seen in public since the night Lewis' limousine left the bloody crime scene, leading to a question that has haunted the families of the deceased: What happened to the suit Lewis wore that night?\n\n“Why would it be gone?” said Greg Wilson, uncle of Jacinth Baker, one of the victims. “Why would that or anything else they had on them end up missing that night unless it was something that linked them to the murder?”\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nDAILY SPORTS, DELIVERED: Get the best Sports news in your inbox!\n\nFROM 2013:Slayings not forgotten or forgiven\n\nMORE NFL:Super Bowl hero John Riggins now fighting to get more money for older NFL retirees\n\nIn seeking answers to those questions as the Super Bowl returns to Atlanta on Sunday, USA TODAY Sports obtained court records from subsequent civil lawsuits against Lewis and a book by one of his former co-defendants. New details emerged about the suit that prosecutors alleged was stained with blood.\n\n“Where’s it at?” Handsome Lollar, brother of Richard Lollar, the other stabbing victim said last week. “Where’s that white suit that was all bloody?”\n\nThe court filing\n\nThe murder trial over the deaths of Lollar, 24, and Baker, 21, ended in June 2000 when a jury acquitted two of Lewis’ friends and former co-defendants. Nearly three years later, an attorney for Baker’s family filed a 46-page document in federal court in Georgia as part of the family’s civil lawsuit against Lewis seeking damages for his wrongful death.\n\nThe purpose of the document was to persuade a judge to deny an attempt by Lewis to have their case thrown out of court. It mentioned Lewis’ missing suit on the 16th page, along with the names of Lewis’ mother, his friend Kwame King and a woman who accompanied Lewis and sat next him in the limousine. Her name was Jessica Larose Robertson of Houston.\n\nSUPER BOWL:Ranking all 52 Super Bowl games from best to worst\n\n“Two days after the incident, Defendant Lewis' mother, Ms. Sunseria Keith, met with Ms. Robertson and Defendant King, to coordinate and fashion stories that were favorable to Defendant Lewis, regarding the incident,” the Baker family alleged in a document filed in May 2003 by their attorney, Richard Middleton of Savannah. “Ms. Keith instructed Ms. Robertson to destroy the suit Defendant Lewis had been wearing at the time of the incident. The suit that Defendant Lewis was wearing during the fight is still `missing’ and Defendant Lewis has never attempted to locate its whereabouts. Ms. Keith arranged to pay Ms. Robertson for her services in covering up for Defendant Lewis, and for Defendant King's legal fees. During the days and weeks following the incident, Ms. Keith, with Ms. Robertson's assistance, acted upon Defendant Lewis' behalf, in embarking upon a campaign to contact, counsel and harass witnesses.”\n\nFamilies of both victims had sued Lewis for damages, leading to the discovery of evidence, including the deposition testimony of Lewis, Robertson and King in 2001 and 2002, as well as documents from Robertson’s attorney in Atlanta and a draft copy of King’s legal fees.\n\nMiddleton, the Baker family attorney, cited that material in a list of exhibits supporting his assertions and court filings in May 2003.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports asked Middleton for evidence that supports these assertions, but Middleton said he could not provide further information because the specifics of the case are “sealed by agreement.” In response to the family’s court filing in 2003, Lewis’ attorneys noted the evidence and didn’t refute it but said it was irrelevant to the summary judgment motion being considered at the time.\n\n“Plaintiff has brought forth a great deal of evidence that is immaterial to any issue currently before the Court,” Lewis’ attorneys stated in June 2003. “Evidence regarding what Mr. Lewis did days, weeks, and even months following the incident, information as to the actions of his mother, and the payment of legal fees in the criminal proceeding that arose from this case, among other assertions of material facts asserted by the Plaintiff, are irrelevant and immaterial to any legal issue pending before this Court… Mr. Lewis' actions during the police investigation, the actions of Sunseria Keith and others while Mr. Lewis was in jail, should be disregarded.”\n\nThey likely would have contested the issue if it came up at trial. But a few months later, records show Baker’s family reached a confidential settlement to end the lawsuit. In 2004, the family of Lollar, the other victim, also reached an undisclosed settlement with Lewis, who said in his book in 2015 that he paid the families out of sympathy and love, not guilt.\n\nHe has proclaimed his innocence in the killings, said he didn’t witness them or know what happened to the suit.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports made several attempts to reach Lewis, his mother, Robertson, King and attorneys involved in the case regarding the suit Lewis was wearing. They didn’t return messages left directly or through representatives.\n\nAnother book, by another key party in the case, claimed other clothes that went missing from Lewis’ hotel suite that morning.\n\nThe bag and the dumpster\n\nAfter initially being charged with murder, Lewis pleaded guilty to obstruction in a plea agreement that dropped his murder charge. The misdemeanor charge stemmed from a false statement he gave to police when he failed to give them the names of people he knew in the limo that night. Lewis also admitted to telling the people from the limo to “shut the F-up.”\n\nSUPER BOWL: With Super Bowl looming, Atlanta doesn't deserve its reputation as a bad sports town\n\nAs part of the deal, Lewis was punished with probation and agreed to testify in the case against his friends and former co-defendants, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting.\n\nBoth were acquitted of murder at trial, in large part because of unclear and unconvincing evidence in a case muddled by a dark, crowded melee outside a nightclub. What may have happened to Lewis' suit is another story.\n\nBefore trial in 2000, Robertson was granted immunity by the prosecution, led by district attorney Paul Howard, who still holds that office in Atlanta. As part of her agreement, in March 2000, Robertson provided an investigator with several garment bags. Lewis testified in June 2000 he had told her to hold his clothing for him until he returned from Hawaii, where he had planned to go to the Pro Bowl. He also testified he left the suit in his hotel room that morning and had no reason not to turn it over. But the suit he was wearing that night was not among the clothes Robertson provided.\n\n“Were you able to determine whether or not the suits that were displayed in these exhibits were the suits that you had on, the suit that you wore on that night?” Howard asked Lewis at trial.\n\n“No, I haven't seen the suit I wore that night,” Lewis replied then.\n\nBased on other witness testimony at the time, the prosecution alleged Lewis’ bloodstained suit was discarded when Robertson and others drove from Lewis’ hotel that morning and stopped to dump a bag in the dumpster of a fast food restaurant nearby. It’s not clear what was dumped.\n\nOakley, the acquitted co-defendant, said his own clothes from that night went missing while he was taking a shower at Lewis’ hotel suite shortly after the incident. He didn’t testify at trial but wrote about it in his book, Memories of Murder, whose scarce copies are listed for sale on Amazon.com this week at $174 each.\n\n“I wrapped a towel around me and opened the bathroom door and yelled, `Yo, who took my clothes out of the bathroom?’ ” Oakley’s book said.\n\nOakley said King answered by saying he didn’t know and gave him a sweat suit to wear that was twice his size. Oakley wrote he later spotted Robertson getting out of the elevator at the hotel with luggage before she drove with others to the alleged dumpster stop.\n\nIn the 2003 court filing, the Baker family’s attorney said Lewis’ mother spoke with Robertson about the suit two days after the incident, not the morning after the killings when the alleged dumpster dump occurred. Something else was in that bag, according to the filing.\n\nLewis “told Ms. Robertson and Defendant (Carlos) Stafford (described as Robertson’s brother) to throw away a bag in his room that weighed about four pounds and made clanking noises,” the 2003 filing said. “The bag was subsequently placed in a fast food dumpster.”\n\nLewis’ attorneys responded in 2003 by saying this particular assertion about Lewis directing these two to “throw away a bag” was “unsupported by the record.”\n\nNearly 20 years after that Super Bowl night, Lewis and the victims’ families now propose completely different theories about what his clothing that night means to the unsolved case.\n\nThe families\n\nHandsome Lollar, who was about 10 years old at the time of his brother’s death, sells a clothing line in his honor. It’s called “I Am Rich.” He despises Lewis.\n\n“I don’t say his name,” Lollar said of Lewis. “(Expletive) that (expletive). That’s what I got to say. If you’re writing that story, can you put that first? (Expletive) Ray Lewis. Shop `I Am Rich.’ Can you put that in headlines, please, sir?”\n\nAnother Super Bowl in Atlanta doesn’t revive painful memories for the families because they said those memories never left. Based on the missing suit and other evidence, they allege Lewis was more involved than he admitted. They were especially insulted last year when Lewis was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, about 25 miles from where Lollar and Baker are buried in Akron.\n\nIn his 2015 book entitled I Feel Like Going On, Lewis wrote, “I must have been wearing a quarter-million dollars” that night with his suit, jewelry and mink coat.\n\n“I was over the top,” he wrote. “Way, way over the top. I get that. I’m sorry. Frankly, I’m a little embarrassed about all that now, but this was the mentality, and I only mention it here because it became a part of the story.”\n\nLewis wrote his clothes that night “made myself a target” and showed he was “not looking for a fight.” “Point is, when you’re dressed like that, you’re off to the sidelines, and here were these gangbangers stepping to us from the shadows.”\n\nIn 2013, CNN asked Lewis’ defense attorney from 2000, Ed Garland, what happened to the suit.\n\n“It went to the cleaners and was in the suits that were in his closet,” Garland said. “The prosecution didn't do the things they needed to do to get access to the suit.” He said then he didn’t know that suit’s whereabouts.\n\nNo supporting evidence of the suit going to the cleaners was found in the court record, however. And the prosecution did attempt to access the suit by making a deal with Robertson to turn over his clothes. The suit wasn't found among them.\n\nWilson, Baker’s uncle, notes that blood matching his nephew’s was found in the limo carrying Lewis and others. Howard, the prosecutor, noted Lewis' blood was found on a bathrobe and pillow at his hotel. At trial, Lewis said the blood on the pillow came from a prior football head injury but didn't know how blood got on the robe. Lewis also admitted to going to a sporting goods store the day before with Oakley and Sweeting, who purchased knives there.\n\nIn his defense, Lewis’ attorneys pointed to Baker as starting the fight by hitting Oakley on the head with a champagne bottle.\n\nLewis still expressed sympathy for the families in his book, describing the victims as “poor young men.” “Nobody’s been brought to justice, and they’re still gone and grieving,” he wrote. The families can agree with that.\n\n“If we can keep it alive, some of the stuff will eventually come out,” said Cindy Lollar-Owens, Richard’s aunt. “If we can keep it alive, somebody is going to say something” about what happened.\n\nIn Atlanta, Lewis is scheduled to host a party this week to benefit his foundation, rekindling memories of the last time he partied on the scene of an Atlanta Super Bowl. Much has changed since then. The site of the slayings has been redeveloped, part of a renewed city with a new stadium for Sunday’s game between the Los Angeles Rams and New England Patriots. The address of the old Cobalt nightclub where Lewis went that night is now listed as a sushi restaurant. Howard, the district attorney, is still prosecuting crime but doesn’t want to talk about it.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports submitted questions about the case to his office, including whether it still believes it put the right men on trial. Howard’s office didn’t reply with an answer.\n\nRobertson never testified at the murder trial in 2000 even though she had been granted immunity from prosecution. USA TODAY reported then that Howard didn’t want to call her to the stand after another witness testified that Robertson told her she had burned a photo that would have helped police identify the occupants of the limo and what they were wearing.\n\n\"Anyone who engaged in those kinds of actions is not helpful,\" Howard said then.\n\nFollow sports reporter Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer.

He took the captain band from Messi until his exit, where he hugged Messi on the bench to cap his international career.\n\nAnd this one is for Argentina, the 2024 Copa America champions, after a 1-0 win over Colombia in a final that was eventful to say the least.\n\nLautaro Martinez, the club’s leading scorer this Copa America, scored another in the 112th minute of extra time to help Argentina make history.\n\n“We thought Lautaro would find a chance and blast it toward the net,” Argentine national coach Lionel Scaloni said of Martinez, a late substitute who scored five goals for the club during Copa America.\n\nArgentina won Copa America 2021.

Uruguay would score a last-gasp equalizer through Luis Suárez, before claiming third place after winning a penalty-kick tiebreaker 4-3.\n\nCanada's coach, Jesse Marsch, will have much to praise in his side's strong performance in the tournament. The team finished second in Group A and Marsch expressed optimism about Canada's prospects in the 2026 World Cup. However, the nature of this third-place game defeat will sting, as the Canadians outplayed Uruguay for long stretches and held a lead deep into the second half.\n\nThe dramatic end capped off an exciting game that saw both teams hold the lead. Rodrigo Betancur put Uruguay in front after just eight minutes, only for Ismaël Koné to score a tremendous equalizer in the 22nd minute.\n\nSubstitute Jonathan David seemed to win the game for Canada with an 80th minute goal, only for Suárez to save Uruguay in the game's closing moments.\n\nMore:Uruguay players and Colombia fans fight in stands after Copa America semifinal\n\nCanada vs. Uruguay highlights\n\nWhen is the Copa America final?\n\nArgentina vs. Colombia, Sunday, July 14 at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nCanada Uruguay result: Final score\n\nThe result was a 2-2 draw, with Uruguay defeating Canada 4-3 on penalties.\n\nFinal: Uruguay wins 4-3 on penalties\n\nSuárez converts Uruguay's fourth kick, putting Canada up against it. Davies has a chance to keep his side alive, but his attempt at an extremely risky \"Panenka\" lob ends up kissing the crossbar and bouncing away.\n\nUruguay, after taking a moment to figure out the math, realizes they've won third place. That's hard luck for Canada, who outplayed Uruguay for most of the match only to see it slip away in the final seconds.\n\nKoné penalty saved, Uruguay leads\n\nKoné has had a wonderful tournament, but the young midfielder's penalty is weak and telegraphed, allowing Rochet to dive right and palm it away to start the third round.\n\nDe Arrascaeta doesn't make the same mistake, and Uruguay takes a 3-2 lead.\n\nPenalties: Strange delay, St. Clair booked\n\nIt's not shown on screen, but for some reason Herrera the referee has paused the shootout to come over and book Canada goalkeeper St. Clair before Canada's second shot.\n\nAfter all that, Moise Bombito scores for Canada, while Betancur does the same for Uruguay\n\nPenalties: 1-1 after the first round\n\nJonathan David opens the shootout with a successful shot for Canada, while Uruguay's Federico Valverde responds with a goal of his own.\n\nReminder: We go straight to penalty kicks\n\nIf you're wondering why this game is heading right to penalties rather than going through a 30-minute extra time, you're not alone. With the heat and travel a factor, Copa América organizer CONMEBOL decided that all knockout-round games save for the final would go straight to penalties.\n\nFulltime score: Uruguay 2, Canada 2\n\nThis game has been wild from start to finish, with Uruguay scoring a goal two minutes into second-half stoppage time to send this match to penalties.\n\nGoal: Suarez scores Uruguay 2, Canada 2\n\nJust when it seemed Canada was going to hang on, it all falls apart in stoppage time. Suárez has a dramatic stoppage-time equalizer for Uruguay.\n\nSuárez saw his first look denied by an excellent save by St. Clair, but it took just a few seconds for Uruguay to get another look.\n\nThis time, it's Giménez — a center back pushing up in desperation — expertly feeding Suárez, who is wide open for an easy finish to equalize.\n\nBetancur gets a yellow card\n\nCanada is hunting for a third rather than retreating into a shell. David, putting his fresh legs to use, stripped Betancur of the ball before racing away.\n\nIn a very unconventional foul, Betancur somehow falls backwards, grabbing David's leg and landing on his feet to trip him. Strange or no, it's a clear booking for stopping the attacking opportunity.\n\nGoal: David scores, Canada 2, Uruguay 1\n\nCanada's knocking at the door finally works out, as David's shot from nearly on the ground somehow gets over the line.\n\nIt all started with Koné, who wasn't closed down by Uruguay in the 80th minute. The midfielder launched a rocket towards goal that Rochet managed to save, but David does just enough to poke the rebound home.\n\nIt might have been a surprise for Canada to win this game at kickoff, but they deserve to have this 2-1 lead.\n\nFinal subs for Canada\n\nIt's the 77th minute, and Jesse Marsch goes to his bench for the final time. The influential Osorio and Ahmed come off, with Theo Bair and Liam Millar entering the fray.\n\nMoments later, Koné gets a yellow card after a late challenge on Olaza, giving Uruguay a decent set piece from out on the left.\n\nDavies misses by inches\n\nDavies had been an injury doubt for this game, but the Bayern Munich star has immediately made a difference. From well outside the box, he took aim in the 70th minute, only for his shot to just barely be deflected wide.\n\nRight now at least, Canada looks like the team with more energy, and they're creating just about all of the recent chances.\n\nMore substitutions\n\nUruguay uses its last substitution to replace Viña, who has been given a tough night at the office by Ahmed. Lucas Olaza is on in his place.\n\nCanada, meanwhile, has replaced Oluwaseyi with striker Jonathan David, while Derek Cornelius is on for De Fougerolles at center back.\n\nRochet denies Oluwaseyi, Davies subs on\n\nCanada has stayed dangerous, and it's Oluwaseyi once again in the mix. This time, it's another smart pass from Ahmed, who feeds the striker's smart run only for Rochet to make a huge save to keep things level.\n\nImmediately afterwards, both teams turn to the bench. Uruguay makes another double sub, sending in Brian Rodríguez and Cristian Oliveira for Araújo and Pellistri.\n\nFor Canada, it's Alphonso Davies replacing Alistair Johnston, with Laryea moving to right back in the exchange..\n\nPlay stops as Giménez is cut\n\nThe game is halted in the 49th minute after José María Giménez ends up getting an elbow in the eyebrow.\n\nThat opened up a pretty substantial cut, and referee Alexis Herrera ended up being the one to inform Giménez that he was in fact bleeding, and would need to change jerseys.\n\nGiménez, after getting a new shirt and a wrap on his head to contain the blood, is already back out there.\n\nLuis Suarez enters as the second half kicks off\n\nPlay has resumed, with Uruguay making two subs: Luis Suárez is on for Núñez up top, while attacking midfielder Giorgian de Arrascaeta has replaced defensive midfielder Manuel Ugarte.\n\nHalftime score: Canada 1, Uruguay 1\n\nIt's been an eventful first half, with the scores level after Uruguay and Canada were both dominant for spells. The early stages favored Marcelo Bielsa's side, but Canada found its footing and will walk off wondering how those late chances didn't give them the lead.\n\nCanada will probably be the happier team, as a more experienced Uruguay side kicked off as a solid favorite to claim third place at this Copa América. Instead, this game is truly up for grabs, with plenty of chances at either end.\n\nNández saves Canada chance off the line\n\nCanada is doing everything but score at the moment. This time, Oluwaseyi and Osorio combine to unlock the Uruguay defense.\n\nOsorio is all alone, but his first shot is stuffed by Rochet. The rebound floated up temptingly for the Canada midfielder, but his header over Rochet was hacked off the line by Nahitan Nández, who is in some discomfort after saving a sure goal.\n\nOluwaseyi misses by inches for Canada\n\nAli Ahmed is having an impressive game on the right wing for Canada, and this time his cross found Oluwaseyi wide open.\n\nIt's a tricky chance as Oluwaseyi overran the ball by a step, and the Minnesota United striker could only direct the ball wide. That was a big opportunity.\n\nShaffelburg's dangerous shot blocked\n\nCanada played a slick one-two in the 39th minute, with Osorio sending Jacob Shaffelburg in on goal. However, just as the Nashville SC wide man went for goal, Sebastián Cáceres arrived with a timely block.\n\nCanada had two corners in the aftermath, but neither pans out.\n\nNúñez misses, Canada gets off the hook\n\nOnce Canada set up its wall and Núñez took aim, the 37th minute free kick ends up zipping two yards over the crossbar. Canada won't want to risk another foul like that one, but this time at least they move on with the scores level.\n\nNúñez wins dangerous free kick\n\nLiverpool star Darwin Núñez has been quiet, but he just won a free kick in a superb position just outside the Canadian box.\n\n26th minute: Yellow card for Viña\n\nUruguay defender Matías Viña is given a yellow card for a bad tackle on De Fougerolles in the 26th minute. Viña's studs went right into the Canada center back's shin, but fortunately the latter wasn't injured.\n\nUruguay goal called back\n\nFacundo Pellistri is sure he's put Uruguay back in front, but the Uruguay winger's goal is called back after Araújo is caught just a step offside.\n\nThat's as close a call as you'll see, but it remains 1-1.\n\nGoal: Kone scores Uruguay 1, Canada 1\n\nIsmaël Koné has the equalizer, and it's a spectacular goal. Canada's corner kick went to the back post, and the young midfielder — with his back to goal — hopped up before looping the ball over goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and in.\n\nCanada pressure ends in two close calls\n\nCanada has started to get after Uruguay, and have created two good looks in the 19th and 20th minutes.

It's an unbelievably disappointing performance for the USMNT.\n\nThe USMNT put itself in a difficult position ahead of Monday's match against Uruguay — one of the top teams in the tournament — with a stunning defeat against Concacaf rival Panama on Thursday night. The U.S. entered Monday night's game needing to at least match what Panama did against Bolivia, one of the weakest squads in Copa America. The U.S. was not up to the task. Instead, Uruguay and Panama advance to the knockout round.\n\n\"We had a good start and then brought a lot of energy, but at the end of the day just not enough quality,\" Christian Pulisic told FOX Sports in a postgame interview. \"I felt like we gave it everything, but just couldn't find the solutions to score.\"\n\nThe failure to advance beyond the group stage in Copa America could force major changes in the team, most notably with the job status of coach Gregg Berhalter.\n\n\"Our tournament performance fell short of our expectations. We must do better,\" U.S. Soccer Federation sporting director Matt Crocker said in a statement. \"We will be conducting a comprehensive review of our performance in Copa America and how best to improve the team and results as we look towards the 2026 World Cup.\"\n\nChants of \"fire Gregg\" could be heard during the second half and after the final whistle Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium. After the game, Berhalter acknowledged that his team fell well short of expectations.\n\n\"We know that we're capable of more, and this tournament, we didn't show it,\" Berhalter said.\n\nThe USMNT hoped to use the Copa America to build momentum toward the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Instead, the team is in the unwelcome position in which difficult decisions will need to be made in the two-year build-up to the second World Cup ever held in the U.S.\n\nUSMNT vs. Uruguay highlights\n\nMathias Olivera scored the lone goal in Uruguay's 1-0 win over the U.S., who were knocked out after finishing third in Group C.\n\nSpecial mention must be given for the unique awfulness that was Kevin Ortega’s performance on Monday.\n\nThe Peruvian official had something of a nightmare, which began in the first half when Tyler Adams was shown a yellow card for … being stepped on by Olivera.\n\nBut the true coup de grâce was an unprecedented move in the first half that started with a justified yellow card for U.S. defender Chris Richards. But things went haywire from there.\n\nUruguay attempted a quick restart, which Ortega inexplicably allowed despite being in the process of yellow-carding Richards. The sequence would have resulted in a goal were it not for Tim Ream’s goal-line clearance.\n\n— Seth Vertelney, Pro Soccer Wire\n\nPanama 3, Bolivia 1: César Yanis builds lead\n\nThe USMNT needs a near-miracle now after Panama extended its lead against Bolivia.\n\nCésar Yanis scored in the 91st minute to give Panama its third goal of the game.\n\nHaji Wright replaces Joe Scally\n\nThe USMNT is emptying the bench to get as many attacking players into the game as possible as it desperately tries to save its Copa America campaign. Forward Haji Wright came on for defender Joe Scally in the 79th minute.\n\nWright has four goals for the USMNT, including one during the 2022 World Cup against the Netherlands in the Round of 16.\n\nPanama 2, Bolivia 1: Eduardo Guerrero takes back lead\n\nEduardo Guerrero put Panama back in the lead — and further damaged the USMNT's hopes to advance — with a 79th minute goal.\n\nPanama leads, putting the U.S. in a position where it needs a win to reach the knockout round.\n\nJosh Sargent brought on for USMNT\n\nDesperately needing a goal (or maybe more), the USMNT has subbed on another striker in Josh Sargent. Midfielder Yunus Musah, who was making his first start of the Copa America, was taken off the field during the 72nd minute substitution.\n\nUruguay 1, USA 0: Hopes quickly dashed moments after Bolivia goal\n\nJust moments after Bolivia presented the USMNT with a Copa America lifeline, Uruguay finally broke through with the game's first goal.\n\nIt came off a free kick in which U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner made a save off a header, but the rebound was buried for a goal by defender Mathias Olivera. The play was reviewed by VAR for offsides but later confirmed as a goal.\n\nBolivia 1, Panama 1: USMNT presented with a lifeline\n\nBruno Miranda tied it up for Bolivia in the 69th minute against Panama, and with that goal gave the U.S. a chance to finish second in the group and advance to the knockout round.\n\nThrough 60 minutes, USMNT vs. Uruguay has been a rough one\n\nThe U.S. and Uruguay have combined for just one shot on goal through 60 minutes of play.\n\nThe two teams also have combined for 15 fouls and three yellow cards in a physical game that lacks any rhythm.\n\nPanama still leads Bolivia 1-0, a result that would keep the U.S. out of the knockout stage.\n\nHalftime update: USA 0, Uruguay 0; Panama 1, Bolivia 0\n\nAs things stand at the break for both Copa America Group C games, the USMNT will not advance to the knockout round. The team desperately needs a go-ahead goal to keep its Copa America hopes alive.\n\nWith Panama winning and Uruguay-USA deadlocked, both Uruguay — as the group winner — and Panama — as group runner-up — would advance.\n\nDarwin Núñez issued yellow card in first half stoppage time\n\nUruguay forward Darwin Núñez was presented with a yellow card after a challenge on the USMNT's Joe Scally during the fourth minute of first-half stoppage time.\n\nThe demolition derby nature of this game is taking a toll on both teams — with each already making a first-half substitution — with the game threatening to get out of hand for referee Kevin Ortega.\n\nRicardo Pepi subbed on for Folarin Balogun\n\nThe physical first half between the U.S. and Uruguay resulted in another first-half substitution, as Folarin Balogun was replaced by Ricardo Pepi in the 41st minute.\n\nBalogun had a collision with Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet earlier in the game.\n\nChris Richards issued yellow card\n\nUSMNT defender Chris Richards was issued a yellow card in the 32nd minute.\n\nIf the USMNT were to advance out of the group stage, Richards would miss the next match after earning his second yellow card of the competition.\n\nMaximiliano Araújo stretchered off after collision\n\nUruguay's Maximiliano Araújo had to be stretchered off the field following a collision with the USMNT's Tim Ream.\n\nAraújo immediately subbed out of the game and replaced by Cristian Olivera, who plays professionally for Major League Soccer's Los Angeles FC. Olivera has four goals in 16 games played for LAFC.\n\nPanama 1, Bolivia 0: José Fajardo nets opening goal\n\nJosé Fajardo scored in a 22nd minute to put Panama into the lead against Bolivia, while simultaneously striking a blow to the USMNT's hopes of advancing in the Copa America.\n\nIf Panama wins vs. Bolivia, the USMNT also would need to win while also maintaining its goal differential advantage on Panama to advance.\n\nUSMNT can't convert opportunity in 13th minute\n\nTyler Adams and Gio Reyna pushed forward and nearly were able to get the ball to Folarin Balogun for a goal-scoring chance, but Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet stepped in to halt the opportunity.\n\nBoth the USMNT-Uruguay game and Bolivia-Panama games are scoreless through 15 minutes. If these scorelines hold — a highly unlikely scenario — the U.S. would advance.\n\nWhen is the USMNT's Copa America 2024 game against Uruguay?\n\nKickoff is slated for 9 p.m. ET on Monday, July 1.\n\nWhere will the USMNT's Copa America 2024 game against Uruguay be played?\n\nThe USMNT-Uruguay Copa America 2024 game will be held at Arrowhead Stadium, regular home stadium for the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs, the two-time defending Super Bowl champions. Arrowhead Stadium is among the 11 United States-based venues that will host games for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nHow to watch USMNT vs. Uruguay on TV\n\nThe television broadcast will be available on FS1, with pregame coverage starting at 8 p.m. ET.

Vix will provide a streaming option for Spanish-language broadcasts. Streaming also available on Fubo.\n\nUSMNT starting 11 vs. Uruguay\n\nWith Tim Weah out with a red-card suspension, Yunus Musah will start in his place against Uruguay. This is Musah's fist start of the 2024 Copa America.\n\nGoalkeeper Matt Turner, who suffered a leg injury in Thursday night's loss to Panama, is healthy enough to start.\n\nUruguay starting 11 vs. USMNT\n\nDespite having first place in the group nearly locked up, Uruguay is rolling out a first-choice squad against the U.S.\n\nMaximiliano Araújo and Darwin Núñez each have scored two goals apiece in Copa America 2024 (Argentina's Lautaro Martinez is the tournament's leading goal scorer so far with four). Núñez, who plays his club football for the Premier League's Liverpool, has scored seven goals in his last four games for Uruguay.\n\nLuis Suárez, the all-time leading goal scorer for Uruguay, is available off the bench.\n\nWhat are Monday's Copa America 2024 games?\n\nMonday's Copa America 2024 slate features two games, both involving teams in Group C:\n\n➤ United States vs. Uruguay at Arrowhead Stadium, 9 p.m. ET (FS1)\n\n➤ Bolivia vs. Panama at Inter & Co Stadium in Orlando, 9 p.m. ET (FS2)\n\nThe USMNT put itself in a real tough spot heading into its final group stage match at the 2024 Copa America.\n\nHowever, there are still a number of scenarios that could see the team avoid a stunning group-stage elimination.\n\nThe USMNT can advance by matching or bettering Panama’s result against Bolivia while maintaining its goal differential edge. Both the USMNT and Panama enter the final matchday on three points, with the U.S. holding a two-goal advantage on goal differential, the first tiebreaker.\n\nHere are the USMNT's advancement scenarios:\n\n➤ The USMNT will advance with a win over Uruguay by four or more goals, regardless of Panama’s result.\n\n➤ If the USMNT and Panama both win, then the U.S. will need to maintain its goal differential advantage to advance.\n\n➤ If Panama and Bolivia draw, then the U.S. will advance with a win or draw.\n\n➤ If Bolivia beats Panama, the U.S. will advance with a win or draw, or with a loss if it maintains its goal differential advantage.\n\n— Seth Vertelney, Pro Soccer Wire\n\n2024 Copa America Group C standings\n\nHere is the Group C table heading into Monday night's action:\n\n1. Uruguay: 6 points\n\n2 wins, 0 draws, 0 losses, +7 goal differential\n\n2. USA: 3 points\n\n1 win, 0 draws, 1 loss, +1 goal differential\n\n3. Panama: 3 points\n\n1 win, 0 draws, 1 loss, -1 goal differential\n\n4. Bolivia: 0 points\n\n0 wins, 0 draws, 2 losses, -7 goal differential\n\nWhat are the odds for the USMNT vs. Uruguay Copa America match?\n\nAccording to BetMGM, these are the odds for Monday night's match: United States +150; Draw +210; Uruguay +195. The over/under for goals is 2.5.\n\nWhat are the 2024 Copa America odds?\n\nAccording to the latest BetMGM odds, Argentina (+125) remain the favorites to win the 2024 Copa America, followed by Brazil (+275), Uruguay (+400) and Colombia (+600). The odds for the USMNT to win the 2024 Copa America are +2500.\n\nArgentina’s Lautaro Martínez (-135) is the favorite to score the most goals in the 2024 Copa America, according to BetMGM. He is followed by Brazil's Vinicius Junior (+200), Uruguay's Darwin Núñez (+250), Argentina's Lionel Messi (+1200) and Julián Álvarez (+1200).\n\nFOX Sports soccer analyst Alexi Lalas believes that U.S. men's soccer coach Gregg Berhalter will be coaching for his job on Monday night against Uruguay.\n\nThe USMNT suffered a shocking 2-1 defeat against Panama on Thursday night, leaving the team on the brink of an unthinkable group-stage exit at the Copa América.\n\nFor ex-USMNT defender Lalas, Monday’s game in Kansas City is now make-or-break for the embattled boss. But he didn’t necessarily view that as a negative, given the match also provides the coach with an opportunity to achieve a long-awaited signature win.\n\n\"But there’s a strange part of me that said, ‘You know what? All chips in, all right?’\" Lalas said. \"We talked so much about this tournament being an assessment of this team, an assessment of head coach Gregg Berhalter relative to getting out of the group and playing against the likes of Colombia and Brazil. But you know what? That challenge and that assessment — that ultimate assessment — is now going to happen in the third game against Uruguay.\n\n\"They better be up for it.\"\n\n— Seth Vertelney, Pro Soccer Wire\n\nWhich players are on the USMNT and Uruguay rosters?\n\nUSMNT roster\n\nGoalkeepers (3): Ethan Horvath (Cardiff City/Wales), Sean Johnson (Toronto FC/Canada), Matt Turner (Nottingham Forest/England)\n\nDefenders (9): Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic/Scotland), Kristoffer Lund (Palermo/Italy), Mark McKenzie (Genk/Belgium), Shaq Moore (Nashville SC), Tim Ream (Fulham/England), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/England), Antonee Robinson (Fulham/England), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach/Germany)\n\nMidfielders (7): Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/England), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/Spain), Luca de la Torre (Celta Vigo/Spain), Weston McKennie (Juventus/Italy), Yunus Musah (AC Milan; Italy), Gio Reyna (Nottingham Forest/England), Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/Netherlands)\n\nForwards (7): Brenden Aaronson (Union Berlin/Germany), Folarin Balogun (Monaco/France), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven/Netherlands), Christian Pulisic (AC Milan/Italy), Josh Sargent (Norwich City/England), Tim Weah (Juventus/Italy), Haji Wright (Coventry City/England)\n\nUruguay roster\n\nGoalkeepers (3): Sergio Rochet (Internacional/Brazil), Santiago Mele (Junior de Barranquilla/Colombia), Franco Israel (Sporting Clube/Portugal)\n\nDefenders (9): Ronald Araújo (Barcelona/Spain), José Giménez (Atlético Madrid/Spain), Nicolás Marichal (Dynamo Moscow/Russia), Matías Viña (Flamengo/Brazil), Lucas Olaza (Krasnodar/Russia), Mathías Olivera (Napoli/Italy), Sebastián Cáceres (Club América/Mexico), Guillermo Varela (Flamengo/Brazil), Nahitan Nández (Cagliari/Italy)\n\nMidfielders (8): Maximiliano Araújo (Toluca/Mexico), Manuel Ugarte (Paris Saint-Germain/France), Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham/England, Federico Valverde (Real Madrid/Spain), Emiliano Martínez (Midtjylland/Denmark), Nicolás de la Cruz (Flamengo/Brazil), Giorgian De Arrascaeta (Flamengo/Brazil), Agustín Canobbio (Athletico Paranaense/Brazil)\n\nForwards (6): Brian Rodríguez (Club América/Mexico), Brian Ocampo (Cádiz/Spain), Facundo Pellistri (Granada/Spain), Cristian Olivera (Los Angeles FC/USA), Darwin Núñez (Liverpool/England), Luis Suárez (Inter Miami CF/USA)\n\nMLS players in Copa America 2024\n\nIn all, there are 41 Major League Soccer players on rosters for Copa America teams.\n\nOf the league's 29 teams, 21 will be represented in the tournament.

This year, the 10 CONMEBOL teams will be joined by six Concacaf teams.\n\nThis summer’s edition will be the 48th tournament and only the second time it has ever been held outside of South America.

APEAM expected 1,200 truckloads a week of avocados to head north starting on Monday, but cautioned “if there are limitations delays in transportation, significant losses may occur.”\n\nA least six Mexicans states have suffered fuel shortages, prompting service stations to close or ration gasoline and long gas lines to form – reminiscent of 1970s America. Public transportation has stopped in some states, schools have suspended classes and police forces in places have parked their vehicles or started patrolling with bicycles.\n\nMore:Six Mexican states are run short on gasoline, prompting rush to the pumps\n\nThe shortages stem from an attempt to curb fuel thefts, which have cost the country billions in lost revenue as thieves tap pipes operated by state-run oil company Pemex.\n\nPresident Andrés Manuel López Obrador launched the crackdown in early January by closing pipelines flowing from refineries – moving fuel by a fleet of tanker trucks instead – and deploying soldiers to Pemex installations.\n\n“We’re going to continue taking all necessary actions,” López Obrador said Friday. “There will not be one step back, not even to pause. We’re going to confront this scourge.”\n\nThe tapping Pemex pipes to siphon fuel dates back decades. But the theft mushroomed as crime in the country escalated over the past dozen years and drug cartels got involved in the illicit fuel business.\n\nLópez Obradro said fuel theft costs the country $3.5 billion annually. Pemex, meanwhile, recorded 12 illegal taps per day of its pipelines between 2009 and 2016, according to Jesús Pérez Caballero, professor at College of the Northern Border in Matamoros. That number hit 28 per day in 2017 under then-President Enrique Peña Nieto, while only 1.6 percent of the complaints presented by Pemex ended up in criminal trials.\n\nFuel thieves, meanwhile, have formed fearsome gangs, and Pemex pipes run through areas disputed by drug cartels. The central state of Guanajuato became Mexico’s most murderous as rival drug cartels entered the stolen fuel business. In the southeastern state of Puebla, a “subculture” of fuel theft has formed, Pérez Caballero said, with locals blocking highways when soldiers come to crack down on fuel theft.\n\n“It’s very bad and it got worse through negligence,” David Shields, publisher of Energía a Debate, a Mexican energy industry magazine. The Peña Nieto administration did little to stop it, he added, saying they “went through a bunch of half-hearted measures to crack down on it.”\n\nAMLO, as the president is known, took office Dec. 1 after winning a landslide election on promises to clean up corruption. A poll in the Reforma newspaper says 73 percent of respondents support his crackdown on stolen fuel.\n\nThe federal government insists there is no fuel shortage – only distribution challenges. But on Friday it issued a social media statement calling for the public to “support the president” – a possible violation of government advertising rules, which prohibit using politician’s names in promotional materials.\n\nPublic officials called for people filling up everything from jerrycans to water jugs to avoid panic purchases – common in Mexico, where the population has a history doing the opposite upon hearing politicians assure them that there are no shortages of basic staples.\n\nTaxi driver Héctor Torres wasn’t taking any chances. He waited three hours in a Mexico City gas line to fill up his cab and a jerrycan, but seemed willing to give the president the benefit of the doubt, while disregarding the panic purchasing warning.\n\n“I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” he said. “We have to stop this gasoline theft. If this [shortage] is for changing that, fine.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/14"}]}

But even from its sideways position, the uncrewed robot – built and operated by the space company Intuitive Machines in Houston – was able to transmit photos and data to Earth during its weeklong stay on the moon.\n\nNASA, which helped finance the mission as its primary customer, has indicated that the data collected by its instruments aboard Odysseus will help as the space agency prepares to send astronauts back to the moon in the years ahead.\n\nThe lander, nicknamed \"Odie\" by its creators, sent its last photo Thursday afternoon before its solar power was depleted and lunar nighttime set in. The team hopes to wake Odysseus back up in about three weeks when the sun returns for solar noon, its highest point in the sky, and provides power-generating rays.\n\n\"Goodnight, Odie,\" Intuitive Machines said in a post Thursday on the social media site X. \"We hope to hear from you again.\"\n\nOdysseus lunar mission:See the best pictures from the lander's historic moon landing\n\nOdysseus is first privately built lander to make it to moon\n\nOdysseus' landing not only returned America to the moon for the first time since 1972, but it also marked the first time a commercial company built a spacecraft that made it to the lunar surface.\n\nThe landing, which came a week after Odysseus launched Feb. 15 aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, saw Intuitive Machines accomplish a feat that another private company could not. Pittsburgh-based aerospace company Astrobotic Technology had called off its own moon landing attempt about a month earlier when its Peregrine lander began leaking a critical amount of fuel.\n\nAfter separating from the SpaceX rocket, it took the six-legged Nova-C lander 48 minutes to reach its orbit before it established communication with ground control. The next day, it aced a crucial engine firing test and succeeded in orienting itself in the direction of the moon as it powered ahead.\n\nDisaster struck, though, when telemetry data seemed to indicate the spacecraft failed to land on its six legs and instead came down on its side near Malapert A, a small crater about 190 miles from the moon's south pole region, where water ice is thought to be abundant.\n\nNASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter later confirmed Odysseus' precise position, the southernmost location where any craft has ever landed on the moon, Intuitive Machines said.\n\nOdysseus hit the lunar surface hard upon landing, sending it into a skid as the engines continued to fire. When the engines were throttled down, Odysseus slowly tipped over at a 30-degree angle on what flight controllers believe is a gentle slope.\n\nBefore the craft was powered down Thursday, flight controllers in Houston received and shared Odysseus' farewell image captured Feb. 22 that \"showcases the crescent Earth in the backdrop, a subtle reminder of humanity’s presence in the universe,\" Intuitive Machines said.\n\nFuture NASA-sponsored moon missions ahead\n\nFor NASA, the IM-1 mission has laid the groundwork for the space agency to work with more commercial entities on future space endeavors – including Intuitive Machines IM-2 mission planned for the end of the year.\n\nIntuitive Machines' IM-1 mission was part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS. The space agency paid the company $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon, which they said yielded valuable insights about the unexplored south polar region.\n\nWater ice in the region would not only help sustain astronauts on the surface, but it also would be a source of hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel.\n\nNASA has a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028 to pay private companies like Intuitive Machines to carry scientific payloads on private robotic landers bound for the moon. The excursions will pave the way for NASA's own Artemis moon missions, which will ultimately see the U.S. send astronauts back to the moon to establish a base of operations ahead of trips to Mars.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

It was published this week in Arxiv, an open-access repository of scientific papers.\n\nIt calls for a binary-coded message “developed for transmission to extraterrestrial intelligences in the Milky Way galaxy,” and will include scientific concepts including the human form, according to the proposal.\n\nIt will build on previous messages sent to space, principally the Arecibo message, an interstellar radio message sent to globular star cluster M13 in 1974, the researchers said.\n\nNASA has previously sent aspects of humanity to space. The 2021 Lucy Mission included a poem by inaugural National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman, lyrics and quotes from the Beatles and a fossil belonging to the ancient human ancestor that gave the mission its name. Voyager 1 and 2 took with them golden phonograph records with images and sounds meant to reflect human culture.\n\nThe BITG proposal plans to leave out human culture and language entirely, focusing on concepts that may be be more legible to extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI): mathematics and physics.\n\n“Though the concept of mathematics in human terms is potentially unrecognizable to ETI, binary is likely universal across all intelligence,” the researchers said. Therefore, the message was coded in the binary language of zeroes and ones used in computing systems.\n\nThe message includes a time stamp, location stamp, visual representations of the DNA double-helix structure and a hydrogen atom, visual explanations of algebra and other mathematical operations, an illustration of the solar system, a map of the earth, and, of course, a smiling illustration of two human bodies, one male and one female. The pair are waving at the viewer.\n\n“This information is part of the basic expectation of any message to an ETI as it allows recognition of our appearance – a detail of a given ETI that would no doubt be of interest to us, and relevant should further exchanges be established, or we someday physically meet,” the scientists said.\n\nIn other words, aliens might be eager to see what humans look like, just as we would be curious to see if they match the green, bug-eyed extraterrestrials of science fiction fame.\n\nThe messages close with an invitation for extraterrestrials to respond using a radio telescope apparatus of their own.\n\nThe report proposes using the FAST Observable Field, the largest radio telescope in the world, located in Pingtang, Guizhoou, China, to send the message.\n\n“The message is simple but meaningful,” the researchers said, with the ultimate goal to “start a dialogue with ETI – no matter how far in the future that might occur.”\n\nThe project was created with support from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, under contract with NASA, and the NASA ROSES Exoplanet Research Program.", "authors": ["Zoe Sottile"], "publish_date": "2022/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/world/spacex-nasa-first-native-american-space-nicole-mann-scn/index.html", "title": "NASA, SpaceX to send first Native American woman to orbit | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe first Native American woman ever to travel to Earth’s orbit will take flight this week on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. The astronaut, NASA’s Nicole Aunapu Mann, will serve as mission commander.\n\nThe former US Marine Corps pilot’s role can be thought of as the crew’s quarterback.\n\nMann’s historic journey — and her first trip to space since joining NASA’s astronaut corps in 2013 — is on track to kick off Wednesday at 12 p.m. ET, when Mann and her three crewmates will ride in their spacecraft atop a 230-foot-tall (70-meter-tall) SpaceX rocket set to take off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. They’ll travel to the International Space Station for a five-month stay, joining a long list of astronauts to serve as full-time staff aboard the orbiting laboratory, which has hosted humans for nearly 22 years.\n\nOn her trip, Mann will carry some mementos: her wedding rings, a surprise gift for her family, and a dream catcher that her mother gave her.\n\n“That will be a special part of my childhood and of my community and my family,” Mann told reporters during a news conference Saturday, just after arriving by plane to the launch site.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the aerospace company's Crew Dragon spacecraft rests at launch pad 39A on October 3. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHer crewmates will also represent a broad swath of cultural backgrounds. She’ll fly alongside fellow NASA astronaut Josh Cassada, who is from Minnesota; Koichi Wakata of Japan’s space agency, called JAXA, or Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; and Anna Kikina, a Roscomos cosmonaut who joined this mission as part of a US-Russian ride-sharing agreement.\n\n“I am very proud to represent Native Americans and my heritage,” Mann said. “I think it’s important to celebrate our diversity and also realize how important it is when we collaborate and unite, the incredible accomplishments that we can have.”\n\nFrom Northern California to NASA\n\nMann grew up in Northern California and is a registered member of the Wailacki tribe of the Round Valley reservation, which encompasses several Indigenous tribes that were forced onto the same post-colonial reservation in the mid-1800s.\n\n“A lot of my extended family still lives in that area,” Mann told Indian Country Today in August. “We actually got together a couple of weeks ago for a family reunion. So it’s really important, I think, for us to continue to create those bonds.”\n\nA colonel in the Marine Corps, Mann began a military career as a second lieutenant in 1999, according to NASA’s website. Two years later, she began flight training and went on serve two deployments, supporting combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to NASA. She then earned a spot as a test pilot, flying F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet aircraft.\n\nMann said she realized only later in life that she wanted to be an astronaut — and that such a role was feasible.\n\n“I was in my mid 20s,” she told reporters in August. “I realized that being an astronaut was not only something that was a possible dream, but actually something that’s quite attainable. I think as a young girl, I just didn’t realize that that was an opportunity and a possibility.”\n\nNASA astronaut Nicole A. Mann speaks during a news conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on October 1. John Raoux/AP\n\nAfter being selected for NASA’s astronaut corps in 2013, Mann waited years to be assigned to a mission. And after being slotted into her role on Crew-5, Mann spent 18 months in intensive training, including practicing spacewalks underwater and studying Russian to better communicate with her cosmonaut counterparts.\n\nREAD MORE: The big numbers that make the Artemis I mission a monumental feat\n\nDiversity in space\n\nMann’s mission, dubbed Crew-5, will mark the sixth astronaut launch that SpaceX has carried out in partnership with NASA since 2020 as part of a broader effort to outsource human spaceflight and other ISS activities to the private sector.\n\nIn her role as commander, Mann will be responsible for ensuring the spacecraft is on track from the time it launches until it docks with the ISS and again when it returns home with the four Crew-5 astronauts next year. Never before has a woman taken on the commander role on a SpaceX mission, though a couple women served in that position during the Space Shuttle Program, which NASA retired in 2011.\n\nI hope it inspires adults as well to follow your dreams and to realize that the limitations that we may have had in the past are starting to be broken down. Nicole Aunapu Mann\n\nIn the years after NASA was formed in the mid-20th century, astronauts were all White men — even through the final days of the space agency’s famed Apollo program. That only changed when Sally Ride became the first American woman in space in 1983, and she was followed shortly after by the first Black person in space, Guion Bluford.\n\nREAD MORE: Meet the space trailblazers of color who empowered others to dream\n\nSince then, NASA has worked to make its astronaut corps more diverse. The space agency’s new, cornerstone human spaceflight program, called Artemis, aims to land the first woman and first person of color on the moon.\n\nThe Artemis program hasn’t taken off yet, as NASA is still working to get its mega moon rocket off the ground. But Mann was selected as one of 18 astronauts that could be assigned to the program’s first moon landing mission.\n\nThe diverse group of Artemis astronauts have been taking turns traveling to the ISS, where they conduct science experiments and keep of the maintenance of the aging space station as well as prepare for a possible journey to deep space later this decade.\n\n“What we are going to do in low-Earth orbit is a stepping stone to achieve those goals of exploration into deep space,” Mann said, using the term “low-Earth orbit” to refer to the area of space where the ISS orbits. “We’re going to gain a ton of experience flying in low-Earth orbit, and any of us could be assigned to an Artemis mission in the future. And hopefully we’ll walk on the moon together one day. “\n\nOn Saturday, Mann also commented on the importance of having astronauts with a wide range of experiences and backgrounds.\n\n“We hope that this will inspire young children throughout the world that come from varying, different backgrounds,” she said. “In fact, I hope it inspires adults as well to follow your dreams and to realize that the limitations that we may have had in the past are starting to be broken down.”", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/27/asteroids-to-pass-earth/74229608007/", "title": "Asteroids to pass by Earth this week, one closer than the moon", "text": "Two asteroids have stargazers' attention this week – one the size of Mount Everest and another that will pass closer than the moon – just days before Asteroid Day.\n\nThe massive asteroid, named 415029 (2011 UL21), will pass Earth Thursday. At its closest point, it will be more than 4 million miles away, or 17 times as far from Earth as the moon, according to a European Space Agency news release. At more than 7,500 feet across, it is larger than 99% of near-Earth asteroids.\n\nTwo days later, the smaller asteroid will hurtle much closer to Earth, although astronomers say it also has a 0% chance of impact. The asteroid, dubbed 2024 MK, will pass within the moon's orbit of Earth, about 180,000 miles away. It will be observable from clear, dark skies with a small telescope on Saturday, the European Space Agency said.\n\nAstronomers in South Africa spotted 2024 MK just weeks ago.

The United Launch Alliance, which manufactured the rocket, said in a statement that the cancellation was \"out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the flight and pad crew.\"\n\nTrouble with a valve in the rocket's upper stage prompted engineers to make the call to delay the long-awaited launch – a critical demonstration of Boeing's spacecraft as it seeks to win approval from NASA to make routine orbital trips on the space agency's behalf.\n\nNASA is now eyeing a May 17 launch date after the United Launch Alliance initially said that the launch would not be able to take place any earlier than Friday.

The United Launch Alliance said the decision came after an anomaly was detected on the pressure regulation valve in the liquid oxygen tank of the rocket's upper stage.\n\nNASA and Boeing also confirmed the postponement. The two-person crew of Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita \"Suni\" Williams safely exited Starliner and returned to their quarters, Boeing said on its website.\n\n\"The team needs additional time to complete a full assessment,\" the United Launch Alliance said in a statement.\n\nWhen will the Boeing Starliner launch now?\n\nAfter the mission was canceled, the United Launch Alliance initially said that it would target another launch attempt no earlier than Friday.\n\nHowever, engineers who have since analyzed the data to fully understand the issue have determined that more time is needed.

Both astronauts are Navy veterans who have each ventured to space twice before.\n\nOnce the Starliner launches and reaches the space station, the astronauts are scheduled to spend a little more than a week testing the spacecraft and its subsystems before they board the capsule for a return trip to Earth. The craft will land in the American Southwest using parachutes that will slow it down to 4 mph before inflating large airbags.\n\nWhy is NASA contracting with Boeing?\n\nBoeing hopes to join Elon Musk's SpaceX as one of two companies contracted by NASA for routine missions to the space station and low-Earth orbit.\n\nAs part of NASA’s commercial crew program, Boeing was awarded $4.8 billion and SpaceX was awarded $3.1 billion in 2014 to develop their respective spacecraft, Florida Today reported.\n\nUnder NASA's more ambitious commercial lunar program, it's also paid SpaceX $2.9 billion to develop the first commercial human lander for the agency's Artemis moon missions and eventually trips to Mars.\n\nSpaceX, whose Dragon spacecraft flew its first human mission in 2020, recently saw its Crew-7 return to Earth after nearly 200 days aboard the International Space Station. The eighth crew comprised of three NASA astronauts and one cosmonaut launched on March 3 and docked on March 5 to await the arrival of Boeing's Starliner capsule.\n\nIf the mission is a success, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and its systems for crewed rotation missions to the space station, according to NASA.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

NASA's recent video experiment was to test its new Deep Space Optical Communications system, which consists of a flight laser transceiver, a ground laser transmitter and a ground laser receiver.\n\nDesigned to transmit data from deep space at rates 10 to 100 times greater than the radio frequency systems used today, the new system is intended to be better equipped to accommodate the massive amounts of science data expected to be transmitted on future space missions – such as ones to Mars.\n\nAnd if the results of Taters' video are any indication, the system is showing promise.\n\n“Despite transmitting from millions of miles away, it was able to send the video faster than most broadband internet connections,” Ryan Rogalin, the project’s receiver electronics lead, said in a statement.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Fear not: the U.S. space agency isn't launching any sort of attack against the sun, but is rather hoping to gather some valuable scientific data about how solar eclipses alter Earth’s upper atmosphere.\n\nHere's what to know about NASA's rocket experiment, and how to tune in to see it unfold in real time.\n\nLawsuit over eclipse:New York inmates say a prison lockdown for solar eclipse violates religious freedom\n\nWhy is NASA launching rockets during the total solar eclipse?\n\nNASA is using spacecraft called sounding rockets that are equipped with scientific instruments to take measurements and perform experiments during its sub-orbital flight.\n\nThe three rockets will launch from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and will reach an intended altitude of 260 miles, NASA said. That's high enough to study disturbances during a total solar eclipse in the ionosphere, a region of Earth’s atmosphere between 55 to 310 miles above the ground.\n\nThe sounding rockets had been previously launched and recovered in October from the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico during the annular solar eclipse, a similar celestial event that was distinct for the \"ring of fire\" shape it created in the sky. This time around, NASA said the rockets have been refurbished with new instrumentation.\n\nThe ionosphere forms the boundary between Earth's lower atmosphere – where humans live and breathe – and the vacuum of space. Studying its short-term changes during an eclipse is difficult to do with other instrumentation like satellites, which are unlikely to cross into an eclipse's path to make observations and record data, said mission leader Aroh Barjatya, an engineering physicist at Florida's Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n\nBarjatya and his team hope to collect data on how the sun's sudden disappearance during the eclipse creates disturbances that could interfere with communications here on Earth.\n\n“Understanding the ionosphere and developing models to help us predict disturbances is crucial to making sure our increasingly communication-dependent world operates smoothly,\" Barjatya said in a statement.\n\nHow to watch NASA's sounding rocket experiment\n\nThe public will have plenty of opportunities to witness the rocket launches themselves on the big day, both in person and online.\n\nThe launch window for the mission is 2:40 p.m. to 4:05 p.m. EST, and the rockets are scheduled to launch approximately 45 minutes apart.\n\nThose who find themselves in Virginia during the solar eclipse may consider watching the launches in person from 1 to 4 p.m. EST at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility Visitor Center from the coast of Virginia.\n\nBut for most people, the most accessible way to view the rocket launches will be from home.\n\nNASA will host a live stream of the launches on its Wallops YouTube page, with coverage of the mission beginning 10 minutes before the scheduled launch time, according to NASA. The takeoff will also be featured in NASA’s official broadcast of the total solar eclipse.\n\nWhat else to know about the April 8 eclipse\n\nHundreds of cities in 13 states are on the path of totality for this year's total solar eclipse, which will pass from southwest to northeast across Mexico, the United States and Canada.\n\nYou won't want to miss it, as this is the last such eclipse in North America until 2044.\n\nAnd don't forget: While a total solar eclipse offers sky-gazers the rare opportunity to witness the display with the naked eye, solar eclipse glasses are still needed until it's safe to do so. Certified solar eclipse glasses are crucial for spectators to avoid the sun's retina-damaging rays.\n\nBut when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to remove them for a short period of time.\n\nAs you make your eclipse-viewing plans, this guide should help you find some last-minute eclipse glasses, while these interactive maps should help you chart the time and duration for when totality would occur in cities along the path.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The lunar landing is also the first by an American-built spacecraft since NASA's final Apollo mission in 1972.\n\n\"Houston, Odysseus has found its new home,\" Stephen Altemus, president and CEO of Intuitive Machines, said shortly after the landing at 5:23 p.m. CST.\n\nThe announcement came about 10 minutes after it happened after some communications challenges. Tension built as the team behind the IM-1 mission waited for confirmation with bated breath.\n\n\"I know this was a nail-biter, but we are on the surface and we are transmitting,\" Altemus said. \"Welcome to the moon.\"\n\nWhat is the Odysseus lunar lander?\n\nNicknamed for the Greek hero of Homer's epic poem \"The Odyssey,\" the Odysseus lander hitched a ride to orbit last Thursday aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, which launched from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nRead more: What Odysseus will do now.\n\nIntuitive Machines built the Odysseus to carry cargo for NASA and other private customers to the lunar surface for its IM-1 mission. Formally called a Nova-C, the lander is a 14-foot-tall hexagonal cylinder with six legs that the space company has operated from a mission control center in Houston.\n\nA failed lunar lander attempt\n\nOdysseus may be the first privately built spacecraft to reach the moon, but it's hardly the first to try.\n\nIn January, Pittsburgh-based aerospace company Astrobotic sent its Peregrine lander on a doomed mission to the moon that ended with the spacecraft burning up in Earth's atmosphere days later.\n\nShortly after the craft separated from the United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocket, Peregrine's propulsion began leaking a critical amount of propellant that forced Astrobotic to abandon plans of landing on the moon.\n\nIntuitive Machines lander's journey to the moon\n\nIntuitive Machines encountered hiccups along the way – including temporary communication delays – but none so detrimental that it could threaten the mission.\n\nAfter separating from the SpaceX rocket last week, it took the lander 48 minutes to reach its orbit before it established communication with ground control in Houston, Intuitive Machines said. An engine firing Friday helped position the lander toward the moon and allowed flight controllers to determine that the engine burn and throttle systems needed to land were functioning as intended.\n\nThe tests set the Odysseus craft up to enter lunar orbit Wednesday ahead of its landing Thursday near the moon's south polar region. Scientists have long been interested in studying the south pole because of the water ice thought to be abundant within its craters.\n\nIntuitive Machines is working with NASA\n\nIntuitive Machines' lunar mission is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.\n\nThe U.S. space agency has a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028 to pay private companies to place scientific payloads on private robotic landers like Odysseus bound for the lunar surface. The success of Intuitive Machines in putting a lander on the moon will now pave the way for NASA to work with more commercial entities on future space endeavors.\n\nAs the primary customer for the Odysseus mission, NASA paid Intuitive Machines $118 million to take its scientific payloads to the moon. The instruments will collect valuable data for NASA as it prepares to send astronauts back to the lunar surface for its Artemis program for the first time since the last Apollo mission 52 years ago.\n\nNASA's Artemis program mission delayed\n\nNASA had intended to launch its Artemis II astronauts into orbit by the end of the year on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon ahead of a moon landing itself a year later for Artemis III. But the Artemis program missions have since been delayed by at least a year after NASA encountered a slew of issues, including a battery flaw on the vehicle that will ferry astronauts to the moon.\n\nOnce NASA is back on track in the years ahead, the agency intends to send a crew to the moon's south polar region, where it will will lay the groundwork for NASA to establish a permanent human presence on and around the moon ahead of future missions to Mars.\n\nContributing: Amanda Lee Myers and Mike Snider.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

What to ...", "text": "Touted as the largest celestial spectacle of the decade, Monday's total solar eclipse has been drawing attention for weeks across the country. But how many people will really be able to view the phenomenon?\n\nStorms or cloud coverage in certain areas across the path of totality at the time of the eclipse will prevent people in some places from seeing the eclipse. According to the National Weather Service, the best places for clear viewing are northern New England and from southern Missouri to central Indiana.\n\nForecasters are predicting a 20-30% chance of rain showers in Texas, Oklahoma, southern Arkansas, Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and western New York during the timeframe of the eclipse, and a 60-90% chance of thunderstorms in the south-central U.S.\n\nThe path of totality does not extend to Arizona. Metro Phoenix residents will be able to see a partial eclipse for about 2.5 hours, with only 64% of the sun being obstructed by the moon. The National Weather Service in Phoenix is predicting cloud coverage of only 39% around 11 a.m., but there is still some uncertainty.\n\n“The main uncertainty with cloud cover that we have right now is going to be the timing of when that cloud cover may push out,” said Ryan Worley, a meteorologist at the weather service in Phoenix.\n\nWhere will the solar eclipse be visible?Here are the best places to watch in Arizona\n\nWhere will the eclipse be visible?\n\nA total eclipse occurs when the moon, appearing the same size as the sun, moves into the same path as the sun and blocks the entire disk. For those in the direct path of the eclipse, darkness like that of night ensues for several minutes, until the moon travels outside the same path as the sun.\n\nAside from near complete darkness, the \"totality\" — when only the outer ring of the sun’s atmosphere is visible — can silence animals and stir an unnatural feeling for everyone.\n\nThe eclipse path begins in southern Texas shortly before 1:30 p.m. local time, before moving through portions of Midwest states, ending its journey in the United States in Maine a few minutes past 3:30 p.m. local time.\n\nMost Americans will be able to view the eclipse to some degree, but the amount one can see really depends on the location compared to the path of totality.\n\nSome of the major cities in each state that falls in the path of totality that have a chance to see the total eclipse include: Dallas and San Antonio, Texas; Idabel, Oklahoma; Poplar Bluff, Missouri; Little Rock, Arkansas; Paducah, Kentucky; Indianapolis and Evansville, Indiana; Carbondale, Illinois; Cleveland and Toledo, Ohio; Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, New York; Burlington, Vermont; Lancaster, New Hampshire; Caribou, Maine; and Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\nEclipse viewing in Phoenix\n\nIn Phoenix, residents will be able to see the moon move into the sun’s path around 10:08 a.m., peaking at 11:19 a.m., and finishing at 12:34 p.m. The National Weather Service says the views will depend on how clouds from a weekend front move out.\n\n“It could be pretty cloudy in the morning, around 50-60% coverage, but it looks like as we progress more towards when the eclipse is going to occur, that cloud cover will start to push out, so the conditions should be relatively favorable for the viewing of the eclipse,\" Worley said. \"But we'll certainly become more confident in what we're going to see as we get closer.\"\n\nTo get updated forecasts closer to the day of the eclipse, visit the National Weather Service’s interactive cloud forecast, updated 24/7.\n\nPhoenix residents may not be able to see the full eclipse, but they will enjoy cool temperatures this weekend, well below normal for this time of year, before warming up next week.\n\nHigh temperatures are expected to reach only the mid- to upper 60s Saturday, rising Sunday and Monday to the lower 70s and reaching a nearer-normal 80 degrees by Tuesday. The average high temperature for this time of year is 83 to 84 degrees, according to the weather service.\n\nCaralin Nunes writes about weather and related topics for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nA total eclipse, like the one happening on April 8, means the sun suddenly disappears at a time of day when it shouldn't – and that can have some surprising effects on animals' behaviors.\n\nDuring previous eclipses, people around the globe have noticed a surreal silence as birds, bugs and animals interrupted their normal activities.\n\nAnd researchers have observed all sorts of unusual things at zoos: Flamingos gathered in a circle around their babies to protect them. Giraffes began galloping around their enclosure. Swarms of birds large enough to appear on radar suddenly left the sky and roosted in trees. Gorillas marched to their dens, expecting their final meal of the day. The ancient Galapagos tortoises started mating.\n\nWith a full solar eclipse coming to a large swath of the United States in April, scientists are gearing up to observe animals at multiple zoos in the path of the totality, in part because they were so surprised at what they discovered in 2017 during the last total solar eclipse in the U.S.\n\n“I thought it was going to be nonsense, I didn’t think animals were going to be affected. at all,” said Adam Hartstone-Rose, a professor of comparative anatomy at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. “Clouds pass over and they don’t react. It was so ephemeral.”\n\nFor the 2024 eclipse, scientists will be watching the birds and beasts – and inviting citizen scientists to offer their observations as well – as the celestial curtain falls.\n\nPets, too, are being included in the surveys, though veterinarians say overall the biggest effect on their behavior will not be the sudden darkness, but rather the behavior of the humans around them.\n\n\"They're going to react more to our reactions, our excitement and our anxiety than anything actually from the actual eclipse,\" said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\n2017 eclipse provoked some odd animal behavior\n\nTo set up the study, Hartstone-Rose and his collaborators set more than 40 people to watch 12 animal exhibits at the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in Columbia, South Carolina. They began a few days before the eclipse so they could gauge how much the animals' behavior changed.\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse?Search your ZIP code for a viewing guide\n\nIt was a perfect place to do the experiment. At 2:41 pm on Aug. 21, 2017 the greater Columbia area experienced the longest period of totality of any city on the East Coast, slightly more than 2 minutes and 30 seconds of total darkness.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the animals exhibited changed behavior.\n\nGorillas : “Marched all together to be let in for the evening and were kind of perplexed, like ‘Why aren’t you letting us in?’” Hartstone-Rose said.\n\n: “Marched all together to be let in for the evening and were kind of perplexed, like ‘Why aren’t you letting us in?’” Hartstone-Rose said.

Galapagos tortoises: The Riverbanks zoo has a group of 35 of the slow-moving giants which can reach 900 pounds and live for more than 150 years. During the peak of the eclipse, they started breeding.\n\nScaling up for the 2024 eclipse\n\nFor 2024, Hartstone-Rose is scaling up animal observations across the country. There will be studies at multiple zoos in the path of the totality, which will allow a larger number of animals to be observed.

I’m very curious to see if they react by mating.\"\n\nBirds fall silent, head to their roosts\n\nAlmost anyone who’s been outdoors during an eclipse notices two things – the eerily light and the sudden silencing of the birds and insects.\n\nAnimals simply don’t know what to do with eclipses because they’re not something their biology is adapted for, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology who has studied bird behavior during eclipses.\n\n“Eclipses aren’t common but they’re not rare and we humans can plan for them. But for short-lived animals that may not be tracking astronomy with math, it’s pretty unexpected.”\n\nIn 2017 he and a group of researchers used radar to see just what the birds were doing during the eclipse, a project they plan to expand during this year’s April eclipse.\n\nUsing 143 weather radar stations, they watched the behavior of several types of birds.\n\nDaytime soaring birds, raptors such as turkey vultures and red-tailed hawks, tended to go to roost. They depend on the thermals off the sun’s energy to soar so when it gets dark they head down to the Earth because they expect the thermals to go away, he said.\n\nBirds that forage for insects during flight, such as swallows and purple martins, also leave the sky.\n\nThey’re foraging for insects while they’re flying but when night comes there’s a decline in their food source and they can’t see as well, he said.\n\nWhen Farnsworth and his collaborators watched radar images in 2017, the extent of birds’ behavior was surprising.\n\n“For me, the take home from the 2017 eclipse was the magnitude of the response we saw,” he said. Their study shows huge clouds of birds that had been wheeling through the sky swooped down to the surface in numbers so large it showed up clearly on radar scans.\n\nThis year researchers plan on expanding the number of stations they are monitoring and expect to see the behavior across a much larger swath of the country, from Texas to Maine.\n\nUSA TODAY 10Best:10 solar eclipse fun facts to share with your friends\n\nA call to all Americans to observe in April\n\nTo get the maximum number of eyes watching to see what animals do, there's also a citizen science project that will let people across the country gather information about what wild, farm and domestic animals do.\n\nThe project is called SolarEclipseSafari.org. Taking part won’t interfere with people’s eclipse experience but will allow scientists to collate information about how animals react both inside the totality and in areas where there’s only partial darkness.\n\n“We’re hoping to have thousands watching,” he said.\n\nA NASA-funded study will also listen for the distinct quiet that falls when the sun is eclipsed and animals fall silent. Americans will be invited to capture sound as part of the Eclipse Soundscape Project.\n\nGo outside and pay attention\n\nAll the researchers USA TODAY interviewed had one piece of advice – the most important thing about an eclipse is to simply go outside and experience it. Don’t fiddle with phones and cameras or computers the whole time.\n\n“Just listen and look,” said Farnsworth. “It’s easy to get wrapped up in the technology. It’s really important to do the observations with your eyes and ears and make the connection to nature that comes with that.”\n\nThe experience, as Hartstone-Rose learned, can be life-altering.\n\n“It’s awe-inspiring,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/04/celestial-events-april-solar-eclipse-devil-comet-lyrids-pink-moon/73201013007/", "title": "After total solar eclipse, 3 more celestial events visible in April", "text": "Few celestial events have managed to capture the public's collective attention and inspire such a widespread sense of awe as next week's total solar eclipse.\n\nAnd considering both the rarity and the sheer grandeur of the cosmic display – the first in North America in seven years and the last for two decades – it's no wonder why. But amid the clamor to watch as the moon passes in front of the sun and ushers in a dazzling sight across the continent, it may be easy to overlook some other celestial events that are also worthy of our admiration.\n\nCome Monday, the 115-mile-wide eclipse will move from southwest in Mexico to northeast in Canada. In the United States, 13 states fall on the path of totality, whereby the moon will completely block the sun's disc, leading to a period of darkness and revealing the sun's outermost layer known as the corona.\n\nWhen the eclipse has come and gone, a few other celestial events this month will give skygazers other reasons to look up. Here are three of them.\n\nSolar eclipse experiment:Here's why NASA is launching 3 sounding rockets into space during the total solar eclipse\n\nApril 21: The 'devil comet'\n\nWhile the famed \"devil comet\" may be visible during the solar eclipse itself, astronomers say that the celestial body will be best sighted on April 21.\n\nThat's the day that the comet, officially known as 12P/Pons-Brooks, will make its closest approach to the sun in its 71-year orbit of the massive star.\n\nThe \"devil comet,\" which earned its demonic nickname from its distinctive tail that resembles horns, is typically visible to only those with the strongest of telescopes. But on the day it's closest to the sun, its brightness should increase so much that it will become visible to the naked eye.\n\nApril 21-22: Lyrids meteor shower\n\nThe Lyrids, one of the oldest-known meteor showers on record, has reliably peaked every year in late April like clockwork for thousands of years.\n\nThe shower, pieces of debris from the Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher, is one of four major meteor showers each year with a sharp peak. This year, that peak falls between April 21-22, according to EarthSky.org.\n\nThe first meteor shower of the spring, the fast and bright meteors of the Lyrids will appear to be flying across the night sky. While NASA notes that the Lyrids can surprise watchers with as many as 100 meteors seen per hour, in general, 10-20 Lyrid meteors can be seen per hour during the peak.\n\nApril 23: Pink moon\n\nThe pink moon, otherwise known as the first full moon of the spring, will rise April 23.\n\nNamed for the moss pink wildflower that sprouts this time of year, the moon won't appear as pink to our eyes here on Earth.\n\nBut that won't make it any less spectacular to witness.\n\nAs it rises just above the horizon, the pink moon will appear its biggest and take on a golden hue, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice; Wyatte Grantham-Philips\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

One swirling around the internet, gaining attention on social media platforms, is that the eclipse will bring on a massive human sacrifice. The earthquake in New York City on Friday didn’t help quell these kinds of far-fetched predictions.\n\nThe eclipse has also fueled the ideas of conspiracy theorists, theologians’ theories of eschatology and climate-change fanatics.\n\n\"Far-right conspiracy theorists are claiming that 'elites' will use the eclipse to control humanity, sway the presidential election, and everything else under the sun,” a WIRED headline reads.\n\nOnly in America could a total solar eclipse usher in the apocalypse and simultaneously influence an election.\n\nAlmost every generation believes they are living in the end of days. Maybe we are. Maybe we aren’t.

After all, there's no shortage of meteor showers, passing comets and various types of eclipses that capture humanity's collective attention.\n\nIf looking up at the stars to catch a glimpse of a passing celestial show isn't your thing, you may be feeling overwhelmed with all the hoopla surrounding the upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8.\n\nBut when astronomers implore you not to miss this one, they really *really* mean it.\n\nYou've probably heard about the 2024 eclipse, which will shroud much of the U.S. in darkness as it moves from the southwest in Mexico to the northeast in Canada. You've likely heard that this is North America's first total solar eclipse in seven years, and the last for another 20.\n\nWhat you might not know, though, is why this year's eclipse is projected to be \"the most accessible eclipse this nation has experienced in this generation,” at least according to Nicola Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.\n\nWhat Fox means is that this year's total solar eclipse is unlike any eclipse we've witnessed in our lifetime – even in 2017. And we're unlikely to witness anything like it again.\n\nHere's what makes the 2024 eclipse different from the 2017 event.\n\nWhen is the 2024 total solar eclipse?Your guide to glasses, forecast, where to watch.\n\nSun will be at peak activity, making its corona brighter\n\nFor millions of Americans, the news of the total solar eclipse likely brings with it memories of the last time on Aug. 21, 2017 that the moon passed between the earth and sun, completely blocking out the sunlight.\n\nAt that time, the sun's activity was at the minimum point of its 11-year solar cycle. During the time of the appropriately-named \"solar minimum,\" the sun emits fewer solar flares and coronal mass ejections, according to NASA.\n\nWhat that meant for eclipse spectators was that while they could see the sun's oft-hidden outermost layer known as the corona, its activity was otherwise relatively quiet. White streams of light belonging to the corona were merely restricted to the equatorial regions of the star.\n\nThings won't be quite so tame this year now that the sun is at the height of its activity – its solar maximum – and its magnetic field is \"more like a tangled hairball,\" NASA says. Those same streamers will likely be more pervasive, making the corona brighter when the moon blocks the sun's disk and brings on totality.\n\nIn addition to that, viewers will have a better chance to see prominences, which appear as bright pink curls or loops coming off the Sun, according to NASA.\n\nMoon will appear bigger from Earth, lengthening time of darkness\n\nIn order for a total eclipse to occur, the moon must be close enough in its orbit of Earth to appear, at least to us, to be the same size of the sun.\n\nWhile the effects of the eclipse can last for a decent amount of time, totality only occurs at the moment that the moon completely blocks the sun's light from reaching us, shrouding those in the path in an uncharacteristic daytime darkness.\n\nThis year though, the moon will be even bigger than it was in 2017, meaning those precious moments of totality will last for even longer, according to eclipse2024.org.\n\nSeven years ago, the longest period of totality occurred for about 2 minutes and 42 seconds near Carbondale, Illinois, according to NASA. On April 8, that time will nearly double in an area just northwest of the Mexican city of Torreón, where spectators will experience a totality lasting 4 minutes and 28 seconds.\n\nMany places in the United States along the eclipse's sweeping path will experience a totality lasting for multiple minutes – and, in some places, also surpassing four minutes.\n\nEven as the eclipse exits the U.S. and enters the maritime provinces of Canada, totality will last up to 3 minutes, 21 seconds.\n\nMore people should see this year's eclipse\n\nAlong its 115-mile journey, the eclipse will pass through 13 U.S. states comprising hundreds of cities and small towns.\n\nThat represents a larger swath of the continent and more people along the path than in 2017 who will have a near front row seat to the spectacular sight of the eclipse, NASA says. While the 2017 path ranged from about 62 to 71 miles wide, this year's eclipse is projected to range between 108 and 122 miles wide.\n\nAn estimated 31 million Americans already live on the path, which doesn't even account for the countless tourists sure to flock to major cities sure to experience the eclipse, according to eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler at GreatAmericanEclipse.com. Seven years ago, meanwhile, just 12 million Americans lives along the path, while an additional 150 million people were within 200 miles of it, according to NASA.\n\nAll told, 13 states in the U.S. comprised of hundreds of cities and small towns are directly on the path of totality. Additionally, small parts of Tennessee and Michigan are also expected to experience the eclipse, NASA says.\n\nIf you want to see the time and duration for when totality would occur in cities along the path, see these interactive maps.\n\nWhat else should people know about this year's eclipse?\n\nAs if a breathtaking solar eclipse won't be enough, there's a small chance that the horned \"devil comet\" may make an appearance that same day as it makes its closest orbital approach to Earth later in the month.\n\nAnd if you plan on viewing the eclipse, just remember certified safety eyewear is a must until the moon completely blocks out the sun's light, leaving only the outermost layer visible.

Read the latest eclipse weather forecasts for Akron, Cincinnati and Columbus.\n\nA total eclipse, like the one happening on April 8, means the sun suddenly disappears at a time of day when it shouldn't – and that can have some surprising effects on animals' behaviors.\n\nDuring previous eclipses, people around the globe have noticed a surreal silence as birds, bugs and animals interrupted their normal activities.\n\nAnd researchers have observed all sorts of unusual things at zoos: Flamingos gathered in a circle around their babies to protect them. Giraffes began galloping around their enclosure. Swarms of birds large enough to appear on radar suddenly left the sky and roosted in trees. Gorillas marched to their dens, expecting their final meal of the day. The ancient Galapagos tortoises started mating.\n\nWith the full solar eclipse of 2024 coming to a large swath of the United State, scientists are gearing up to observe animals at multiple zoos in the path of the totality, in part because they were so surprised at what they discovered in 2017 during the last total solar eclipse in the U.S.\n\n“I thought it was going to be nonsense, I didn’t think animals were going to be affected at all,” said Adam Hartstone-Rose, a professor of comparative anatomy at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. “Clouds pass over and they don’t react. It was so ephemeral.”\n\nFor the 2024 eclipse, scientists will be watching the birds and beasts – and inviting citizen scientists to offer their observations as well – as the celestial curtain falls.\n\nPets, too, are being included in the surveys, though veterinarians say overall the biggest effect on their behavior will not be the sudden darkness, but rather the behavior of the humans around them.\n\n\"They're going to react more to our reactions and our excitement and our anxiety than anything actually from the actual eclipse,\" said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nWhat time does the eclipse come to Ohio?\n\nA wide swath of the Buckeye State is lucky to lie in the eclipse's path of totality (even if new data suggests that path might be slightly narrower).\n\nAccording to National Eclipse, Ohio residents can first see the moon overtake the sun at 1:53 p.m. before it fully reappears at 4:30 p.m.\n\nThe eclipse totality will last from 3:08 to 3:19 p.m. as it cuts a swath from southwest to northeast Ohio.\n\nHere's when some Ohio cities along its path can expect the total eclipse to being, and how long it will last:\n\nHamilton -- Begins at 3:09:09 p.m., will last 1 minute, 42 seconds.\n\n-- Begins at 3:09:09 p.m., will last 1 minute, 42 seconds.

They began a few days before the eclipse so they could gauge how much the animals' behavior changed.\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse?Search your ZIP code for a viewing guide\n\nIt was a perfect place to do the experiment. At 2:41 pm on Aug. 21, 2017 the greater Columbia area experienced the longest period of totality of any city on the East Coast, slightly more than 2 minutes and 30 seconds of total darkness.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the animals exhibited changed behavior.\n\nGorillas : “Marched all together to be let in for the evening and were kind of perplexed, like ‘Why aren’t you letting us in?’” Hartstone-Rose said.\n\n: “Marched all together to be let in for the evening and were kind of perplexed, like ‘Why aren’t you letting us in?’” Hartstone-Rose said.

Whenever one is set to occur, the promise of catching a glimpse of such a dazzling spectacle – whether it be a complete eclipse or only a partial one – always manages to capture the public's attention.\n\n\"I think humans have a deep connection with the night sky,\" Cameron Hummels, director of astrophysics outreach at the California Institute of Technology, previously told USA TODAY. \"Astronomical events like eclipses, meteor showers, and the northern lights are a way in which they can experience it first hand.\"\n\nYour guide to the eclipse:What to know before totality hits Monday\n\nTotal solar eclipse is chance for millions to see totality, corona\n\nThe phenomenon of an eclipse is rare enough as it is, but the upcoming astral display will quite literally be a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle to behold. Compared to the last total solar eclipse in 2017, this year's even will produce a brighter corona around the sun, a larger moon and a longer totality.\n\nMillions of Americans have now long been eagerly awaiting what will be their only chance until 2044 to witness totality, whereby the moon will completely block the sun's disc, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness.\n\nAmericans across the country will flock Monday to eclipse watch parties at libraries, national parks and other venues to catch a glimpse of the phenomenon, which will pass over portions of Mexico, the United States and Canada. Here in the U.S., 13 states fall directly in the path of totality, which will offer the most captivating views.\n\nThe process and reasons for an eclipse have long been understood by scientists, but it hasn't diminished the excitement that bubbles up anytime an eclipse approaches. Many astronomers, like Christopher Sirola from the University of Southern Mississippi, even view eclipses as an opportunity to harness public captivation to educate about the science behind the phenomenon.\n\n\"Solar eclipses are very predictable, but their regularities are not obvious,\" Sirola said. \"Such events are awesome, especially total solar eclipses.\"\n\nEclipses offer scientists a chance to study sun\n\nWe may think of astronomers and astrophysicists as studious and objective observers of the skies, but solar eclipses are equally exciting for them.\n\nAnd while much of that eager anticipation is purely for the celestial light show that will be on display, there's an academic reason as well.\n\nDescribing eclipses as \"a cosmic masterpiece,\" Elsayed Talaat of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told USA TODAY that the celestial events afford scientists an opportunity to study the sun much closer than normal.\n\nTotal solar eclipses in particular, such as the one that will overtake a large swath of the country in April, allow for scientists to test and improve human understanding of the laws of physics, primarily those of the sun. Veiled by the massive star's bright light, the sun's corona becomes visible during a total eclipse, allowing astronomers to conduct observations normally impossible, said Talaat, director of NOAA's Office of Space Weather Observations.\n\nAt NASA, for instance, a team of engineering physicists plan to launch three sounding rockets Monday toward the sun to study how a loss of sunlight alters Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe corona to this day remains shrouded in mystery, as Talaat said scientists are unsure of just why the outermost layer is able to reach a temperature of 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit compared to the 10,000 degrees measured on the surface of the sun itself.\n\nScientists at NOAA use a telescopic device called a coronagraph to replicate the effects of an eclipse by blocking out the direct light from the sun in order to measure a corona year-round without relying on the moon's orbit.\n\nNOAA’s newest geostationary satellite will carry a coronagraph onboard when it launches for deep space next year, while a 2025 mission will also bring another device roughly 1 million miles away from earth to allow for unobstructed observations of the corona.\n\nHowever, Talaat admits there's nothing like seeing an eclipse for yourself.\n\n\"It's very different to be able to see it with your own eyes from the ground; that's a very powerful experience for me,\" Talaat said. \"It reminds me — it reminds us — that the sun is powerful in ways we don't fully understand or quite appreciate.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

And astrophysicist Antonella Fruscione is constantly refreshing the weather forecast.\n\nMillions of Americans are awaiting a rare solar eclipse on April 8 — nearly the whole country will have a chance to look up and see at least a small portion of the moon clip the sun. But people who made plans to visit the narrow path of totality for the best show are confronting some fickle cloud forecasts that may put a damper on their plans.\n\nFruscione and 18 friends – some coming from as far away as Europe – have been planning this trip since they all caught the solar eclipse together in Idaho in 2017. The group has flights and lodging booked to Texas to catch this eclipse in a prime spot.\n\nThe anxiety about the eclipse being clouded out is “palpable,” in San Antonio, Fruscione hears from a friend who lives there. So her group, based in New England, is going to make it a game-day call about making the Texas trip — but they plan to view the celestial spectacle “no matter what. When you see a total eclipse, it’s such an incredible experience that all you want to do is see the next one.”\n\nTheir chosen viewing spot of San Antonio could be dicey. Recent forecasts have said some kind of clouds are likely in Texas, along with most places along the path of totality, the narrow band of the country that will be directly in the moon's shadow as it crosses the sun.\n\nForecasters are more optimistic about the northern part of the path, with \"Clear skies ... most likely in northern New England and upstate New York, and possible in Arkansas and Missouri,\" according to a Tuesday forecast from the Weather Prediction Center, a branch of the National Weather Service.\n\nIf the weather in Texas is looking bad Fruscione's group might lose money on their flights and hotels but will still be able to make the drive to another spot in the path of totality that currently has a more favorable weather outlook: Vermont.\n\n“We are ‘lucky’ because we are in Boston, so we still live two hours away by car from the path of totality. So this is why we can make this decision,” she said.\n\nA party in Ohio will go on, regardless of clouds\n\nClint Werner of San Francisco is heading to Cleveland to see the eclipse and is hopeful clouds won’t get in the way.\n\n“I’ve got a good feeling” the self-proclaimed \"eclipse evangelist,\" 63, said.\n\nFor Werner, eclipses are “elating and mind-altering, you are put in euphoric amazement.” This will be his 21st eclipse and his husband’s 20th.\n\n“Our first date I asked if he wanted to go to Chile to see the eclipse and he said ‘Sure.’”\n\nWhich is why changing venues isn’t an option for them. Cleveland won’t simply be a chance to experience awe, “the whole cosmic relationship between us and the heavens,” it’s also a big 30th anniversary and eclipse viewing party with friends and family.\n\n“We’ve got too many people coming, we’ve made this an event,” he said. But as much as he loves eclipses, he's not distressed, partly because he's hopeful for clear weather and partly because he knows whatever happens “we’ll have a great time, a beautiful friends and family reunion.”\n\nThere's science behind his good feeling. Clouds, particularly shallow cumulus clouds, tend to vanish during a solar eclipse. Just 15% of the sun needs to be obscured by the moon before some clouds disappear, according to new research published Feb. 12 in the journal \"Communications Earth & Environment.\"\n\nHaving been to 21 eclipses, he's only been “clouded out” three times. And even those experiences can be significant, Werner said.\n\nIn 2019 in South America there were clouds and he found himself in despair. But when the actual eclipse came it was still monumental despite them.\n\n“If you have a good vantage point and a nice 360° view, especially if you’re elevated or in a big flat field, you can see the shadow coming at you. And you can see it on the bottom of the clouds sometimes and have that coming towards you. And then you get the sudden plunge into darkness,” he said.\n\nChecking the weather from the road\n\nA year ago Laurae Pearson, 58 and her husband Kevin Weil, 58, decided to leave their San Francisco home to see the 2024 solar eclipse. They ended up making the viewing part of a 17-day cross-country trip that’s so far included hiking in Zion and Bryce national parks, visiting the Navajo Nation with a planned ending to visit family in Texas.\n\n“We have some friends driving down from Chicago who will meet us, it’s a very celebratory and celestial event,” she said from the car as they headed into Arizona.\n\nShe admits she’s a “little worried” and is tracking weather and storm reports every day but so far they haven’t adjusted their travel plans and she doesn’t think they will.\n\n“Mother Nature is going to do what Mother Nature is going to do,” she said. “Hopefully we’ll see an amazing event but even if it’s a disappointment, it’s about the journey and having a wonderful time seeing our family.”\n\nTexas organizer says don't give up hope\n\nIn Texas, Downtown Dallas's Chief Marketing Officer Shalissa Perry said it's still a bit early to know exactly what the visibility will be but officials there \"are keeping an eye on it.\"\n\n\"We plan to host our viewing party rain (or cloudy) or shine and it will still be a spectacular day downtown regardless of the eclipse visibility,\" Perry said. \"We have a full lineup of exciting events planned for the entire weekend leading up to the eclipse – and the weather looks magnificent for the weekend.\"\n\nShe cited the National Weather Service Fort Worth's announcement on April 2: “The forecast for Eclipse Day continues to be cloudy, however, not all hope is lost! Widespread upper cloud cover is likely, but dense low clouds look less likely. Don't focus on the exact areas, just yet, as these forecasts will change a bit each day.”\n\nFormer NASA astronaut Commander Terry Virts got to see an eclipse from space in 2015, so while he’s eager to see this one Earth-side, he’s not too worried about the weather.\n\n“It is a good idea to have a backup plan, but it’s hard to be certain that one area nearby will be clear and your spot will be cloudy. You’ll have to make that call early in the day before you can really be sure where the clouds will be. I will be staying put in my spot and hoping for the best!” he said of his favored perch in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas area, which is in the path of the totality.\n\n“Even if we can’t see the sun directly, it will get very dark outside, which will be surreal,” he said. “Not as good as having a clear sky, but a total eclipse on a cloudy day should be very interesting.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/good-news/2024/04/08/eclipse-2024-what-to-know-to-watch-the-solar-eclipse-in-ri-today/73221265007/", "title": "Eclipse 2024: What to know to watch the solar eclipse in RI today", "text": "A solar eclipse visible across a large swath of the United States will blot out the sun in northern New England and create a partial eclipse that will darken skies in Rhode Island today.\n\nLooking directly at the sun, even when 90% of it is blocked, as it will be from Rhode Island, can damage your eyes, even though the damage may not be immediately detectable. The only safe way to look at the sun is through eclipse glasses, which blacken almost everything else.\n\nYou need eye protection for the eclipse:Here's what to know about safety glasses\n\nWhat kind of eclipse will be visible from Rhode Island?\n\nToday, April 8, observers in Rhode Island will see a partial solar eclipse.\n\nWhat time is the eclipse visible in Rhode Island?\n\nFrom 2:15 to 4:38 p.m. April 8, the moon will partially cover the sun. This will be visible from all locations in Rhode Island, as long as the weather cooperates. The maximum eclipse, when just more than 90% of the sun will be blocked, will be at 3:29 p.m.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse?\n\nEvery month, as part of the moon's orbit around the Earth, the moon passes on the same side of the Earth as the sun. Roughly two to four times a year, the three celestial bodies align so that the moon's shadow falls onto the surface of the earth, blocking out the sun's light. This is called a solar eclipse.\n\nWill observatories in Rhode Island host eclipse events?\n\nTwo prominent local observatories, the Ladd Observatory at Brown University in Providence and the Frosty Drew Observatory and Science Center in Charlestown, will be closed because their staff will be traveling – to Texas, Canada and points in between – to see the total eclipse.\n\n\"You don't need to be at a venue to enjoy an eclipse,\" said Scott MacNeill, director of the Frosty Drew Observatory. \"You just need to be at a place where you can see the sun.\"\n\n\"It's so easy to see with the naked eye that there's no reason to look at it through a telescope,\" said David Targan, director of the Ladd Observatory, stressing that eclipse glasses are necessary during the partial eclipse.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses alternatives\n\nAnother simple method is to create your own pinhole projector to project the sun onto a nearby surface. The American Astronomical Society offers helpful instructions to set them up.\n\nMaking one doesn't even require any special equipment – just some common household items.\n\nWith the sun at your back, make sure its light passes through a small opening – a hole punched in an index card, a pasta colander, or even your own outstretched fingers – onto the ground or another surface. The little spaces will project a grid of small images on the ground that, during the partial phases of a solar eclipse, will reveal the sun's crescent shape.\n\nThen, of course, when it suddenly gets dark, it will be safe to look directly at the eclipsed sun if you can find a spot to see it on the path of totality.\n\nOther methods include handmade sun funnels, as well as the pricey Sunspotters and Solarscopes, which are better-suited for groups such as astronomy clubs, schools, museums and planetariums.\n\n– Eric Lagatta, USA Today reporter\n\nWhen is the next solar eclipse?\n\nAfter this event, the next solar eclipse visible from the contiguous United States will be in 20 years, on Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA. That one will be visible only in a few Western states along the Canadian border, but it will be followed in 2045 by one that will be visible along a curving path from California to Florida.\n\nWhen will Rhode Island next have a total solar eclipse?\n\nThen, the United States will have to wait three more decades, when solar eclipses will be visible from the United States in consecutive years — 2078 and 2079, with the latter one beginning at sunrise on May 1 and the total eclipse visible in the cities of Philadelphia, New York and Boston, plus the entire states of Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts. The center line of totality, along which the total eclipse lasts the longest, will pass through southern Rhode Island, including Westerly, South Kingstown, Saunderstown, Jamestown, Middletown, Portsmouth and Tiverton.\n\nAre schools canceled because of the eclipse?\n\nWhile it's not as destructive as a hurricane or a blizzard, the solar eclipse coming Monday is getting the kind of advance attention that mega storms do, and it's causing several Rhode Island school systems to shut their doors, too.\n\nWith the moon covering 90% of the sun, the eclipse presents safety concerns to school administrators.\n\n\"It will be very dark around 3:15, which is our elementary dismissal time,\" South Kingstown Superintendent Bob Littlefield wrote in a Facebook post. \"How do we get students dismissed from school safely in the dark? Elementary students will be asked to board and disembark their buses and/or walk home in nighttime conditions.\"\n\nMore:Some RI schools to close early because of Monday's solar eclipse\n\nWhat about Rhode Islanders who have traveled to the path of totality?\n\nTotality out-of-state:The lengths these Rhode Islanders will go to see eclipse\n\nMost Rhode Islanders will catch the beauty of that partial eclipse at home, but several plan to be anywhere from Texas to Canada come Monday afternoon, taking in the majesty of the total eclipse at a fancy hotel in Quebec, a rustic camp in upstate New York, the ballpark in Cleveland, a lighthouse on Lake Champlain, a steakhouse near the Canadian border or a travel trailer somewhere along the side of a Vermont highway.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/03/05/2024-solar-eclipse-safety-precautions/72839252007/", "title": "2024 solar eclipse: Safety precautions for once-in-a-lifetime event", "text": "On the afternoon of April 8, New York will be one of 11 contiguous states situated within the path of totality for the total solar eclipse. Several regions lie within the direct path, including parts of the Mohawk Valley.\n\nMohawk Valley Astronomical Society (MVAS) Observing Coordinator, Faith Thompson, expressed the organization's excitement for the celestial event. MVAS has promoted amateur astronomy and stargazing across Central New York since 1989.\n\nThere’s nothing better to capture public attention than something unforgettable like an eclipse, she said.\n\nThompson described a total solar eclipse as an “experience that reaches one’s very soul,” adding that to view the Sun’s normally invisible atmosphere is mesmerizing. Nonetheless, she stressed the importance of observing the celestial event safely.\n\n“Be aware that the 99% partial solar eclipse visible in the Utica area requires everyone to wear solar filters over their eyes all the time,” Thompson warned. “Never look at the sun as it can damage your eyes. Only if you are in the path of totality then during the few moments when the moon completely covers the sun can you look directly at the corona.”\n\nOneida County: Know before you go\n\nAssociate Professor of Physics at Hamilton College, Adam Lark, and Instructional Lab Manager at Syracuse University, Samuel Sampere, offered insight on how to enjoy the eclipse safely.\n\nAccording to Professor Lark, Herkimer, Whitesboro, Utica, New Hartford, and Clinton lie outside the path of totality. Residents in these areas can expect to observe roughly 99% coverage of the April eclipse.\n\n“The celestial event will begin roughly around 2:10 p.m.” Lark explained. “The moon will cover the sun for the next hour until reaching max coverage around 3:25 p.m. The sky will be dim and eerie during that time. For the next hour the moon will progressively leave the front of the sun until the eclipse concludes around 4:35 p.m.”\n\nProtect yourself:Everything you need to know about solar eclipse glasses, including where to get them\n\nRome is unique in that the northern parts of the city lie within the path of totality while the southern tier does not. Only a few spots will observe seconds of complete totality. For example, the Delta Lake State Park will experience 1 minute and 20 seconds of totality.\n\nOld Forge lies within the path of totality and the hamlet will observe darkness for almost three minutes.\n\n“Locals should get excited about this eclipse, it’s the last solar eclipse in North America until 2045, and the last solar eclipse in New York State until 2079,” Lark emphasized. “The beauty and awe of a total solar eclipse is life changing. It brings communities together. When you attend a viewing event you are connected with everyone around you– the comradery is palpable. It doesn't matter what religion or political leaning you are, everyone congregates to witness the same beautiful event.”\n\nSafety is crucial, Lark noted.\n\n“Even if the sun is 99% covered, looking at it directly is still dangerous to your eyes,\" Lark said. \"Sunglasses are not good enough! You need iso-certified eclipse glasses to look directly at the sun. On the other hand, if you are in the path of totality can you safely take your eclipse glasses off for the duration of totality. It will be incredible to observe the night's sky in the middle of the day, as well as the colors of sunset and sunrise all around you in every direction.”\n\nAlternative viewing options\n\nLark offered that instead of traveling North, to the Adirondacks, heading west another option. “The New York State thruway can handle the traffic; those willing to travel should certainly consider Syracuse or Rochester,” he said.\n\nThe Syracuse University Physics department will be involved in an eclipse education event held on the lawn outside the science center.\n\nAccording to Sampere, administrators will be present, ready to answer questions as well as disperse pinhole projectors and solar glasses.\n\n“Having an eclipse in the area is extremely rare,” Sampere said. “Normally people have to travel far to observe these events. Many occur over oceans, where you need to travel via boat to catch a glimpse. Take advantage of this opportunity and don’t squander the moment. You will see a beautiful corona, experience temperature drops of a few degrees, and hear night animals emerge. Outdoors will be about as bright as the night on a full moon.”\n\nWhile appreciating the infrequency of the eclipse is important Sampere also underscored the importance of doing so safely. He pointed out this applies to electronics as well; improper protection of your phone and camera could damage the lenses.\n\n“Do not ever look at the sun without eye protection, and that includes during the partial phases of the eclipse,\" Sampere said. \"If you want to observe the event safely a great website is eclipse.aas.org. Another cost-free way is to make your own pinhole projectors. I recommend practicing with your homemade instrument before the eclipse so you don’t waste time during the event trying to figure out how to use your viewer.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/05"}]}

That could force difficult decisions about who gets care and who doesn't as the country awaits a vaccine.\n\nCONTACT TRACERS OVERWHELMED:Delaware's contact tracing efforts under significant strain as positive cases spike\n\nWhen the state issued its spring stay-at-home order it came with the following instructions: shelter in place to \"flatten the curve\" to buy officials time to get the virus under control before hospitals become overrun.\n\nThe measures largely achieved their goals — the curve flattened and Delaware never surpassed its hospital capacity. But now, almost nine months into the pandemic and with a devastated economy, the curve has never been less flat.\n\nDelaware on Tuesday reported 682 new cases, the most in a single day.\n\nOver the past week, Delaware has reported on average 524 cases per day. In the first week of November, Delaware averaged 188 cases per day.\n\nThe state reported five new deaths Tuesday, raising the death toll to 777. And there are 246 people currently hospitalized in Delaware due to COVID-19, the most since May 15.\n\nCOVID-19 VACCINE:Delaware health care workers could begin receiving COVID-19 vaccines in early December\n\nThe surge in cases and hospitalizations brought on by holiday gatherings and cool weather sending people indoors has prompted state officials to consider new restrictions in another attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Mid-Atlantic states issued a wave of pre-Thanksgiving orders, most of which took aim at private gatherings. Ahead of an expected post-Thanksgiving wave, some states made more restrictions this week.\n\nGov. John Carney, who regularly confers with leaders of nearby states, said Delaware is considering new restrictions this week.\n\nJOE BIDEN:'Help is on the way,' Biden says as he introduces economic team in Wilmington\n\n\"We have some big decisions to make this week as we assess the data, as we look at the areas in our society where transmission is taking place,\" he said.\n\nWill hospitals fill up?\n\nAs of 6 p.m. Monday, there were 246 people hospitalized in Delaware, the most since May 15.\n\nThe number of hospitalizations in the state is rising slightly faster than it did during the spring surge. Over the past week, hospitalizations increased by 34% from 183 to 246. In the week preceding the spring peak, hospitalizations increased by 25% from 269 to 337.\n\nThe state never surpassed its hospital capacity during the spring. The number of hospitalizations steadily decreased from a peak of 337 on April 27 to a low of 29 on Aug. 16.\n\nNow, with hospitals performing elective procedures, Carney has estimated the state’s hospital capacity for COVID-19 patients is between 400 and 500. Carney declined to offer an estimate of when the state will threaten that capacity when asked Tuesday.\n\nIf the number of hospitalizations increases by the same rate they have over the past week, Delaware would pass 400 hospitalizations in roughly 17 days. The state would pass 500 hospitalizations in roughly 28 days.\n\nBut several factors could likely to influence how many people need to be hospitalized.\n\nKENT COUNTY SCHOOLS:Kent County school reopening criteria is in the red stage, but state says they should remain hybrid\n\nHospitalizations are considered a lagging indicator. Because of the virus’ long incubation period, a spike in hospitalizations is typically linked to case increases reported up to two weeks earlier.\n\nThe number of cases reported each day in Delaware has been rising since September, with dramatic increases since early November. Two weeks ago, the state’s rolling seven-day average for new cases was a then-record 346.7. It has since increased by 51% to an all-time high of 523.9 reported Tuesday.\n\nIf the state didn’t report any new cases, there would still be new hospitalizations among the roughly 6,000 Delawareans who have tested positive in that time frame. It’s impossible to determine how many of them will need to be hospitalized, but the state has several factors working in its favor.\n\nAlthough cases have increased among all demographic groups, people ages 18-34 now account for a much larger share of the positive cases compared to the spring surge. Younger people are less likely to need significant medical care. There is also better treatment, shortening the average hospital stay, according to public health officials.\n\n\"We know that we don’t necessarily need to move towards a ventilator as quickly as it was initially thought back in March,\" said Dr. Bill Chasanov, an infectious disease physician at Beebe Healthcare. He added that young patients appear to need ventilators less than older patients.\n\nWorking against the state is that cases are likely to climb at an even greater rate because of increased travel and large gatherings around Thanksgiving.\n\nIt’s too early to ascribe an increase in cases to the holiday, but the early indication from public health officials, including the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is there could be a \"surge upon a surge.\"\n\n\"The challenge is that we’ve got a lot more movement in the community, a lot more people circulating and gathering,\" Carney said.\n\nWhat preparations are in the works?\n\nBeebe Healthcare President and CEO Dr. David Tam said he is not as concerned about hospital capacity as are hospitals in other states such as California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday said his state’s hospitals could be close to filled up by Christmas.\n\n\"We are not at a point where we are even close to what is going on in California,\" said Tam, whose hospitals are in Sussex County. \"That might be different in the northern part of the state.\"\n\n'NEW NORMAL' NOT POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE:My brother has daily seizures. COVID-19 restrictions are making him sicker.\n\nChristianaCare spokesman Hiran Ratnayake said that ChristianaCare hospitals, most of them in New Castle County, \"believe that we have the capacity to meet the needs of the community throughout the winter.\"\n\nDoctors at Beebe's hospital and emergency rooms don’t worry about running out of PPE in the winter months, but Tam said he still worries about his hospital workers’ emotional state.\n\n\"It’s like combat fatigue,\" Tam said. \"Not just pandemic fatigue, but combat fatigue … I think they are sometimes concerned that they go outside and they see people not (following guidelines) and it’s sort of this disconnect between, look, we’re working very hard here and yet you’re out there doing all this stuff at the mall and things like that.\"\n\nNEW CASTLE COUNTY:NCCo taxpayers get their $3 million back from controversial Delaware Board of Trade loan\n\nTam said he also worries about people who are not coming into the emergency room or their doctor’s office for regular checkups to prevent complications with issues such as heart disease, diabetes or stroke.\n\n\"As a result, they also suffer significant medical problems because they are afraid of coming in and getting the care they need,\" Tam said, adding that Beebe is keeping all of its services open. “That’s another source of morbidity and mortality that is going on out there because of COVID, not necessarily directly related to getting infected.”\n\nCarney said hospitals in the state are not as worried about having enough beds as they are with having enough staff.\n\n\"The more people that obviously test positive and need to be quarantined, the fewer staff that you have,\" he said.\n\nCarney has issued an emergency executive order to allow out-of-state health care workers, heath care workers who have retired in the past five years, recent graduates and some health professional students to help hospitals with the surge. Those workers would work in hospitals under appropriate supervision, according to a spokesman for Carney's administration.\n\nCarney said that ramped up testing and contact tracing, as well as additional hospital sites, are also on the horizon as the state heads into the winter.\n\nWILMINGTON PROTESTS:'We were obeying the law': Wilmington protesters say police are violating their rights\n\nIf Delaware ends up needing extra hospital beds, the state's deal is still intact with the Nemours Center for Sports Medicine in Wilmington, which set up an alternative care site in the spring for non-COVID-19 patients to be transferred from hospitals in order to make room for people infected with the virus. It would take about a month to stand up that facility, Carney said.\n\nTo combat the spread of the virus, the state has primarily relied on three tools: testing, contact tracing and restrictions.\n\nThe state is testing a record number of people, in hopes it can better understand how the virus is spreading and detect more cases before people spread the virus to others.\n\nDelaware tested a record 7,355.4 people per day from Nov. 21 to Nov. 27, and is increasing the number of pop-up testing sites and Walgreens testing sites it offers. Officials on Tuesday also recommended residents consider ordering a free at-home testing kit through the state's website.\n\nContact tracing works alongside those testing efforts, to determine where the spread is occurring and who needs to quarantine. The state is hiring dozens more contact tracers and shortening its interviews with positive cases to try to keep up with the number of new cases.\n\nSALVATION ARMY KETTLES:'Listen for the bell': Salvation Army kettles are still out, but limited due to COVID-19\n\nDelaware tightened restrictions in mid-November, capping indoor dining at restaurants and limiting indoor gatherings to 10 people, but they still pale in comparison to the shut down experienced in the spring, when case counts and other key metrics were significantly lower.\n\nCarney has said previously the state must \"strike a balance\" between implementing more restrictions for public health reasons and the damage they'd cause on local businesses.\n\nWILMINGTON BALLET:'Stuffy' no longer: New Wilmington Ballet leaders want to smash stereotypes\n\nIt's unlikely that Delaware will undergo the same drastic shutdown it did in the spring when Carney's administration forced many businesses to close entirely in an attempt to slow the spread. In an election debate with Republican opponent Julianne Murray last month, Carney said a shutdown similar to the one the state had earlier this year was not feasible and that Delawareans have to \"adapt to a new normal,\" like routinely wearing masks and maintaining social distance.\n\n\"In the beginning of the pandemic, lockdowns were broad because it took time to develop and implement the safety precautions needed to safely operate schools, businesses, outpatient and elevate health care, etcetera and ramp up the supply chain of PPE to make this happen,\" said Dr. M. Kit Delgado, an assistant professor of emergency medicine and epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nRENTAL ASSISTANCE:$10M left, only a month to spend it: Clock is ticking on rental assistance money credited with preventing evictions\n\n\"As the months have passed we know much more about how the virus is spread and how to treat it.\"\n\nDelgado said the virus now requires \"targeted interventions\" aimed at preventing as much of the virus' spread with the least amount of \"societal side effects.\" He recommends public officials limit indoor public and private gathering sizes, restrict group gym glasses and restrict bars and indoor dining.\n\nHe called closing schools, where public health experts insist spread isn't occurring, a \"last resort.\"\n\nRESTAURANTS BRACE FOR WINTER:Brandywine Diner hoping to weather new indoor dining restrictions\n\n\"At the end, if action isn’t taken, health care rationing will occur or is probably already occurring,\" Delgado said. \"It’s going to be ugly no matter, the goal is to navigate the next few months with the least harms to health and society.\"\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Monday announced that his state is limiting outdoor gatherings to 25 people and banning youth sports for the rest of the year, though he dismissed rumors about potential widespread shutdowns. Meanwhile, on Monday New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned his residents that he could roll out regional shutdowns if hospital capacity nears a crisis level.\n\nPennsylvania's health secretary on Monday announced that the Keystone State's current number of COVID-19 hospitalizations has surpassed its highest numbers from the spring.\n\nWRESTLING AND COVID-19:Why coaches say Delaware high school wrestlers would be safer without wearing masks\n\nDelaware's November restrictions were met with outcries from business groups and protests from grassroots groups that have pushed back on Carney's state of emergency orders since the spring. It's unclear how many Delawareans actually heeded the 10-person limit over Thanksgiving, and the true effect of the holiday likely won't be known for at least another two weeks.\n\nIt's a political conundrum for any governor to decide between dismissing the science versus further destroying a ravaged economy.

The Department of Corrections said the inmate at the Elba Community Based Facility/Community Work Center was moved to the Easterling Correctional Facility and placed in an isolation cell, where he’ll receive medical treatment. Inmates at the Elba facility have been quarantined. The prison system has so far reported four COVID-19 cases and one prisoner death. Inmate advocates and health experts have expressed concerns that the state’s overcrowded prisons would become a breeding ground for a deadly outbreak and urged additional changes. Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn said the prison system is distributing masks and taking other precautions. Alabamians for Fair Justice, an advocacy group, donated more than 3,200 bars of antibacterial soap and other hygiene supplies to the system, which said the items will be distributed to inmates deemed at high risk.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy has proposed disbursing more than $1 billion in federal coronavirus relief aid through a process that would not require the Legislature to reconvene. A legislative attorney, however, has raised questions with that approach. Dunleavy has asked the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee to review his plan to distribute funds to help municipalities, nonprofits, small businesses, schools and other areas. State law lays out a process by which a governor can submit to the committee plans to accept and spend on a budget item additional federal or other program funds. Even if the committee disagrees, a governor can proceed. But Megan Wallace, director of Legislative Legal Services, raised concerns with use of the process for the federal aid in a memo responding to questions from Sen. Bill Wielechowski.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Nearly $18 million of federal funding provided to the city in response to the coronavirus outbreak would pay for housing support that includes renting hotel rooms for homeless people and providing aid to other low-income people. Mayor Kate Gallego said the City Council’s unanimous approval Tuesday for use of a grant is the largest investment in fighting homelessness in the city’s history. The city’s plans for spending the money include renting about 100 rooms at a hotel to house 100 seniors or people with chronic health issues who are at higher risk for COVID-19. Other parts of the city’s plan include more shelter beds and housing support. The city estimates it could reach 200 individuals and 555 families experiencing homelessness.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Next week the state will ease its ban on elective surgeries during the coronavirus pandemic, and an announcement could also come on the lifting of restrictions on other businesses, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday. The state will allow hospitals and clinics to resume some elective surgeries starting Monday, Hutchinson said. The state had ordered health care providers to reschedule procedures that could be safely postponed. State Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith said the providers will have to meet certain conditions, including requiring patients to be tested for the virus 48 hours before the procedure. Smith said the the ban is being lifted for procedures that don’t require an overnight stay in the hospital. It was not immediately clear whether the order would clear the way for the resumption of surgical abortions, which the state has halted.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The California Highway Patrol said Wednesday that it is temporarily banning rallies at the Capitol and other state facilities because of the pandemic. The change in policy came after hundreds of protesters gathered on the Capitol grounds in Sacramento on Monday, many without wearing masks or following recommendations to remain more than 6 feet apart to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The same group had planned additional rallies in coming days against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s orders that people remain at home except for essential activities. The CHP said it was caught by surprise when protesters ignored public safety recommendations. The event permit “was issued with the understanding that the protest would be conducted in a manner consistent with the state’s public health guidance. That is not what occurred, and CHP will take this experience into account when considering permits for this or any other group,” it said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: More than 67,000 more people filed for unemployment in the state last week, bringing the total number of new applications for the past month to just over 279,000, the Department of Labor and Employment said Thursday. The number of new unemployment applications last week was less than the 104,217 new claims reported during the previous week. However, self-employed and gig workers and others not previously able to collect unemployment benefits were only allowed to start filing claims Monday and are not included in the latest official count. Like other states, Colorado had to come up with a new process for accepting those claims and verifying the amount of money to which those workers were entitled. So far, more than 30,000 people have filed claims through the new application, the department said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Experts are expressing concern about the effects the pandemic is having on those needing help for drug addiction and other behavioral health services. Dr. J. Craig Allen, the medical director at Hartford HealthCare’s Rushford treatment center, said isolation and anxiety can wreak havoc on those with substance abuse issues in the best of times. He said there has been a decline in those seeking help at the same time there has been a rise in sales of things such as alcohol, vaping products and cigarettes. Hartford HealthCare has set up what officials are calling a “warm line” for those who need to talk to a recovery specialist. Meanwhile, the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services announced Wednesday that it has been awarded a $2 million federal grant to address behavioral health care needs of different populations heavily affected by the pandemic.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Prison officials in the state say they have no plans to expedite the release of inmates because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Delaware State News reports Department of Correction facilities are operating at less than 75% capacity. The department said COVID-19 has largely been limited to a minimum-security housing unit at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center. Officials said there is ample space to handle more cases. DOC Commissioner Claire DeMatteis expressed concerns about where inmates would go if they were released and the fact that there is still a risk to exposure on the outside as well. “The other side of releasing inmates is where do they go,” she said. “We’re all about reentry; now we’re just going to release a bunch of people with no place to go, no health care, no job, no prospect for a job. Exactly how does that help us?”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The board that oversees the metropolitan area’s Metrorail system is taking advantage of decreased ridership by greatly expanding a series of planned maintenance closures over the summer. The expanded summer shutdowns will affect northern Virginia in particular – the entire Silver Line, which serves Reston and the Tysons Corner areas, will be closed. Nine stations in Fairfax and Arlington counties will close. Service on the Orange and Silver lines will terminate in Virginia at the Ballston station. Several of those stations had already been slated for closure this summer to repair rider platforms and perform other maintenance. Metro officials say ridership declines of as much as 95% due to the coronavirus provide an opportunity to do even more maintenance with less disruption. The closures begin May 23 and are expected to run through the fall. Free shuttle buses will run from some of the closed stations.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A shipment of 1 million face masks en route to South Florida for firefighters was confiscated last week by the federal government, Miami-Dade’s top emergency management official said. Frank Rollason, the director of emergency management for Miami-Dade County, told WLRN on Wednesday that the masks were for firefighters who planned to begin at-home new coronavirus testing for homebound Miami-Dade residents who can’t make it to drive-thru testing sites. “We thought we were in pretty good shape with having that amount coming in, and they were – we were – usurped,” Rollason said. Miami-Dade has the largest number of confirmed cases in Florida, with almost 10,300 as of Thursday morning. Statewide, there are more than 28,500 confirmed cases. WLRN reports that other shipments of masks meant for municipalities also have been confiscated by the federal government.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp’s plan to begin cracking open the economy faces two major hurdles – the state is struggling to increase testing for new coronavirus infections and to boost tracking of those in contact with infected people. Without those capabilities, Georgia risks a quick rebound of the COVID-19 illness as Kemp allows some businesses to reopen in coming days. The Republican governor’s decision has been questioned because the state has yet to show continuing progress in those areas, and it could be difficult to catch up. “The virus moves faster than government does,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “So if I had to bet on who would come out of the gate faster, it would be the virus.” Georgia has ranked in the bottom 10 per capita in testing.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Daily arrests on the Big Island have plunged 33% since the governor issued a stay-at-home order because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Hawaii County Police Department said. Hawaii Police Chief Ferreira confirmed the decrease in arrests during the period after Democratic Gov. David Ige’s emergency proclamation took effect March 25, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The decrease has various explanations, including an expanded use of citations by officers to deal with some crimes, Ferreira said. “We’re not actively going out there and pursuing (suspects on) bench warrants,” Ferreira said. Another factor is the smaller number of people committing crimes in their vehicles, including driving under the influence. “Because the bars are closed, and because of the stay-at-home order, you have less people on the roadway,” Ferreira said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little’s efforts to flatten the curve and slow the rate of infection and spread of the coronavirus after it made a rapid entry into the state last month have succeeded. But with infections slowing, the Republican governor is facing growing unrest within his own party, and groups are chafing at his stay-at-home order and the closure of nonessential businesses despite the risk of a second wave of infections. Calls to disobey have increased along with a smattering of defiant actions across the state. “I think once it looks like we’ve got past the worst of it, it makes it seem like, ‘Why don’t we open back up?’ ” said Jaclyn Kettler, a Boise State University political scientist. “At the same time, there’s a lot of risk we might not fully understand.” Idaho is unique in that most states facing coordinated pushback for virus closures have Democratic governors.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Republicans in the state’s House on Tuesday suggested ways to slowly reopen businesses and relax restrictions on public interaction as the threat from COVID-19 potentially recedes. With Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order scheduled to expire April 30, GOP lawmakers are seeking relief for a devastated economy and frustrated constituents. Rep. Mark Batinick of Plainfield said he hoped their proposed modifications would get “buy-in” from the public. There was no specific start date mentioned. The proposal came just a day after Pritzker raised the specter of a stay-at-home extension when he announced that the rising number of COVID-19 cases, expected to peak in the latter half of April, now won’t top out until mid-May. At his daily briefing later Wednesday, Pritzker gave a lukewarm response to the GOP plans, which include reopening car dealerships, golf courses, state parks, department stores and hair salons.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s first coronavirus infections occurred at least a couple of weeks before the first illness for a resident was confirmed in early March, the state health commissioner said Wednesday. That would indicate the virus could have been spreading around Indiana for perhaps six weeks before the statewide stay-at-home order took effect March 25. “We tracked cases that we thought probably went back to at least mid-February,” said the health commissioner, Dr. Kristina Box. The earlier infections are in line with the determination of two coronavirus deaths in California in early and mid-February, showing that the virus was spreading in the U.S. well before health officials realized it. “There will be individuals that never hit the hospital system that may very well have had COVID-19, and they won’t know that until we have that good antibody test out there to show that they are immune,” Box said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s livestock producers face tumbling prices after hundreds of meatpacking workers have tested positive for COVID-19, resulting in Midwest processing plants significantly slowing production or closing. The situation could turn tragic for pork producers, who face the possibility of euthanizing thousands of animals backed up on farms across the state. “Producers face horrible choices,” said Dermot Hayes, an Iowa State University agriculture economist. Pork processing capacity has shrunk by about 25%, crushing hog prices, which have tumbled about 50% since January. Iowa is the nation’s largest pork producer, with nearly 25 million pigs in confinements. U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday he’s heard estimates that the country has about 100,000 pigs that should be slaughtered each day but aren’t. “Apply that over 10 days, and with a million pigs, you’ve got a big problem,” the Iowa Republican said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has suspended multiple regulations licensing medical professionals to make it easier for them to work in health care facilities and nursing homes. The executive order Kelly issued Wednesday suspends requirements that doctors supervise physician assistants, advanced practice practical nurses and licensed practical nurses. The order also allows nurses with inactive or lapsed licenses to provide services and permits medical or nursing students to volunteer to work in health care facilities. “Our health care facilities need as much flexibility as possible as we approach our projected peak infection rate in the coming days to ensure that hospitals do not become overwhelmed,” Kelly said Wednesday. The governor said the order is a “first step,” and health care providers face “broader and more complex challenges.” She said she cannot address them with an executive order and called on the Legislature to consider rewriting licensing laws.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Making it through the first Saturday in May without a Kentucky Derby will be tough for a lot of people in the Bluegrass State. Churchill Downs has a plan, though. The home of the Run for the Roses is planning to host a daylong, at-home, virtual Kentucky Derby party that’ll feature a virtual race among all 13 past Triple Crown winners to raise $2million for COVID-19 emergency relief funds. The 146th Kentucky Derby has been postponed until Sept. 5 due to public health concerns over the growing coronavirus pandemic. A special broadcast will air on NBC from 3 to 6 p.m. May 2 featuring the 2015 Kentucky Derby that kicked off American Pharoah’s historic Triple Crown run. In addition, the broadcast will highlight Churchill Downs’ first-ever virtual horse race – The Kentucky Derby: Triple Crown Showdown, a computer-simulated version of a race under the historic Twin Spires of Churchill Downs.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Masks will be recommended attire even when stay-at-home orders and restrictions on business activity are eased during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Wednesday. He noted medical experts’ guidance saying proper masks keep patients infected with coronavirus from spreading it to others. “Think of wearing a mask in public as just being polite to others,” Edwards said at his daily news conference, calling mask-wearing part of “new normal” of life when restrictions are lifted. It remained unclear exactly how and when restrictions will be lifted, but Edwards said he expects to deliver more information as early as Monday. Louisiana’s current stay-at-home emergency order, banning gatherings of more than 10 people and forcing closure of many nonessential businesses, expires April 30. The Democratic governor has been reluctant to speculate on what will be done next.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Unemployment claims have slowed somewhat in the state but remain much higher than historical averages. A total of 11,560 people made initial claims for unemployment compensation in the week that ended April 18, the Maine Department of Labor reported. That was the lowest number of initial claims in the past five weeks. Meanwhile, new cellphone data suggests about 40% of Mainers are staying put in their homes on any given day, abiding by the governor’s stay-at-home order. The percentage of Mainers staying home grew steadily to about 35% after the state’s first coronavirus case was announced March 12, the Bangor Daily News reports. The figure rose to its current level after Mills issued a formal stay-at-home order March 31. The newspaper cited an analysis by SafeGraph.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Crime in the city is continuing to fall during the coronavirus pandemic. The Baltimore Sun reports property crime was already on a steep decline. Violent crime is falling as well, although not as much. Police reported 71 total violent crimes for the week ending April 18. That’s a stark decline from the previous week, which had seen 152 violent crimes reported. There were 196 violent crimes reported for the week ending March 21. For the past month, total violent crimes are down 26% compared with the same period last year. Total shootings and gun-related homicides are also down by a third during the past month compared to last year. Experts had expected crime to decline in the wake of the stay-at-home orders that have been imposed in an effort to curb the virus’s spread and keep hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state’s death toll in the coronavirus pandemic surged past 2,000 on Wednesday, about doubling in just seven days as the Boston area becomes a hot spot. Public health officials said there were 221 new deaths, pushing the overall toll to 2,182. It was the most deaths reported in a single day since the outbreak in Massachusetts began, and it marked the first time the state has recorded more than 200 in a day. Massachusetts saw its first COVID-19 death March 20, and the outbreak has intensified despite strict social distancing measures and contact tracing aimed at slowing transmission. The state passed 1,000 deaths April 15, when 1,108 were reported. There were more than 1,700 new cases reported Wednesday, bringing the number of confirmed cases close to 43,000. More than half the deaths – 1,205 – were reported in long-term care centers, such as nursing homes. The average age of people who have died of confirmed COVID-19 is 82, officials said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A major health care provider in southeastern Michigan said the number of COVID-19 patients had dropped below 500 this week for the first time in nearly a month. Henry Ford Health System reported 490 patients Thursday morning at five hospitals, a sign that the coronavirus was slowing down. It had 426 patients March 28 and more than 700 on April 8. COVID-19 is the respiratory disease caused by the virus. Henry Ford said it has discharged 1,549 patients during the outbreak. Beaumont Health has also reported a significant drop in patients at its Detroit-area hospitals. Both health care providers are temporarily laying off thousands of people due to a lack of revenue from medical procedures that have been suspended.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz on Thursday ordered schools to stay closed through the rest of the academic year amid the COVID-19 crisis. Walz, a former teacher, called it “a heartbreaking decision.” The Democratic governor said he feels sorry for all the students who will miss out on graduations, tournaments and end-of-year celebrations. But Walz said the health and safety of Minnesotans is his top priority, so distance learning will continue through the end of this school year. “While I recognize distance learning is a challenge for many families, it is critical to social distancing in Minnesota and supports the health of Minnesota’s families. We will continue looking for ways to improve the current system and better support our children,” Walz said in a statement. He also outlined his approach for gradually loosening restrictions on businesses over time, saying his decision will allow up to 100,000 Minnesotans to return to work in industrial, manufacturing and office settings next Monday.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: The switch to virtual events during the coronavirus pandemic includes a festival honoring the king of rock ’n’ roll. Organizers for the Tupelo Elvis Festival announced Wednesday that the music event slated to be held in June will now be a virtual gathering. “The health and safety of our patrons is most important, but we are excited to share our festival with the world,” Debbie Brangenberg, the executive director of the festival, told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal. The annual fest honoring Tupelo-born Elvis Presley features performances from musicians and gospel groups and includes a competition to qualify for the Ultimate Elvis Tribute Contest held in Memphis. Organizers are offering refunds for those who do not want to attend a virtual festival.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Leaders of counties on the edge of the state’s two metropolitan areas are showing an increasing urge to end business shutdowns necessitated by the coronavirus, breaking with urban leaders who have extended stay-at-home orders for several weeks. The majority of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, have occurred in the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. Democratic leaders of St. Louis city and county, Kansas City and Jackson County have extended stay-at-home orders until at least mid-May in hopes of containing the spread of the disease. But amid a growing backlash to social distancing restrictions and the economic fallout, Republican leaders of counties adjacent to the urban core are opting to allow businesses to reopen sooner. Clay and Cass counties near Kansas City announced Wednesday that their stay-at-home orders will expire May 3, the same day Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s emergency order expires.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Churches can hold services Sunday, and some businesses will be able to reopen Monday as long as they practice social distancing, Gov. Steve Bullock said Wednesday in easing coronavirus restrictions while asking residents to continue many of the precautions they have been taking. Because Montana took the coronavirus pandemic seriously and acted quickly and because residents made sacrifices to follow directives to stay at home and use social distancing, the state had the lowest numbers of hospitalizations per capita, Bullock said. The health department reports 59 people were hospitalized and 14 people have died from COVID-19. Two deaths were reported Wednesday. Reilly Neill, a former Democratic state representative and publisher from Livingston, said she thinks Bullock is acting too quickly without enough consideration for the amount of asymptomatic spread of the virus or plans for methodical statewide testing and tracing.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A new state website designed to ramp up testing for the coronavirus logged about 20,000 new registrations on its first day, and the data that residents submit could help determine which parts of the state get tested first, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. Ricketts said the $27 million program, similar to ones Iowa and Utah, will help state officials decide where to first use the 540,000 new tests that were included in the deal with a private contractor. He said front-line medical and public safety workers will get first priority for testing, followed by people who report a lot of symptoms on the Test Nebraska website, followed by people with just a symptoms and then potentially people who are asymptomatic. “Part of it, frankly, will be driven by people filling out the assessment,” Ricketts said at his weekday coronavirus news conference.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: State officials condemned comments Wednesday by Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman after she called for casinos and other nonessential businesses to reopen and suggested the city could serve as a test case to measure the impact during the coronavirus pandemic. One local official called her comments “reckless and dangerous,” and another described them as an “embarrassment.” Goodman, during a 25-minute interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, said she wants everything back open, including casinos, restaurants and small businesses, and a return of conventions. The politically independent mayor suggested that “viruses for years have been here” and said she had suggested that the residents of Las Vegas become “a control group,” serving as “that placebo side,” to see how relaxing closures and restrictions would affect the city.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nStratham: Some summer fairs in the state have already been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Stratham Fair, annually the first in a season of fairs that stretches into October, on Wednesday called off the event, scheduled for July 16-19. The annual Lancaster Fair, held during Labor Day weekend, also was canceled. “At this time of year, the Fair Board would typically be fundraising, hiring entertainment, entering into contracts, and making decisions about our fair programs,” the directors said in a statement Wednesday. “During this public health pandemic, when our entire community is under such an intense strain, it is not feasible to request or make such commitments.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy says the two drive-thru testing sites operated with the federal government cannot yet begin taking asymptomatic residents. Murphy corrected an earlier statement from the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s office that said the testing for residents without symptoms would begin. Murphy said the state first needs to obtain a waiver from the federal government. The state operates the drive-thru facilities with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. One is at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, Monmouth County. The other is at Bergen Community College in Paramus. Beyond the two federally affiliated facilities, New Jersey has nearly 90 sites other testing centers across the state and conducts about 9,000 tests a day, according to Murphy, who said he thinks the state needs to double the number of tests it does daily.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Mental health and substance abuse programs in the state will be getting an infusion of funding as part of the U.S. government’s relief efforts related to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. Members of the state’s congressional delegation say a $2 million grant has been awarded to the state Human Services Department to fund behavioral health services during the pandemic. Officials expect the demand for such services to increase because of the public health toll of the outbreak. “We can’t allow this pandemic to create any lapses in behavior health care for New Mexicans who need it,” Sen. Martin Heinrich said in a statement. “Our state has long faced challenges providing adequate behavioral health resources. That has only been exacerbated during this crisis.” To boost access, the state has launched NMConnect, a new app that provides free 24-hour crisis and non-crisis support.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: More evidence is emerging that far more New Yorkers have had the coronavirus than the number confirmed by lab tests, officials said Thursday. A state survey of about 3,000 people found that 13.9% had antibodies suggesting they had been exposed to the virus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at his daily news briefing in Albany. In New York City, 21% of the people tested had antibodies. Cuomo cautioned that the data was preliminary. The sample of people tested was small, and people were recruited for the study at shopping centers and grocery stores, which meant they were healthy enough to be out in public. Experts also say having antibodies is not necessarily proof someone is immune to the virus. But Cuomo said knowing how many people have antibodies could potentially help set policy on when to reopen parts of the state. Earlier Thursday, New York City’s health commissioner said many as 1 million people in the city may have been exposed.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A number of beer and wine distributors in the state are volunteering their tractor-trailers to help stock grocery stores and food pantries in the midst of the coronavirus. The NC Beer & Wine Wholesalers and NC Retail Merchants associations have joined forces to provide its trucks and commercial drivers to get products to the stores, The Charlotte Observer reports, noting the groups are acting with the approval of the state ABC Commission. Since Gov. Roy Cooper’s stay-at-home order went into effect March 17, distributors lost about a quarter of their business that normally delivers to restaurants and bars, said Tim Kent, executive director of NC Beer & Wine Wholesalers Association. “I’ve got drivers willing to help anyone having distribution difficulties,” Kent said. “These are extraordinary times that require extraordinary measures.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Health officials said the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state now exceeds 700. The North Dakota Department of Health on Thursday also reported one new death, a woman in her 80s from Cass County with underlying medical conditions, bringing the state’s total to 15. Health officials said 32 additional people tested positive for COVID-19 since Wednesday, bringing the state total to 709. Health officials said two previous cases reported earlier were people who lived out of state and were removed from the state’s tally. There were 18 coronavirus patients who were hospitalized Thursday. Officials said 741 people have been screened since Wednesday, bringing the total tested in North Dakota to 16,330. They said 15,621 of those tests have come back negative.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday announced an easing up on the prohibition of elective surgeries during the coronavirus pandemic. DeWine said that doctors can now review postponed procedures and surgeries with patients in terms of their current health situation and quality of life, after which doctors and patients can make a joint decision about whether to proceed. DeWine said patients must be informed of the risk of contracting COVID-19 and must also be told of the impact of contracting the illness during the post-operative recovery process. “I’ve heard stories that some surgeries that we had no intention of stopping have been postponed,” DeWine said. “That has concerned me a great deal, so we are starting back one step at a time.” The governor gave the example of someone who might have postponed hip replacement surgery but now is experiencing severe pain.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Nine additional deaths in the state have been attributed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, while the number of hospitalizations in the state declined by 15, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported Thursday. At least 179 people have now died of COVID-19 in Oklahoma, with eight of the additional deaths in the 65 or older age group and one who was 50-64, the department said. The number hospitalized is 284, down from 298 reported Wednesday. At least 3,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the state. Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday announced plans to begin reopening businesses in the state, starting Friday when barbershops, hair and nail salons, pet groomers and spas can reopen in cities that do not have additional restrictions. The personal care businesses must continue social distancing, and employees and customers must wear masks if they are within 6 feet of each other.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown announced Thursday that she will lift her order delaying non-urgent medical procedures, if health care providers can demonstrate they have met new requirements for COVID-19 safety and preparedness. Hospitals, surgical centers, medical offices and dental offices that meet those requirements will be able to resume non-urgent procedures May 1, Brown said in a statement. “As anyone waiting for an elective surgery knows, ‘non-urgent’ does not mean ‘minor,’ ” Brown said. “This is incredibly important medical care that we would not have told providers to delay if the threat of COVID-19 had not made it necessary.” The Oregon Health Authority on Wednesday reported 57 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state total to nearly 2,060. The agency for the first time in several weeks reported no new deaths in its daily report. At least 78 people have died from the coronavirus in the state.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The Pennsylvania Department of Health slashed the state’s COVID-19 death toll by 201 on Thursday, saying probable deaths it had previously included in the count were eliminated after further investigation. The overall death toll now stands at 1,421, down from 1,622 reported a day earlier. The number of deaths confirmed by a positive virus test actually rose overnight by 69, to 1,394. But Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Thursday that 270 probable deaths that had been added to the death toll in recent days have been removed after further investigation. State health officials had recently changed the way they count COVID-19 deaths – now including probable deaths along with confirmed deaths – which resulted in a doubling of the state’s death toll in just four days. A probable death is one in which a coroner or medical examiner listed COVID-19 as the cause or contributing cause, but the deceased was not tested for the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has launched a new website that allows residents to check whether they are at risk of getting or may have contracted the coronavirus, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Wednesday. The site, covidselfcheck.ri.gov, launched by the state Department of Health in conjunction with Diagnostic Robotics, asks residents about their symptoms, their possible exposure and other risk factors – in English, Spanish or Portuguese – and recommends whether they should see a health care professional. “It’s not a substitute for consulting a doctor but a guide to help you figure out if you should do that,” the Democrat said at her daily news briefing. The site also uses predictive technology to recognize possible outbreaks before they occur.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: More than 341,000 people in the state have said they lost their jobs since the coronavirus pandemic began. The 73,000 jobless claims filed for the week ending April 18 marked the first drop since businesses began closing for COVID-19 in March, according to figures released Thursday from the state Department of Employment and Workforce. But all the people reporting they are out of work over the past five weeks represent more than 14% of the workforce in February in South Carolina. Amid that alarming backdrop, Gov. Henry McMaster called his first meeting Thursday of a group he calls “Accelerate South Carolina.” More than two dozen mayors, presidents of institutions of higher learning, business owners, health care professionals and lawmakers are tasked with figuring out how to reopen the state after closing for the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday recommended that the operators of a meatpacking plant where nearly 800 workers contracted the coronavirus implement a strict social distancing policy and find ways to overcome language barriers. Smithfield Foods closed its Sioux Falls plant indefinitely because of the outbreak and faced complaints that it wasn’t doing enough to protect its workers. A CDC team toured the plant last week and reported the company had slowed down production lines to space workers farther apart and installed about 800 Plexiglas barriers along the lines. But even though there were only a few workers left in the plant, some were still gathering closer than 6 feet apart when not at their work stations or not wearing face masks, the team found. Plant management told the CDC that more than 40 languages were spoken at the plant, making it difficult to communicate guidance to employees.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials on Wednesday finally released more detailed information surrounding confirmed cases and COVID-19-related deaths in its long-term care facilities after open-government advocates, Democratic lawmakers and others urged for its release. The state’s Department of Health had previously held off disclosing such information, saying the state needed to protect “patient privacy.” Similar to previous attempts by the state to withhold certain information during its fight against the coronavirus, officials eventually reversed course by conceding that the information was valuable to the public. According to the state, 37 deaths have occurred in the state’s long-term care facilities, and at least 375 cases have been confirmed. Yet discrepancies in the newly released data remain between what the state and local governments are reporting.\n\nTexas\n\nBeaumont: Mayor Becky Ames says she did not violate the city’s stay-at-home order when she visited a closed nail shop. After a picture that circulated on social media sparked criticism of the mayor showing her nails soaking in a bowl, Ames explained she wasn’t getting a manicure but was soaking her fingertips in acetone to remove the artificial nails. Ames said the salon owner told her that the shop wasn’t open but that she would mix up some solution for pickup, according to Beaumont Enterprise. The photograph was taken while Ames was soaking her nails to learn how to take them off. Ames said she didn’t know who took the photo or even realize there was a third person in the salon. The owner said it was an employee who had stopped by to pick up nail polish to use at home. The worker has been informed she cannot return to the shop, though it was not immediately known for how long.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state launched a new cellphone app Wednesday to track coronavirus symptoms and identify people who may have been exposed, known as contact tracing. The state has a contract worth up to $2.75 million with the social media company Twenty, which makes an app that helps people use location data to find their friends to hang out. The company used its technology to build an app called Healthy Together for the state. People who download the app will get daily reminders to self-report any symptoms, then be directed to testing if they’re at risk. If a case is confirmed, the app will use cellphone location data to trace back everyone they may have exposed to the virus, even those people who they don’t know or with whom they never spoke. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert said data privacy is “of upmost concern.” People would have to opt-in, and location data will be deleted after 30 days, except in cases where there are legal requirements to keep it longer.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont House of Representatives held its first full, online floor session Thursday, a legislative response to the COVID-19 epidemic’s need to stay apart while finding a way to pass legislation. From homes across the state, 153 members of the House and a handful of staff, some of whom were in the Statehouse, met electronically. A few lawmakers called in and weren’t visible online. The session came after lawmakers held 14 committee practice sessions and many smaller online meetings since the House gave preliminary approval last month to a resolution authorizing the online sessions. The first order of business was to formally adopt the the online voting system, which under the rule governing the meetings required approval by three-quarters of the lawmakers online. “This remote system for representing our constituents and meeting our constitutional responsibilities is clearly flawed,” Rep. Anne Donahue, a Northfield Republican. “I cannot pretend that I feel able to function in the way I would normally consider to be necessary to meet those duties.”\n\nVirginia\n\nCulpeper: Two Republican state senators are representing a gym owner who is suing the governor over his executive order that closed down nonessential businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic. State Sen. Bill Stanley and Ryan McDougle filed the lawsuit in Culpeper County on Tuesday on behalf of Merrill C. “Sandy” Hall, who owns several Gold’s Gym franchises. The lawsuit argues Gov. Ralph Northam exceeded his authority when ordering the closure of nonessential businesses, including fitness centers, on March 23. It also seeks relief from the executive order so Hall can open up his businesses. While announcing the lawsuit, Stanley said the doors of the gyms should “no longer be shuttered” and “need to be reopened,” The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. McDougle, who chairs the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus, accused Northam of failing to isolate people infected with the virus so that Virginians could be protected “against government overreach.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: In a historic setting, the state Supreme Court heard oral arguments Thursday while sitting alone in their separate chambers using Zoom technology in a case that seeks the release of inmates in the state’s prisons due to the coronavirus outbreak. “They don’t have the ability to keep themselves safe,” said Nicholas Straley, a lawyer representing the inmates. “They’re reliant on the state to provide them the opportunity to be safe. We can all hold out in our homes. We can decide who we allow into our homes. People in prison do not have that option.” Assistant Attorney General John Samson said the corrections department has handed out face masks, created separated sleeping space, tested 300 inmates for COVID-19 and released some offenders, but releasing thousands more could pose a threat not only to the public but also to the inmates, who could end up homeless. The court concluded the hearing without saying when it would rule on the case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCross Lanes: The cars snaked out of the parking lot, up the road and onto the interstate as a newly opened restaurant during the coronavirus pandemic caused quite a stir among cooped-up residents in this small town. Cook Out’s soft opening Wednesday was a smashing success. Thursday’s first full day had customers jammed three cars across to get to the drive-thru window in Cross Lanes, a community of about 10,000 that, until now, had not seen traffic like this in weeks. Residents from nearby towns who had been stuck indoors for more than a month got their reason to get outside, even in Thursday’s heavy rains. Gov. Jim Justice has ordered residents to stay home unless they have a pressing need to go somewhere. And when they do, people aren’t supposed to gather in crowds of five or more. Wednesday’s soft opening on a sunny spring day prompted a dozen people at times to stand outside the walk-up window.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Organizers of a rally against the state’s stay-at-home order said Wednesday that they’ll proceed with the event even though their permit to hold it on the grounds of the Capitol was denied. Two local sheriffs, meanwhile, cast doubt on whether they would enforce the state’s recently extended order that was designed to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The protest planned for Friday would be the latest in a string of events across the country against such orders that demonstrators say are damaging the economy. It has the potential to be the largest yet in Wisconsin; as of Wednesday, more than 3,300 people said on Facebook that they are going, and 12,000 were interested. The extension of the statewide stay-at-home order until May 26 has prompted the sheriffs in Racine and Polk counties to say they’re not planning heavy enforcement.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Trump administration on Thursday urged government intervention to rescue U.S. uranium mining and nuclear fuel industries in a tough global marketplace, from making it easier to mine public lands out West to blocking some imports of foreign nuclear fuel. Republican Sen. John Barrasso of the mining state of Wyoming, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said Thursday that Russia had “weaponized” its nuclear fuel to undercut uranium miners in the U.S. “The coronavirus pandemic has clearly demonstrated why America should not rely on other nations to supply critical materials. That includes uranium,” Barrasso said in a statement.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/08/giant-joystick-hyena-health-moose-loose-news-around-states/49327113/", "title": "Giant joystick, hyena health: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday signed employment protections for workers who claim a religious or health reason for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The Republican governor signed the legislation a day after it was approved by the Alabama Legislature as GOP-led states turn to lawsuits and legislation to fight federal vaccine requirements that they call an infringement on personal liberties. Ivey also signed into law a separate bill requiring parental consent for minors to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The new law says employers in Alabama can’t fire workers for being unvaccinated if the employee returns a new standardized state form to claim a religious or medical exemption. President Joe Biden in September announced contractors who do business with the federal government must have workforces vaccinated, with no option to test out. The Alabama law will also affect companies, such as medical providers, who wanted to independently place vaccination requirements on workers. The bill drew opposition from the Business Council of Alabama, which said it would put federal contractors in a no-win situation. Democrats said Republicans were putting both jobs and public health in jeopardy for the sake of scoring political points.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Department of the Interior said the first two federal land allotments to Alaska Native Vietnam War-era veterans have been finalized. Frank Nanooruk and Richard Boskoffsky received the first allotments under a 2019 law passed by Congress, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The allotments are east of Goodnews Bay in southwest Alaska, agency spokesperson Richard Packer said by email Friday. The Interior Department said the allotments were finalized Thursday. Under the 1906 Alaska Native Allotment Act, Alaska Natives were allowed to apply for up to 160 acres of land. Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office has said that the program’s restrictions kept many from applying until the 1960s. There was a push to urge Alaska Natives to apply for lands if they had not already done so before a 1971 law took effect. But that period overlapped with the Vietnam War. A 1998 federal law allowed veterans to apply for land, but the provisions were seen as restrictive. The 2019 law lifted use and occupancy requirements that were part of prior laws and made lands available until late 2025, the Bureau of Land Management has said. “We have a sacred obligation to America’s veterans,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Education advocates did not collect enough valid signatures to give voters a chance to repeal a new state law exempting some business owners from a tax increase on the wealthy to boost school funding, a lawyer for Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said Friday. The measure is one of two tax-cut bills signed this year by Gov. Doug Ducey that school-funding advocates are trying to refer to the 2022 ballot. County election officials reviewing a sample of the 123,500 submitted signatures found too many were invalid. Petitioners needed 118,823 valid signatures. The failure to collect enough signatures is not likely to matter much, however, because the Arizona Supreme Court has signaled that the entire tax increase, approved by voters last year as Proposition 208, is likely to be struck down. In addition to the tax exemption for business owners, education groups want voters to have a say on a new flat income tax rate of 2.5%, which would cut taxes by about $2 billion a year, primarily benefiting the wealthy. They turned in significantly more signatures to refer that measure. Lawyers for the Free Enterprise Club, a conservative advocacy group, argued in court Friday that the constitution does not allow referrals for measures that provide for “support and maintenance” of state government and that tax cut bills fall into that category.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A former state senator convicted in 2018 of corruption-related charges is pushing forward with a request for a new trial. Attorney Lee D. Short of North Little Rock filed notice Wednesday that his client, former Sen. Jon Woods, will take his request for a new trial to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Woods was sentenced to more than 18 years in prison on 15 counts of conspiracy, fraud and money laundering for a bribery scheme in which prosecutors said he and another Republican legislator were taking kickbacks from state grants meant to be directed to nonprofit groups. The scheme involved at least $20 million taken from taxpayers or the nonprofit. The request for a retrial comes after claims that the FBI coerced former state Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson into giving incriminating information about Woods that lead to his investigation and subsequent conviction. According to the Democrat-Gazette, the information Hutchinson gave the FBI should have been protected by attorney-client privilege. Four additional state legislators pleaded guilty or were convicted on corruption-related charges in the investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDiamond Bar: Southern California air regulators on Friday approved new restrictions on area oil refineries and other factories that could remove tons of smog-forming pollutants from the air. The board of the South Coast Air Quality Management District adopted rule changes requiring emissions limits on oxides of nitrogen that will affect nine refineries and seven plants that produce asphalt, biofuel plants, hydrogen and sulfuric acid. Oxides of nitrogen, collectively known as NOx, form when fuel is burned at high temperatures. The gases can be produced by cars and industrial sources such as refineries and power plants. They are a key ingredient in producing ozone pollution. The new rules will reduce NOx emissions by about 8 tons per day over the next 14 years, with nearly half the reductions expected by 2023, and will go a long way to helping the region meet some federal air quality standards by 2031, the AQMD said. The rules apply to some 300 pieces of combustion equipment at the facilities, such as boilers and gas turbines. The rules, which will be implemented over a decade, provide two ways of meeting the new requirements and also ban refineries from purchasing credits to offset pollution they produce. The total cost of implementing the new rules is projected at about $2.3 billion, but the reduction in health costs from pollution is expected to be about $2.6 billion, according to a September AQMD study session.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two hyenas at the Denver Zoo have tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the first confirmed cases among the animals worldwide, a national veterinary lab announced Friday. Samples from a variety of animals at the zoo, including the spotted hyenas, were tested after several lions at the facility became ill, according to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories. The hyena samples tested presumptive positive at a lab at Colorado State University, and the cases were confirmed by the national lab. In addition to the two hyenas, 11 lions and two tigers at the zoo tested positive for the virus. “Hyenas are famously tough, resilient animals that are known to be highly tolerant to anthrax, rabies and distemper. They are otherwise healthy and expected to make a full recovery,” the zoo said in a statement. Zoo officials said the hyenas – 22-year-old Ngozi and 23-year-old Kibo – are experiencing mild symptoms, including slight lethargy, some nasal discharge and an occasional cough. The other animals that tested positive in recent weeks either have fully recovered or are on the path to a full recovery. “We now know that many other species may be susceptible to COVID-19 based on multiple reports, and we continue to use the highest level of care and precaution when working with all of our 3,000 animals and 450 different species,” the statement said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Bomb threats forced the evacuation of several buildings at Yale University as well as nearby businesses for hours Friday, school and city officials said. A single caller to the New Haven police nonemergency line indicated there were bombs in eight buildings on campus about 2 p.m., police and school officials said. People in the buildings were initially told to go to the New Haven Green. Later, they were directed to certain indoor locations. Yale gave the all clear at about 7 p.m. and said the campus had resumed normal operations. Several city streets were blocked off as law enforcement officials with bomb-sniffing dogs prepared to search the buildings that were threatened. FBI and state police were helping Yale and New Haven authorities in the investigation and response. “We’re treating this as if it is a legitimate threat; however, at this time we are still working on who the caller was,” acting New Haven Police Chief Renee Dominguez said at a late afternoon news conference. Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins said the person who made the bomb threats did not give a reason.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The family-owned Delaware Park, home to the state’s biggest thoroughbred horse race each year, is being sold to a private equity firm and a gambling investor. The sale of Delaware Park, which has been operated by the Rickman family since the early 1980s and now includes a casino, should be completed by the end of the year, according to a news release Friday. The new owners will be Canadian-based Clairvest Group Inc. and Rubico Gaming LLC, a newly formed subsidiary run by investor Thomas Benninger. Delaware Park President Bill Fasy, who declined to comment Friday when asked about a sale price, said he wasn’t aware of any immediate operational changes to the Wilmington-based attraction, which hosts the Delaware Handicap each July. First developed by William du Pont Jr. in the 1930s, Delaware Park was known as the only major East Coast track, save for Aqueduct in New York, that raced in June. In 1983, longtime Maryland-based real estate developer William Rickman Sr. purchased the track, which had closed after financial troubles. He revived the business by offering smaller purses, which attracted cheaper horses. Competition improved in 1996 when legislation allowed slot machines at the track.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University’s president addressed students Friday as campus protests entered a 24th day Friday, WUSA-TV reports. Dozens of students began occupying the Blackburn University Center and set up tents on the yard in October to bring attention to several issues, including a demand for better living conditions, as they claim some dormitory rooms have been found to have mold. They also want student representation to be restored on the university board of trustees. “We’re not just these radical Black students,” said Channing Hill, a junior at Howard. “We’re simply trying to garner the first-class living conditions that Georgetown students have.” The day’s protests coincided with President Wayne Frederick’s annual State of the University address. Frederick took questions from students and alumni in a virtual event and said he was “empathetic with the students who have concerns.” He said one student with mold in their room is one too many, and Howard needs to make sure its housing partners who are responsible for the upkeep and cleaning air ducts are doing it at a high level. But Frederick also said dorms are not any worse now than they have been in the past. “The physical infrastructure of our residence halls today is as good as it’s ever been,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Reversing its previous position, the University of Florida said Friday that it will allow three professors to testify as experts in a lawsuit challenging a new state election law that critics say restricts voting rights. Last month, the university prohibited Dan Smith, Michael McDonald and Sharon Austin from testifying in the lawsuit brought by civic groups, saying that such testimony would put the school in conflict with the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, which pushed the election law. More than half of the university’s trustees are appointed by the governor. In a letter to the campus, university President Kent Fuchs said he is asking the office responsible for approving professors’ outside work to greenlight their request to serve as expert witnesses in the litigation. Fuchs said the outside work would have to be on the professors’ own time and not use university resources. Attorneys representing the professors said they were still planning to move forward with a lawsuit against the university. The school’s announcement came after the union for faculty members urged donors to withhold contributions and scholars and artists to turn down invitations to campus until university administrators affirmed the free speech rights of school employees.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republicans on Friday advanced a plan projected to maintain a 33-23 GOP majority in the state Senate, setting it up for a possible vote this week in the full Senate. The proposal passed the Senate Reapportionment and Redistricting Committee on a 9-4 party-line vote over complaints that Republicans pushed too fast for a proposal released late Tuesday. “This process has gone too fast,” said Sen. Harold Jones II, D-Augusta. “We should really know what we’re talking about.” As senators voted, a House committee started considering new districts for the 180-member state House. The General Assembly must redraw electoral districts at least once every decade to equalize populations following the U.S. census. Georgia added more than a million people from 2010 to 2020, with urban districts generally growing and rural districts usually shrinking. This will be the first time in decades that Georgia lawmakers won’t be required to get federal approval of their maps after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act. Committee Chairman John Kennedy, R-Macon, noted that this year’s redistricting process had been compressed because of delays in releasing census results. But he said that if people wanted different alternatives considered, they should have gotten their senators to introduce them.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: An independent review of the state of astronomy and astrophysics in the U.S. has recommended federal funding of a giant telescope in the state. The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey warned it could be “disastrous” for U.S. astronomy if the National Science Foundation does not invest in projects like the Thirty Meter Telescope, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The survey recommends the U.S. government fund several large astronomy projects. “There’s a little bit of a feeling of astronomy going the way of physics,” said Doug Simons, director of the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy. He said the cancellation of a particle accelerator in Texas in 1993 resulted in the research moving to European facilities like the Large Hadron Collider. “I think if … the Europeans were the only international organization that had this kind of research capacity, that really signals something kind of alarming in the U.S., which has historically had a leadership role in contemporary astronomy.” But the report also highlights astronomy’s problems with Indigenous people. Some Native Hawaiians consider the proposed site for the giant telescope, on the Big Island’s Mauna Kea, to be sacred. “I wish they would have recognized that we have already spoken,” Native Hawaiian activist Kealoha Pisciotta said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch sent a letter to the White House last week requesting a meeting about Idaho’s federal district judge vacancy, saying it “cannot be filled” without a “mutual agreement” between them and the administration. But the “blue slip” procedure that the Republicans referenced – a system that gave home-state senators a veto over federal judicial nominees – was thrown out during the Trump administration, when federal judges were appointed over objections from Democratic senators. “The blue slip procedure regarding filling United States District Court vacancies is alive and well,” the two senators wrote in a Nov. 2 letter to Dana Remus, counsel to the president, the Idaho Press reports. Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials submitted an all-female list of four nominees to the White House in March, but there’s been no further word on the nomination since then. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill took senior status in August, making Idaho eligible for another federal judge. The Democratics nominated Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Idaho is one of just three states with only two U.S. district judges and has not gotten an additional judgeship in 60 years, though caseloads have soared.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools officials have canceled all classes next Friday in a bid to boost COVID-19 vaccinations among younger students who are newly eligible for the shots. A letter from the district sent Thursday to parents and families said schools will be closed Nov. 12 for “Vaccination Awareness Day” after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved a COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old last week. District CEO Pedro Martinez said next Friday’s canceled classes will provide “an opportunity for parents and guardians to take their children 5 years of age and older to get vaccinated.” He said sporting events would not be canceled. Martinez and Chicago Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady have stressed their desire to see children vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when family gatherings have proven to spread the coronavirus at high rates. Jesse Sharkey, the Chicago Teachers Union president, said in a statement to union members that he welcomes the district’s acknowledgment of the importance for parents and families to get their children vaccinated. Free vaccines can be obtained at sites around the city. In addition, CPS has set up four clinics where students can get shots. Appointments can be made at cps.edu/vaccinations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: With state tax collections surging, a top Republican legislator is looking at possible significant changes to the state sales tax and cutting property taxes for some businesses. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Tim Brown hasn’t offered details yet for what he could propose for the new legislative session starting in January, but such changes face concerns about the possibility of an economic slowdown and the impact on funding for local governments and school districts. Topics in Brown’s sights include expanding Indiana’s 7% sales tax that covers merchandise purchases ranging from clothing to cars so that it also is charged for spending on services, which potentially could be anything from haircuts to hospital stays. Brown said his aim would be to lower the sales tax rate if it were applied to a broader range of spending. Brown pointed to a trend of more spending on services, which federal reports show now make up nearly 70% of consumer spending. “Our sales tax base is changing a lot, so I am interested in looking at sales tax, and sales tax affects everybody,” Brown said. “It doesn’t matter how much money you make; you pay sales tax.”\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Twenty years after a fire destroyed the dome of the University of Iowa’s Old Capitol, the UI now is preparing to redo “failing” gilding at an estimated cost of $200,000 to $500,000. The UI will pay OPN Architects $23,500 to study the “causes and extents of gilding failure on the Old Capitol dome and develop recommendations for repair and restoration,” according to a contract signed in September. The study may include drone photography, sampling of the gold leaf and consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office. Wendy Moorehead, UI assistant director of facilities management, said that “the campus is excited to celebrate the upcoming year representing the 175th anniversary of the UI, and the Old Capitol dome, at the heart of campus, will represent that important milestone.” Another major milestone was the Nov. 20, 2001, fire that destroyed the dome, damaged much of the historic building and kept the Old Capitol shuttered for five years. The Old Capitol Building, for which the cornerstone was laid July 4, 1840, was to be the hub of state government after Iowa City was chosen as the state capital in 1839. The Iowa Legislative Assembly met in the building for the first time in December 1842. The Legislature decided in 1857 to move the capital to Des Moines. Old Cap housed most of the UI classes after the university was founded in 1847. The building also served as the library, chapel, armory and office space for administrators.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly grew more forceful Friday in opposing President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandates, saying it’s “too late” in the pandemic to impose them after Kansas and other states tailored responses to their needs. Kelly’s latest statement came a day after she argued that federal mandates “tend not to work,” though they’ve boosted vaccination rates elsewhere. She faces a difficult race for reelection next year in her Republican-leaning state, and GOP officials have been attacking the Democratic president’s mandates for weeks and criticizing Kelly for not making any public comments until Thursday. “While I appreciate the intention to keep people safe, a goal I share, I don’t believe this directive is the correct, or the most effective, solution for Kansas,” Kelly said in her latest statement. Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican who hopes to unseat Kelly next year, announced later Friday that Kansas is among seven states that filed a federal lawsuit with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati against a Biden mandate that applies to companies with more than 100 workers. Schmidt already had brought Kansas into a federal lawsuit against a mandate applying to employees of federal government contractors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear, a Bluegrass State bourbon industry leader and a Louisville-based spirits producer are applauding an agreement between the United States and the European Union to lift tariffs on bourbon and whiskey. The United States and European Union have been in a trade war since 2018, when the former imposed a 25% tariff, or tax on imports, on European steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum under then-President Donald Trump. The European Union retaliated with tariffs on American products, including a 25% on bourbon whiskey. That tariff on a major Kentucky product was set to double Dec. 1. But now, for bourbon producers, “it’s time to raise a glass,” Kentucky Distillers Association President Eric Gregory said. National security adviser Jake Sullivan, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced an agreement Oct. 30 in which the United States will allow some quantity of European steel and aluminum to come to the country without tariffs, and, in turn, the European Union will drop its retaliatory tariffs. Gregory said that “these unfortunate tariffs have slashed exports of Kentucky bourbon by 50% to the EU and the United Kingdom, costing distillers, industry partners and farm families hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nFranklin: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is holding a contest to name a recently improved pond in a national wildlife refuge. The agency has graded the parking lot and installed a floating dock and an information kiosk at the pond on Stephen R. Road in the Bayou Teche National Wildlife Refuge near Franklin. Now it’s asking people to visit the refuge and take a selfie or a photo of their family enjoying its trails as part of their entry. The photo, proposed name and a short explanation of the name can be submitted by email – bayouteche@fws.gov – or at facebook.com/SoutheastLouisiana. Specific personal names or vulgar, profane, racially insensitive or other derogatory names will not be accepted. The top five entries will be announced Dec. 2 on the refuge’s Facebook page, and the public will have a week to choose their favorite. The winning name will be announced live on Facebook at 10 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 11.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s environmental commissioner said Friday that she’ll take the referendum vote into account when deciding whether to suspend a permit for a $1 billion electric transmission line in western Maine. Commissioner Melanie Loyzim will close comments at the end of a new public hearing Nov. 22 so she can expedite a decision. Loyzim’s letter to New England Clean Energy Connect points to an aggressive timetable after Maine residents voted Tuesday to halt the project. The law takes effect 30 days after election results are certified. The Natural Resources Council of Maine told the commissioner the permit should be revoked immediately to prevent further environmental damage during construction, which is continuing. It would be a “dereliction of duty” for regulators to allow “continued destruction” of woodlands while waiting for the law to go into effect, James Kilbreth, a lawyer for NRCM, wrote Thursday in a notice to environmental regulators. The 145-mile power transmission line would serve as a conduit for up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower. Most of it would be built along existing corridors, but a new 53-mile section is being cut through the woods to reach the Canadian border.\n\nMaryland\n\nElkton: The Christmas tree that will light up Rockefeller Center this holiday season is coming from Maryland for the first time in the nearly nine decades of the annual tradition. A 79-foot-tall Norway spruce will be cut down in Elkton next Thursday and arrive in New York City on Saturday, the center announced Thursday. Rockefeller Center’s website says the 85-year-old tree will be covered with about 5 miles of wire holding more than 50,000 multicolored lights and topped with a 900-pound star covered in 3 million Swarovski crystals. The lighting ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 1 and will be televised on NBC. After that, the tree will be lit daily from 6 a.m. to midnight. It will be lit for 24 hours on Christmas Day and from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Three residents of a tent encampment at the nexus of the city’s opioid and homelessness crises say in a lawsuit that Boston’s plan to move them from the area is unconstitutional because it doesn’t provide viable alternatives, officials said Friday. The lawsuit filed Thursday in Suffolk Superior Court by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and the WilmerHale law firm was in response to the city’s decision last month to declare addiction and homelessness a public health emergency and clean up the area around Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, known as Mass and Cass. The city pledged to find treatment or alternative housing for people displaced from tents in the area but has not properly done so, according to the ACLU. Although only three plaintiffs are mentioned, the suit applies to all residents of the area, according to the ACLU. “We can’t sweep or arrest our way out of the intersecting crises at Mass and Cass,” Carol Rose, the state ACLU’s executive director, said in a statement. “This plan is harmful and unconstitutional because it forces people to disperse with no safe place to sleep, while disconnecting them from the medical care they are able to receive at Mass and Cass.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed Republican-backed bills that would have created scholarship accounts for K-12 students to pay for educational expenses, including private school and tutoring, and given tax credits to people and corporations that donate to the program. The veto, which was expected, came the same week proponents of the legislation preemptively launched a ballot drive that would enable the GOP-led Legislature to enact identical citizen-initiated bills without her signature. The Democratic governor said the bills would cut state revenue by as much as $500 million in 2022 alone. “Simply put, our schools cannot provide the high-quality education our kids deserve if we turn private schools into tax shelters for the wealthy,” she wrote to lawmakers, adding that she has worked to reverse disinvestment in public education. School-choice proponents such as the Great Lakes Education Project criticized Whitmer, saying the funds would have helped more than 1 million kids who fell behind during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the plan, students would have been eligible for scholarships if their family income was no more than double the cutoff to receive free or reduced-priced lunch – $98,050 for a family of four currently – or if they had a disability or were in foster care.\n\nMinnesota\n\nPine City: Gov. Tim Walz was among the thousands of hunters who took to the field Saturday for the state’s firearms deer hunting season opener. Walz hunted with Brady Crocker and Kevin Hinze on the Hinze family’s private property in Pine County. The family permanently protected the land by donating a conservation easement to the Minnesota Land Trust. Walz, Crocker and Hinze didn’t get a deer, but the opener was marked by beautiful, warmer-than-usual weather across most of Minnesota. Following the hunt, Walz visited a chronic wasting disease sampling site in Pine City, joined by Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Sarah Strommen and Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen. They highlighted the importance of sampling to detect the brain disease, which is always fatal in deer. During opening weekend, people hunting in CWD surveillance, control, or management zones must bring their harvested deer to sampling stations to be tested. Voluntary sampling is available after the opening weekend for deer harvested within a CWD zone. “I ask all Minnesota deer hunters to be aware of CWD regulations and use one of the state’s sampling sites if hunting in a mandatory or voluntary sampling area,” Walz said in a statement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An environmental group is using fines from the 2010 BP oil spill to plan the state’s first oyster shell recycling program. “It’s very straightforward – take the actual oyster shell and reuse it to help restore the very resource it’s providing. But the devil is always in the details,” said Alex Littlejohn, state director for The Nature Conservancy. “We want to learn from the other successful programs like this in other states, work through the kinks and make this a viable program for Mississippi.” At least 14 other states have had programs that collect empty shells from restaurants, festivals and other venues and use them to build coastal reefs. A survey before the COVID-19 pandemic found such programs in all four other Gulf Coast states, nine on the East Coast, and California, said Tom Mohrman, The Nature Conservancy’s director of marine programs. The programs often cover specific areas, such as Galveston Bay or Mobile Bay, but Mississippi’s coastline is small enough that one program could cover it all, he said. Mississippi’s Gulf Coast generally has plenty of oyster larvae but needs more hard surfaces where they can attach themselves and grow into oysters, the organization said in a news release. Oyster reefs also create homes for other types of marine life, slow waves that erode coastlines, and purify water.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The U.S. Office of Special Counsel said in a letter to President Joe Biden and members of Congress that employees at a federal office complex in the city were exposed to “widespread, longstanding” contamination from asbestos, lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxic materials by the agency in charge of managing government workplaces. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the letter, issued Friday, also noted that children at an on-site day care facility were exposed. The letter said officials deliberately misled tenants about the health risks at the Goodfellow Federal Center in north St. Louis. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel handles investigations and prosecution aimed at protecting federal employees. The OSC said an investigation into whistleblower allegations “substantiated that officials had been aware of environmental contamination but failed to appropriately notify GSA employees or tenant agencies.” The investigation also concluded that officials made no effort to limit access to contaminated areas and failed to assess potential exposure risks in the site’s child care center. The GSA has said it is working to close the Goodfellow complex and expects to relocate most tenant agencies by the end of 2022.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Calls to the Missoula Mobile Support Team have significantly reduced the number of people who would otherwise be taken to jail or to an emergency room since the team’s inception late last year, according to a presentation the program’s organizers made to a City Council committee Wednesday. Data shows that calls to the team are also on the rise. “The number of calls increased over time and continue to increase,” Gretchen Neal, Missoula County’s mental health coordinator, told the Missoulian. The Mobile Support Team is funded by the county, the city and the state. Emergency medical technicians from the Missoula Fire Department and licensed behavioral health clinicians or clinicians in training work with case facilitators to staff the team. They are trained to provide consultation, screening and brief intervention to individuals in crisis stemming from behavioral health issues, which includes mental health issues or substance abuse issues. The goal is to provide them with the care they need while reducing the time that first responders spend addressing a situation in which behavioral health is the chief concern. Another goal is to reduce the number of arrests and emergency room visits, which reduces government-funded jail and hospital costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city plans to join hundreds of others across the nation trying to come up with strategies to combat climate change. While the Nebraska Legislature has rejected calls for a statewide plan, Omaha will lead a metropolitan area climate action plan expected to be funded with a mix of public and private money, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Mayor Jean Stothert told the newspaper in an email that the time is right. “Omaha has been implementing sustainability measures for some time now without the need for a formal plan,” she wrote. “The current timeline gives us the opportunity to maximize the results of more coordination for climate-related practices.” Climate plans typically involve identifying where a community is most vulnerable to severe weather, its contribution to global warming, what needs to be done and measurable steps that can be taken. A consultant is expected to be chosen by mid-2022. It could take a year or longer for the consultant that’s chosen to develop the plan. Some wonder what took so long. The Kansas City metropolitan area, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and Lincoln are among nearby places that already have climate action plans. “Omaha and the surrounding area are late to the solutions game,” said David Corbin, chairman of the Missouri Valley Sierra Club’s energy committee.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: American Civil Liberties Union attorneys said if the state redraws its political maps without reallocating thousands of inmates to their pre-prison addresses, they will be in violation of a 2019 Nevada law. The threat of a lawsuit and the organization’s insistence that prison officials compile more addresses could complicate the redistricting process that lawmakers are expected to conduct this month. Though the U.S. census counts inmates at prisons where they’re serving sentences, Nevada is one of a growing number of states required to reallocate residents in prison to where they previously lived. Nevada lawmakers in 2019 passed legislation to ban so-called prison gerrymandering. It directs the Department of Corrections to “compile the last known residential address of each offender immediately before the offender was sentenced to imprisonment in a facility or institution of the Department” and subsequently “provide to the State Demographer all available information.” Last week, prison officials said they only had usable addresses for 6,275 people out of the 12,214 counted in the 2020 census, or about 51%. In a Friday letter sent to lawmakers and state officials, attorneys Holly Welborn and Chris Peterson allege the thousands of missing inmate addresses “place the Legislature at risk of violating Nevada’s Constitutional requirement to base reapportionment on accurate data.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: A 9-foot-tall video game joystick made of wood, rubber and steel has made it into the Guinness World Records 2022 as the largest. Dartmouth College professor Mary Flanagan created the giant controller – nearly 14 times the size of an original classic Atari controller – in 2006 to celebrate her childhood experience of “maniacally” playing Atari 2600 video games. She also wanted to see what it would be like when a single-player experience becomes collaborative: It takes at least two people to operate the joystick and push the button to play classic Atari games such as “Centipede” and “Breakout.” “To have this common pop culture artifact just erupt in the middle of a space and allow people to play something familiar, yet not familiar, was exciting,” said Flanagan, an artist who is chair of Dartmouth’s Film and Media Studies and the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities. The joystick, which toured Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, is now part of the permanent collection of ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A truck driver who ousted the powerful state Senate president in last week’s election previously posted online calling Islam “a false religion,” comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust and defending rioters at the U.S. Capitol. Republican Edward Durr apologized Friday after media outlets highlighted the posts. His victory over Steve Sweeney, widely regarded as the second most powerful Democrat in state government, in Tuesday’s election shocked the state’s political establishment. Durr spent a paltry sum on his campaign. On Thursday and Friday, media reports highlighted posts Durr had made on Twitter and Facebook, including some critical of immigrants, boasting of defying state COVID-19 mask mandates, and making misogynist attacks on Democratic elected officials like then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Durr issued a statement Thursday night to radio station WHYY and Friday to the website New Jersey Globe apologizing for the posts. “I’m a passionate guy and I sometimes say things in the heat of the moment,” Durr said in identical comments to both outlets. “If I said things in the past that hurt anybody’s feelings, I sincerely apologize.” Twitter showed Friday that Durr’s account had been deactivated by the user.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials have been inundated with critical letters on proposed K-12 social studies standards over the inclusion of racial identity and social justice themes in a majority-Latino state where Indigenous tribes have persevered through war, famine, internment camps and boarding schools aimed at stamping out their cultures. If approved, the standards would require students starting in kindergarten to “identify some of their group identities” and “take group or individual action to help address local, regional, and/or global problems.” By high school, students would examine “factors which resulted in unequal power relations among identity groups.” Critics, including some Hispanics, say the standards promote victimhood, while supporters have praised the standards as “more just and anti-racist.” The proposed New Mexico standards represent a new frontier in the clash over “critical race theory” – an academic concept increasingly used by conservative activists as a catchall term for the study of systemic racism, historical oppression or progressive social activism. New Mexico is a patchwork of 23 federally recognized Native American nations, tribes and pueblos. Half of the state is Latino, and about 10% of students are Native American, with many tracing their heritage to pre-Columbian and 16th-century Spanish conquistadors.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The former head of the city’s police sergeants union has been punished with a loss of 70 vacation days, which amounts to almost $32,000 in pay, after being found guilty by his own police department of improperly disclosing information and using inappropriate language on social media, police said Friday. Ed Mullins of the New York Police Department had already filed retirement papers last month and retired as president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association in the wake of federal agents raiding the union’s office and his home. The retirement was effective as of Friday, but the NYPD said in an email that “the cases were moved forward expeditiously to ensure the appropriate penalty could be imposed in the event of findings of guilt.” Mullins was found guilty in disciplinary proceedings for improperly tweeting NYPD paperwork last year regarding the arrest of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s daughter during protests over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. He denied violating guidelines. In a separate complaint from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, he was also found guilty after an administrative hearing for using inappropriate language in social media posts he made that referenced other New York City officials. Review board Chair Fred Davie said he was “disappointed” that Mullins was docked vacations days and not fired.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Barely 24 hours after their passage, the state’s newly drawn maps drew another legal complaint that will likely determine how much Republicans can expand their political clout over the coming decade in a state that is slowly becoming more blue. An organization formed by Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic lawyer, announced Friday that a group of voters who successfully challenged previous North Carolina maps will now make a similar appeal in state court contesting the latest congressional maps. They will argue that the boundaries approved by Republicans on Thursday were drawn for political gain in a way that violates several provisions of the North Carolina Constitution. The stakes are high, as Republicans currently hold an 8-5 edge over Democrats in the U.S. House and would likely expand their advantages substantially if the maps prevail. During a virtual event on Twitter, Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, called North Carolina’s maps “a grotesque partisan gerrymander” and “indefensible.” “The Republican Party has lost all shame,” Elias said. “I mean, in the 2010 (redistricting process and) after 2010, they were still pretending that they cared about democracy and about voting rights, and now they no longer pretend.” Last week, voters and advocacy groups sued in Wake County court to block the timetable for passing state legislative maps, accusing Republicans of breaking rules aimed at ensuring Black voters can elect their desired candidates.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A proposal to use $150 million in federal stimulus money to build another pipeline to carry natural gas from the Bakken region to eastern North Dakota will be on the table as lawmakers convene at the Capitol. Lawmakers plan to divvy up $1 billion from the federal American Rescue Plan Act during the special session, which opens Monday, and the money that leaders hope to set aside for pipeline grants could make the prospect of such a project more attractive to developers. “There’s been a long-standing desire to see more North Dakota gas be used in the state,” North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad told the Bismarck Tribune. The Bakken region of western North Dakota produces substantial quantities of gas alongside oil, and some of it is wastefully burned off in flares at well sites rather than piped away for use as fuel due to a lack of infrastructure. Some eastern North Dakota communities have gas service because they happen to be near a limited number of pipelines that extend to that part of the state, but many do not. Much of the gas produced within North Dakota is transported to markets in other states. Cost appears to be the major barrier to building another pipeline. The economics tend to work out better to send gas down existing pipelines into other states, Kringstad said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The election board for the state’s most populous county is being put under administrative oversight by the secretary of state, after another problem with electronic poll books led to three improperly cast votes in last week’s election. Not all of Franklin County’s electronic poll books were properly updated on Election Day with data about who had already voted early or requested an absentee ballot, according to Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office. His office has determined three voters were able to vote twice but said those votes didn’t affect the outcome of any election. One of those voters told the office they cast a ballot during early voting, then did so again on Election Day while accompanying their spouse to vote because a poll worker indicated the poll book didn’t reflect the earlier vote. The voter said they were worried their first ballot hadn’t been counted. The Franklin County Board of Elections had another problem last year with some of its electronic poll books not updating, and it didn’t fully follow a remediation plan to avoid the newest problem, LaRose’s office said. To make sure the board is effectively administering elections, it will now have to report weekly to the secretary of state, according to LaRose’s office.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group of about 20 local pastors and ministers gathered outside the state Capitol on Friday to pray for Gov. Kevin Stitt as he weighs the fate of high-profile death row inmate Julius Jones. The preachers said they hoped Stitt would lean heavily on his Christian roots and follow the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board’s recommendation that Jones be granted clemency. “Lord, we implore you to allow Gov. Stitt to be the hero of Julius’ story,” the Rev. Keith Jossell, Jones’ spiritual adviser, said in his prayer. The prayer gathering came only days before Jones’ execution date, set for Nov. 18. Jones was convicted in 2002 in the fatal shooting of Edmond insurance executive Paul Howell during a 1999 carjacking. Jones has maintained his innocence in the murder, claiming another individual shot and killed Howell and pinned the slaying on him. The Rev. Major Jemison, senior pastor of St. John Missionary Baptist Church, said the circumstances surrounding Jones’ conviction included Jones’ lack of adequate representation, lack of fairness and lack of equality. Jemison also voiced unease that there could be negative consequences should the governor go against the parole board’s recommendation. “We are also very concerned about the potential for civil unrest if the state proceeds with the execution of Mr. Jones while disregarding the avalanche of questions and ambiguity surrounding the circumstances of the case,” he said.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: The teachers union in the city has filed a lawsuit over a policy passed narrowly by its school board that limits what kinds of images or signs school employees can display on campus. The “Ensuring Safe Environments to Learn” policy bars school employees from displaying images “relating to a political, quasi-political, or controversial topic.” The lawsuit was filed Wednesday. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the Newberg policy has been a lightning rod for controversy, with the ACLU, Democrats in the Oregon Legislature and the State Board of Education all issuing statements against it. The policy, backed by a four-member majority of the Newberg school board, started out as a directive to remove signs and posters showing support for Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ pride. In its 18-page complaint, the Newberg Education Association argues the policy violates two amendments of the U.S. Constitution: the First Amendment protecting free speech and the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection. The suit also argues the Newberg policy violates Article I, Section 20 of the Oregon Constitution, which protects “against vague laws that confer unbridled discretion, because such discretion creates the potential for unequal application of the law,” among other state constitutional provisions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf said his mail-in ballot was dropped off by his wife before Tuesday’s election despite a state law requiring that voters deliver them in person. Wolf’s spokeswoman Beth Rementer called it an honest mistake. “I did vote; actually I voted by mail,” Wolf said Tuesday on KDKA radio. When an interviewer told him the ballot was due in the York County elections office by the end of Election Day, he said first lady Frances Wolf delivered it. “My wife actually dropped it off personally two weeks ago, so it’s there,” he said. The interview segment was highlighted Thursday in a tweet by state Rep. Seth Grove, R-York County, who has spent much of the past year working on an election code revamp. In June, Democrat Wolf vetoed an election reform bill Grove sponsored. “It’s law,” Grove said in a text exchange Thursday. “You can’t hand in more than 1 ballot.” He said Frances Wolf dropping off the governor’s mail-in ballot would have been legal had his bill been enacted. State law requires voters who do not mail their absentee or mail-in ballot to “deliver it in person to (their) county board of election,” although with preapproval others can do it under certain circumstances.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A World War I veteran is getting a new monument in the city after the original monument in his honor was vandalized. City Councilman David Salvatore said the new marker in honor of Pfc. Carlo Lafazia will be commissioned and dedicated next spring. “We’re going to relocate it to a new area that is going to allow for an education opportunity, first and foremost about the history of Private Lafazia and the contributions that he made, and secondly, some of the history around World War I and what that meant to the Eagle Park community and to Rhode Island as a whole,” Salvatore said. Lafazia, who served in the 16th Infantry Regiment, was killed in the Forest of Argonne in France in October 1918. The original monument was placed on Admiral Street in 2017. But earlier this year, it was knocked off its foundation. The vandal was never caught. The damaged monument stone is now stored at the Department of Public Works.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A strong storm off the Southeast’s Atlantic coast combined with periodic higher tides Sunday, causing coastal flooding that approached levels rarely seen outside of hurricanes along the South Carolina and Georgia coasts, officials said. Scientists have said data shows the unusually high tides and the flooding of roads that come with it are happening more frequently as sea levels rise with global warming. The Sunday high tide in Charleston Harbor reached 8.51 feet, the 10th-highest level in the century of recording at that site, the National Weather Service said. The high water closed dozens of roads in downtown and caused the city to cancel its Veterans Day parade scheduled for Saturday. Sunday’s high tides were the culmination of four days of rising ocean water pushed ashore by both winds from a strong autumn storm offshore and periodic King Tides when the moon’s location causes the water level to increase. Rising sea levels are leading to more frequent flooding, meteorologists said. Charleston Harbor has recorded 25 of the 39 tides of 8 feet or greater since 2015. The tide reached that level for major flooding three times already this month, meteorologists said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A moose on the loose got onto the South Dakota State University football field in Brookings before leaving town. Campus police said the moose left campus about 3:30 p.m. Friday and was headed west. They said the bull moose appeared to be 1 to 2 years old. Emmett Keyser, the regional supervisor for the Game Fish and Parks office, told KELO-TV his agency helped the campus police and other law enforcement with herding the moose out of town. “We did try to move him north,” Keyser said. But, in apparent impersonation of a running back, “he ran back through our line and into the stadium,” Keyser said. The moose hung around campus for a time until officials were able to herd him west out of town. “The thing is, moose are so unpredictable,” Keyser said. “You don’t want anyone getting hurt or the animal getting hurt.” The sighting followed one a few days earlier of a moose walking down U.S. Highway 75 in Luverne, Minnesota, about 50 miles away. It wasn’t clear if it was the same moose. While moose are rare in the area, they do appear from time to time.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Friday again extended an executive order that allows parents to opt students out of school mask requirements that federal judges have blocked from applying in three counties. The Republican’s decision maintains the status quo on the opt-out order for two weeks while he considers whether to sign a broad coronavirus-related bill that would limit mask policies in schools even further. He first issued the mask opt-out order in mid-August and extended it in late September. Lee on Friday also extended the ongoing state of emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic until Nov. 19, while members of his administration “continue analyzing impacts of recent legislation & how it affects certain provisions,” he wrote on Twitter. During their recent three-day special session, Republican lawmakers passed a proposal that would in part largely prohibit government entities – including public schools – from implementing mask mandates. Those entities would only be allowed to require masks if they lived in a county with a rolling average 14-day COVID-19 infection rate of at least 1,000 per 100,000 resident while the state is under a state of emergency. There are no counties that currently meet that threshold. Even then, mask mandates would continue to be limited in use.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The weeklong, record-breaking February freeze this past winter led to crises of power, water, food, shelter, medical care, transportation and emergency response. A lengthy report published by the city Thursday identified a myriad of issues the community experienced that week and offered 132 recommendations about how to be better prepared for the next disaster. The freeze “was an overlapping emergency with overwhelming and cascading community impacts,” says the report, written by the city’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management departments with the help of Hagerty Consulting. The report reviewed the city’s entire response to the weather event and subsequent crises, identifying lapses in training and coordination, as well as supply-chain failures and neglected communities. “City and county leadership sought to move expeditiously to provide life-sustaining services,” the report says. “These included activation of shelter and warming centers, coordinating medical operations and distribution of drinking water. They faced significant obstacles in loss of infrastructure, staffing shortfalls, and availability of volunteers.” The coronavirus pandemic meant resources were already stretched thin, the report says. Some elected officials and volunteers set up services in response to shortfalls in departmental services.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State lawmakers are set to vote on a name change for southern Utah’s Dixie State University this week. A bill to rename it Utah Technical University will be considered in a special session in which lawmakers will also vote on redistricting, state Rep. Kelly Miles, R-South Ogden, told Fox13. It’s expected to get a hearing before the Education Interim Committee on Tuesday. The step comes after numerous public hearings, focus groups and a vote in favor of a name change from the Utah System of Higher Education. Supporters of changing “Dixie” have pointed to difficulties in recruiting and retaining students, who link the name to the South, the Civil War and the Confederacy. Past yearbooks show students in blackface, Confederate flags and the former mascot dubbed “The Rebel.” Opponents of the name change insist the name comes from Mormon pioneers who settled in the St. George area to grow cotton. They’ve begun launching campaigns to pressure lawmakers to resist a name change, accusing the state of giving in to “cancel culture.” The Washington County Commission recently passed a resolution supporting \\\\ the “Dixie” name. But Miles said that after an extensive input-gathering process, he expects the Legislature to support a name change. Gov. Spencer Cox would also be expected to sign it.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is requiring unvaccinated employees to use personal sick time if they are exposed to someone with COVID-19 through their jobs and have to quarantine. State workers who exhaust all their sick time could be required to quarantine without being paid. Fully vaccinated employees forced to quarantine will be paid without needing to use sick time. “We want to do whatever we can to take advantage of safe, effective and free vaccines,” Jason Maulucci, a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Phil Scott, said Friday. “If there are people who choose not to, there are implications to making that decision.” Maulucci said it was unclear how many people have had to use sick leave or if anyone has already gone unpaid. Steve Howard, executive director of the Vermont State Employees Association, said there have been cases in which employees have had to use leave, but he didn’t have a specific number. He didn’t know if anyone had gone without pay. Howard said the union has filed a grievance, saying the new policy was implemented without working through the details with the union. The previous policy allowed state workers who had to quarantine to be paid while out of work.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A juvenile son of Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin tried twice to cast a ballot in Tuesday’s election, election officials said Friday. The 17-year-old presented an ID but was told he was ineligible to vote due to his age and turned away, according to a statement from Scott Konopasek, Fairfax County’s general registrar. The statement said the teen did not successfully vote, made no false statements, did not disrupt voting and appeared to have committed “no election offense.” The statement mentioned Youngkin’s son by name, saying the identification was based on contemporaneous notes by the chief election officer. The news was first reported by The Washington Post. The Associated Press is not naming the son because he is a juvenile. A spokesman for the Republican governor-elect, who campaigned heavily on election integrity, said the son misunderstood Virginia’s laws. State law allows any person who is 17 and will be 18 by Election Day to register in advance and vote in any intervening primary or special election. Jennifer Chanty, a precinct captain, told The Washington Post she encountered the son, who left after initially being told he was too young to vote. She said he returned a short time later, saying a friend who was also 17 had been allowed to cast a ballot. Youngkin, who has four children, made election integrity central to his campaign during the fight for the GOP nomination, and he refused for months to say whether President Joe Biden was legitimately elected.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Three Black women who work for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department have filed a lawsuit against the county alleging a long-standing pattern of discrimination, harassment and retaliation against minority employees. The News Tribune reports Lt. Charla James-Hutchison and Sgts. Dione Alexander and Sabrina Braswell-Bouyer are the highest-ranking African American women in the department’s 168-year history. Their attorneys filed the suit on their behalf last Monday, claiming that the women – who all work in Pierce County Jail – have suffered emotional distress, economic losses and damage to their reputations due to the decades of discrimination. No specific damages are specified in the lawsuit. James-Hutchison, Alexander and Braswell-Bouyer are among 12 Black women who work for the Sheriff’s Department, according to county statistics. There are 47 Black sworn employees in the department out of about 614. The women have been subjected to racial slurs, told they were only hired or promoted to “fill a quota,” called thugs because of their hairstyles, and subjected to colleagues’ comments about how the COVID-19 vaccines should be tested on Black people before white people, the suit says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Grandparents who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren ages 5 to 11 can receive a $150 school voucher if they are vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday. The program is through the Healthy Grandfamilies vaccination incentive program. To receive a voucher, the family must be enrolled in West Virginia State University’s Healthy Grandfamilies program at healthygrandfamilies.com. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended the vaccine for use by children ages 5 to 11. All vaccine-eligible members of the family must have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vouchers can be used for school supplies, the governor’s office said in a news release. About 19,000 West Virginia children live in households with a grandparent as primary caregiver, according to the Healthy Grandfamilies organization.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison has raised the Ho-Chunk Nation flag over its main administration building, marking the first time the university has flown another nation’s flag with the U.S. flag and the Wisconsin flag. Friday’s ceremony at Bascom Hall felt historic to senior Paige Skenandore, who grew up on a reservation in northern Wisconsin and is one of roughly 100 Native American students on campus. It also felt long overdue. “I think this is a great first step,” Skenandore told the Wisconsin State Journal. “It’s been a long time coming. It’s kind of shocking that it hasn’t happened before.” Ho-Chunk Nation Chief Clayton Winneshiek told attendees the flag-raising was “a start.” UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank said the flag-raising was more than a symbolic gesture but part of an ongoing commitment to educate and acknowledge the state’s tribes and their sovereignty. Almost 190 years ago, the U.S. government and Ho-Chunk Nation signed the Treaty of 1832, which forced the tribe to give up territory that includes the UW-Madison campus. “For many years, UW-Madison was not mindful of this history, and we paid little attention to our relationship with the descendants of those who were here long before us,” Blank told a crowd of at least a couple hundred. “But we are working to change that.”\n\nWyoming\n\nTorrington: An inmate who died Wednesday is the fourth death in as many weeks at the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution. The Casper Star Tribune reports 66-year-old Frank Lee Apodaca died Wednesday at the Community Hospital in Torrington. The Wyoming Department of Corrections said it will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Apodaca was from Fort Collins, Colorado, and sentenced to nine to 12 years in prison in 2017, after being convicted of third-degree sexual assault and intrusion on a victim under age 16 in Laramie County.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/12/coronavirus-vermont-live-updates-cases-closures-covid-19/5023835002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Vermont: Latest news and impact", "text": "Free Press Staff\n\nAs the situation surrounding the COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus continues to evolve in Vermont, here are updates and information.

Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15.

An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

The state's total fatalities related to the coronavirus now stand at 56.\n\nSix new cases of the disease were reported in the department's mid-morning update, for a cumulative total of 1,135. Three of the cases are in Chittenden County.

A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19. Eligible “short-term borrowing costs” do not include principal payments, fees, or any interest on borrowings not directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipalities can learn more, and apply, by visiting https://www.vermonttreasurer.gov/content/local-government.\n\n_________\n\nThree additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont, bringing the pandemic total to 1,130, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 914 people have recovered from the virus, the data showed, and 52,890 people have been tested.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 10 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\nMonday, June 15, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced. Campground use had been capped at 50% capacity.\n\nQuarantine guidelines from out-of-state campers will remain in place.\n\n_________\n\nOne additional positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Vermont on Sunday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,128, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, about 912 people have recovered from the virus, the data shows, and 52,557 people have been tested, the data showed.\n\nTwo people are in the hospital for COVID-19, and 14 are hospitalized under investigation — the same numbers as Sunday.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n________\n\nDespite uptick in cases due to a cluster in Winooski in early June, Vermont seems to be back on a reliable path toward containing and tracking the coronavirus (# of cases dipped to just three over the weekend), according to Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine.\n\nStatewide, effective ways of managing outbreaks can take place even as restrictions are relaxed, he said.\n\nSerology tests (that test blood for the presence of, or exposure to, coronavirus) would be of limited utility in Vermont, where the population that has been exposed remains very low by national standards (Levine's best guess is 5%).\n\nLess invasive and more comfortable tests (front-of-nose; saliva) are in development, and will, until a vaccine is developed, make it easier for people to seek out testing, Levine added.. Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday.

Police already are “depleted and exhausted,” and leaders don’t want to add to restrictions that already include early closing times and crowd limits at nightspots, Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox said. But the sight of crowds like those that gathered near campus in an area called The Strip are disheartening after officials spent weeks pleading with people to take steps that will slow the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, Maddox said. Maddox’s comments came after University of Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne tweeted a photo that showed dozens of people, many not wearing face masks or staying away from others, waiting to get into a popular bar in Tuscaloosa on the day sororities accepted new members. “Who wants college sports this fall?? Obviously not these people!! We’ve got to do better than this for each other and our campus community. Please wear your masks!” Byrne said in a tweet Sunday. Tuscaloosa police officers issued 12 citations for mask violations and arrested four people, but the problem wasn’t just at the University of Alabama: Photos on social media also showed large crowds and relatively few masks around Auburn University over the weekend.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Travel on an Alaska ferry was temporarily suspended after the vessel transported passengers who tested positive for COVID-19, officials said. The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities announced sailings by the M/V Matanuska are suspended until Monday, The Juneau Empire reported. The transportation department said in a statement that five passengers who traveled aboard the Matanuska last week tested positive for the virus. The ferry’s crew was required to receive negative test results before the ship resumes service, the department said. On Monday, the department said tests on all 47 crew members returned negative. Passengers who had tickets for the canceled sailings this week were being notified and either rescheduled or refunded, the department said. The passengers are believed to have been infectious while traveling on the Matanuska, which embarked from Kake, traveled through Sitka and arrived in Juneau on Aug. 10. While the ship was in transit, the crew learned some passengers had been in close contact with an individual in Kake who had tested positive, the department said. The passengers were quarantined in their cabins and provided room service until arriving in Juneau, in accordance with protocols, the department said. The passengers informed the department they had tested positive and the department informed other passengers and the public out of an abundance of caution. State health officials recommended recent travelers on the Matanuska self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 and take extra precautions.\n\nArizona\n\nWindow Rock: The Navajo Nation has lifted its stay-at-home order but is encouraging residents to leave their homes only for emergencies or essential activities. The stay-at-home order was rescinded Sunday, when 24 additional coronavirus cases and zero deaths were reported. Tribal officials on Monday reported 12 new COVID-19 cases but zero deaths again. The numbers are a vast change from earlier this year, when the tribe had one of the highest per-capita rates of infection in the U.S. The tribe’s executive branch released its reopening plan last week. Although some tourist destinations partially overseen by the federal government reopened Monday, tribal officials discouraged visitors from off the reservation. The National Park Service said it is working within the tribe’s guidelines but could not police who visits Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Chinle, Navajo National Monument near Shonto and Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site in Ganado. Limited services such as restrooms, self-guided trails and overlooks were open. Tribal parks such as Monument Valley and the Four Corners Monument were not open, Navajo President Jonathan Nez said Monday. Representatives for Nez didn’t respond to requests for further comment.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Dr. Deborah Birx, President Donald Trump’s top coronavirus adviser, said friends and families holding parties are driving the virus’s spread in the community, issuing the warning as outbreaks at some colleges across the country are being tied to large gatherings. Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, urged people to wear masks and socially distance after visiting with Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and state health officials, pointing to the gatherings as a particular concern. Arkansas’ Health Department on Monday reported 412 new virus cases and four more deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Hutchinson said ensuring college students in Arkansas don’t have large parties like the ones Birx warned of is a challenge. “This is where the universities need to educate and they also need to have a plan whenever a student doesn’t behave properly or carefully,” Hutchinson said. Arkansas’ K-12 public schools are set to resume classes next week. Although schools are allowed to offer virtual classes or a hybrid option that includes some onsite classes, the state is requiring schools to be open five days a week for students who need in-person instruction. Birx stopped short of weighing in on that approach, but said offering the students the option of virtual learning decreases the number of students in the classroom.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The Los Angeles Unified School District will launch an aggressive coronavirus testing and contact tracing program for all students, staff and their families as part of a broad plan to safely reopen campuses. No date has been set for reopening schools in the nation’s second-largest district. The academic year formally begins this week with distance learning. The spread of COVID-19 in the Los Angeles area still exceeds state guidelines governing the possible return of students to campuses. The testing and tracing plan announced Sunday will provide data that can be used as a guide for renewing school operations, Superintendent Austin Beutner wrote in an opinion article for the Los Angeles Times. Tests will first be given to staff working at schools, as well as to any of their children participating in child care provided for Los Angeles Unified employees. Testing will also be provided to family members of students and staff who test positive for the coronavirus and family members who show symptoms. In the event of a positive test, contact can be made with others in the school community to quickly isolate the virus, Beutner wrote.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The beginning of Colorado State University’s move-in week is far different this year. Students are being tested for COVID-19 and required to wear masks or other facial coverings inside – outside, too, if social distancing can’t be maintained. And instead of having as many as 4,000 students moving in on a single day during the usual two-day window, they’re arriving and moving belongings into their rooms in small groups at preassigned times throughout the week. “It’s definitely going to be different,” said Martika Hererra, a freshman from Artesia, New Mexico. “It’s just a new way of life, because we all have to wear masks and do different things. There are different regulations and laws. It’s not our usual way of life and doing things.” Hererra and her parents, Rachel and Ben, had no reservations, though, about moving her into Piñon Hall during her assigned time Monday. “I’m more excited than anything,” Martika said. Students began the move-in process Monday, with even the largest residence halls – 12-story Westfall and Durward – limiting access to 15 students per hour and limiting each student to a maximum of two helpers. Move-in times begin at 8 a.m. and end at 9 p.m. daily through Friday, said Tonie Miyamoto, the director of communications and sustainability for CSU’s housing and dining services. Residence hall capacity has been reduced for the semester from 6,300 beds to about 5,600, Miyamoto said, to allow for more social distancing in community areas and to set aside living spaces with separate entrances for any students who might need to be quarantined because of a positive COVID-19 test or close contact with someone who tests positive.\n\nConnecticut\n\nUncasville: The Mohegan Sun casino said it will lay off an unspecified number of employees because of impacts from the coronavirus pandemic. The southeastern Connecticut casino on sovereign tribal land opened June 1 despite opposition from Gov. Ned Lamont over the potential danger of spreading the virus in large group settings. About 3,000 of roughly 5,000 workers returned to work at that time. The company said it is ending its furlough program on Sept. 30. Mohegan Sun President & General Manager Jeff Hamilton said the move will reduce their workforce among employees who have not been called back to work before the end of September.“This difficult decision came after careful consideration and was driven by the unprecedented circumstances created by the pandemic, including reduced capacity and the inability to open all of the property amenities,” Hamilton said in a prepared statement reported by NBC Connecticut.The company said it was working with employees to find new positions.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State health officials said that coronavirus-related hospitalizations have fallen to below 30 for the first time. The Delaware State News reported Monday that there were 29 hospitalizations. The numbers come from the Delaware Division of Public Health. Seven of the hospitalizations are considered critical. Delaware has recorded more than 16,000 positive COVID-19 cases. New Castle County has seen the most. It has 7,580 cases. Sussex County has recorded 6,197, Kent County has had 2,496. There are 263 cases where the county is not yet known.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser said the District will expand its number of contact tracers by 175, bringing the total to 450, WUSA-TV reported. D.C. health officials said contact tracers will begin conducting home visits starting on Thursday for cases in which individuals were reached but did not complete an interview, or were unable to be reached. The home visits will allow investigators to assess the need for additional social services.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The state reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases since mid-June on Monday as the number of people hospitalized continued to fall. The state reported 2,678 new confirmed cases, a level the state hasn’t seen since June 17 just as Florida began a monthlong surge of new infections that peaked at 15,300 on July 12. The seven-day average for new cases is now about 3,600, down from 11,000 a month ago. Also, the number of people being treated in Florida hospitals for COVID-19 has been declining since highs above 9,500 on July 23. The number of patients in the late morning Monday stood at 5,657, according to a total posted online by the state. The state reported 87 deaths Monday, bringing the total since the outbreak was first reported in Florida on March 1 to at least 9,674. Mondays are typically low numbers for deaths as some hospitals don’t report over the weekend.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: A longtime county commissioner in Georgia died Monday after more than two weeks in the hospital fighting the coronavirus. Chatham County Commissioner James Holmes of Savannah was 82. His wife, Yvonne, confirmed his death to news outlets. She said her husband had been hospitalized with COVID-19 since July 30. “This is something of a reminder, and I don’t think we need this occasion to remind folks of it, of how serious the coronavirus really is,” Al Scott, chairman of the Chatham County Commission, told reporters at a news conference. Holmes was a former high school basketball coach who had also worked as an assistant coach at Savannah State University. Scott said that Holmes planned to leave office at the end of the year after serving on the commission since 2005.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Anastasiya Kamaletdinova spent her first day of eighth grade at Kaimuki Middle School on Monday on a computer in her bedroom. “I was more shy than usual,” Kamaletdinova , 13, said. “Everything was great except for the last 20 minutes, I had problems with my computer and I couldn’t hear my teacher for some reason.” Like many public school students across Hawaii, she started the new academic year remotely as coronavirus cases are surging on Oahu, where Honolulu is located. The statewide teachers union led an effort to delay the first day for students by two weeks. At the union’s urging, the Hawaii Department of Education announced most schools would start the first four weeks online. The union is still concerned there are students on campuses this week. Education officials said some students will be on campuses for things such as picking up learning materials and learning how to use technology for remote instruction. This week, Aikahi Elementary on Oahu’s windward side is welcoming small groups of students for a few hours each day for orientation, training on distance learning systems and connecting with teachers and friends, said Principal Keoki Fraser. The union warned some teachers would be using personal or sick leave to avoid jeopardizing health and safety. Fraser said all his teachers were present Monday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A school district in southwestern Idaho has announced plans to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic despite recommendations against doing so from local health officials. The New Plymouth School District Board voted 4-1 on Aug. 10 to reopen classrooms five days a week to about 1,000 students starting Aug. 24, the Idaho Statesman reported Monday. However, Southwest District Health reported that Payette County has the highest level of community spread, which comes with a recommendation to close school buildings. New Plymouth is located in Payette County, about 50 miles northwest of Boise. Board Chairman Marc Haws scrutinized the community’s latest COVID-19 data, reviewed a parent survey and weighed the risk of the coronavirus against the impact of more lost time in the classroom and did not find a compelling reason to keep the schools closed. Haws said the district considered recommendations from the local health department but argued that the school board has the ultimate responsibility to open or close the schools. New Plymouth Superintendent David Sotutu said everyone at the schools will be required to wear facial coverings and practice social distancing. Sotutu also said masks will be offered, sanitation procedures will be increased and students will have the option to learn solely online.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: State public health officials on Monday launched a COVID-19 hot spot map for travelers to assess their risk before leaving the state. The online map shows which U.S. states have an average daily case rate of at least 15 cases per 100,000 people, which is considered higher risk. “This virus does not recognize borders and specific regions and it doesn’t stop at the edge of a region or a county,” Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said at an East St. Louis news conference. “We know that people may have to travel, but potentially based on where you may go that travel may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19.” She urged travelers to factor in details like how to safely manage airport terminals and rest areas.\n\nIndiana\n\nRockville: The Parke County Board of Commissioners voted to cancel this year’s Covered Bridge Festival because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commissioners voted 2-0 on Monday, with one member abstaining to cancel the event that had been scheduled for Oct. 9-18, the Tribune-Star reported. Commissioner Bruce Hartman said he had spoken to many local health care and emergency management professionals recently and had “come to the conclusion there is a absolutely a risk to the people of Parke County.” Hartman said he had heard from residents on both sides of the issue but not one had presented a solid reason to hold the festival other than the income it generates. As one resident pointed out to him, Hartman said, “Money’s no good if you’re dead” from the coronavirus. The festival in years past has attracted as many as 1 million visitors to the rustic western Indiana county to enjoy its 31 covered bridges. Commissioner Jim Meece agreed with Hartman, saying there was no realistic way the county could enforce or hope to achieve anti-COVID measures recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or Gov. Eric Holcomb and the State Department of Health.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A state agency said it is working to fix a data error on Iowa’s coronavirus website that lowers the number of new confirmed cases and therefore downplays the severity of the outbreak, just as schools are deciding whether to reopen. The glitch means the Iowa Department of Public Health has inadvertently been reporting fewer new infections and a smaller percentage of daily positive tests than is the case, according to Dana Jones, an Iowa City nurse practitioner who uncovered the problem. It’s particularly significant because school districts are relying on state data to determine whether they will offer in-person instruction when school resumes in the coming days and weeks. Potentially thousands of coronavirus infections from recent weeks and months have instead been erroneously recorded as having happened in March, April, May and June, Jones said Monday. The numbers are skewed because some people tested negative earlier but recently tested positive. Iowa’s system has been recording their new positive results as having happened when their original negative results were reported. “It’s one of the worst data errors that could be happening right now,” said Megan Srinivas, an infectious disease physician in Fort Dodge, Iowa. “We are making these policy calls based on completely flawed numbers and that needs to be acknowledged.” An Iowa Department of Public Health official confirmed the glitch in an email to Jones Friday. He said a system-generated date when test results are reported to the state stays the same when an individual later tests positive. But the state has yet to publicly announce the error. Amy McCoy, a spokeswoman for the public health department, told the Associated Press that she hoped to have more information about the issue soon.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly imposed a new ban on evictions and foreclosures on home mortgages in Kansas because one federal program to aid unemployed workers has expired and she isn’t sure that the state will participate in an alternative offered by President Donald Trump Kelly’s order prevents landlords and lenders from initiating efforts to remove people from their apartments or homes if they can’t pay their rent or make their mortgage payments because of financial problems resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Kelly’s executive order took effect Monday and is remains in effect until Sept. 15. The governor said she might extend the order longer if Congress does not approve another coronavirus relief package. She also said that she recognizes that her new order will burden landlords and home lenders, and her administration has started to look for ways to provide relief to them. A federal program providing an additional $600 a week to unemployed workers expired at the end of July. Trump issued an executive order earlier this month offering $300 a week in extra benefits, with an extra $100 available to jobless workers if states cover the cost. Kansas has yet to sign up for either version, and Kelly questioned whether Trump has the power to bypass Congress.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky should accept a supplemental $300 in federal weekly assistance for its unemployed workers under a White House offer that won’t require any extra spending by the state, Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell said in a letter to the state’s Democratic governor. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, noted in his Monday letter to Gov. Andy Beshear that some states – including some led by Democratic governors – have started accepting the assistance. McConnell added that “Kentucky must not be left behind.” “All you need to do is sign up,” McConnell, the chief congressional ally to President Donald Trump, said in his letter. Kentucky and other states were hit by surging unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic. The option recently provided by the White House involves less than the $600 a week in federal aid that unemployment recipients received until the assistance expired on Aug 1. Congress has been unable to agree on an extension amid an impasse on a new round of coronavirus aid. Trump issued a series of executive orders, including the lower supplemental unemployment payments, after negotiations broke down over the new relief bill. Another option for Kentucky and other states is to tap into federal aid already provided under the coronavirus rescue package to raise the extra weekly payment to $400 for unemployment claimants, McConnell said. McConnell was a chief architect of the massive relief provided under the measure. Kentucky recipients will still receive regular state unemployment benefits under the options. Beshear responded later Monday that his administration had reviewed the application and “put together a draft” but still needed “clarity” on some points in the program.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal judge in New Orleans refused to block a state order closing bars to stop the spread of COVID-19, handing a defeat to 10 southeast Louisiana bar owners who had sued to stop the closure. U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman said the closure order was legal under the broad powers a governor has under public health emergencies such as the pandemic. Feldman, a judge in the federal court system’s Eastern District of Louisiana, ruled even as a hearing in a similar suit played out in the Western District. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, who issued the order last month, was testifying in that lawsuit Monday afternoon, according to a Twitter post by an Edwards spokeswoman. The hearing was before U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays in Lafayette, where 11 bar owners were fighting the closure order. Feldman heard arguments Friday. “The case turns on a classic who-decides question: As between democratically accountable state officials and a federal court, who decides what measures best protect Louisianans during a global pandemic?” Feldman wrote. “The answer is state officials.” It is unknown when Summerhays will rule. Feldman said federal court precedent makes clear that “the bar owners cannot succeed on the merits of their claim that the Governor’s enforcement of the ban of on-site consumption of food or drinks at ‘bars’ violates their constitutional rights.”\n\nMaine\n\nMillinocket: Two dozen Maine residents tested positive for the coronavirus after a wedding reception in Millinocket – the state’s first outbreak linked to a social gathering, officials said Monday. Eighteen people who attended the Aug. 7 reception and six others who had close contact with attendees subsequently tested positive, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control. All told, about 65 people attended the indoor event at the Big Moose Inn, said Maine CDC spokesman Robert Long. The governor’s executive orders put in place during the global pandemic limit indoor gatherings to 50 people if there’s adequate space, and 100 people are allowed at outdoor events. Attendees should also follow physical distancing guidelines and wear masks while not eating. The Maine CDC was communicating with Big Moose Inn about the nature of the event and adherence to state requirements. A telephone message was left at the inn on Monday afternoon. Millinocket Town Manager John Davis said Monday that he didn’t have all the details about the outbreak, but said there was enough concern to close the town hall and local schools as a precaution. It’s unknown if the owner of the Big Moose Inn could be cited if it’s confirmed there were too many people at the reception. The governor’s executive orders allow for a fine of up to $10,000, the governor’s spokeswoman said.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:SunFest, the city’s “biggest and best festival,” won’t go on as planned in 2020, becoming yet another event to be postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. SunFest is an annual festival that brings artists, musicians and food vendors to the Ocean City Inlet each fall. This year’s event was scheduled for Oct. 1-4. The Ocean City Mayor and Town Council unanimously voted Monday night to postpone SunFest after a long discussion about the festival’s viability given the pandemic and statewide restrictions. Despite the postponement, Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan still encouraged people to visit the beach town this fall, according to a press release announcing the change to SunFest. “Ocean City has actively promoted the many ways visitors can enjoy the town while maintaining physical distancing this summer, but for an event like Sunfest, we recognized it would not be possible to host the event in a way that was in the best interest of public health,” Meehan said. The decision by the town came after state officials issued guidance stating SunFest couldn’t have any audiences for live performances because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state has taken another step toward an expedited renovation project at a veterans’ care center that was the site of one of the nation’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks at a long-term care facility. The Office of Administration and Finance said it had selected a company to conduct a 12-week assessment of what needs to be done at the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke. The assessment includes meetings with stakeholders such as veterans and their families, staff, community members and state legislators. It will also look at cost estimates, financing options and realistic timelines for regulatory approvals, design and construction. The assessment by Payette will be used to develop and implement a plan to apply for a federal Veterans’ Affairs State Home Construction Grant by the April 15 deadline. “Our administration is committed to supporting important facility improvements for the Soldiers’ Home to ensure the facility can provide the best care possible for the veteran residents who have served our country with honor,” Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement. During the outbreak at the 250-bed state-run facility that opened in 1952, 76 aging and sick residents died after contracting the disease caused by the coronavirus and dozens of other residents and staffers were sickened. A state investigation found that a building poorly designed for infection control, as well as “baffling” decisions by management, allowed the disease to run amok.The home’s superintendent was fired, and the state Veterans Services Director, who oversaw the home, resigned. The state has already spent $6 million to improve infection control at the facility, including the replacement of furnishings and the installation of air purification units.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Legislators gave final approval Monday to bills that would provide flexibility for K-12 schools as they prepare to open amid the coronavirus pandemic, waiving physical attendance and minimum instruction requirements to allow for remote classes. The legislation, which Gov. Gretchen Whitmer will sign, would give districts and charter schools the option to choose in-person instruction, online or a hybrid based on consulting with local health departments. Their student count, the foundation of state funding, would be weighted heavily toward last year’s figure and less so on uncertain enrollment in the new academic year. The plan utilizes innovative methods of instruction and keeps kids safe “without jeopardizing their education,” said House Education Committee Chairwoman Pamela Hornberger, a Republican from Macomb County’s Chesterfield Township. The measures were passed on 77-33, 77-29 and 81-25 bipartisan votes in the GOP-controlled House two days after clearing the Republican-led Senate following a deal with the Democratic governor. The bills would revise how attendance is linked to funding. Currently, districts must have 75% average daily attendance to get their full state aid. Instead, schools would have to make sure there are two-way interactions between 75% of students and their teachers. Districts also would have to administer a benchmark assessment to K-8 students twice, including once in the first nine weeks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:The City Council voted 5-1 to censure member Paul Brandmire for suggesting a mask mandate could lead to yellow star badges that mark COVID-19-positive people. At Monday’s meeting, council member Carol Lewis asked for the censure, stating she “never expected that a false equivalency of marking someone for death” would come up during during a discussion on mandating face masks to preserve life by preventing the spread of COVID-19. The council approved a mask mandate July 20, days before Gov. Tim Walz ordered masks worn in indoor spaces statewide. At the meeting, Brandmire said, “I mean, if we can mandate masks we can certainly mandate that any COVID-positive people wear some sort of identification badge, maybe like a bright yellow star or something on their lapel.” At the following meeting, on Aug. 3, Lewis and council member George Hontos asked Brandmire to apologize for his remarks. Brandmire refused to apologize for what he said was a “vague reference” against government overreach but said he would apologize to Holocaust survivors who were offended. Brandmire was unable to vote on the motion; he also did not respond to the motion or other council members’ comments Monday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is expanding access to free coronavirus testing for teachers and school-based emergency telehealth coverage after more than 70 of the state’s 82 counties have reported outbreaks during their first few weeks back in the classroom. The State Department of Health has reported 245 cases of coronavirus in teachers and 199 in students since some districts began returning to school in late July. More than 2,000 students and about 600 teachers at the start of this week are in quarantine after being exposed to the virus, state health officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said. To curb the spread of the virus, Dobbs announced Monday that K-12 teachers in the state will now have access to free testing, regardless of whether they have symptoms or know they have been exposed. They will be able to be tested at the state’s two community testing sites, as well as 16 new regional mobile testing sites to be set up early next week. Additionally, the Mississippi Division of Medicaid said that it has expanded its coverage to allow schools without nurses or school-based clinics to access telehealth services. That change began Aug. 1 and will continue through the end of the pandemic, officials said. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said the two measures will ensure that Mississippi’s schools “will remain safe,” adding that he hopes expanding testing for teachers, in particular, will give educators confidence and “peace of mind” about returning to school.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The mayor of Missouri’s largest city has been getting plenty of messages about people not following social distancing guidelines at bars, so he decided to check for himself. Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told the Kansas City Star that he spent two hours on Saturday night dropping by or looking into eight businesses in the city. His decision to spot check came after a video circulated online showing more than 100 people – most without masks – at an event in the Power & Light District. The Democratic mayor publicized his personal cellphone number and he has received several messages about people ignoring guidelines aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. He decided to check out establishments in various neighborhoods of the city: Midtown-Westport, Country Club Plaza and the 18th and Vine Jazz District, where he lives. Lucas told the Star that most businesses were trying to follow public health guidance. He found “one bad actor,” another that did an “outstanding” job following protocols, and most somewhere in the middle. “There was one establishment I went to that appeared to be following absolutely no protections in the slightest,” said Lucas, who did not name the business.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Gov. Steve Bullock said his office has been in contact with actress Sharon Stone, shortly after she posted on social media about her sister, in which she said it took five days in Montana to get test results for a COVID-19 test. Bullock said Stone called the governor’s office last week but there was no indication of family members in hospitals and she offered to be part of a fundraiser to increase funding for testing. Bullock said in a news conference in which he was discussing Montana’s fire fund and budget that the state is working with health care providers to make sure they have the resources they need for testing and “we’re continuing to do the work to get rapid turnaround testing … 2-5 days … everywhere across the state.” Stone, 62, urged Instagram followers Sunday to wear a mask “for yourself and others” after her sister Kelly, who is immunocompromised, was hospitalized in Montana with COVID-19, USA TODAY reported. Stone posted photos of her sister Kelly’s hospital room and wrote that Kelly, who has lupus, had only visited the pharmacy but still contracted the virus. Stone said in a video that in Montana, where Kelly and her husband, Bruce Singer, live, people can’t get tested unless they are symptomatic. She said this was happening as people carried guns in a protest in front of a courthouse saying it was their right to not wear a mask. She said earlier that Bullock was not returning her calls and that the health department had hung up on her. She urges people to vote for Democratic president candidate Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris because “with women in power we will fight for our families.” Bullock said the citizen advocate from the governor’s office called her Monday morning for more information. Bullock said there have been protesters in Helena and other places statewide about not only masks, but his stay-at-home order.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A western Nebraska school district has canceled most classes this week after three staff members tested positive for the coronavirus, requiring two dozen school workers to quarantine. Classes for most grade levels in the Broken Bow School District have been canceled for the week, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Superintendent Darren Tobey said in an online announcement that classes for prekindergarten and grades 6-12 were canceled through Friday. Kindergarten through fifth-grade classes were expected to be held as usual. The district is now also requiring all students and staff to wear masks through Sept. 7, including at extracurricular activities and on school transportation. The requirement will be revisited before it expires, Tobey said. The school district covers 426 square miles in Custer County and has an enrollment of more than 800 students.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Walmart in Mesquite and high-end retailer Nieman Marcus on the Las Vegas Strip were among 11 businesses statewide fined last week by inspectors for failure to comply with coronavirus pandemic mitigation measures, including mask-wearing and social distancing, officials said. A tire shop in Fernley was the only northern Nevada business that made the list following about 700 initial workplace visits statewide, a Nevada Occupational Safety and Health statement said. A Las Vegas pizza restaurant was fined about $6,000 and a Boulder City bar was ordered to pay more than $4,800, OSHA said. Other fines ranged from less than $3,000 for a tire store in Las Vegas to more than $12,600 for Walmart. Nieman Marcus was fined $8,501. The inspections followed Gov. Steve Sisolak’s announcement in July that he would focus more closely on data specific to businesses and municipalities rather than broad guidelines for geographic areas to reopen with measures in place to prevent COVID-19. The communities of Dayton and Mound House in Lyon County had the lowest municipal compliance rate, at 50%, OSHA said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The University of New Hampshire expects to open a coronavirus testing lab with a 12-hour turnaround time for results within a few weeks, the head of the state university system said Monday. Chancellor Todd Leach joined colleagues from private colleges and the community college system for a discussion hosted by U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan. Students have begun returning to many campuses this week, and so far the process has gone smoothly, they said. At the public universities, students are required to get tested for the virus before arriving, and will be tested upon arrival and again within weeks, Leach said. The new lab will be able to process thousands of samples a day, not just from the UNH campus in Durham but from Plymouth State University and Keene State College, Leach said. “That will ensure no matter how busy things get around the country, we’ll have a turnaround time that’s fairly tight,” he said. At the state’s community colleges, where fewer students live in campus, the focus is less on testing and more on personal protective equipment, said interim Chancellor Susan Huard. That’s because many students also work as essential workers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy gave a strong endorsement of having high school sports while saying such activities need to be limited to outdoors-only and with precautions. Murphy said the final determination on fall high school sports seasons will be made by the State Interscholastic Athletic Association, which he said “will only pursue a sports schedule if they feel the proper health and safety requirements can be met.” If districts opt not to have teams take the field, the state will not overrule them, he said. But Murphy said he was “hugely of the opinion we need sports,” citing beneficial mental and physical health, teamwork and camaraderie effects. If high school sports weren’t pursued, he said, third-party organizations would “fill that void” and might not provide the same level of oversight as would the high school athletic association. Murphy said most fall sports are outdoor activities and safer than indoor ones, and social distancing can be ensured among spectators and on sidelines. “There just isn’t evidence of outdoor flare-ups,” the governor said. “The flare-ups that we’ve seen at the college level, even at the community level, as far as we can tell have been overwhelmingly tied back to indoor activities that were away from the athletic activity.” The state’s high school athletic association said July 30 that “our return-to-play plan is in full swing throughout New Jersey,” adding “we’re eager to begin our seasons in mid-September.” NJ.com reported that the Newark school district, the state’s largest, announced plans Monday to begin the fall with all-remote instruction, reversing plans for some in-person instruction. Other school districts have announced similar plans and some have canceled high school sports for the fall.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces:With schools beginning classes through distance learning, districts have seen cases of staff with COVID-19 on their campuses – including Hatch Valley Public Schools, Gadsden Independent School District and Deming Public Schools. This has required schools to work closely with the New Mexico Department of Health to help track down those who have come in contact with people who have tested positive. Statewide, school districts are looking ahead and planning for students’ eventual return to campus for face-to-face learning. This has led districts to consider what actions they will take to limit the spread of the virus when it comes time for in-person learning. “It’s not a matter if we’ll have positive cases, it’s when we have positive cases — (and) to the extent we have them,” said Kelly Jameson, spokeswoman for Las Cruces Public Schools. “If there was a potential outbreak, it would be incumbent upon the district to be responsible and disclose any kind of threat to the public.” Like other districts, LCPS will be following guidance and taking advice from the DOH on procedures moving forward. Jameson said LCPS will be communicating any coronavirus activity to the community.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Indoor gyms in New York can reopen as soon as next week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday, if they meet public health requirements, including inspections, mandatory mask wearing, a 33% occupancy limit and 6 feet between gym-goers. All gyms that meet the state’s health and safety standards can open by Monday or as at late as Sept. 2 if local officials say they need more time for local inspections. County governments and the mayor of New York City can also decide to delay the start of indoor fitness classes beyond Sept. 2, Cuomo said. The governor’s announcement came just over five months after the state shuttered gyms and other businesses statewide in hopes of reducing the spread of the coronavirus. Gym and fitness studio owners have been clamoring for New York for their businesses to reopen as Cuomo has lifted restrictions on certain industries since mid-May. “The fitness industry is ready to reopen safely, with proper protocols in place to protect our employees and members,” Bill Lia, chairperson of the New York State Fitness Alliance, said recently. The Cuomo administration allowed bowling alleys to open with restrictions starting Monday, while indoor dining is allowed outside New York City.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Public schools returned to class Monday, with most students still learning from home through computers to start the year because of continued worries about COVID-19. Nearly every school in all K-12 districts began the new school year. Leaders of districts and charter schools that teach two-thirds of the 1.5 million public school students chose to implement full-remote learning for now, according to data from the Department of Public Instruction. The first day was marked by technical challenges beyond those that video conferencing and virtual learning bring. Districts reported trouble for children and instructors logging on to the North Carolina Education Cloud. The portal provides access to several digital applications, including tools for grading and attendance, instructional materials and lesson plans. “The product experienced a degradation in service this morning,” the Department of Public Instruction said in a news release. The service was working as of midday Monday, the agency said, and the vendor that provides the service will expain what went wrong. In a Facebook post, the Craven County Public Schools said the system experienced an “overload due to so many students across the state trying to login at the same time.” Under Gov. Roy Cooper’s plan, school boards could start the year by offering full remote learning, in-person instruction with strict social distancing or a mix.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Interim committee meetings for lawmakers have been canceled at least through next week after a member of the Legislature’s research arm tested positive for the coronavirus. John Bjornson, who heads the Legislative Council, said the staff member told him late Sunday night. Bjornson said he notified legislative leaders early Monday, who gave the OK to cancel the meetings as a precaution. Bjornson said the staff member is asymptomatic and was working from home on Monday. Five interim committee meetings had been scheduled for this week, and at least two next week. All will be rescheduled, Bjornson said. Bjornson, the Legislature’s top attorney, said he has encouraged all 32 of his staff to get tested for the coronavirus. The nonpartisan agency includes accountants and attorneys who help lawmakers with research, bill drafting and budget proposals. The staff member is not believed to have had close contact with any lawmaker over the past several days and came within reach of only a “handful” of fellow agency employees, Bjornson said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A state senator and two of her family members are recovering at home from COVID-19. “Both relatives are out of the hospital,” Sen. Tina Maharath, D-Canal Winchester, told The Columbus Dispatch on Tuesday morning. The 29-year-old workforce analyst tweeted Monday night that she had tested positive and two of her family members were hospitalized. She asked her followers to “wear your masks and stay at home if you’re sick” because her sister-in-law, who had been fighting cancer before she contracted the virus, didn’t survive. “I know she’s rooting for our recovery up in heaven right now,” Maharath tweeted. Maharath, whose parents immigrated to the United States as refugees from Laos, said her surviving family members were lucky to arrive at the hospital when they did. They need help translating what was being said, and a health-care worker just happened to know Lao and Hmong.If not for that man, Maharath said, her family would have been stuck dialing a language hotline and waiting until they found someone who could translate, “which can oftentimes take too long due to the lack of staffing for the southeast Asian languages.” The state senator isn’t the only elected official in Ohio to test positive. State Rep. Stephanie Howse, D-Cleveland, tested positive for COVID-19 in July.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt said he has submitted an application for unemployed Oklahomans to receive an additional $300 in federal unemployment benefits. Once the Federal Emergency Management Agency approves the state’s grant application, the federal government will fund the $300-per-week benefit and Oklahoma will fulfill the 25% state match through existing unemployment benefits, Stitt said. For months, on top of their state benefit, unemployed Americans also collected $600 a week in federal jobless aid, but that expired at the end of July, and negotiations in Congress to extend it collapsed. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order that would provide $300 a week to replace the expired $600. Unemployed Oklahomans have faced numerous challenges in receiving their unemployment benefits, with lines of people often stretching for blocks outside the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. The agency has blamed delays on an outdated computer system, and Interim OESC Director Shelley Zumwalt acknowledged some delays in the new benefit should be expected.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The state’s jobs recovery slowed in July despite the unemployment rate dropping to 10.4% from 11.6% in June. The state gained back 20,500 jobs in the month after adding 57,000 jobs in June, and the state has gained back 38% of the jobs cut in March and April because of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Well, although the past couple months we’ve seen historic monthly job gains, employers have only added back about two of the five jobs that were cut in March and April,” said Anna Johnson, senior economic analyst for the Oregon Employment Department. The largest monthly job gains in July were in the leisure and hospitality sector, which recovered 7,300 jobs; the government added 5,700, retail gained 3,600 and health care added 3,100. Nationally, the unemployment rate declined to 10.2% in July from 11.1% in June.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration is trying to make it clear that masks are to be worn practically at all times by students in school, drawing complaints that school leaders must again change their preparations. The administration this week released additional guidance that Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said Tuesday clarifies the state’s intentions for mask-wearing in schools as they prepare to reopen in the coming days and weeks. Masks must be worn in school, even when students and educators are 6 feet apart, Levine said. “We have had questions about it and we’ve had enough questions that we wanted to clarify,” Levine said at a news conference. “That we mean that when the young people are wearing masks, that they are wearing masks that they are in their classroom even though they’re six feet apart, they should be wearing their masks.” But with some private or career technical schools already open, school officials said it is another frustrating change in guidance. They said they had previously been told that students and educators could remove their masks in the classrooms if they were at least 6 feet apart. The American Academy of Pediatrics said that universal face covering is ideal in schools, but not always possible in the school setting for many reasons. DiRocco said it’s going to be a much more difficult task to ensure that students have a mask on their face throughout the day in a classroom setting, particularly in younger children through third grade.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: There were 75 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Rhode Island on Monday and one additional death, the state Department of Health reported Tuesday. The department also reported 78 people in the hospital with the disease as of Sunday, the latest day for which the information was available, a slight decline from the previous day. Eight patients were in intensive care. The state has now had nearly 20,700 confirmed cases of the disease and 1,024 fatalities. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Rhode Island went from 104.43 per day on Aug. 3 to 91.14 per day on Monday, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate in Rhode Island declined from 2.56% on Aug. 3 to 2.36% on Monday, according to the Johns Hopkins statistics.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville:South Carolina has the nation’s third-highest rate of COVID-19 infections in children, trailing only Arizona and Tennessee, according to a medical report issued this week. The report from the American Academy of Pediatrics stated that 15,295 children in South Carolina have contracted COVID-19 since the pandemic began. That figure accounts for slightly more than 1% of the state’s age 20-and-under population. About 15% of the state’s overall COVID-19 cases are in children. South Carolina is the nation’s 23rd-most populated state but ranks eighth in its number of COVID-19 infections in children. Two children under age 5 have died of COVID-19 in South Carolina, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. One was from Greenville County. More than 75,000 new cases of COVID-19 in children were reported across the nation between July 30 and Aug. 13 – a 24% increase from the previous two-week period, according to the AAP report. Children infected with COVID-19 are less likely to develop serious illnesses than adults who have the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, according to the most recent information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the CDC noted, “hospitalization rates in children are increasing.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: This year’s Sturgis Motorcycle Rally drew more than 460,000 vehicles during the 10-day event, according to a count that South Dakota transportation officials released Tuesday. The count represents a decrease of nearly 8% from last year but showed that many were undeterred by the coronavirus pandemic. Sturgis officials said they expected fewer people to show up this year, estimating they would see between 250,000 and 300,000 people during the 10-day event. Most people didn’t take significant precautions against COVID-19 infections at this year’s rally. A few people wore masks and some said they were avoiding crowds, but many others packed close together at bars and concerts. With people traveling to the rally from all over the country, the mass gathering has raised concerns it could become an epicenter of infections that are hard to track, but spread quickly as rally-goers travel home. The city releases an estimate of rally turnout after the event every year, based mostly on the weight of the trash generated. Last year, the estimate tracked closely with the number of vehicles counted: 499,654 vehicles entered Sturgis, and city officials estimated 490,000 people came to the rally. The city plans to conduct mass COVID-19 testing in an effort to catch outbreaks.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee has signed into law sweeping protections for businesses, schools and nursing homes against coronavirus lawsuits. Lee touted the legislation as “historic” and argued the law would protect businesses from “frivolous lawsuits.” The GOP-dominated Statehouse could not advance the proposal earlier this year when negotiations among lawmakers broke down in the hectic waning hours of legislative work. Lee convened a special legislative session to not only address COVID-19 liability, but also telemedicine and penalties against protesters who violate certain laws. Under Lee’s leadership, Tennessee was one of the first states to begin reopening in late April after the Republican reluctantly issued a safer-at-home order that forced businesses to close. Lee has since maintained he will not shut down the economy and has resisted calls for a statewide mask mandate.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas surpassed 10,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths Monday as the lingering toll of a massive summer outbreak continues, and health experts expressed concerns that recent encouraging trends could be fragile as schools begin reopening for 5 million students across the state. Roughly four in every five of those deaths were reported after June 1. Texas embarked on one of the fastest reopenings in the country in May before an ensuing surge in cases led Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to backtrack and impose a statewide mask order. August has seen an improving outlook, although Texas officials are now concerned that not enough people are seeking tests. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 51 new deaths Monday, along with more than 2,700 new cases, Numbers are typically lower on Monday because reporting lags over weekends. Texas joins New York, New Jersey and California as the other states to surpass 10,000 coronavirus deaths. Florida is also approaching the grim milestone. Abbott is now urging Texans not to grow complacent as the numbers improve and schools and universities reopen.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Utah lawmaker said some teachers in the state haven’t received any personal protective equipment as students start returning to schools. Democratic Sen. Kathleen Riebe, who is also a teacher, said her classroom hasn’t received any of the necessary equipment during an education subcommittee hearing Monday, Fox 13 reported. Riebe, who represents Cottonwood Heights, said teachers in her district were “nervous” about the lack of supplies. “I have not seen any of this equipment in our schools, and I’m receiving many emails and phone calls and social media displays that these things have not made it to our schools,” said Riebe, whose school district will reopen Monday. Sarah Young, the state Board of Education’s director of strategic initiatives, said the necessary PPE is in stock and that teachers in Riebe’s district will receive it this week. Education officials said they have purchased extra face coverings and other equipment, but an order for nearly 200,000 packages of disinfectant wipes likely won’t be delivered to the state until Sept. 15. Each teacher is supposed to receive five packages of the wipes.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: As schools prepare to restart in September, Vermont plans to expand child care capacity, including opening regional hubs to serve school-aged children on remote learning days at their schools, Republican Gov. Phil Scott said. Scott said he would also modify state regulations to allow registered home-based child care centers to serve longer hours on school days, which he believes will add about 3,000 spots. “We know we need more childcare capacity and we need it quickly,” Scott said, noting that child care will be a challenge for many parents as schools move back and forth from in-person and remote learning. The regional child care hubs will be set up in workplaces, as well as school, recreational, municipal and summer camp buildings, Agency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said. The state anticipates needing 73 such hubs that could serve as many as 7,000 school-aged children, he said. The state also will expedite administrative processing and increase flexibility for applicants seeking to become registered child care providers, Smith said. The Scott administration is recommending that $12 million in federal coronavirus relief funding be used on the child care initiative, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers met Tuesday for a special session to address the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and widespread calls for criminal justice reform sparked by the death of George Floyd. Gov. Ralph Northam also announced budget proposals aimed at increasing voter access, including $2 million for prepaid postage for all absentee ballots and budget language that expressly permits local governments to use drop boxes or implement drop-off locations for absentee voters. Before the session, two groups of protesters gathered on the sidewalk outside of the Science Museum of Virginia, where the state Senate was meeting inside. Lawmakers in the House met at Virginia Commonwealth University’s basketball arena, with desks spread far out. Many male lawmakers skipped wearing ties, which Northam – a pediatric neurologist – has said can help spread disease. Most lawmakers wore masks, but not all of them. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported one group of protesters, organized by the Virginia New Majority, gathered outside the museum to lobby for rent relief and to call for an end to evictions, chanting “eviction is violence.”\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap:Under state COVID-19 guidelines, bowling alleys are listed as reopening in Phase 4, two beyond Kitsap’s current Phase 2. There’s increasing worry that Kitsap might not get there until at least 2021, leaving the family that owns Kitsap’s last two bowling alleys – All Star Lanes & Casino in Silverdale and the Hi Joy Bowl in Port Orchard – in limbo. “This is the only time we’ve ever asked, ‘Are we gonna make it,’ “ said Kylie Myers-Hicks, All Star’s operations manager. “It’s scary for sure.” These are bowling’s slow months; business picks up in the winter. Getting through late 2020 and early 2021 could make the difference, she said. The alleys, like other indoor recreation businesses, face a precarious future under the restrictions of the pandemic. Far removed from their midcentury heyday, when even Kitsap had at least a half-dozen bowling alleys, the sport now faces possible obsolescence. Earlier this month, Glacier Lanes in Everett closed its doors after 60 years in business. Hi Joy and All Star, owned by the Myers family since 1970 and 1985, respectively, have been closed since March 16. While restaurants and bars at both have been able to reopen, the lanes – 40 at All Star and 32 at Hi Joy – remain empty. The bowling alley’s management received money from the federal Paycheck Protection Program, but that money will run out by October. At that point, things are uncertain for the employer of more than 200 people. “There’s just a point where the savings runs out and there’s nothing to fall back on,” Myers-Hicks said. Myers-Hicks would like to see rules established for earlier openings of bowling alleys like those her family operates. Already, the business has created a socially distanced environment and ramped up disinfection. There is one bowling alley that remains open, albeit on a limited basis, and it’s just for sailors and their families. The Olympic Bowling Center at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor is open Friday and Saturday nights. Base officials inspect the center before opening, and bowling is restricted to every other lane. Only families can bowl together, according to Jake Chappelle, a Naval Base Kitsap spokesman.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State officials have decided to cancel elk tours this year because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Logan State Park naturalist Lauren Cole, who leads the tours, told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that there would be too many risks involved if the tours were allowed. “The problem is that we have to put 12 guests and two employees in a 15-passenger van to get to the (Tomblin) Wildlife Management Area property where the elk are. There’s no way to social-distance in a van,” she said. Division of Natural Resources officials have allowed up to 24 public tours each year since 2018, and they are usually timed between early September and mid-October to coincide with mating season. The tours quickly became very popular, and Cole said she expects resume leading them fall as long as there’s no concern about the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Interim University of Wisconsin System President Tommy Thompson said he will ask Gov. Tony Evers to include a nearly $100 million boost for the system in the next state budget and give him permission to borrow up to $1 billion as the coronavirus pandemic bleeds revenue from campuses. A UW news release outlining the request makes no mention of the virus. The closest it comes is a sentence with Thompson acknowledging “unprecedented challenges.” Instead, the release lists a number of new initiatives Thompson wants to use the money to launch. Chief among them is the Wisconsin Tuition Promise, a pledge to pay up to four years’ worth of tuition and fees at any regional campus for incoming state resident freshmen and transfer students whose families make $60,000 or less. The initiative is modeled after UW-Madison’s Bucky’s Tuition Promise, which covers tuition for resident freshmen and transfer students at the state’s flagship university. The money also would go toward expanding and enhancing online courses, forgiving teachers’ student loans, providing stipends for student teachers, adding 20 county-based agriculture positions in the Division of Extension at UW-Madison, and expanding student mental health services. Thompson also plans to ask Evers to include permission in the budget to borrow between $500 million and $1 billion in the current fiscal year to cushion pandemic-related losses, according to a budget summary prepared for regents.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The total number of coronavirus cases in Wyoming grew by 45 on Monday, with the number of confirmed cases rising by 40 and the number of probable cases rising by five, the Casper Star-Tribune reported, according to the Wyoming Department of Health’s daily update. Patients have tested positive for coronavirus in all 23 of Wyoming’s counties. Wyoming has the second-lowest recorded number of coronavirus deaths of any state with 33, behind Hawaii, and its death rate of 5 per 100,000 residents is third-lowest behind Hawaii and Alaska, according to the New York Times.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/22/goats-got-milk-winnebago-tribe-new-mexico-quake-news-around-states/117628544/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMaxwell Air Force Base:The 908th Airlift Wing was among the units across the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command that was able to resume Physical Fitness Assessment testing for its members. Over the Unit Training Assembly weekend of July 10-11, more than 100 Reserve Citizen Airmen from the 908th participated in the testing in Montgomery, Ala., which provided wing leadership with important data. Healthy and fit airmen are better equipped to mitigate the stresses of living and working in the austere environments often encountered at deployed locations. However, social distancing protocols limited the options airmen had to participate in physical training. Combined with postponed testing, some airmen experienced a lack in the motivation to stay fit because they couldn’t participate in their preferred activity or sport. Now that restrictions have been lifted and testing has resumed, some airmen have regained the incentive to maintain an exercise regimen and healthier lifestyle.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state-run ferry system is proposing a winter schedule that suggests limited service for some southeast Alaskan communities and improved service for Kodiak Island and some parts of south-central Alaska. State transportation department spokesperson Andy Mills told CoastAlaska the draft schedule reflects the best the state can do given available funding and maintenance needs within the fleet. Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed about $8.5 million for vessel operations, which his budget office said would “align service with historical demand, while providing 18 months of funding to align the system’s budget with the calendar year.” The move to provide funding for operations for 18 months rather than the traditional 12 months was intended in part to provide more stability in scheduling. The draft, which the transportation department is taking public comment on, covers operations between October and April and calls for up to five ships operating at any one time. One of those, however, is a ferry that shuttles between Ketchikan and nearby Metlakatla.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State wildlife officials and conservationists are offering a reward of up to $2,500 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect or suspects in the recent poaching of a desert bighorn sheep at Gillespie Dam southwest of Phoenix. The illegal harvest of the ram occurred the evening of July 10 south of Buckeye, the Arizona Game and Fish Department said. Investigators said a group of five Asian males seen leaving the scene at approximately 8:30 p.m. in a gray sedan and a black sport utility vehicle might have been involved. Anyone with information can call Operation Game Thief hotline at (800) 352-0700 regarding case #21-002114. Tipsters might be eligible for a reward of up to $1,500 for information that leads to an arrest in this case. The Arizona Desert Bighorn Sheep Society is offering an additional reward of $1,000 for information that leads to a conviction.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Public health researchers called the rapid rise in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in Arkansas a “raging forest fire,” and the state’s top health official warned that he expects significant outbreaks in schools. The model by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences’ Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health projected a daily average of 1,039 new cases over the next week. The model also predicted an average increase of 169 new cases a day in children under age 17. Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state also has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated. Dr. Jose Romero, the state’s health secretary, said he was concerned about the possibility of a “surge on top of this surge” when school begins this fall. Laws enacted this year prevent schools from mandating face masks or from requiring students and teachers to be vaccinated. Romero said the key to combatting those outbreaks will be parents stressing the importance of wearing masks.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Six more California counties are urging residents to wear masks in indoor public settings amid concerning upticks in coronavirus cases and continued circulation of the highly contagious delta variant. The latest recommendations from Santa Barbara, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, Santa Cruz and Ventura raise to 17 the number of counties now asking even fully vaccinated individuals to wear face coverings as a precaution while inside places such as grocery stores, movie theaters and retail outlets. So far, only one – Los Angeles County – has gone a step further and mandated that masks be worn in such settings. The city of Pasadena, which has its own independent health department, said it would do likewise later this week. The new round of advisories means that roughly 56% of Californians live in a county that either recommends or requires indoor masking for all individuals, including those vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Marijuana-related arrests have dropped since the first recreational pot shops opened in Colorado seven years ago but Black people are still much more likely to get into legal trouble for cannabis offenses, according to a state report released Monday. The biennial report, commissioned by the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice, found that the marijuana arrest rate for Black people (160 per 100,000 people) is more than double that for white people (76 per 100,000) in Colorado, The Denver Post reported. The report also found that people over 65 are using marijuana at triple the rate that they did in 2014 and that people are consuming cannabis through vapes and edibles at higher rates.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Terrence Cheng, president of the Connecticut State Colleges and Universities system, said the state’s community colleges will forgive $17 million of student debt accumulated during the pandemic. The debt, which students took on during the pandemic or could not repay because of it, will be made up with money from the federal Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, Cheng said. There are no conditions attached, and students are not required to enroll in classes in any future semesters, Cheng said. The decision is expected to impact 18,161 current and former students at the state’s 12 community colleges, officials said. That includes students who lost jobs, suffered food insecurity and even those who were afflicted with COVID-19 said Jane Gates, CSCU’s provost and senior vice president of academic and student affairs.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The Delaware Democratic Party said that anti-Asian slurs and other sexual language used by state Rep. Gerald Brady in an email “will not be tolerated,” but stopped short of demanding that he resign. The outcry came after a June 27 email sent by Brady was shared with The News Journal. The email was intended to be sent to a private citizen Brady knows, said Drew Volturo, a spokesman for the House Democratic Caucus. Instead, Brady replied to a sex workers’ advocate who had emailed him to discuss legislation intended to protect sex workers. “Misogynistic, anti-Asian language has no place in our Party and calls into question the integrity of any leader,” Betsy Maron, chair of the Delaware Democratic Party, said in a written statement. “No apology will rectify the fact that Representative Gerald Brady felt comfortable enough to use such hateful language behind closed doors.” When asked if the party was calling on Brady to step down, Democratic spokeswoman Sarah Fulton said no. “If Gerald Brady doesn’t want to resign, that’s something that he is going to have to deal with when he looks his constituents in the face next fall and tries to justify why they should vote for him,” Fulton said. Brady sent a written apology Monday through a spokesman. He also posted his apology on his Facebook page Tuesday afternoon.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:For the first time in decades, D.C.’s Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will open to the public on April 18, 2022, WUSA-TV reported. According to a news release from the Church of Latter-day Saints, invited guests will be available to take private tours of the renovated temple between April 19-27. The temple will then hold a public open house for two months, except Sundays, starting April 28 and running through June 4.Ticket information for the public open house will be made available at the DC Temple website, here. The Church of Latter-day Saints said the Temple first opened in 1974 and was closed in March 2018 to undergo a significant renovation. According to Dan Holt, the project manager, the renovations added “21st-century flair” to the temple's midcentury motif to make the temple “more maintainable, more modern and really relevant for today.” The last time the temple was open to the public was from Sept. 17 to Oct. 19, in 1974, when more than 750,000 people toured the building.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Officials in Florida’s most populous county are encouraging residents to get vaccinated against the coronavirus as infection rates once again spike in the state. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and other government, public safety and health officials released a statement Tuesday urging people to take the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. Miami-Dade has achieved a vaccination rate of more than 75%, according to the Florida Department of Health. In less than a month, positive tests have increased from 3.6% to 8.6% in Miami-Dade County, officials said. In the last three weeks, the number of COVID-positive inpatients at Miami’s Jackson Health System has increased 178%. More than 95% of the new patients are unvaccinated, and more than 40% are under age 50.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations around the world is starting to reach Georgia, experts said, driven by the infection’s spread among the unvaccinated. Arkansas, Florida, Missouri and Nevada are in full-fledged outbreaks, and neighboring states are following behind, Emory University Professor Carlos del Rio said in a briefing. In the past week, Georgia’s hospitalizations from the disease have increased 30%, he said. The highly contagious delta variant now accounts for about 70% of all new cases, most of which are among those who haven’t been vaccinated, including children too young for the shots. Of the 480 Georgia patients hospitalized with COVID-19 this month, 416 were not fully vaccinated, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: Dozens of Maui residents held a rally for affordable housing as the county’s median home price tops $1 million and the county council considers a new affordable housing plan. Stand Up Maui organized the affordable housing rally, which gathered more than 40 people along Kaahumanu Avenue on Monday, The Maui News reported. “Build affordable housing now,” resident Faith Chase yelled through a bullhorn. Median home prices in Maui County hit $1,117,500 in June – the highest in the state. The figure was up 45% from $773,250 during the same month last year. At the Maui County Council, a committee heard testimony about a new affordable housing plan. Some said the county should require that candidates for affordable housing have at least 20 years of residency. But the Comprehensive Affordable Housing Plan called for two years of residency. The affordable housing plan called for the county to spend $380 million on infrastructure, including roads, water and wastewater projects. Another $789 million would support housing for locals, including subsidies for rentals and mortgages.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin, acting as governor with Gov. Brad Little out of the state, on Tuesday sent what she called a formal inquiry to the director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare concerning private health care businesses requiring their employees get COVID-19 vaccines. McGeachin, who is running for governor, said the Biden administration could be behind the requirement, citing a lengthy proposed rule in the federal register published in May having to do with Medicare that has several references to vaccine coverage among health care workers. As acting governor in May, McGeachin issued an executive order banning mask mandates that Little nullified when he returned. Little is in Colorado meeting with other Republican governors and is scheduled to return Wednesday, spokeswoman Marissa Morrison said. McGeachin has said she wants to find out why three large Idaho health care providers are requiring their employees be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Two state agencies that oversee higher education in Illinois on Monday encouraged colleges and universities to require COVID-19 vaccinations of students heading to campuses this fall. The Illinois Board of Higher Education and the Illinois Community College Board made the recommendation, which they said follows recently released guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state agencies contend the guidance will help facilitate the safe transition back to campus, as more students return to in-person learning. The oversight agencies’ recommendation came on the same day a federal judge ruled Indiana University can require its students and employees to get vaccinated before returning to campus for fall classes. Students who don’t comply will have their registration canceled and workers who don’t will lose their jobs.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University said 60% of incoming students and 66% of school employees have submitted proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 four weeks ahead of an Aug. 13 fall semester deadline. Purdue announced the figures Tuesday in its first release of overall campus vaccination rates. Purdue said it is strongly encouraging all students and employees to get the vaccine if possible. The university expects the numbers of those fully vaccinated will grow before the first day of fall classes Aug. 23, said Eric Barker, dean of the College of Pharmacy and leader of the Protect Purdue Health Monitoring and Surveillance team. Vaccination rates for Purdue students are about twice the rate compared with individuals ages 16-29 across the state, the school said. Individuals not vaccinated who have a high-risk exposure must quarantine for 14 days and will not be allowed to attend classes or report to work, regardless of symptoms, Purdue said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a high-risk exposure as coming within 6 feet of an infected individual for 15 minutes or more where both individuals are not wearing masks.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Waterloo Community Schools will seek federal stimulus dollars to help fund internet access and computers for students whose families can’t afford them. The district is applying for money through the Emergency Connectivity Fund, part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. On Tuesday, the Board of Education approved the purchase of 593 Dell touchscreen Chromebook laptops at a cost of $148,843 during a special meeting. The ECF includes a provision that allows districts to seek funding for laptop computers when they will be used by students who lack devices sufficient to engage in remote learning. As a result, Waterloo Schools will “target our virtual students, who obviously need a suitable device,” said Matt O’Brien, the district’s director of technology. The touchscreen functionality has been identified as being important for the district’s virtual learners, especially those in elementary school. Reimbursement will be sought from the fund for the entire cost.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Families and advocates for the elderly in Kansas argue that with most nursing home residents vaccinated against COVID-19, some facilities’ visiting rules need to be relaxed, though the delta variant’s spread is making operators nervous. A state official who investigates complaints against nursing homes and the elder-care focused Kansas Advocates for Better Care are calling on the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services to crack down on homes that aren’t open enough. They’re concerned that the delta variant will prompt new lockdowns. The aging department said it is working to ensure that residents and families have a voice in visitation policies, though some industry officials still see a need to proceed with caution. The debate showed how operators feel they’re still facing tough choices after nursing homes were COVID-19 hot spots early on during the pandemic. It also shows how residents’ and families’ anguish and anger still linger.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky State University’s president resigned Tuesday amid concerns about the school’s financial health and lawsuits alleging misconduct by campus officials. The school’s Board of Regents accepted M. Christopher Brown II’s resignation at a specially called meeting, news media outlets reported. Brown’s resignation came after four years on the job. The regents named Clara Ross Stamps as the school’s acting president. Stamps has been a senior vice president and spokeswoman at the university. The board also voted to hire auditors to review the school’s financial situation. Stamps declined afterward to provide any information about possible problems or the reason for Brown’s departure, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. Brown’s departure came amid a half-dozen lawsuits pending this year accusing college officials, including Brown, of various acts of misconduct, the newspaper reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State health officials reported 5,388 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday and said it’s the third-highest daily count since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020. Hospitalizations for the disease rose to 844 statewide, up more than 600 since June 19. The numbers were announced as state officials continued to stress the need for vaccination. Figures posted Wednesday showed 1.6 million people, about 36% of the state’s population are fully vaccinated. The seven-day average of new cases reported daily in New Orleans had jumped to 99 by Tuesday, up from 11 two weeks ago. Mayor LaToya Tidwell said vaccinations are the key to stopping the spread, which is fueled by the highly contagious delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19. Restrictions on gatherings and mask requirements had been greatly eased in recent months as vaccines became widely available.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The City Council has decided to continue a pandemic rule to allow outdoor dining and retail in place until at least the fall. Portland is looking to end a local emergency declaration about the pandemic on July 29. That would also end additional powers given to the city manager that can restrict public gatherings. However, street closures that allow businesses to expand outdoor dining and retail options will continue until November, the Portland Press Herald reported. The council voted that a designation allowing restaurants to operate without additional fees will continue until Nov. 1. A statewide emergency declaration about the pandemic ended in June. Maine has had a lower burden of coronavirus cases than many other states, though cases have increased somewhat in recent days.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The leader of the Maryland National Guard is warning that training missions and equipment maintenance are in peril if the state isn’t reimbursed soon for the Guard’s response to the Jan. 6 insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol. Maj. Gen. Timothy E. Gowen, the adjutant general for the Maryland National Guard, warned in a letter Tuesday to members of Congress that the Guard is so short on money that he might have to resort to deep budget cuts in the coming weeks. Maryland Guard members were among the first to arrive in Washington on Jan. 6 when the Capitol building was disrupted during the certification of the 2020 election results. After a delay in getting the sign-off from federal officials, the state sent 500 Guard members, a number that swelled to about 1,000 over the next few weeks. The deployment to Washington came in the midst of an unprecedented and busy time for the Guard, whose members helped run coronavirus testing sites and food distribution programs and were preparing to staff mass vaccination clinics at the time of the attack on the Capitol.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: City health officials urged recent visitors to Provincetown to self-isolate and get tested for the coronavirus after a cluster of cases was linked to the popular Cape Cod tourist town. At least 35 cases of COVID-19 in Boston have been traced to Provincetown, with the vast majority of cases involving people who were fully vaccinated, according to the Boston Public Health Commission. Anyone who has traveled to Provincetown since July 1 is being asked to get tested at least five days after returning. The travel guidance also asks recent visitors to self-isolate and avoid gatherings for at least five days and until they receive a negative coronavirus test. Provincetown officials issued a new mask advisory on Monday after more than 100 people tested positive following the Fourth of July holiday. The advisory encourages mask-wearing for all residents and visitors of the town, which is a popular LGBTQ+ summer destination.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Marais: A wildfire burned about 6 acres of Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore and adjacent state forest in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, authorities said. A U.S. Coast Guard vessel reported the fire about 3 p.m. Monday near the Twelvemile Beach campground at Pictured Rocks, they said. Park rangers said large amounts of smoke might linger for the next few days in the area and along Highway 58 near the Kingston Lake campground. The investigation into how the fire started is continuing. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Burt Township firefighters and Pictured Rocks park rangers extinguished the fire.“Thank you to all our agency partners who reported and helped us keep this fire under control,” Chief Ranger Joseph Hughes said in a statement. “I would like to remind all park visitors to recreate safely. Drivers and visitors should slow down and use caution in the area.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Minnesota’s most populous county is boosting its incentive program for COVID-19 vaccine shots. The Hennepin County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved an additional $250,000 to promote vaccine shots, on top of the original $100,000 that was allocated earlier from federal recovery funds. Commissioner Chris LaTondresse said the program has increased the number of shots and Tuesday’s action “doubles down on this promising strategy” to help fight the coronavirus. The county used the original investment to buy 2,235 Visa gift cards worth $50 each. As of Monday. about 775 of those cards had been distributed, mainly at county public health events. The incentive program includes partnerships with community groups to host vaccine events and provide perks such as free meals, groceries, and entertainment.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: With a national moratorium on evictions scheduled to end at the end of this month, millions of dollars in federal rental and utility assistance is still available for low-income tenants in Mississippi. The funds, provided by Congress, are disbursed through the Mississippi Home Corporation. Eligible for the benefits are Mississippians making 80% or less of the median area income whose ability to pay rent or utilities was disrupted by the pandemic. For example, in Hinds County, a three-person household making $52,300 or less a year is eligible for assistance. There is more than $180 million available to state residents, and Home Corporation Executive Director Scott Spivey said he hopes more people apply for the assistance.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The St. Louis area is facing a third wave of COVID-19 that could cause more deaths and serious cases if residents don’t get vaccinated and return to wearing masks in public, the head of the region’s pandemic task force said. Dr. Clay Dunagan, BJC HealthCare’s chief clinical officer, said seven COVID-19 patients have died in the St. Louis region and 91 were admitted to intensive care units during the 24 hours before he issued his plea Tuesday morning. He said if residents don’t respond, the area could return to high hospitalization rates, prompting renewed visitor restrictions and delayed elective procedures. He said even people who have been vaccinated should wear masks in public, in part because only 46.3% of Missourians had been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, which significantly trailed the national average. Also Tuesday, officials from St. Louis County and St. Louis issued a joint statement echoing Dunagan’s remarks. They said they are watching trends and paying attention to mask mandates initiated by other jurisdictions.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Environmental groups pressed a state judge to order a new review of a Montana copper mine over worries that mining waste will pollute a river that’s popular among boaters. Attorneys for Trout Unlimited and other groups argued that state officials did not adequately review the risk of toxic waste spills from the Black Butte copper mine north of White Sulphur Springs. Work began last year on the mine along Sheep Creek, a tributary of the Smith River. Montana Department of Environmental Quality attorney Sarah Clerget rejected worries the mine would pollute the Smith during Friday’s hearing before state District Judge Katherine Bidegary in Meagher County. Clerget said the mine won’t leak or fail, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The underground mine proposed by Vancouver-based Sandfire Resources is on private land and would extract 15.3 million tons of copper-laden rock and waste over 15 years – roughly 440 tons a day. The 110-mile Smith River runs through a limestone canyon and a scenic valley before flowing into the Missouri River south of Great Falls. The waterway is so popular the state holds an annual lottery for permits to float down it.\n\nNebraska\n\nWinnebago: A mask mandate has been reinstated on the Winnebago Reservation to limit the spread of COVID-19. The Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska said in a post on its Facebook page that masks are required for all indoors in public buildings and places of business within the exterior boundaries of the reservation. During a meeting Monday, the Winnebago Tribal Council voted 6-1 to reinstate the mask mandate. According to a report from Twelve Clans Unity Hospital, as of Monday, there were 12 active cases of the virus on the reservation and six households in quarantine. On June 25, the Winnebago Public Health Department reported that 70% of community members ages 12 and up had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Tribal officials touted the vaccination rate as the highest in the state.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: U.S. Rep. Mark Amodei said he hasn’t decided whether to run for reelection or mount a bid for Nevada governor, but appears unimpressed by the Republican primary field vying to challenge first-term Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak. “Certainly no one has sucked the air out of the room, in a Republican primary sense, which Steve Sisolak must be happy about. Nevada Republicans need a strong gubernatorial candidate in 2022,” he said. Amodei, a Carson City Republican, said he didn’t feel rushed to make a decision with the primary election 11 months away. If he enters the race, Amodei will join Sheriff Joe Lombardo, former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee and Reno attorney Joey Gilbert in the Republican primary field. Former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller has told Republican groups that he’s also mulling a run. Amodei has served in Congress since 2011 and previously represented Carson City in the Nevada statehouse. He continues to raise campaign contributions toward another congressional run.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Conway: Surveyors with the New Hampshire Division of Forests and Lands have found widespread defoliation attributed to a population boom of moth caterpillars. Kyle Lombard, the coordinator of the division’s forest health program, said that the department has surveyed 20% of the state and found 30,000 acres of defoliation. The affected trees are primarily clumps of red and black oaks, WCVB-TV reported. According to the department, the last time the state experienced more than 10,000 to 15,000 acres of defoliation was in 1992. Lombard said that areas with a lot of oaks will look weird; however, the defoliation should not affect the foliage season. The trees that largely produce the bright oranges, reds and yellows are primarily maples, aspens and ash, which are not affected by the moth larvae. Lombard said that the real concern is that if the moth population continues to expand, it will increase the amount of dry brush across a larger area, increasing the risk of fires.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A state appeals court ruled Gov. Phil Murphy didn’t overstep his authority when he issued an executive order last year allowing tenants to use their security deposits to pay rent. The ruling rejected arguments by several businesses and individual landlords who argued Murphy wasn’t authorized to issue the order in April 2020 and that their due process rights were violated. In a tweet, Acting State Attorney General Andrew Bruck praised the ruling and said Murphy’s executive order “supported renters and helped keep them in their homes.” The attorney general’s office argued the case on behalf of Murphy, a Democrat; former attorney general Gurbir Grewal and state health commissioner Judy Persichilli, who also were named as defendants. Under Murphy’s order, landlords were still entitled to reimbursement for expenses that would have been covered by a security deposit, and tenants were obligated to replenish the deposit in full if they renewed the lease.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMalaga: The U.S. Geological Survey recorded an earthquake near the Eddy and Lea County line Monday morning, nearly 23 miles east-southeast of Malaga. Susan Torres, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department , said the earthquake was reported about 5:30 a.m. The USGS considered the earthquake light. The Carlsbad Brine Well remediation project, located south of Carlsbad where U.S. highways 285 and 62/180 converge to form the South Y, detected the activity. The readings indicated the Brine Well pressure was stable. Eddy County Fire and Rescue Chief Joshua Mack said volunteer fire departments did not respond to any emergency calls in the area. Carlsbad Fire Chief Richard Lopez said no damage or injuries were reported in the city limits. The USGS has reported six other earthquakes near the Texas-New Mexico state line nearly 60 miles south of Carlsbad since July 13. The magnitude of those earthquakes was less than 4.0.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Workers in city-run hospitals and health clinics will have to get vaccinated or get tested weekly under a policy announced Wednesday to fight a rise in COVID-19 cases fueled by the highly contagious delta variant. Publicly employed nurses, doctors, social workers, custodians, registrars and colleagues will be covered under the order from city Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi, and Mayor Bill de Blasio didn’t rule out applying the same requirement to teachers, police officers and other city employees. The number of vaccine doses being given out daily in the city has dropped to less than 18,000, down from a peak of more than 100,000 in early April. About 65% of all adults are fully vaccinated. But the rate among public hospital system workers is lower: about 60%, according to Dr. Mitchell Katz, who runs it. Meanwhile, caseloads have been rising in the city for weeks, and health officials said the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Children would need parental permission before they could receive COVID-19 vaccines approved by federal regulators for emergency use in legislation that advanced through a state Senate committee Wednesday. The parent or guardian requirement is contained in a bill approved by the Senate Health Care Committee that also would expand the types of medications immunizing pharmacists can administer. The permission is designed to address concerns by some parents and legislators that young people could get a new COVID-19 immunization on their own while it is still authorized for emergency use, said Sen. Jim Burgin, a Harnett County Republican. Only the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is available to children from 12 to 17. North Carolina law allows these children to make the decision on their own, “if they show the decisional capacity to do so,” according to the state Department of Health Human Services.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Oil production is flat in North Dakota because of a workforce shortage as the industry recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. Companies said they are in need of workers to inject water, sand and chemicals down wells to crack open rock and release oil, a process known as hydraulic fracking. State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said eight crews are working in North Dakota, down from at least 20 which would typically be working in the state at today’s oil prices. “Most of these folks went to Texas where activity was still significantly higher than it was here, where they didn’t have winter and where there were jobs in their industry,” Helms told the Bismarck Tribune. “It’s going to take higher pay and housing incentives and that sort of thing to get them here.” North Dakota’s oil production rose 4,000 barrels per day in May, a negligible increase. The state produced about 1 million barrels of oil per day in May, the latest month for which data is available. The fracking side of the industry is also experimenting with new techniques to reduce costs. One company is using saltwater to replace some of the freshwater used in the fracking process. The fluid is being transported several miles through a flat line hose tucked inside another hose to prevent leaks until it reaches a fracking site, Helms said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An Ohio anti-abortion group is protesting a local Catholic university’s involvement in playing host to President Joe Biden in a CNN town hall Wednesday night. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that Right to Life of Greater Cincinnati urged members of the public Tuesday to call Mount St. Joseph University and Cincinnati Archbishop Dennis Schnurr to object to the school’s decision. The group, which opposes abortion, said the suburban Cincinnati university is playing host to the “most pro-abortion president in U.S. history.” Biden, the nation’s second Catholic president, has said he supports abortion rights for others while personally opposing the procedure. He and other Catholic politicians who take Communion while supporting abortion rights were the subject of a rebuke by U.S. bishops last month. The university defended its involvement in the event, saying in a statement that Mount St. Joseph “has always been and will continue to be a diverse and inclusive place where people from different races, ethnicities, social backgrounds, beliefs, and religions can come together to discuss and share their unique perspectives.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A coalition of state health officials pleaded with Oklahomans to be vaccinated against the coronavirus as the number of cases and hospitalizations rise in the state. Aaron Wendelboe, an epidemiologist at the University of Oklahoma College of Public Health, said hospitalizations have nearly tripled since June. The state health department reported a seven-day average of 733 new cases daily, double the average of 364 from a week ago. “On average, each infected person with COVID is transmitting it to 2.9 other people,” compared to each infected person who transmitted the illness to two people in June, Wendelboe said. The health department reported a three-day average of 409 people hospitalized with COVID, almost four times the average of 116 in late June, topping 400 for the first time since early June. Assistant Deputy Health Commissioner Buffy Heater said 90% of those hospitalized are unvaccinated, “which further indicates to us that vaccines are safe and continue to be effective against all strains or all variants of COVID.” Oklahoma ranks ninth in the nation with 209.2 new virus cases per 100,000 residents, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is being forced to make immediate and extensive changes to the way it operates the 13 dams in the Willamette Valley, including Detroit Dam, to give native species of fish a chance to survive. Under an order from U.S. District Court Judge Marco Hernandez issued July 16, the Corps will be forced to take actions such as improving fish passage and water quality, deep drawdowns of water to allow juvenile fish to pass downstream, spilling water at different times of year, and releasing adult fish above the dams. Hernandez's order laid out broad actions; a later final judgment will contain specifics. According to a statement from the Corps, it is reviewing Hernandez’s opinion to determine the next steps it will take to comply with it.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Local Catholics attending Mass last Sunday sounded happy that Philadelphia Archbishop Nelson Pérez has reinstated the religious obligation to attend Mass in person starting next month, ending a 16-month dispensation during the coronavirus pandemic. “I think he should have done it a long time ago,” said Nathan Hook, just before he and his fiancée, Jessica Rosario, walked into St. Agatha-St. James Church in West Philadelphia. “The dispensation makes people think church isn’t that important. But you need to be in person to receive the sacraments.” The in-person attendance directive, effective Aug. 15, has exceptions. Just as before the pandemic, the church recognizes that people might not be able to gather in person because of illness, caregiving responsibilities, or health risks. Pérez’s statement said lingering pandemic anxiety about crowds is also a valid reason to stay home and, if possible, join online.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s courts are preparing to resume regular operations this fall. State Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Suttell issued an executive order that will lift most coronavirus restrictions by Sept. 7. The Boston Globe reported the new order will allow the public to return to all judicial buildings, with some restrictions. Fully vaccinated people will not be required to wear a mask, unless judges mandate it in their courtrooms. The public will be able to file court documents in-person by Sept. 7. Coronavirus cleaning protocols and plexiglass safety barriers installed in courtrooms will remain at least until the end of the year. During the early days of the pandemic, Suttell ordered courts shuttered for all but emergency matters. Like other court systems, most judicial proceedings were held remotely. The court system has been easing back into in-person operations with grand juries and bench trials resuming last summer. Jury trials resumed late last year as some courtrooms were outfitted with plexiglass.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Three Republican U.S. House members have lost appeals challenging fines for not wearing face coverings on the House floor earlier this year. On Tuesday, the U.S. House Ethics Committee released statements noting that U.S. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ralph Norman of South Carolina had failed in their appeals of $500 fines issued in May. The Republicans challenged the fines in June, arguing that the mandate was out of sync with recent federal guidance on face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vote in question happened a week after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance noting that “fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing.” At the time, face coverings were still required on the floor, a mandate put in place by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in June 2020. Even after the updated CDC guidance in May, Dr. Brian Monahan, Congress’ attending physician, wrote that “mask requirement and other guidelines remain unchanged until all Members and floor staff are fully vaccinated.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A fraternity of the far-right group Proud Boys has withdrawn its sponsorship of a street dance in the town of Scotland in September. David Finnell applied on behalf of the group to have the street dance from noon until midnight Sept. 18 in the Bon Homme County community of about 700 people. The City Council approved the request to close a section of the city street as required for alcohol consumption and food vendors. Finnell, in a Facebook message to KELO-TV, said the Proud Boys were dropping sponsorship of the event out of concerns for safety. He did not elaborate. Scotland’s city attorney, Kent Lehr, said although the Proud Boys have gained some negative national attention, there have not been any problems locally. It’s his understanding that several local or area residents are associated with the Proud Boys, Lehr said. “I’m not saying the city is condoning or agreeing with what the group says,” Lehr said. The council had to evaluate the street dance request from the Proud Boys as it evaluates any other request, he said. “It has to consider the benefit to the community, any potential disruption (to closing street and caused by the event), the benefit to businesses on Main Street,” Lehr said. Finnell said the Proud Boys planned to raise money for local nonprofits before deciding on Monday to withdraw from the event.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials said they have finished deconstructing emergency COVID-19 care sites in Nashville and Memphis. According to a news release, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said this week that the sites finished serving their purpose of providing additional hospital capacity for COVID-19 patients. “Tennessee’s alternate care sites provided our health care system with a margin of safety, and thankfully we did not need to open either site,” Gov. Bill Lee said in a statement. The Memphis site, which was the former home of The Commercial Appeal, was renovated to provide more than 400 beds. The Nashville site opened in late May and provided 67 beds. “The Memphis and Nashville sites are models of what the public and private sector can accomplish working together,” TEMA Director Patrick Sheehan said in a statement. All medical equipment and supplies from both sites have been returned to TEMA’s warehouse.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Emergency officials have lifted a shelter-in-place order that was issued Wednesday morning for parts of a Houston-area city after a chemical release at a plant. The order had been issued for parts of La Porte, a city about 25 miles southeast of Houston. La Porte Emergency Management said earlier that residents in the affected area should stay indoors, turn their air conditioning off and close windows. Dow Chemical, which operates a plant in the area, said in a public alert message that a “release event” from a tank truck had occurred but did not specify what chemicals were involved. Harris County Pollution Control said in a statement that a tank wagon overpressurized, which caused a release of the chemical hydroxyethyl acrylate. The chemical can cause irritation of the nose and throat, the statement said. An evacuation order remained in place for people within a half-mile of the plant, which is located in an industrial area.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: The Utah County sheriff is offering an active-shooter training class for teachers and it has filled up long before its start date. Trainers at the Teachers Academy include police, self-defense trainers and medical professionals for the 20-hour course informed by lessons learned in other active shooter incidents, the Daily Herald reported. Topics covered during the Teacher Academy training will include tactical emergency medical techniques, weapons familiarization, Utah concealed carry certification, tactical de-escalation, self-defense and live range-shooting. This is the third Teachers Academy class held since 2019. It’s designed for teachers, administrators, and school support staff. Participants for the session beginning Aug. 3 are limited to 30 people, and spots have already filled up and a wait list has started.\n\nVermont\n\nHyde Park: Grappling with a changed industry, two brothers operating their family’s dairy farm have made the drastic decision to give up hundreds of cows for goats. The Jones family, which had raised cows for 150 years at Joneslan Farm, houses about 1,000 goats in their barn that remains adorned with painted cutouts of dairy cattle. Fluctuating milk prices paid to dairy cow farmers and rising costs have driven some small family farms to go big or out of business – or get creative like brothers Brian and Steven. The Jones brothers finished constructing their nanny-milking parlor and delivered their first goat milk earlier this year to Land O’ Lakes-owned Vermont Creamery, to be used for cheese-making. They plan to milk 1,200 to 1,500 dairy goats within two years. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the number of dairy cow farms fell by more than half between 2003 and 2020 while the number of cows nationwide grew as farms consolidated. At the same time, the dairy goat industry in the U.S. has grown significantly in the last 20 years, with the number of dairy goats rising from more than 190,000 in 1997 to 440,000 last year.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration issued new guidance Wednesday on COVID-19 prevention measures for the upcoming school year, urging but not requiring continued masking in many circumstances. With a statewide public health order that had mandated masking in schools coming to an end Sunday, school divisions will have the ability to implement local policies “based on community level conditions and public health recommendations,” the Democratic administration said in a news release. The departments of health and education released a 14-page document with advice about reducing the spread of the coronavirus, addressing issues like ventilation and physical distancing, in addition to masking. The recommendations urge school divisions for now to adopt a universal masking policy for students and adults in elementary schools, regardless of vaccination status, because no vaccine has been approved yet for children under 12. For middle and high schools, the state guidance said that “at a minimum” teachers, students and staff who aren’t fully vaccinated should wear masks indoors. The guidance provides flexibility for school divisions while ensuring a safe and healthy environment, Northam said in a statement, which also encouraged Virginians to get vaccinated if they have not already.\n\nWashington\n\nKelso: Authorities are searching for an Army lieutenant reported missing near Mount St. Helens in southwest Washington. The Cowlitz County Sheriff’s Office said crews are searching for a missing hiker, identified as 1st Lt. Brian Yang in the Coldwater area of Mount St. Helens. KOIN reported Yang, 25, was last seen at the Coldwater Trail Head about noon Sunday. According to its Twitter account, the Army’s I Corps is aware of Yang’s absence and is also involved in the effort.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Dozens of labor and advocacy groups called on President Joe Biden to save nearly 1,500 jobs at a pharmaceutical plant in West Virginia scheduled to close at the end of July. Drugmaker Viatris Inc. announced in December it will lay off workers at the Morgantown plant, formerly operated by the generic drug company Mylan. Upjohn and Mylan’s merged last year to form the new company, which announced it would slash 20% of its workforce worldwide. Viatris is now one of the world’s dominant manufacturers in the generics industry, which has been consolidating for years. The moves left workers scrambling to find new jobs as the major employer left West Virginia, which is often trying to lure new companies to uplift the state’s stagnant economy. A new campaign led by Our Revolution, a political nonprofit organization founded by Bernie Sanders, urged Biden to use the Defense Production Act to halt Pittsburgh-based Viatris from closing the plant. It also asks Biden to convene a task force of labor groups, local leaders and others to determine how the plant might continue producing pharmaceutical or medical goods.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is again asking ruffed grouse hunters to submit samples during the final year of a four-year, multistate ruffed grouse West Nile virus study. The DNR and conservation partners will distribute testing kits to hunters to get more samples as biologists try to determine how many grouse are getting West Nile and what impacts the disease is having on the grouse population. Anyone else who finds a sick or entact dead grouse can also submit samples. Hunters who have a kit from a previous year are encouraged to collect a sample, fill the kit and send it in to be processed; nothing in the kit expires. Kits will be available in early September. The DNR might limit the number of kits per individual to ensure samples come from a large geographic area. The DNR will provide test results via email. Sample testing will not begin until after the grouse season has closed and final results will not be available for several months after that. Mosquitoes spread West Nile virus and its effects on birds can vary. Signs range from no clinical disease or illness to heart lesions and inflammation of the brain’s lining and spinal cord. There is no evidence that West Nile can be spread by handling dead birds or consuming properly cooked game.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon is allowing truck drivers to work longer hours while they deliver fuel that might be needed for firefighting aircraft. So far this summer, Wyoming hasn’t had significant fuel shortages or major wildfires. Gordon’s office described Tuesday’s executive order as a preemptive measure because of high fuel demand amid record tourism and firefighting efforts elsewhere. “Part of the reason he signed the executive order was really to make sure that it wasn’t a transportation hiccup that was preventing fuel from making it to its destination,” Gordon spokesman Michael Pearlman told the Casper Star-Tribune. Other Western governors, including South Dakota’s Kristi Noem, have signed similar orders. Government rules usually limit truck drivers’ road hours to prevent fatigue-related accidents. The Wyoming order still prohibits truck drivers from driving when tired.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/12/03/conspiracy-theories-overtime-abuse-digital-divide-news-around-states/115092162/", "title": "Conspiracy theories, overtime abuse: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Hospitals that already are treating a record number of COVID-19 patients are bracing for a “tidal wave” of additional cases linked to holiday gatherings, a health official said Tuesday. Despite the fact that less testing is being performed now than earlier in the outbreak, the state has still recorded at least 2,000 new cases daily since Nov. 15. Hospitals are treating more patients than ever, and an expected post-Thanksgiving surge of cases has yet to begin, said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Only 11% of the state’s intensive care beds were available Monday, according to the Alabama Hospital Association, and the remaining spaces could be filled as more patients are admitted than leave hospitals. While experts have tried to avoid “alarmist terminology” during the crisis, Marrazzo said, “I think this is a time when we need to start thinking about things like tidal wave imagery or tsunami imagery.”\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Some borough attorneys have refuted a claim by the state’s top lawyer that boroughs can enact mask mandates in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Attorneys representing second-class boroughs in the state sent a letter to Alaska Acting Attorney General Ed Sniffen, The Peninsula Clarion reports. Sniffen last month said municipalities, including the state’s second-class boroughs, can mandate face masks using their disaster powers. Alaska has 18 organized boroughs and one unorganized borough covering more than half the state, the Alaska Municipal League’s website said. Second-class boroughs must receive voter approval to exercise many powers, while first-class boroughs can exercise any power not prohibited by law by adopting ordinances. The letter was signed by attorneys for the Aleutians East, Bristol Bay, Fairbanks North Star, Kenai Peninsula, Ketchikan Gateway, Kodiak Island and Matanuska-Susitna boroughs.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: COVID-19-related hospitalizations continue to climb as the state on Wednesday reported more than 3,800 additional known cases, well short of a record set Tuesday due to holiday weekend reporting delays. COVID-19 hospitalizations reached 2,699 as of Tuesday, up more than 100 from Monday, and included 642 patients in intensive care unit beds. Health experts have said holiday travel and gatherings are expected to produce additional new cases and related hospitalizations over the next few weeks. According to the state Department of Health Service’s coronavirus dashboard, 10% of all hospital acute-care beds and 10% of ICU beds remained available. The Tucson City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to establish a mandatory nightly curfew, from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., for three weeks beginning Friday in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of people hospitalized due to COVID-19 reached another record Tuesday as the state unveiled a new effort to coordinate its virus cases among its hospitals. The Department of Health said the state’s hospitalizations due to the illness caused by the coronavirus rose by 11 to 1,074. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the state would begin using its Trauma Communications Center to coordinate transfers of COVID-19 patients between hospitals. The plan was recommended by a task force Hutchinson formed to address a surge in virus cases and hospitalizations. “We’re really trying to maximize the use of those scarce resources, ICU beds in particular, and look at the whole state and take care of all of our patients in Arkansas,” said Baptist Health President and CEO Troy Wells, who is also a member of the task force. The new system will cost about $70,000 a month and should be up and running in about two weeks, Hutchinson said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A staggering rise in coronavirus cases could overwhelm the state’s health system within weeks, and “drastic” action such as a widespread stay-at-home order may be needed to combat the threat, Gov. Gavin Newsom warned. Hospitalizations from COVID-19 have increased nearly 90% and could triple by Christmas, officials said Monday. “The red flags are flying in terms of the trajectory in our projections of growth,” Newsom said. The number of COVID-19 cases reported each day in California has been setting records, with the average daily case rate over the past week topping 14,000. The levels are far above those recorded during a summer peak or even in March, when a state public health order restricted people from going outside except for the most essential reasons. That order was later eased. About 12% of Californians testing positive for the virus are likely to need hospital care within the next two to three weeks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: In an effort to keep residents fed and employed this winter, the Legislature concluded a special session Wednesday by passing bills offering assistance to restaurants and food pantries struggling to keep their doors open during the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Sen. Tammy Story, sponsor of a bill to add $5 million for the state’s Food Pantry Assistance Grant Program, stressed that 1 out of 3 Colorado residents doesn’t have enough food because of the pandemic’s economic fallout. Restaurants serving financially stable Colorado residents could receive relief from a tax break allowing the restaurants to keep monthly sales tax receipts rather than paying it to the state. Diners pay 2.9% state sales tax on restaurant bills. Lawmakers also passed a $37 million “direct relief” bill for food retail establishments and other small businesses subject to severe capacity limits under public health orders.\n\nConnecticut\n\nManchester: Laptop computers have been provided for every student identified by their district as in need, state officials said Wednesday, touting progress in closing the digital divide as a silver lining of the pandemic. In an appearance at Manchester High School, Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said the devices and internet connections provided with help from nonprofits, federal aid and donors are invaluable for households to keep up with education through the pandemic and offer other opportunities, such as virtual medical appointments. “This is about education, but it’s about so much more,” Lamont said. As school districts switched to distance learning in March, the nonprofit Partnership for Connecticut spent $24 million to provide 60,000 laptops to high school students. And the state used $43.5 million from its portion of federal coronavirus relief funds to buy 82,000 laptops and 44,000 home internet connections for students, the governor’s office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Schools are “safe places” and should continue with a mix of in-person and virtual instruction despite a statewide spike in coronavirus cases, Gov. John Carney said Tuesday. During his weekly COVID-19 briefing, Carney said the number of new cases was “off the charts” compared with numbers in late summer. He noted hospitalizations as of Monday have more than doubled since the start of November. But the Democratic governor’s administration has taken issue with decisions by some school districts in central Delaware to move to remote learning, rather than a hybrid approach of online and in-person classes. The districts’ decisions were based on trends in the number of new COVID-19 cases, average daily hospitalizations and the percentage of positive tests in Kent County. But “schools are safe environments. Children are wearing masks, and they’re social distancing,” Carney said. “We’re not seeing a lot of spread within schools themselves.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. already has the ultra-cold storage capacity it needs to house coronavirus vaccines when they become available, WUSA-TV reports, but will likely only get a fraction of the doses it needs to inoculate front-line health care workers at first, the city’s top health official said Monday. Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, joined Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday at her weekly coronavirus briefing to talk about the city’s efforts to prepare for distribution of an eventual COVID-19 vaccine. Nesbitt said unlike other jurisdictions – Maryland, for example, which purchased five ultra-cold freezers to store the Pfizer vaccine – D.C. was advised to look for existing capacity within the city. DC Health was able to identify acute care providers and pharmacies in the district that already have ultra-cold storage in place. Nesbitt said the city did decide to purchase one additional freezer for itself.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Sunshine State joined Texas and California in surpassing 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases Tuesday as the governor vowed not to adopt any further restrictions or impose closures like those enacted in the spring and summer. Hospitalizations have also climbed in the state with 4,261 COVID-19 patients, up from 4,139 tallied Monday. The figure is still less than half what hospitals saw in late July, but it has steadily climbed since October after plateauing at about 2,000 hospitalizations daily for weeks following the summer surge of the virus. The state’s health department on Tuesday reported 82 new virus deaths, raising the toll in the third-most populous state to at least 18,942 since the beginning of the pandemic. While vaccines could arrive as early as this month, officials say it will be spring at the earliest before most people can receive the shots.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Students who took online classes at the University of Georgia and the Georgia Institute of Technology because of the pandemic are now seeking a return of some tuition and fees. The students filed two class-action lawsuits this week, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. They say they didn’t get the full educational experience they anticipated when they paid their tuition and fees. A representative of the University System of Georgia said the institution does not discuss pending litigation and declined comment. The system oversees operations at the two schools and Georgia’s other public colleges and universities and is a defendant in the lawsuits. The lawsuits are similar to others that have been filed against colleges and universities across the nation.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard said her department takes responsibility for the actions of officers on its now-suspended coronavirus enforcement units who are accused of abusing the department’s overtime policy. Ballard confirmed Monday in a statement on social media that multiple investigations are being conducted about the officers accused of submitting as many as 300 overtime hours in one week. Ballard also criticized state lawmakers for not amending a state law that makes violations of coronavirus-related health orders a misdemeanor. The police department “believes that a fine would have accomplished the desired change in public behavior without flooding the courts,” Ballard wrote. Less than 1 in 50 citations issued on Oahu for violating public health orders related to the pandemic resulted in convictions, Hawaii News Now reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Three gas retailers have reached a settlement agreement with state Attorney General Lawrence Wasden after his office launched an investigation into their fuel prices. The retailers – Maverik, Jacksons Food Stores and Stinker Stores – don’t admit any wrongdoing under the agreement and say they disagree with the premise of the attorney general’s investigation. Still, they said they agreed to the settlement because it will help consumers facing economic difficulties during the pandemic. Wasden began investigating the fuel prices after state and federal officials declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year. Those emergency declarations triggered a state law that forbids companies from selling food, water, fuel or pharmaceuticals at excessive prices while the declarations are in effect. Under the settlement agreement, the three companies will provide a combined $1.5 million in sales credits during 2021 by selling fuel at a lower margin than the average margin earned by fuel retailers in neighboring states.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state on Wednesday reported a record 238 fatalities related to the coronavirus pandemic, a total that is nearly one-quarter higher than the previous record set during the spring onslaught of the illness. The deaths were accompanied by 9,757 new cases of COVID-19, the malady caused by coronavirus infection. Overall, in nine months of the pandemic, Illinois has recorded 12,639 deaths among 748,603 infections. The seven-day rolling test positivity average, which had hit a high of 13.2% on Nov. 13, had leveled off at just above 10% for several days but increased to 10.6% Wednesday. There was a glimmer of good news for hospitals, which are bracing for another sharp increase in illness following the Thanksgiving holiday. Hospitalizations dipped slightly to 5,764, as did the number of occupied intensive care units (1,190) and those on ventilators (714).\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of COVID-19 deaths in Indiana nearly doubled in November, and the state on Tuesday reported that coronavirus-related hospitalizations remain at their highest point during the pandemic. Gov. Eric Holcomb on Tuesday also signed an extension of the state’s public health emergency through Dec. 31, a step under which he has issued the statewide mask order and limits on crowd sizes. The Indiana State Department of Health added 142 deaths to the statewide toll with Tuesday’s daily update. Most of those deaths occurred over the past week with a reporting lull from local officials over the Thanksgiving weekend. Those boost Indiana’s coronavirus deaths during November to at least 1,416 people – surpassing the previous monthly peak during April by nearly 400 and almost double October’s total of 732 deaths. The state’s seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 deaths has reached 58 per day after that average was below 10 a day during July, when the state recorded 286 coronavirus fatalities.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state posted 22 additional deaths from the coronavirus Wednesday, the third consecutive day of more than 20 deaths and raising the state’s death toll to 2,449. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in Iowa has risen over the past two weeks from nearly 22 deaths per day Nov. 17 to 29 deaths per day Tuesday. The state’s death count is the nation’s 21st highest per capita at 77.6 deaths per 100,000 people, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. More than 2,900 additional confirmed coronavirus cases were identified in the past day, and hospitalizations remained high with 1,162 people in Iowa hospitals with COVID-19. The state health department reported 181 patients were admitted in the previous 24 hours, an increase from recent days. State data indicated virus outbreaks in 163 nursing homes, continuing an upward trend\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state on Wednesday reported the sharpest increase of deaths over a two-day period since the COVID-19 pandemic began, with a rise of 119 fatalities linked to the coronavirus. It appears that most of the deaths did not occur in the past several days, and it’s possible the dramatic increase is due to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment squaring death records from weeks prior. The rise in deaths most heavily affected older Kansans, with roughly two-thirds of the deaths coming among residents age 75 and older. Statewide, 4,615 new cases of COVID-19 were reported by KDHE since Monday, as well as 185 new hospitalizations in that same time frame. The state also reported multiple new COVID-19 outbreaks, with most of the clusters remaining concentrated in long-term care facilities and prisons and jails; 71 cases were linked to the Kansas Department of Corrections’ central office in downtown Topeka.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state reported record-high numbers of new coronavirus cases and deaths Tuesday as the governor warned that the COVID-19 outbreak is “spreading like wildfire.” Gov. Andy Beshear announced 4,151 more virus cases statewide and 35 additional virus-related deaths. He called it “the very worst day” since he started reporting daily virus numbers in March. Nearly 1,780 virus patients are hospitalized in Kentucky, including more than 440 in intensive care – both record numbers in the state, he said. Nearly 250 virus patients are on ventilators. The statewide rate for positive tests reached 9.59%. Beshear warned that “a huge amount of virus” is spreading rapidly in every Kentucky county. “Today is a terrible day that shows us how quickly this thing is spreading,” he said. The record-setting surge reinforces the need for aggressive actions to try to curb the virus’s spread, the governor said. Beshear warned that “inaction is deadly,” adding that he’s “willing to do what’s unpopular” if it saves lives.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Amid the state’s third surge of the coronavirus outbreak, craft brewers and bar owners told lawmakers Wednesday that Gov. John Bel Edwards’ COVID-19 restrictions are damaging their operations and threaten to bankrupt their businesses. Microbrewery representatives told the House Ways and Means Committee that their taprooms shouldn’t be treated the same as bars, which are largely required to shutter indoor operations under the tightened virus rules the Democratic governor enacted last week. The brewers also called for the ability to deliver their beer directly to consumers, as other businesses are allowed to do with their products. Bar owners criticized Edwards’ rules limiting indoor live music performances as too strict, largely unworkable and unnecessary to protect public safety. Louisiana’s health department said 1,288 people in the state were hospitalized Wednesday with COVID-19, more than double the 596 COVID-19 patients hospitalized a month ago. Louisiana’s death toll from COVID-19 grew by another 37 confirmed deaths to 6,231.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: With Gov. Janet Mills in quarantine, the state’s acting chief justice instead swore lawmakers into office Wednesday in a historic offsite session that featured the state’s first openly gay House speaker and the first Black woman in a party leadership position. Mills, a Democrat, delivered a video message urging lawmakers to put safety first as they gathered at the Augusta Civic Center, where the session was moved from the Statehouse to ensure adequate space for social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which is surging in the state. Mills told lawmakers she feels well and is displaying no symptoms after exposure to a member of her security detail who is presumed to have contracted the virus. “I hope this serves as another reminder to all of us. As we’ve said all along, no one is immune to the spread and impact of the virus. Please stay safe,” Mills said on the video, a day after the state recorded a single-day high of 20 COVID-19 deaths.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Faced with surging COVID-19 cases, Gov. Larry Hogan announced measures Tuesday to boost the number of available health care workers and plan for more hospital beds. In a partnership with the Maryland Hospital Association, the governor announced the launch of an initiative called MarylandMedNow to recruit people with clinical backgrounds to work at state hospitals, nursing homes, testing sites and vaccination clinics. The state has asked colleges and universities to develop emergency policies and procedures to award academic credit to students who are willing to get hands-on work experience during the pandemic. Colleges also are being encouraged to allow health care students who are in their final semester and have satisfied all graduation requirements to get an “early exit” and expedited testing and licensing requirements to get them into the workforce.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker is urging those attending services at houses of worship to adhere to COVID-19 precautions, like wearing masks and practicing social distancing, particularly for indoor services. The state is still seeing too many COVID-19 clusters that can be traced back to houses of worship, the Republican said at a Tuesday press conference. “We know that houses of worship have always served as a place of refuge especially in difficult times like this,” Baker said. “But as with all gatherings, protocols have been put in place to ensure that services and other functions that happen in houses of worship happen as safely as possible.” Baker said many of the state’s faith leaders have stepped up by moving services online or holding them outside if possible. “It’s critically important that if you do attend an in-person service, please do wear a mask,” he said. “Keep your distance.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Bars and restaurants lost a challenge Wednesday to the state’s ban on indoor dining and immediately warned about business failures and deep job losses if the restriction linked to the coronavirus is extended past next week. U.S. District Judge Paul Maloney turned down a request for an injunction with seven days left in the three-week ban ordered by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration in response to an alarming rise in virus cases. “The court finds that a plausible explanation for the emergency order exists: Restaurant patrons cannot wear a mask while eating or drinking,” Maloney said. “Plaintiffs complain that they are being treated differently than similar businesses, but as the court noted in its previous order, individuals can patronize the businesses that remain open while wearing a mask.” The Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association and some restaurants had sued state health director Robert Gordon, saying they can safely provide indoor dining and were being treated unfairly when compared to other businesses.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health authorities reported 77 new COVID-19 deaths Wednesday – the second-highest one-day total of the pandemic – but this week’s figures have been affected by reporting lags due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The new deaths raise the state’s toll to 3,692. Minnesota’s highest one-day total was 101 cases last Friday, which reflected data from last Wednesday. The daily death tolls had been relatively low since then until now, but health officials have cautioned against reading too much into short-term fluctuations. The Minnesota Department of Health also reported 5,192 new coronavirus cases to bring the state’s total to 327,477. As of Tuesday, Minnesota hospitals were treating 1,604 COVID-19 patients, including 354 in intensive care.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves instituted mask mandates in 13 more counties Tuesday but chose not to implement the measure statewide, a week after several prominent health care leaders called on him to do so. During a press briefing, the Republican governor said he believes issuing mask requirements in counties with the highest number of new cases will encourage people to take the regulations more seriously than a blanket approach would. A total of 54 out of the state’s 82 counties now have a mask mandate. “I almost feel like there are those out there who really, truly believe if I were to write an executive order, a statewide prohibition against hurricanes in 2021, that we won’t have any hurricanes,” Reeves said. “It just doesn’t work that way.” Reeves’ decision to forgo a statewide mask mandate comes as 12 major hospitals had no intensive care unit beds available Tuesday, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The Legislature resumed work Tuesday after a special session had been delayed because several lawmakers tested positive for the coronavirus. The Senate budget committee on Tuesday gave initial approval to a $1.2 billion coronavirus aid package mostly comprised of federal funding. The move would allow the state to keep the federal money, including about $752 million in general coronavirus relief funding that needs to be spent by the end of the year. In Missouri, the Legislature must give approval for the governor to spend federal funding. Senators raised concerns with Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s request to spend more federal funding despite not yet using all the coronavirus aid the state received earlier this year. For example, Parson’s administration expects counties to leave as much as $300 million on the table that will go back to the federal government if unspent by the end of the year.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A new counseling hotline is available to help residents struggling with their mental health during the COVID-19 crisis, Gov. Steve Bullock announced Tuesday. The hotline is funded by a $1.6 million federal grant and will be available for at least the next nine months. People can call 1-877-503-0833 to receive free and confidential counseling services from trained crisis counselors from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday. The new service is meant to help health care workers, first responders, school officials, veterans, the elderly, Native Americans, and farmers and ranchers but is available to all Montana residents, according to the governor’s office. The state Department of Public Health and Human Services partnered with Disaster and Emergency Services to pursue the grant to address the growing need for mental health services amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: One of the state’s largest county jails is locked down after an outbreak of the coronavirus among inmates, and a state prison inmate with the virus has died. Lancaster County officials said Tuesday that their jail was locked down as a precaution after 12 inmates tested positive for the virus. All of the ill inmates are being treated in the jail’s infirmary, and more testing is being done in the two housing units where they had been held. Officials said it’s not clear how the virus reached the jail’s general population. The jail screens new inmates and holds them in quarantine for 10 days before releasing them into the general population. Previously, nine cases of COVID-19 were discovered during booking at the jail. All inmates and staff are required to wear masks inside the jail. Separate from the jail outbreak, the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said Tuesday that an inmate in his 70s died at a Lincoln hospital. The cause of death hasn’t been determined. The department said the inmate had COVID-19 and other underlying medical conditions.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A photo of a hospital’s alternative care site is being misrepresented on social media to fuel the false narrative that the coronavirus pandemic is a hoax, even as cases surge. Renown Regional Medical Center has been the primary target of renewed conspiracy theories suggesting hospitals are empty. The alternative care site with two floors of supplemental hospital beds inside a parking structure was opened Nov. 12 to accommodate an overflow in COVID-19 cases if needed. A photo showing a doctor standing in front of empty beds was taken the day it was opened, and patients had yet to arrive. Renown Regional Medical Center said the site has treated 198 coronavirus patients since it opened. President Donald Trump propelled the misinformation Tuesday, retweeting the photo of the doctor amid empty beds to his more than 80 million followers. “Fake election results in Nevada, also!” he said of the tweet suggesting that the parking garage site and pandemic were both fake. Gov. Steve Sisolak rebutted Trump’s retweet, saying that the president’s “consistent misleading rhetoric on COVID-19 is dangerous and reckless.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: State lawmakers bundled up and spread out on an athletic field Wednesday to start their next two-year session. But many House Democrats skipped the gathering over concerns about the coronavirus, and the no-shows, coupled with a show of force by Republicans, signaled a rough path ahead. The 400-member House and 24-member Senate met at the University of New Hampshire to get sworn in, choose leaders, and elect the secretary of state and treasurer. Things went smoothly for the Senate, of which Salem Republican Chuck Morse was elected president. But many House Democrats decided to stay home after Republican leaders revealed Tuesday that a number of GOP House members tested positive for the virus after attending a caucus meeting Nov. 20. There were 130 representatives absent, including Rep. Renny Cushing, D-Hampton, the new House minority leader. He said Republicans showed an unconscionable, blatant disregard for public health at a time when coronavirus cases are surging.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHackensack: Health officials are investigating a rise in COVID-19 cases at Ocean Medical Center that has infected at least 100 employees as the coronavirus surges through hospitals across New Jersey, according to the Ocean County Health Department, employees and a memo from the hospital’s ownership. The Brick hospital’s owner, Hackensack Meridian Health, said that “more than 100 of our team members are out of work at one hospital” because of the disease, according to a network memo sent to employees Nov. 20. The health system declined repeated requests the past week to provide the number of employees who were infected with the disease and quarantined but acknowledged that “we are seeing a higher rate of COVID-19 infection among team members at Hackensack Meridian Ocean Medical Center,” spokesman Ben Goldstein said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state was expected to mark another grim milestone Wednesday as the coronavirus pandemic marches on and as some public health restrictions were eased following a two-week lockdown. Confirmed cases in the state were on track to top 100,000 on Wednesday. Data shows about half of the state’s total cases since the pandemic began have been reported in just the past month. Like other states across the nation, New Mexico has been dealing with a surge in infections, related deaths and hospitalizations in recent weeks. Health care providers say they are at capacity, and laboratories have been struggling to keep up with growing demand for testing. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted Tuesday that the state has been at “this precipice for some time now” and urged people to abide by the health restrictions, which include staying home as much as possible, wearing a mask and keeping distance from other people.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An owner of a Staten Island bar that was providing indoor service in defiance of coronavirus restrictions was arrested after a sting in which plainclothes officers went inside and ordered food and beverages, the city sheriff’s office said. Protesters shouted as deputies arrested Danny Presti, the co-owner of Mac’s Public House, on Tuesday. The tavern is in an area of New York City designated by Gov. Andrew Cuomo as an orange zone because of spiking COVID-19 rates and was not supposed to be serving customers indoors. But the owners had declared the bar an “autonomous zone,” a nod to protesters who claimed control over a Seattle neighborhood in June. The bar has been fined thousands of dollars as it continued to serve patrons inside and to operate past the 10 p.m. curfew for restaurant service that Cuomo imposed citywide. According to a release from Sheriff Joseph Fucito, plainclothes deputies went inside Tuesday and ordered food in exchange for a mandatory $40 “donation.” Uniformed deputies went in then and issued tickets for state and city violations.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilson: Nearly half of third to 12th grade students in one school district failed a class this school year while taking virtual classes during the coronavirus pandemic, the district’s data shows. Wilson County Schools released data showing that 46% of students in those grades failed a class during the first nine weeks of the school year, WRAL-TV reports. That’s more than double the rate from the same period last year. The first quarter of the school year for students was entirely remote. Elementary and middle school students then transitioned into hybrid learning. Superintendent Dr. Lane Mills said in a statement that the outcome is “not what we want for our students and system.” “However, we also recognize that this pattern is happening across the state in all systems,” he said. “We are now on a path where many of our students are back in face-to-face instruction and are becoming more accustomed to online learning.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: City commissioners are planning to provide assistance to local businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic, beyond what is available at the state and federal level. Commissioners will look at a number of possibilities to assist bars, restaurants, retail and other businesses, KFGO reports. That could include waiving next year’s liquor license fees, adjusting utility bills and property tax reductions. City Strategic Planning Director Jim Gilmour said data from a number of sources shows that at least 30 Fargo businesses have closed so far during the pandemic. That includes seven hotels and 19 restaurants and breweries that have not renewed licenses required by the city. Gilmour said that in October there were 5,000 fewer employees in Cass and Clay Counties compared to a year ago. North Dakota health officials on Wednesday confirmed a dozen new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus, lifting the total number of fatalities in the state to 966 since the start of the pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A leading business group on Tuesday asked employees to model best practices for reducing the spread of the coronavirus as it warned of the impact the current spike in cases could have on the economy. The Ohio Business Roundtable, a nonprofit organization of big economy chief executive officers, wants workers to encourage mask-wearing at any gathering outside immediate family, avoid large gatherings such as game day celebrations, and reconsider indoor holiday parties. “This is not a choice between our health and a strong economy; the two are strongly connected,” said Pat Tiberi, the roundtable’s president and CEO and a former longtime Republican congressman. The group dubbed the effort the Coalition to Stop the Spread. The announcement came as Ohio’s economy continues to show signs of weakness. Last week, the state said 30,177 Ohioans filed initial claims for unemployment compensation, a 21% jump from the week before. More than 5,200 people were hospitalized with the coronavirus Tuesday, another record.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials reported a record-high 54 deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, more than double the previous one-day record, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues to surge. The latest deaths were reported in 23 counties across the state between Oct. 24 and Nov. 30, including 37 deaths since Nov. 26, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. There is often a delay in reporting deaths because of the time it takes to confirm the death is COVID-19-related, said department spokesman Anthony Triana. The previous one-day record number of reported deaths was 26 on Nov. 18. The latest figures bring the total number of virus-related deaths in Oklahoma to 1,812. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in the state has risen over the past two weeks from 13.29 deaths per day Nov. 17 to 13.43 deaths per day Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state reported 24 more deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday, a record high for a single day in the state. The Oregon Health Authority said the “grim milestone” underscores that people should wear masks, keep physical distance and keep gatherings small. The increase raises the state’s known death toll to 936. Meanwhile, officials in Silverton, a town east of Salem, are trying to monitor a potential outbreak among firefighters. The situation has underscored a weakness in Oregon’s response to the pandemic: a lack of a system for getting first responders tested rapidly, said Assistant Chief Ed Grambusch of the Silverton Fire District. A member of the fire district who was taking part in training Nov. 21 has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Twenty people who were trainees or instructors may have had a high risk exposure.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Regional “strike teams” will fan out across the state over the next 12 weeks in a bid to improve its coronavirus testing efforts, the governor announced Tuesday, as health officials anticipated a post-Thanksgiving surge in new cases. The Department of Health is expanding an existing contract with AMI Expeditionary Healthcare, which will dedicate five virus testing teams to the new effort. Each week, the teams will operate temporary testing sites in counties identified as virus hot spots, eventually making it to every Pennsylvania county that doesn’t have its own health department. “Our goal is to ensure that everyone who needs a test in Pennsylvania can get one,” Gov. Tom Wolf said Tuesday. Temporary sites opened Wednesday in Bedford, Mifflin, Tioga and Northampton counties, with another scheduled to open Friday in Butler County. Pennsylvania is reporting an average of 6,700 new confirmed infections and 73 deaths per day, both up sharply over the past two weeks, according to AP analysis of data from the COVID Tracking Project. Statewide hospitalizations have more than tripled since the beginning of November, according to Department of Health data.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Corrections’ medical director is stepping down as Rhode Island’s prison system deals with a spike in coronavirus cases. Dr. Jennifer Clarke’s last day is Friday after working for the department since 1998. Corrections Director Patricia Coyne-Fague acknowledged Clarke’s departure comes at a challenging time for the department but thanked her for improvements she made to inmate health care. Coyne-Fague highlighted Clark’s work implementing the department’s medication-assisted opioid treatment program, which has garnered national attention. The corrections department reported Monday that 488 prisoners and 112 staffers had tested positive for the coronavirus in November. The prison’s maximum-security unit is among the hardest hit. Nearly all of the roughly 350 inmates in the unit have tested positive for the virus. The state public defender’s office has filed an emergency petition with the state Supreme Court seeking the release of as many people as possible on bail to reduce the prison population. The petition includes a statement of support from Clarke.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The state Department of Health and Environmental Control on Wednesday reported 1,612 new cases of the coronavirus and 35 new deaths. The department also reported 70 new probable cases of COVID-19. The state cumulative total is 206,653 confirmed cases, and there have been 4,126 total confirmed deaths. Additionally, there have been 14,182 probable cases and 318 probable deaths. Of the 7,480 COVID-19 test results reported Tuesday to DHEC, 21.6% were positive. Among South Carolina’s 46 counties, Greenville County has led the state with the most confirmed cases for 27 consecutive days, every day since Nov. 6. Seven Upstate hospitals including five from Prisma have reported staffing shortages related to demands from the coronavirus pandemic, although all of the facilities said they have made internal adjustments to accommodate needs.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state on Wednesday reported that 47 people had died from COVID-19, one of the highest single-day death tallies since the pandemic began. South Dakota has reported more than 50 deaths in a day only twice – both in November. The total number of deaths stands at 995. The rate of death from the virus has risen dramatically in recent weeks, and the state now has the nation’s ninth-highest number of deaths per capita. There were 107.5 deaths per 100,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. But health officials did offer some good news. They are expecting to receive the first shipments of a COVID-19 vaccine in the next two weeks if it is authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration. Medical workers caring for COVID-19 patients will be the first to receive the vaccine, followed by people in elder care facilities.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Lawmakers who have often been critical of government restrictions to curb COVID-19’s spread are suggesting ways to give themselves the power to limit or overturn emergency orders from the governor during future health crises. Amid the worsening pandemic, a GOP-led panel of state House and Senate lawmakers issued recommendations Tuesday that would treat health-related emergency orders differently from others, with caps on how long a governor’s health state of emergency can stand before lawmakers would get a vote on it; power for lawmakers to override a state of emergency or executive order; requirements for notice and fiscal impact estimates of an emergency order; and more. The suggestions are poised to end up in legislation that the Republican-supermajority Legislature will consider when it returns in January for its annual lawmaking session. The recommendations also take some heat off Republican Gov. Bill Lee, since they would only apply to the next administration, exempting his.\n\nTexas\n\nMarfa: The state surpassed 9,000 hospitalized coronavirus patients Tuesday for the first time since a deadly summer outbreak as the pandemic’s spread threatened the Big Bend region near the desert artist hub of Marfa, where tourists continued visiting and officials urged people to stay home. The rising number of cases near the remote West Texas border is but another example of how the virus is now spreading into places that ducked previous surges. Texas reported more than 15,000 new cases Tuesday, smashing the previous single-day record. Marfa is about 200 miles down the border from El Paso, where hospitalizations have fallen slightly after a grim November. The town of roughly 1,700 people is the second-largest in Presidio County, where in the past two weeks the number of cases since the pandemic began has doubled to at least 460 confirmed cases, according to state health figures. The county borders Ojinagao, Mexico, and the only hospital in rural Alpine has just enough beds to treat only a handful of COVID-19 patients.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: With winter sports in the state set to officially begin Thursday, the high school governing body has released updated guidelines for teams and spectators. The UHSAA has unveiled Return-to-Play Protocol for winter sports, which includes recommendations based on each county’s COVID-19 transmission rate. According to the guidelines, counties with high transmission rates are only allowed to have parents of the participating athletes in the venue. Support groups, such as the drill team or cheerleaders, will be allowed with required masks and social distancing for the home team only. Support groups for away teams will not be allowed. For moderate transmission rates, arenas will be allowed with 25% capacity, and support groups are allowed with required masks and social distancing, but there are no defined student sections. The low transmission rate fundamentals are far more lax.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: People who attended multi-household Thanksgiving gatherings against the governor’s order are urged to quarantine and get tested for the coronavirus. “It’s best to get tested right away and again on Day Seven or later,” Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Tuesday during the governor’s virus briefing. The state is investigating a situation related to a Thanksgiving dinner party that was celebrated early, he said. “I can only hope this single event will not be a sign of more to come,” he said. Levine also reminded Vermonters that Gov. Phil Scott’s order banning on multi-household gatherings is still in effect. “If we can keep doing our part to prevent further spread of COVID-19, we can weather the current surge in cases,” he said. Vermont reported 101 new cases of the coronavirus Wednesday for a statewide total since the pandemic began of 4,461. Two more people have died, bringing the total number of deaths to 74.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A health system serving a swath of the central Appalachian mountains said Wednesday that it will halt nonemergency elective procedures due to surging cases of COVID-19 and capacity concerns at its Virginia and Tennessee hospitals. Ballad Health officials announced the change, which will take effect Monday and last for at least 30 days, at a news conference at which they again implored community members to follow basic public health guidelines such as mask-wearing and social distancing. “The way we’re seeing people act in the community, the way we’re seeing people attend large gatherings, we can expect to see the numbers continuing to rise higher and higher. So I’m pleading with you, please change your behavior if you haven’t yet,” said Eric Deaton, Ballad’s chief operating officer. Gov. Ralph Northam said at a separate news conference Wednesday that health officials believe Tennessee’s lack of a mask mandate and other restrictions has helped increase the virus’s spread in neighboring southwest Virginia communities.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: The vast majority of Skagit County businesses are complying with emergency rules to curb the spread of COVID-19, but a few have been cited and fined for violations. The Skagit Valley Herald reports Skagit Arms is the first county business to be fined by the Department of Labor & Industries for a COVID-19 mask violation, though at least one other local business has been cited by the state Liquor and Cannabis Board and has requested a hearing. Skagit Speedway, meanwhile, received a written warning for a large outdoor political rally held at the racetrack in October, though no fine was issued. Eight other businesses throughout the state also had been cited and fined for mask violations in the past two months. Fines ranged from $900 to $7,500. Businesses have 15 days to appeal. By state mandate, businesses must ensure all customers and workers on their premises wear masks to protect against the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFairmont: The Marion County Family Resource Network hosted Santa Claus for a breakfast event in the city last year, but the pandemic is preventing his return this year. However, Frank Jarman, executive director of the Family Resource Network, said the nonprofit will serve as a liaison between Saint Nick and area families through its new Letters to Santa initiative instead. “Because of COVID, we weren’t able to do our Breakfast with Santa,” Jarman said. “We just felt like people still needed that hope, that magic that comes with Christmas, so our team came up with this great letter.” According to Jarman, parents can send Santa letter requests to the FRN by just including some information about their children. He said those who send in letters should get replies from Santa in the beginning of December. “We’re just the conduit,” Jarman said. “We just get the information from the parents, we send it to Santa, and he is going to send out a great letter.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans who control the state Senate won’t take up any COVID-19 relief measures before January, the incoming majority leader said Wednesday, even though Assembly Republicans have said they’re open to coming in this month, and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has urged swift action before federal money runs out. “We’re not coming back in December,” said Sen. Devin LeMahieu, who takes over as majority leader in January. Republicans who control the Legislature are at odds on what the next step should be in fighting the virus, which continues to spread across Wisconsin. The state reported 3,777 new confirmed cases Wednesday, bringing the total to more than 395,000. The seven-day average of new cases was 3,664, down from highs seen in mid-November but still five times higher than three months ago. The numbers still show high community spread, the state Department of Health Services said. There were 82 new deaths reported, for a total of 3,502 since the pandemic began.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The governor says he disagrees with a state Republican Party resolution calling on him to rescind a state of emergency in place since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, called the resolution approved by the Wyoming State Republican Central Committee in mid-November a “very unfortunate choice.” Besides allowing the state health officer to issue public health orders, the state of emergency Gordon issued in March makes it easier for hospitals and others to get funding and other resources to help deal with the virus, Gordon said Tuesday in a virtual meeting with the Wyoming Tribune Eagle editorial board. “I just think it was an unfortunate resolution, but it’s perhaps a sign of the times of how far apart this country has become,” he said. Gordon’s comments came a day after Wyoming reported a record 247 coronavirus hospitalizations and as he himself was experiencing mild symptoms of the virus.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/10/21/covid-essentials-tohono-oodham-nation-hoover-dam-news-around-states/114453572/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: A spike in drunken driving cases in Morgan County has led to speculation that the stresses associated with the coronavirus pandemic might be behind the increase. County sheriff’s spokesman Mike Swafford said his department made 43 DUI arrests in the first nine months of 2019. This year, the total is 66 through Sept. 30, an increase of almost 54%. Swafford told The Decatur Daily that sheriff’s officials believe the pandemic is a factor. “People are stressed more,” he said. “We’re seeing more cases of domestic violence, people arguing with their neighbors that we attribute to the stress of everyday living during this pandemic.” But there has also been an increase in patrols under Sheriff Ron Puckett. And, another likely factor, he said, is the closure of two bridges on a U.S. highway that created a 16-mile detour. Another state jurisdiction also is seeing an increase in DUI cases compared to other localities. Town Creek Police Chief Jerry Garrett believes the pandemic is behind the rise his department has seen in recent months. The police force had 19 DUI arrests from March 1, 2019, to Sept. 30, 2019, but the total jumped to 27 for the same period this year.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Personnel stationed at a military base in Alaska’s largest city were ordered to avoid bars and interior dining at restaurants amid rising coronavirus cases on and off the base. Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson placed the restrictions on airmen and soldiers in Anchorage, The Anchorage Daily News reported Saturday. Members of the 673rd Air Base Wing are not allowed to visit businesses that “primarily engage in preparing and serving alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption,” an Oct. 8 memo from base Commander Col. Kirsten Aguilar said. The order keeps active-duty airmen assigned to the 673rd Wing from visiting bars, breweries, pubs and nightclubs. The restrictions were enacted as a “precaution” because of increasing COVID-19 cases statewide, Media Operations Section Chief Erin Eaton said. “The decision was made based on data and inputs from the medical team through their contact tracing efforts, and through base leadership’s evaluation of risk,” Eaton said in an email. The regulation might be reviewed within 30 days. Aguilar said in a video posted on social media Friday that the base has moved into HPCON Charlie, a military health protection level requiring additional limitations on certain base services and potentially more telecommuting.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Citing an urgent situation, particularly for communities of color, the Tohono O’odham Nation said it will donate $2million to advance COVID-19 research in the state. Leaders of the Tohono O’odham Nation of southern Arizona were in Phoenix to make the announcement that they would be giving $1 million each to the University of Arizona and Arizona State University to advance ongoing COVID-19 research, including the development of rapid tests. The money comes from gaming revenue earned by the tribe’s four casinos. Part of the tribe’s gaming compact with the state requires the donation of 12% of revenue toward local community programs. The tribe operates Desert Diamond casinos near Tucson, Sahuarita, Why and in the West Valley near Glendale that reopened in June. Native American communities across the U.S. have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In Arizona, Native Americans make up just 5% of the state’s population, yet 11% of its known deaths, tribal chairman Ned Norris Jr. said. Norris announced the grants after a prayer led by Tohono O’odham legislative council chairman Timothy Joaquin at the UA College of Medicine - Phoenix on Monday afternoon. UA President Robert Robbins and ASU President Michael Crow were both in attendance to accept the donation, along with officials from the Arizona Board of Regents. Robbins and Crow said their universities are working on developing easy, rapid tests that can give results in minutes that they hope to have ready by spring.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Monday hit a new record for number of people hospitalized because of the illness caused by the coronavirus. The Department of Health reported 41 more people hospitalized because of COVID-19, bringing its total number to 613. Ten more people died, bringing the state’s total fatalities to 1,714. The state’s new cases, however, dropped from the previous day. The state’s probable and confirmed cases rose by 531 to 99,597. A day earlier, the state reported 644 new total cases. Arkansas ranks 13th in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he remained hopeful that cases would stay low through the week. “Let’s stay vigilant, and while cases usually go up in the next four days, let’s remember that it is up to each of us to do our part to help slow this virus and protect ourselves, our family, and our neighbors,” Hutchinson said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state won’t allow any distribution of coronavirus vaccines until it is reviewed by the state’s own panel of experts, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday. Vaccinations for the pandemic “will move at the speed of trust,” said Newsom, a Democrat, and the state wants its own independent review no matter who wins the presidential election next month. “Of course we won’t take anyone’s word for it,” Newsom said as he named 11 doctors and scientists to review any rollout of vaccines by the federal government or vaccine developers. The board members hail from top California universities and medical providers, along with state and local public health officials. The pledge raises the possibility that California residents might not receive a vaccine as distribution begins in other states, though the governor said widespread vaccinations are unrealistic until sometime next year. At most, 45 million doses will be available nationwide before the end of this year from the two most advanced vaccines, Newsom said. Each person must receive two doses, three weeks apart. If California were to receive 12% of the doses, commensurate with its percentage of the nation’s population, that would be 5.4 million doses, or enough to treat 2.7 million of the state’s nearly 40 million residents. Most would go to front-line medical workers and first responders, he said, then to the most vulnerable in the population.\n\nColorado\n\nLone Tree: With many U.S. stores closing during the coronavirus pandemic, especially inside malls, the owners of a chain of retail stores called COVID-19 Essential have seized on the empty space, as well as the world’s growing acceptance that wearing masks is a reality that may last well into 2021, if not longer. Masks have evolved from a utilitarian, anything-you-can-find-that-works product into another way to express one’s personality, political leanings or sports fandom. And the owners of COVID-19 Essentials are betting that Americans are willing to put their money where their mouth is. Prices range from $19.99 for a simple children’s mask to $130 for a top-of-the-line face covering, with an N95 filter and a battery-powered fan. Almost all shops and many pop-up kiosks in the Park Meadows mall now sell masks. But COVID-19 Essentials also carries other accessories for the pandemic, including hand sanitizer and other sanitation devices. The chain has locations in New York City, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Las Vegas, and is looking to open stores in California, where wildfires have only added to the demand for masks.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is planning to revamp its benchmarks for when people entering the state from locations with large COVID-19 rates will need to quarantine. Currently, state residents and out-of-state travelers coming from states and territories with 10 cases per 100,000 population or 10% positivity rates must fill out a state travel form and isolate for 14 days. Under the new rule, people must take such steps if they come from locations with 10 cases per 100,000 and 5% positivity rates. “The other threshold was so broad that it was including about 85 percent of our states across the country. It was becoming unenforceable,” said Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. As of Monday, Connecticut itself surpassed the threshold of 10 cases per 100,000 with 11.2 new cases per 100,000. The state’s seven-day rolling average for positive cases as of Monday was 1.7%. Lamont said the state will continue to issue fines for Connecticut residents and out-of-state residents who violate the quarantine and state notification rules. As of last week, the state has issued 45 fines, most to people from Connecticut. Lamont said his administration is still trying to determine how to handle workers who live in one state and work in another if Connecticut reaches the new benchmark.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A health care system said it is seeing “overwhelming demand” for flu shots this year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Beebe Healthcare, a not-for-profit system based in Lewes, has vaccinated more than 3,100 community members through 13 flu clinics, the Delaware State News reported Saturday. That’s about 75% of the total number of vaccinations Beebe recorded last year in more than 30 clinics. This year’s total from Beebe doesn’t include its team members. More than 2,200 were vaccinated in a 48-hour period in September, according to the newspaper. “We’ve seen an overwhelming demand for flu shots from the community this year, which is really encouraging considering how important being vaccinated is with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Bill Chasanov, clinical transformation officer and infectious disease physician at Beebe Healthcare. Health officials and medical groups are urging people to get either the flu shot or nasal spray, so that doctors and hospitals don’t face the extra strain of having to treat influenza in the midst of the pandemic. Last year Delaware had more than 7,000 cases of the flu, with 400 individuals hospitalized and 11 deaths.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly described the nature and location of Beebe Healthcare, which is seeing high demand for flu shots. It is a not-for-profit, independent health care system based in Lewes, Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser said the city will launch a new COVID-19 exposure notifications app for residents to aid in contact tracing, WUSA-TV reported. The app, DC CAN, which became available Tuesday, was developed by Apple and Google and can be used by iPhone and Android users based on whether the smartphone user activates the specific region/state on their phone. D.C. Health Director Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt said if users opt in, their phones will send out “beacons” to other nearby phones using a randomly generated ID that changes every 10-20 minutes. According to Nesbitt, the exposure notification system once a day will download a list of keys belonging to people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and report their diagnosis through DC CAN. Users will then receive a notification informing them if they have come in contact with an individual diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:Florida State University President John Thrasher and his wife, Jean, are free of COVID-19, the president posted on his Twitter account Monday afternoon. “I am happy to share that Jean and I were cleared Friday by the Florida DOH after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month, and we are resuming many of our regular activities,” Thrasher said. “We are feeling good and appreciate all the prayers and well wishes!” Jean Thrasher learned of her positive diagnosis on Oct. 5 after a recent stay in the hospital and a local rehabilitation facility for an unrelated condition. President Thrasher, who tested positive Oct. 6, has continued to conduct university business at home. On Monday, FSU reported 26 students tested positive last week, along with one employee, according to the university’s dashboard. In total, 2,031 people were tested at the Tucker Center last week, with a low positivity rate of 1.33%. At Florida A&M University, eight students reported testing positive for the coronavirus for the week ending Friday, according to its weekly dashboard. That is the highest student number since the week of September 25, when nine positive students tests were reported.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The number of COVID-19 cases is rising in Georgia, although infections in the state are not climbing as fast as those nationwide. Even with relatively few infections reported Monday, the state’s seven-day average is close to 1,300, more than 10% above the recent bottom on Oct. 8. The number of people hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19 has also been rising for a week, crossing back above 1,300 on Monday. A ray of light for Georgia is that the positivity rate has stayed level over the last two weeks at just above 6%, even as the number of DNA-based tests rose modestly, on average. Georgia’s transmission rates still remain below those being seen nationwide, with the state ranking 35th per capita among states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico over the last two weeks, according to data collected by the the Associated Press.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A state program providing rental assistance to tenants struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily stopped accepting applications. The Rent Relief and Housing Assistance Program called a halt to applications after reaching its processing capacity, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Sunday. The program launched in early September received more than 20,000 applications and overwhelmed Catholic Charities Hawaii and Aloha United Way, which are helping administer the program. The charities are working out how to manage the current backlog. “Right now we’re meeting with them daily to figure out how to work through it as quickly as possible,” said Kent Miyasaki, spokesman for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. The program was expected to disburse $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funding through monthly payments to the landlords of tenants struggling to pay rent. The program approved $5.8 million in payouts, although only $2.3 million has been distributed, Miyasaki said.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho: State officials approved a contract with Florida-based vendor ClassWallet to distribute $50 million in federal coronavirus emergency money to low-income families to help children learn during the coronavirus pandemic. The Idaho State Board of Education awarded the no-bid contract Monday that with various fees will cost the state about $2 million to administer. The program will provide up to $1,500 per child with a maximum of $3,500 per family and help about 30,000 children. The program starts Wednesday, and families can apply between then and Dec. 8. Applications will go out in waves based on need until the money runs out. The board unanimously signed off on the contract that’s part of the Strong Families, Strong Students initiative program put forward by Republican Gov. Brad Little. The money is intended to make it less likely for parents to leave the workforce or dip into household money while their children learn amid the challenges posed by the pandemic. The money will be distributed based on income and can be used to purchase educational materials, computers and other services. Many of Idaho’s 310,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade are learning at home as school districts and families try to avoid spreading COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City officials warned Monday of “worrying trends” in increased COVID-19 cases, calling it a second wave that could trigger additional restrictions to curb the spread. Such restrictions have returned to other areas of the state. Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, speaking Monday in Murphysboro, announced an end to indoor restaurant and bar service in parts of southern Illinois, along with limits on groups of more than 25 from congregating. In Chicago, there has been a more than 50% increase of positive cases in the past two weeks to more than 500 daily cases, according to the Chicago Department of Public Health. Commissioner Allison Arwady said it is the most cases since late May, which was the end of the pandemic’s first wave. There also has been a 25% increase in hospitalizations. There are spikes across all groups of Chicagoans and parts of the city. The increase coincides with an increase statewide. The Illinois Department of Public Health on Monday announced 3,113 new confirmed COVID-19 cases and 22 additional deaths.\n\nIndiana\n\nCovington:A county clerk in rural Indiana said she will not wear a mask while overseeing early voting despite the county’s surge of coronavirus cases and warnings from a state official. Fountain County Clerk Paula Copenhaver said she will “not be part of the government overreach” and contends social distancing and hand sanitizer are enough. Valerie Warycha, spokeswoman for the secretary of state, confirmed Friday that Connie Lawson contacted Copenhaver to ask her to wear a mask. Lawson also wrote in an email on Friday to clerks and election officials in all 92 Indiana counties that if poll workers refuse to wear masks or other protection, clerks should thank them for their service “and ask that they voluntarily resign.” Lawson did not mention any clerks or counties by name in her email, and she did not issue any mandates. State elected officials do not have the authority to do that, Warycha said. Lawson said the election is “the time to be careful, not cavalier,” and that clerks needed to put public health before personal preference, the Journal & Courier reported.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: State Auditor Rob Sand warned the governor’s decision to spend $21 million in federal pandemic relief funds on a new executive branch software system would not be allowed and should be abandoned. Sand said that using the federal money to pay for Workday, a cloud-based program for the executive branch’s human resources and finances, is an inappropriate use under the law. He said that if the money isn’t redeployed for a different purpose, Iowa taxpayers could be on the hook to repay the federal government $21 million later on. Sand, a Democrat, said his conclusion was shared by the Treasury Department’s Office of Inspector General, which is responsible for overseeing the appropriate use of federal funds. He noted that the administration of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a five-year, $20 million software contract with Workday in 2019, long before the coronavirus pandemic started. In addition, the state anticipates spending about $28 million more on implementation costs. Earlier this year, Reynolds’ office decided to partly pay for the program with money from the $2. trillion coronavirus aid package approved in March by Congress, which has sent billions of dollars to Iowa. Reynolds’ office has sought to justify its decision to pay for Workday with the money by arguing that it would allow the state to “act quickly to assist essential government employees.” The program could help workers request COVID-19 hardship assistance and time off for family and medical leaves, for instance.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A coronavirus outbreak has killed 10 residents in a nursing home in a northwestern Kansas county that proportionally already had the nation’s largest increase in cases over two weeks. The health department in Norton County reported Monday night that all 62 residents and an unspecified number of employees at the Andbe Home in Norton had tested positive for the coronavirus. The agency also said one Andbe Home resident was hospitalized, and the remaining 51 were being treated at the home. “Steps are being taken to prevent any further outbreak, including quarantining residents in their rooms and not allowing outside visitors into the facility,” the county health department said in a statement Monday night. The outbreak at the nursing home came after the state Department of Health and Environment last week reported more than 100 cases at the state’s prison in Norton over the two weeks ending Wednesday.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The moratorium on disconnecting utilities for nonpayment is ending in Kentucky, but relief funds are being designated to help when residents are at risk of having services cut off during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Beshear signed an executive order ending the statewide moratorium on Nov. 6, but his office said the order also designates $15 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds to help Kentuckians who face disconnections. The order also requires utilities to provide a payment plan over at least six months for residential customers.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette:Five members of a sorority at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have tested positive for COVID-19, university officials said. Officials did not identity the sorority but stated the members followed protocols and self-reported their illnesses, UL Lafayette spokesman Eric Maron said in the release. They are now in isolation, he confirmed. An additional 16 sorority members were in close contact with the women who tested positive and are now in quarantine, Maron said. The university is conducting contact tracing to identify others who may have been in close proximity to the members. Student Health Services will notify anyone who is determined to have been in close contact with anyone who tests positive. Members of the sorority are being offered free, on-campus testing. Once the cases are confirmed through documentation, the cases will be added to the university’s public COVID-19 dashboard. Since March, 138 students and faculty have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the dashboard.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Restaurants and retailers will be allowed to continue operating outdoors through the holiday season in Maine’s largest city. The Portland City Council approved a plan Monday night that extends through Jan. 4 provisions letting businesses operate on private property, public sidewalks and in parking lanes. “Certainly most people in the city are more comfortable dining outdoors than they are indoors right now, so we’re hoping that will provide some flexibility and relief for businesses that are really struggling right now,” Councilor Justin Costa said. In the Old Port, Dana, Milk, Exchange and Wharf streets are closed. Under the plan, all of these roads will reopen to traffic and parking except Dana Street from Fore to Wharf streets and Wharf Street from Union to Dana streets. Businesses on Middle Street cxan continue to use the parking lane with some changes to help with winter operations. City Manager Jon Jennings said the plan accounts for safety and public health standards, along with expeditious removal of snow. Businesses will have to reapply for a permit to continue outdoor dining, but all fees have been waived.\n\nMaryland\n\nHurlock:The governors of Maryland and Delaware have announced new grant programs to help contracted chicken farmers offset losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Each state’s program will offer grants of $1,000 per house, up to $5,000 per farm, with $10 million in funds from the federal CARES, Act. The help is intended to boost family farmers who are contract growers for big companies, like Perdue or Tyson, the governors said in a news conference in Hurlock on Monday. Poultry is the region’s top agricultural commodity and is Delaware’s No. 1 industry. “This COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is continuing to cause great hardship for so many people, not just here in our state, but all across the country and all around the globe,” said Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. “And our farmers certainly are no exception... It’s been a very difficult time for our ag community.” Farms that were forced to euthanize entire flocks – a production reduction measure done in response to processors having reduced capacity – will be eligible for an additional $1,500 per house. Applications are open for the programs, called the Maryland Farmer COVID-19 Relief Program and the Delaware Contract Poultry Grower Grant Assistance Program. The application deadline is Dec. 1.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A cluster of COVID-19 cases that affected nearly 60 staff and patients at Brigham and Women’s Hospital has been contained, hospital officials said. The cluster was identified Sept. 22 in two inpatient units, and 42 employees and 15 patients were potentially connected, the hospital said in a statement on its website. The hospital has not had any new potentially contagious cases on the units that were affected since Oct. 3. The possible factors that contributed to the cluster included a highly infectious source patient, several people with very high viral loads, inconsistencies in patient masking and the use of eye protection among providers, and a lack of physical distancing among staff while eating. The likely source patient was not admitted because of the coronavirus, but had symptoms of a respiratory infection and twice tested negative for COVID-19, Dr. Michael Klompas, hospital epidemiologist, told The Boston Globe. The patient infected a roommate who was then transferred to another unit, he said. In response to the cluster, the hospital instituted an aggressive testing protocol for staff and patients, tested the HVAC system and thoroughly cleaned the affected areas.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: Misdemeanor charges are being dropped against a barber who defied Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and reopened his shop last spring during the coronavirus pandemic. The case against Karl Manke of Owosso fizzled after the Michigan Supreme Court on Oct. 2 said Whitmer used an unconstitutional law as the foundation for emergency orders to control the virus, attorney David Kallman said. Barbershops and salons were closed for months until June 15. But Manke, 77, reopened in early May, declaring that “government is not my mother.” He inspired people from all over Michigan to drive to his shop for a haircut. Manke cut hair on the grounds of the state Capitol during a protest in May. Kallman said the Shiawassee County prosecutor’s office is dropping the case. “It is definitely a weight off my shoulders,” Manke said. “I just want to earn a living, and I am not a health threat to anyone.” State regulators still are trying to revoke his barber license, Kallman said. A hearing is set for Nov. 19.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Monday’s lunchtime crowd at the White Horse restaurant and bar included Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan after she listened to the owner’s feedback on how the pandemic has affected her small business. Flanagan stopped in St. Cloud on a half-day trip to Central Minnesota as part of a statewide small business listening tour. Flanagan also stopped at Stoney Brook Farms in Foley earlier in the day. White Horse owner Jackie Lee told Flanagan and state Rep. Dan Wolgamott, D-St. Cloud, how much she appreciated financial help in the form of the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan – especially with the potential for forgiveness. Flanagan said she continues to advocate for cities and counties to dole out Coronavirus Relief Fund money established by the federal CARES Act. The Minnesota Department of Revenue distributed more than $837.5 million to 85 counties and 1,521 cities and townships, which could be used to support, among other things, grants to businesses impacted by COVID-19. She said the state wants to make sure that money gets to where it needs to be. Cities have until Nov. 15 and counties to Dec. 1 to spend that funding. Unspent aid will then return to the state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said he is imposing a mask mandate for public indoor spaces and other restrictions in nine counties to curb the spread of the coronavirus amid weeks of steadily rising case numbers. “Here in Mississippi, we have seen this before,” Reeves said, referencing a spike in cases the state saw in the summer. “We know what can happen if we allow this to get out of control, so want to be proactive to prevent that from happening.” Reeves said explicitly that he does not think what is happening in Mississippi qualifies as a spike. “We’ve seen a relatively slow, slight increase over the last six weeks, which has really been exacerbated over the last 10 or 11 days,” he said. In the past week, Mississippi had two days when the number of new cases reported in one day reached more than 1,000, something the Department of Health hadn’t reported since mid-August. The seven-day rolling average of daily new confirmed cases in Mississippi has risen from 518 per day on Oct. 4 to 725 cases on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins data analyzed by the Associated Press.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Dr. Alex Garza of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force is warning that hospital workers are “overworked and demoralized” after months of fighting the coronavirus, and the worst might yet to come. Garza said hospitalizations are getting higher and intensive care unit beds are filling up at a time when the flu season is about to create even more strain on the health care system. The St. Louis region is actually in better shape than the rest of the state, according to data released Tuesday on the state health department’s COVID-19 dashboard. Hospitalizations are at or near record levels in virtually every region except St. Louis, which was hit hardest in the spring. But, according to Garza, even St. Louis is seeing an uptick. In Springfield, CoxHealth constructed a temporary building on the parking lot of Cox Medical Center South to serve the expected overflow of COVID-19 and flu patients. The state dashboard showed that ICU capacity statewide was down to 29%, with 476 of Missouri’s 1,439 COVID-19 patients receiving intensive care. The data also shows that 788 ventilators are in use, a figure that includes non-COVID-19 patients.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Students at Montana State University have sued the university claiming it broke a contractual agreement when it canceled in-person classes because of the pandemic without offering to refund or reduce tuition and fees. Anthony Cordero, who was an undergraduate student in the spring semester, filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court in September on behalf of himself and other students who paid tuition for in-person classes that were forced online because of the pandemic, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The lawsuit said Cordero paid about $6,500 for the spring semester and was not provided a prorated refund for his in-person classes that were discontinued and moved online, or the mandatory fees he paid after school facilities and events were canceled. The university said in early March that it would transition to fully online because of health concerns, and did not offer in-person classes again until Aug. 17. The lawsuit alleged that since the students did not choose to attend an online-only higher education institution, they were deprived of both the education and on-campus experiences they paid for when they chose the Bozeman-based university. Kalispell-based attorney Dale Cockrell, who is representing the university, said he was reviewing the lawsuit and expects to file a response toward the end of November. University spokesman Tracy Ellig said the university doesn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and another inmate who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 has died. The state said the number of people hospitalized with the virus jumped to 380 on Monday and eclipsed the previous day’s record of 343. The new record is 64% higher than the spring peak of 232 set on May 27, according to the state’s online virus tracker. But Nebraska officials said 37% of the state’s 578 intensive care beds remain available, so it appears that hospitals have the capacity to handle the recent surge. Nebraska has the fifth-highest rate of new virus cases in the nation. The rate of new cases per 100,000 Nebraska residents over the past two weeks reached 547.25 on Monday, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. The state Corrections Department said an inmate in his 60s died Sunday – three weeks after testing positive for the coronavirus. He is the second inmate to die after being diagnosed with the virus, although officials said he had other health problems.\n\nNevada\n\nBoulder City: The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation reopened Hoover Dam to the public Tuesday, seven months after it closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal officials said visitors will be able to access all open areas and visit the Mike O’Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge plaza and walkway. The visitor center will remain closed with no tours or exhibits available. Visitors to the dam at the Nevada-Arizona border are being asked to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines when it comes to preventing the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state attorney general’s office has fined a restaurant where at least 18 people have tested positive for COVID-19. Fat Katz Food and Drink restaurant has been fined $2,000 for violating emergency orders related to the coronavirus after it moved a karaoke event inside. The Hudson restaurant told authorities that it moved the event inside after receiving noise complaints and because of colder weather. In issuing the fine, the state in a letter to the restaurant said the decision to move the event inside after being told it wasn’t allowed indoors and allowing individuals to participate without bringing their own equipment not only violated the state’s emergency order but also was “reckless.” The cases linked to Fat Katz include a person who went to the restaurant while aware of their COVID-19 diagnosis when they were supposed to be in isolation, and a second person who went there when they were knowingly supposed to be in quarantine. No one responded to a request for comment at Fat Katz.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gov. Phil Murphy conditionally vetoed a bill that would have expanded charitable groups’ ability to sell raffle tickets online based around sporting events, determining that the measure was too close to internet gambling. Because the coronavirus pandemic has drastically reduced or even eliminated in-person attendance at large sporting events in the state, some legislators proposed expanding the law to let people buy tickets to such raffles over the internet, regardless of whether they were in a stadium or not. Although lauding the intent of the bill, Murphy sent it back to lawmakers with recommended changes, including allowing such an expansion only during times of a declared public health emergency, and requiring the same sort of geolocation technology that New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks use to ensure that a person making an online casino or sports wager is physically located within the state’s boundaries.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Netflix has halted production of its Western film “The Harder They Fall” after at least two people on the set tested positive for the coronavirus while working in New Mexico. The production did not identify the people infected with the virus, and declined to comment beyond confirming that production stopped as of Thursday. It is unclear when production is expected to resume. Productions usually wait two weeks with no positive tests before resuming. The New Mexico Rapid Response report listed the positive test at Santa Fe Studios, the Albuquerque Journal reported. The New Mexico Environment Department, which publishes a daily list of entities in the state reporting newly confirmed coronavirus tests, reported that Netflix confirmed at least five positive test results between Oct. 8 and Oct. 19, with at least two of those reports listed as “THTF,” an acronym for the film, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. The production has been required to adhere to state safety guidelines, including facial masks and social distancing. The cast and crew was also subjected to multiple tests a week.\n\nNew York\n\nRamapo:After repeated complaints by the state and county, the Town of Ramapo and Village of Spring Valley have committed personnel to the COVID-19 cluster enforcement task force that’s patrolling Rockland County’s red zone. “We just had online training, Ramapo Town Supervisor Michael Specht said. He said six full-time code enforcement and parking enforcement workers are now dedicated to the task force, including at least one person who is fluent in Yiddish. Another five part-time town workers will be made available this week, Specht said, if the state needs them. Amid growing clusters of COVID-19 cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo launched enforcement zones, or red zones, with strict regulations – which closed schools and cut religious gatherings to just 10 people – designed to tamp down the spread of the virus. Downstate zones, including in Rockland County, mirror the footprint of large Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities. The 12.5-mile diameter zone in Rockland focuses on eastern Ramapo and portions of the Village of Spring Valley.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreenville: East Carolina University has announced temporary furloughs and pay cuts for its athletics staff because of budget deficits caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The salary reductions and furloughs for coaches and staff members at the university will start next month, Jon Gilbert, the university’s athletic director said in a statement Monday. They are based on salary, and will be effective through June 2021. The entire athletics staff was recently furloughed for five days to reduce the school’s deficit by $4.7 million, the statement said. The university estimated a $25 million budget shortfall this fall, The News & Observer reported.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nTown: Mayor Tim Mahoney said he would like to see a statewide mask mandate as the coronavirus spins out of control and in the meantime invoked emergency powers to require face coverings in most settings that don’t involve family members. Mahoney, who in addition to being Fargo’s mayor is also a general surgeon, has been largely supportive of Republican Gov. Doug Burgum’s approach to managing the pandemic. But he said up to one in four people being tested for the virus in his city in recent weeks has tested positive, and Mahoney said it “would be great” if Burgum issued an order for the entire state. Cass County, which includes Fargo, had more than 200 new cases Monday and has had nearly 8,000 since the pandemic began. It has been one of the hardest-hit spots in a state that has ranked worst in the nation for daily new cases per capita the past two weeks. North Dakota leads the nation in the number of new cases per capita in the last two weeks, a distinction it has held many times in the last couple of months, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of people hospitalized in the state because of the coronavirus hit a new high, the Ohio Department of Health reported. The agency said Monday that 1,154 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 related symptoms, with 158 on ventilators. That’s the highest hospitalization figure since July. Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Monday he was caught off-guard by the recent spike in cases and pleaded again for Ohioans to wear masks and keep themselves socially distanced. The Health Department reported 1,837 confirmed and probable cases on Monday, well above the 21-day case average of 1,515. The numbers reflect a recent and continuing spike in cases, including a record 2,178 cases reported on Oct. 15.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association is renewing the group’s call for a statewide mask mandate as the number of people hospitalized because of the coronavirus has reached record levels. OSMA President George Monks said in a tweet Sunday that cities in Oklahoma that have adopted mask ordinances have seen lower rates of infection. “We need face mask mandates to protect more of our Oklahoma citizens,” Monks tweeted. The association has been calling for a statewide mask mandate since the summer, but Gov. Kevin Stitt has repeatedly said he has no plans to do so, citing concerns about how such a mandate would be enforced.\n\nOregon\n\nAlbany: At least 19 students in Greater Albany Public Schools attended a gathering without masks, spurring new COVID-19 cases and setting back progress made toward holding in-person classes, officials said. At least three positive cases have been traced to a large gathering in a local home with students from West Albany High School, South Albany High School and Lebanon High School, the Albany Democrat-Herald reported. “In addition to the large gathering, a number of the same individuals have been together since then,” Schools Superintendent Melissa Goff said. “So we have an additional six students who should be quarantining right now.” The families of the students have been contacted by local health authorities but according to Goff, some families might not be cooperating with efforts to trace the potential outbreak. Before the latest positive cases, the school district was holding limited in-person instruction for students who receive special services while monitoring the increasing case load around the county. A total of 142 students at 14 district sites were receiving in-person instruction. Those services have been paused and all teachers and staff who are able to work from home have been asked to do so by the district.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg:The state’s COVID-19 quarantine list for out-of-state travelers has grown a bit larger over the past few weeks. But Georgia and Louisiana were removed from the travel advisory, meaning travelers coming from there will no longer be subject to a 14-day self-quarantine upon arrival in Pennsylvania. Ten states – Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming ––have been added to the quarantine list, pushing the total to 25 states. The recommendation for travelers coming into Pennsylvania marks a notable shift in which states are being flagged nationwide for the most alarming increases of coronavirus cases. The list of states is fluid though and will be updated regularly, according to the governor’s office. Essential workers – including truckers and others in transportation – are exempt.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A state facility that houses federal detainees has seen a recent surge in coronavirus cases, according to documents filed with a federal court. The Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls had 52 active cases among detainees, and eight among staff as of Monday, The Providence Journal reported. A spokesman said the facility anticipated additional cases and is prepared to respond appropriately. The center has had more than 150 cases total among detainees and staff.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg:Blood supplies are getting dangerously low because there haven’t been any blood drives during the coronavirus pandemic. Schools, churches and businesses usually hold blood drives during the year, but many haven’t returned to a normal working schedule and most outside activities have been canceled. In addition, blood banks have seen some people who are concerned about donating blood because of fears of becoming infected with COVID-19. All of these issues have forced The Blood Connection in Spartanburg to supply hospitals with only enough blood for immediate needs. Allie Van Dyke, The Blood Connection media coordinator, said during the early months of the pandemic, blood donations declined and the trend has continued. September is usually a time when college campuses host blood drives but those also didn’t happen because of the pandemic. And in addition to the lack of donations, she said some area hospitals are beginning to perform some elective surgeries again and that has depleted the blood supply even more. Spartanburg Medical Center is among the hospitals that receive donations from The Blood Connection. Hospital officials understand how low the blood supply is and are calling on donors for help.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state reported seven more deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday, along with an increase in hospitalizations by 25 people. October has been the deadliest month of the pandemic in the state, with the Department of Health reporting 107 deaths. A total of 330 South Dakotans have died from COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic. Gov. Kristi Noem has said her focus is on hospitalizations, offering assurances that the state’s hospitals are still capable of caring for people with severe cases of the virus. But hospitalizations have reached a new high at 329 people. Health officials reported that about 40% of general-care hospital beds and 33% of Intensive Care Units are available, along with staff to operate them.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: First-time voters in Tennessee won’t have to appear in person to vote while a court appeal proceeds, as the Oct. 27 deadline to request an absentee ballot approaches. In a 3-0 decision, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel on Monday declined the state’s request to reinstate the in-person requirement while the court mulls the case. The decision maintains a lower court’s order last month. The blocked law requires first-time voters to cast a ballot in person or show ID at the local election office before voting by mail, if they qualify. Instead, officials are requiring certain first-time voters to submit a copy of their ID during the absentee voting process. In Monday’s opinion, Judge Julia Smith Gibbons said “disrupting the new rules at this point poses significant risk of harm to the public interest in orderly elections.” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said the ruling, coupled with expanded eligibility, means “thousands of first-time voters should not be forced to risk their health in order to vote.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Schools in the state’s largest school district resumed in-person classes Monday for the first time since campuses doors were closed in March at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. About 80,000 of the school district’s 190,000 students were back on campuses, where they were required to wear masks and practice social distancing. Movement within campuses was also going to be limited during the school day and only essential visitors would be allowed inside, said Interim Superintendent Grenita Lathan. District officials have worked to put necessary safety protocols in place, purchased needed supplies, and relied on science and data to provide a safe environment and address any concerns teachers and others might have, Lathan said. The first six weeks of classes in the current school year for Houston school district students were held online. Those children who chose not to return to campuses on Monday will continue to attend classes virtually and will have a chance after every six-week grading period to change their minds.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The southwest Utah health district reported 92 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, a record for a single day, as the St. George area has joined a statewide spike in numbers at the beginning of the fall season. Local health officials have reported 430 new cases over the past seven days, also a record for any seven-day period since the pandemic began. As recently as mid-September, the region was counting fewer than 200 cases per week. The southwest district, which includes Washington, Iron, Kane, Beaver and Garfield counties, has now counted 424 total hospitalizations and 45 new deaths. Washington County, home to the St. George area, has seen the majority of the numbers, with 4,034 total cases and 38 deaths as of Thursday. The jump comes just as hospitals across Utah are warning that they could run out of beds, with Gov. Gary Herbert having just declared the state’s rapidly rising case numbers an “unsustainable” trend.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The outbreak of people infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 traced to a Montpelier hockey rink has expanded to 30, the Vermont Health Department said Monday. The cases are linked to adult and youth hockey leagues and an adult broomball league at the Central Vermont Memorial Civic Center. The Health Department is planning a pop-up testing clinic Thursday at the Barre Auditorium. Testing is for people who are not showing any symptoms of COVID-19, but had direct links to the teams and their close contacts. The Central Vermont Medical Center will also be holding special testing clinics from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. through Friday at its Acute Respiratory Clinic on the Barre-Montpelier Road.\n\nVirginia\n\nHopewell:A Hopewell City Public Schools employee has tested positive for COVID-19, the school division said Monday. The employee works in the division’s technology department. The individual works “across our schools” and was “on site” on Oct. 15. In a press release, the school division encouraged anyone who had contact with technology department staff between Oct. 12-15 to monitor their symptoms and reach out to a primary care provider if needed. Hopewell is one of two local school divisions, along with Petersburg, that has not opened schools to students for in-person learning, so it is unlikely a student was in contact with the individual. Hopewell is considered an area of “highest risk” for the spread of COVID-19 in schools, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Petersburg, Prince George and Dinwiddie counties are also considered “highest risk.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Republican state Rep. Tom Dent of Moses Lake is the second Washington lawmaker known to have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Yakima Herald-Republic reported Monday that Dent, who is up for reelection, talked about his diagnosis on NewsTalk-KIT Radio and said he has been recovering at home. “So far I think I’ve gone through every symptom anybody’s talked about,” he said. “And, you know, it’s crazy. It started out pretty benign in the beginning and then kind of started to go away and came back a little stronger. It’s played this game now, today will be day 15.” Lawmakers haven’t been at the Capitol since they adjourned in March. Any meetings have been held remotely, and it’s unknown what the 105-legislative session will look like when it convenes in January.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The federal government has authorized the West Virginia National Guard to increase the number of personnel on active status to support the response to the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Jim Justice said. There are 379 members of the state National Guard on active status. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will allow that to increase to 400. The federal government will reimburse the state for 75% of the related costs for these personnel, the governor’s office said. The National Guard’s state response has included producing and distributing personal protective equipment, performing virus tests, disinfecting vehicles and facilities, and virus prevention training for businesses, long-term care facilities, medical practices and residents, the statement said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Like Froedtert Hospital in Wauwatosa, Aurora St. Luke’s Medical Center on Milwaukee’s south side is investigating an outbreak of COVID-19 on an inpatient rehabilitation unit where patients go to recover from surgeries, strokes and other ailments. As of Monday, St. Luke’s was investigating at least 15 cases of COVID-19 among patients on the rehabilitation unit and tests were pending on staff members who were potentially affected. “We have taken the appropriate steps to isolate and care for these patients and have suspended new admissions to this unit at this time,” spokeswoman Cheri Mantz wrote in an email to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Mantz said the source of the outbreak had not been determined. St. Luke’s had not been routinely testing staff members for the virus or taking their temperatures before they showed up for work. Like Froedtert, they were relying on employees to self-report their temperatures and any symptoms via an app. It’s unknown the extent to which the hospital has been testing the patient population for the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: In the first week of October, Wyoming was averaging about 105 newly confirmed cases a day, officials said. That average is now above 162 new daily cases, outpacing any previous time period since March. Wyoming also reached a record on Friday for new confirmed cases in a day with 248. The state’s largest hospital, Wyoming Medical Center, opened its COVID-19 surge unit for the first time and activated its Code Orange Incident Command, which establishes special protocols and appoints a team to evaluate daily concerns and communicate them with the rest of the staff. The facility also stopped accepting nonemergent patients transferred from outside Natrona County, hospital interim CEO J.J. Bleicher said. Those patients are now being transferred out of state. “We expect this to continue for several weeks, based on COVID projections in our community,” hospital spokesperson Kristy Bleizeffer said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/02/09/hug-tent-stephen-king-valentines-dining-news-around-states/115453754/", "title": "Hug tent, Stephen King: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state has expanded who is eligible to receive immunizations against COVID-19, but health officials caution there’s still not enough vaccine for everyone who qualifies for a shot. As of Monday, everyone 65 and older, educators, grocery store workers, some manufacturing workers, public transit workers, agriculture employees, state legislators and constitutional officers is eligible to get vaccinated. Previously only health care workers, first responders, nursing home residents, and people 75 and older were eligible. “If you are eligible for a vaccine, then we will get you one if want to take it. But it is not going to happen immediately for everyone,” Dr. Scott Harris, the state health officer, told reporters Friday. Harris said an estimated 1.5 million people would be eligible for vaccines, but the state has been receiving only about 70,000 doses per week, and those not yet administered have been spoken for. The Alabama Department of Public Health site has a map of providers providing shots. The state is opening large, drive-thru clinics in Anniston, Birmingham, Dothan, Huntsville, Mobile, Montgomery, Selma and Tuscaloosa.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: More than 100,000 people in the state have received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine as of Friday. That figure includes over 41,000 people who have been vaccinated in Anchorage, which represents about 15% of the city’s population, Dr. Janet Johnston, an epidemiologist with the Anchorage Health Department, told KTUU-TV. More than 15,000 Anchorage residents have received a second vaccine dose, Johnston said. While case counts in the municipality have decreased steadily, officials said the number of hospitalizations has increased. There were 40 hospitalized coronavirus patients Tuesday, with only four staffed intensive care unit beds available in Anchorage, Johnston said. “This increase in hospitalizations reminds us that Anchorage serves as the health care hub for much of the state,” Johnston said. “With serious COVID-19 outbreaks in other parts of the state, including in the seafood industry, we are seeing more very sick COVID-19 patients in Anchorage hospitals.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will virtually tour the mass COVID-19 vaccination site set up at State Farm Stadium in Glendale. The White House and Gov. Doug Ducey’s office confirmed they will be remotely shown the around-the-clock facility Wednesday afternoon. The Republican governor has held up the stadium as a model for other states trying to establish large vaccination venues, though some Arizona residents have criticized the online system for trying to get an appointment there. Meanwhile, the Arizona Department of Health Services reported an additional 2,250 new coronavirus cases and seven more deaths Monday. The state has now seen 782,887 cases and 14,055 deaths since the pandemic began. The number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization is continuing to slide. Officials said 2,853 people with the virus are occupying 33% of hospital beds statewide, with 828 virus patients taking up 46% of intensive care beds. Arizona has been a national hot spot in the now-receding fall and winter surge. It was the U.S. state with the worst COVID-19 infection rate during much of January.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State health officials have reported 672 new cases of COVID-19 and another 15 deaths linked to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. There were 660 newly confirmed cases of the virus and 12 probable cases recorded Sunday, according to the Arkansas Department of Health. Officials said 11 new deaths were confirmed to be linked to COVID-19, and four more were probably caused by the disease. The new counts bring the state’s total tallies to 306,736 cases and 5,076 fatalities. Arkansas reported 16,324 active cases of the virus Sunday. The actual number is believed to be far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and some who get sick don’t show symptoms. The number of Arkansas residents hospitalized with COVID-19 stood at 781 Sunday, an increase of 31 from Saturday. Over the past week, more than 11% of coronavirus tests in Arkansas have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Some churches opened their doors to worshippers Sunday, after the state revised its guidelines for houses of prayer following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that lifted a ban on indoor services during the coronavirus pandemic. “This morning we declare that this house will be a house of freedom,” announced Pastor Brittany Koopman at Harvest Rock Church near Los Angeles, one of the churches that sued the state over the ban. She led a socially distanced indoor crowd in prayer before Sunday’s service, which was also streamed online. The U.S. justices said for now California can’t continue with a ban on indoor church services, but it can limit attendance to 25% of a building’s capacity and restrict singing and chanting inside. Che Ahn, Harvest Rock’s senior pastor, told his congregation the church would defy the ban on singing, which was instituted because the virus is more easily transmitted indoors, and singing releases tiny droplets that can carry it. “Fifty percent of worship is singing. We’re gonna sing no matter what,” Ahn said at the beginning of the service Sunday. Worshippers without masks could be seen on the livestream raising their arms and singing out loud. Ahn called the state rules “draconian” and urged his congregants to sign a petition to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nColorado\n\nLouisville: Lynda Hartman needed a hug. It had been at least eight months since she touched her husband, Len, 77, who has dementia and has been at an assisted living center in suburban Denver for the past year. On Wednesday, she got a small taste of what life was like before the coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to a “hug tent” set up outside Juniper Village at Louisville, Hartman got to squeeze her husband of nearly 55 years – albeit while wearing plastic sleeves and separated by 4 mil plastic sheeting. “I really needed it,” she said after her brief visit. “It meant a lot to me, and it’s been a long, long time.” Hartman, 75, who fractured two vertebrae and could no longer take care of her husband by herself, said she thought he was a little confused, but it was important for them to embrace again. “It felt good,” she said. “I kept hitting his glasses when I hugged him, though. And he got cold.” The assisted living facility, which has fully vaccinated its residents and staff, partnered with nonprofit health care organization TRU Community Care to set up the tent with construction-grade plastic last week. “I think it’s just a huge weight off their shoulders, just being able to have that hug that they haven’t had in so long,” said Anna Hostetter, a spokeswoman for Juniper Village at Louisville. The hug tent will go up again Tuesday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Legislators were urged Monday to pass a bill that would allow certified medical assistants to perform vaccinations, with the Connecticut Hospital Association noting the “difficult undertaking of vaccinating every resident of the state” with the COVID-19 vaccine without more trained staff. But the concept is receiving some pushback, especially from nurses, who question whether certified medical assistants are properly trained for the task and receive adequate oversight. “Certified medical assistants are a valuable part of the health care team; however, the administration of a medication requires more than technical skill of inserting a needle,” said John Brady, a registered nurse and vice president of the union AFT Connecticut, during a public hearing held by the General Assembly’s Public Health Committee. Brady noted that training for a certified medical assistant can vary greatly, from a high school diploma and one year of experience in a doctor’s office to an associate degree. Also, he said those certifications are not issued by the state and cannot be revoked, unlike state-licensed medical professionals such as doctors and nurses.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Poultry workers are now prioritized as essential employees under the state’s Phase 1B of vaccine distribution. Leaders in the industry and state are now faced with the next step of getting shots into workers arms. But it won’t be an easy task. There’s a vaccine shortage and language barriers to contend with because many of the workers are part of Delaware’s Latino and Haitian immigrant communities. Representatives from two companies, Mountaire and Perdue, said they are deep into multilingual educational campaigns to spread awareness about the importance of the vaccine. The campaigns include signs around the workplace dispelling vaccine myths and letters mailed to employees’ homes. Both companies have wellness centers at the poultry plants. They will ultimately become the headquarters for vaccine distribution.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: New findings from a study on COVID-19 and crime revealed an unprecedented spike in homicides last year, WUSA-TV reports. Researchers with the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice found homicide rates were 30% higher nationally in 2020 compared to 2019. The organization looked at crime data in 34 cities including Washington, D.C. Overall, it found property crimes are down, but more people were killed. Researchers said the decline in property crimes seems clearly connected to restrictions imposed during the pandemic that kept more people at home. According to D.C. Police data, the district saw a 19% increase in homicides between 2019 and 2020 and a slight increase in assaults with a dangerous weapon. Researchers said there may have been many contributing factors to the homicide spike, including the pandemic’s impact on policing. “Many have social distancing requirements by their agencies or their own discretion to maintain distance between themselves and people on the street. That reduces the kind of face-to-face interaction that can help to reduce crime,” said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist and one of the study’s authors.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: So much for the mayor’s order requiring masks at Super Bowl parties. Throngs of mostly maskless fans took to the streets and packed sports bars as the clock inside Raymond James Stadium ticked down on a hometown Super Bowl win for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “It is a little frustrating because we have worked so hard,” Mayor Jane Castor said Monday morning. To meet coronavirus protocols, the NFL capped the crowd at under 25,000 in a stadium that normally holds some 66,000 fans, and it required masks. But outside the stadium, crowds of fans celebrated the Buccaneers’ win Sunday night. Folks cheered, swarmed streets, crammed into bars and hugged in several hot spots around the city – all without masks. An executive order last year by Gov. Ron DeSantis makes it difficult for local governments to enforce mask policies because it prohibits them from fining people who don’t comply. Across Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg, Mayor Rick Kriseman was already unhappy about a maskless party hosted by Rapper Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson in a hangar at Albert Whitted Airport on Friday night. “This isn’t how we should be celebrating the Super Bowl,” he tweeted Saturday. “It’s not safe or smart. It’s stupid. We’re going to take a very close look at this, and it may end up costing someone a lot more than 50 cent.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Movie cameras are rolling again in the state’s oldest city. Crews began shooting a Korean War-era film titled “Devotion” during the past week in Savannah, ending a months­long drought of film productions since the coronavirus pandemic emerged last year. Production company Black Label Media plans to spend 12 weeks shooting in the Savannah area, and streets in the downtown historic district have been closed on select days to accommodate filming, WJCL-TV reports. The company said in a statement that it expects to administer 10,000 virus tests for crew and extras during filming and take other protective measures. Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said he welcomes the economic boost the production is expected to bring as long as the crew works safely. “Obviously, if filming is picking up, that helps our local businesses,” Johnson said. “If it’s helping our local businesses, it’s helping our local economy.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Commercial landlords would be prohibited from evicting tenants under a bill that state lawmakers are considering to help businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. The proposed legislation would prohibit landlords from attempting to collect back rent from businesses for 12 months after the expiration of a final pandemic emergency proclamation, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The bill passed the Senate Committee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and Health last week. Tenants would be able to terminate leases without penalty if negotiations with landlords to amend contract terms are unsuccessful. Tenants could also sue landlords who violate prohibitions in the bill for actual damages, seeking $2,000 for each violation and attorneys’ fees. Data from the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization show there are a third fewer businesses open in Hawaii now than there were before the pandemic. It is unclear how many closed permanently. The bill has received support from small-business owners who told legislators in testimony about the struggles they have faced to continue operating. It’s opposed by landlords.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers on Monday introduced legislation to make permanent changes to the counting of absentee ballots used in the last general election and spurred by the pandemic. The Senate State Affairs Committee voted to clear the way for a public hearing for the bill intended to make absentee vote counting faster. During an August special session called due to the pandemic, lawmakers approved a law allowing the opening and scanning of ballots beginning seven days before Election Day. Election officials anticipated a huge surge in absentee ballots as voters feared going to polls due to the pandemic. The November election arrived as coronavirus cases surged in the state. Officials encouraged absentee and early voting, and about 500,000 of Idaho’s 1 million registered voters used those two options. In all, a record-breaking 880,000 ballots were cast. Election officials said the new law allowing ballots to be opened and scanned – but not tallied – allowed county clerks to quickly report the election results. But that law expired Dec. 31. Ada County Clerk Phil McGrane said the bill introduced Monday is “effectively just striking that deadline.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot touted a preliminary agreement with the city’s teachers union over COVID-19 safety protocols Sunday, potentially averting a strike in the nation’s third-largest school district. Some students could return to classrooms as soon as Thursday, with the reopening of school phased in by grade. Also, the city agreed to vaccinate 1,500 teachers and staff weekly at vaccination sites dedicated to Chicago Public Schools. The possible deal – which still requires approval from the Chicago Teachers Union – also includes metrics that would trigger school closings when cases spike. The union and district have been fighting for months over a plan to gradually reopen the roughly 340,000-student district, with talks breaking down in recent days on issues including vaccinations. Lightfoot and CPS officials had threatened to lock educators out of teaching systems multiple times, which the union said would lead to a strike for the second time in less than two years. By Sunday, the first-term mayor, who had been visibly agitated at recent news conferences, was smiling. “This agreement was about making sure everyone in our school communities just aren’t safe but also that they feel safe,” Lightfoot said. While she called it a “tentative agreement,” the union characterized it as an offer that required further review.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: Two tigers at the Fort Wayne Children’s Zoo have tested positive for the coronavirus, zoo officials have announced. Officials said animal care staff on Feb. 1 first saw mild symptoms consistent with the virus that causes COVID-19 in one Sumatran tiger. Fecal samples for the tigers, Bugara and Indah, were collected for testing and came back positive with the virus. Staff veterinarian Dr. Kami Fox said the male tiger has been experiencing a dry cough, while the female has not shown symptoms. “Both tigers are being watched for any additional clinical signs and remain together in their enclosure,” zoo officials said in a statement issued Saturday. The source of infection is not yet known, and zoo staff are working with the Allen County Department of Health and the State Board of Animal Health to identify potential sources, according to officials. Access to the tigers has been restricted, and staff will follow safety protocols recommended by the CDC and Indiana Department of Health.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Although demand for the COVID-19 vaccine continues to far outstrip the supply, not everyone who is eligible for the coveted shot is eager to take it. About 40% of Des Moines police officers have not indicated they want the vaccine, spokesperson Sgt. Paul Parizek said in an email last week. About half of the state’s prison workers plan to refuse it, according to a report by the Iowa Department of Corrections director. A national survey of nursing home staff showed less than 40% took a first dose of vaccine when offered; the estimate for Iowa workers taking it is 40% to 59%. “I’m more disappointed than surprised,” Iowa Public Health Association executive director Lina Tucker Reinders said of people hesitant to take the vaccine. “Every decline in the vaccine is another potential case of COVID.” She said the politicization of the vaccine, some of its branding and the U.S. history of experimenting on communities of color may all have a role in pushing down vaccination rates. She cited doubt sown around the pandemic, particularly leading up to the November election, and continuing conspiracy theories around the efficacy of this and other vaccines.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has unveiled an economic development plan that aims to provide a blueprint for the state’s future as it looks to the new normal after the COVID-19 pandemic. Dubbed the Kansas Framework for Growth, the plan was lauded as the first of its kind in more than 30 years. It was showcased Thursday in a virtual announcement joined by two of the state’s former governors, Democrat John Carlin and Republican Mike Hayden. Work on drafting the plan began in late 2019, but the new challenges brought on by the pandemic created an urgent need to rethink an approach with the flexibility to respond to ever-changing economic conditions, its supporters said. Kelly called it a “bold plan” to address current and future challenges, saying it takes a long-range view of the headwinds facing Kansas and lays out a set strategy and initiatives to guide state level economic development for decades to come. “This strategic plan takes a forward-thinking, nimble approach to encouraging economic growth and prosperity, particularly when it comes to recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic,” Kelly said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Less than half of staff members at long-term care facilities in the state have been vaccinated for COVID-19, in part because many refused vaccination, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. Now some of those people are changing their minds, leading to complications in the vaccine distribution. Doses first became available for long-term care facility staff and residents two months ago. Since then an estimated 73% of residents have received the vaccine but only about 45% of staff. “It was what I would call a soft, not a hard, no,” Gov. Andy Beshear said. “It wasn’t that they didn’t want to take it; it’s that they felt that maybe it had been rushed, they had concerns about its efficacy, and as they saw other people getting it, they now want it.” CVS Health and Walgreens were contracted by the federal government to provide only three vaccine clinics at long-term care facilities. The third, underway now, was meant as a wrap-up to offer second doses to any stragglers. Both pharmacies initially refused to dole out first doses at their final clinic but have now been instructed to provide a first dose to staff members and residents as long as the facility has a plan for how those people will get a second dose.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state is seeing the ranks of its home-schooled students grow larger during the coronavirus pandemic. The number of home-schooled students was 33,001 in October, the latest data available from the state, a 4% increase over the previous year and a 10% hike for home-schooled students who hope to qualify for college scholarships. “There are so many who have pulled their kids out of school because of COVID,” said Christopher Chin, president of Homeschool Louisiana, a networking group for parents and students. The number of students taught at home has grown by 23% in the past five years and 76% in the past decade, according to a report from The Advocate. Home-schooled students make up 5% of the state’s total student population. Chin said some families have opted for home schooling because of what he called the lack of planning by school officials and the pitfalls of distance learning. “They are realizing that home school is a viable education alternative,” said Chin, whose groups includes about 1,200 families statewide. Louisiana has two forms of home schooling, both of which requires families to sign up with the state Department of Education and to renew annually.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: A group of budding young writers is about to publish a pandemic-inspired book with some help from the Pine Tree State’s most famous writer. Stephen King’s foundation covered the $6,500 cost of publishing a 290-page manuscript by students participating in Farwell Elementary School’s Author Studies Program. The students started with “Fletcher McKenzie and the Passage to Whole,” a story about a Maine boy by Gary Savage, and then reworked it to reflect their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Farwell Principal Amanda Winslow said she is proud of the students for their accomplishment and thankful for the dedication of Savage, who advised the students, and librarian Kathy Martin. A number of local groups also sent donations that will be used for the Author Studies program.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Three Orthodox Jewish day schools in Baltimore County have reported large numbers of coronavirus cases in the past two months. The Baltimore Sun reports the outbreaks prompted one middle school to shut down and move to virtual learning for a week. The outbreaks are far larger than others seen in public or private schools since the state’s mandatory reporting requirements began in October. County health officials said they have been working with the schools but declined to detail what measures have been taken at each to contain the outbreaks, which began shortly after Thanksgiving. The Talmudical Academy of Baltimore, a century-old K-12 school in Pikesville, had 62 cases inside the school Feb. 3, according to Maryland’s COVID-19 school dashboard. That number was by far the most cases reported in a single school since October. The school will be closed for two weeks, including one week of virtual instruction and a week of vacation. The next highest number of cases was 45 at Bais Yaakov Eva Winer High School, a girls’ school with about 425 students. The Torah Institute in Owings Mills had 26 cases as of Jan. 27.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The University of Massachusetts Amherst is moving all classes online and requiring students to stay in their residences for at least two weeks in response to a surge in new coronavirus cases. The university raised its COVID-19 risk level to “high” after nearly 300 students tested positive for the virus over a three-day period last week, Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy said in a statement. Students who live both on campus and off are required to stay at home except for coronavirus testing, meals and medical reasons, the school said. “Failure to comply will result in disciplinary action, which may include removal from residence halls and/or suspension,” the school said. The school has also suspended all varsity sports games and practices for two weeks. “Let this moment be a stark reminder to any of you who may have been cavalier about COVID-19 that your individual behavior has a profound impact on everyone in your community,” Subbaswamy said. The restrictions will only be lifted when public health conditions improve substantially, the school said.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: High schools are anticipating a shortage of men and women who blow the whistle as basketball returns to Michigan gyms after a timeout for the coronavirus. Registration of referees is down 25% from a year ago, and the risk of COVID-19 is a “contributing factor,” said Geoff Kimmerly, a spokesman at the Michigan High School Athletic Association. “It is a concern even in non-COVID years, and we expect it to be more of a concern over these next two months,” Kimmerly told MLive.com. High school basketball typically starts in December, but the state delayed it because of the pandemic. The regular season now will last six weeks followed by the state tournament. Kimmerly said middle school coaches are being encouraged to register as officials. Some schools will likely schedule two games a day, which would allow refs to work both games. Dave Feenstra, head of the Ottawa-Kent Conference, which has dozens of schools in western Michigan, said his region will feel the pinch. He’s asking college students to pitch in and call middle school games. “With some of our guys working three nights a week, it’s going to be fast and furious with the season,” Feenstra said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Republican legislators laid out a roadmap Monday for lifting the state’s coronavirus restrictions on businesses with a goal of letting them return to full operations by May 1. Rep. Dave Baker, of Willmar, said at a news conference that businesses such as restaurants, hotels, event centers and gyms need to be able to make reopening plans with some certainty. He said the downward trends in COVID-19 cases and other key metrics, plus rising vaccination rates, mean businesses can operate safely with the proper precautions in place. Liz Rammer, CEO of Hospitality Minnesota, said no sector of the economy has been more devastated by the pandemic than the hospitality industry. She said the bill that Republicans plan to introduce this week is a reasonable and balanced approach. Baker said he’s ready to compromise on the details. He said he knows the bill won’t go anywhere without at least some Democratic support. But he said he wants to change the approach to reopening businesses from a series of executive orders coming down from Democratic Gov. Tim Walz to a broader dialogue with all sides involved.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: As some Mississippians struggle to get COVID-19 vaccination appointments, reports have surfaced of a small but growing number of out-of-state residents crossing state lines to get shots. According to data from the Mississippi State Department of Health, approximately 5,337 people with out-of-state addresses had received shots as of Wednesday. Because of the state’s lax eligibility determinations, some people have even created groups on social media that tell Louisiana residents how to get Mississippi vaccination appointments. Some state officials have attributed the rush to how smoothly Mississippi’s processes are running. Mark Davis, director of emergency medical services in DeSoto County, said some people from the Memphis, Tennessee, area have come to a state-run vaccination drive-thru in Southaven to get their shots. Davis said he’s heard reports that Tennesseans have sometimes had to wait more than seven hours to get a shot in Shelby County, whereas it only takes 30 minutes at most at the DeSoto County drive-thru. “The Mississippi National Guard has done a phenomenal job here ... but they’ve almost done too good of a job,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Inmates who set fires and broke windows at a jail over the weekend did so to protest inhumane conditions, including a lack of personal protective equipment to combat the spread of the coronavirus, according to inmate advocates. The uprising Saturday at the City Justice Center was “an act of courage” that was necessitated by inmates’ basic needs not being met, Tracy Stanton of Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing St. Louis said during a virtual rally Sunday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. “They are demanding proper heat, they want proper (personal protective equipment), proper clothing and visits from families, who can visit them from the other side of the glass,” Stanton said. More than 100 inmates broke out of their cells Saturday, leading to chaos on the facility’s fourth floor. A corrections officer was attacked and hospitalized but is expected to recover. It was the third uprising at the jail since December. Among the concerns is protection against COVID-19. City officials say that there are no cases among the general population and that inmates are provided with adequate PPE and tested upon request. But activist Inez Bordeaux, of the legal aid group Arch City Defenders, said she’s heard from dozens of detainees who say they don’t have access to testing or PPE.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: GOP state Rep. Brian Putnam has tested positive for the coronavirus, the Montana House Republican caucus said. Putnam felt mildly symptomatic Thursday night, was tested Friday and received his positive test result Sunday. He notified leadership of his results and authorized the release of his name. Putnam participated in the Legislature remotely Friday and will continue to do so. He is a member of the House State Administration and Natural Resources committees. His closest contacts have been notified, and contact tracing is ongoing, House leaders said. Putnam is the third Montana lawmaker to report having tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 during the 2021 session. Rep. David Bedey, R-Hamilton, tested positive Jan. 7, and Rep. Fiona Nave, R-Columbus, announced a positive test four days later. Nave had been participating in the session remotely.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of people getting vaccinated against COVID-19 in the state increased nearly 5% last week. State officials said 48,982 doses of the vaccines were administered last week, up from 46,806 doses the week before. The state is working to speed up distribution of vaccines. So far, about 4.6% of the state’s population has received both required doses of a vaccine. Nebraska said Monday that it has administered 232,896 doses. Across the state, local health departments have begun vaccinating people 65 and older and some essential workers in the second phase of the campaign. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska fell over the past two weeks from 849.14 new cases per day Jan. 24 to 429.86 new cases per day Sunday. The state said 193,826 virus cases and 1,968 deaths have been reported in Nebraska since the pandemic began. The number of people hospitalized with the virus in the state declined again Sunday to 250 from the previous day’s 272. That number hasn’t been that low since early October. It has fallen steadily since peaking at 987 in November.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The governor blamed a failure by those in leadership positions for incidents in which people jump the COVID-19 vaccine line ahead of front-line workers and seniors. “We are seeing rumors and substantiated examples where people are getting access to the vaccine who are not yet eligible,” Gov. Steve Sisolak said Friday. “It is not fair, and that must stop.” The problem has exacerbated an already insufficient supply of doses. “Every time a group is allowed to be vaccinated who is not eligible, those doses are taken away from someone’s grandma or grandpa or front-line worker who has been showing up every day throughout this pandemic,” Sisolak said. While clinic organizers have leeway to provide leftover doses to non-priority recipients to avoid wasting vaccine, there have also been cases in which some hospitals and clinics interpreted Nevada’s COVID-19 playbook to broadly include people such as board members as well as some local judges. “Individuals who have been able to work from home should not be accessing the vaccine before front-line workers or senior citizens,” Sisolak said. “It’s simple.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state would be prohibited from mandating vaccines and its vaccine registry would switch from an opt-out to an opt-in system under two bills before a House committee Monday. The House Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs Committee held public hearings on two bills sponsored by Rep. Tim Lang, R-Sanbornton. One would declare an “inalienable right to bodily integrity, free from any threat or compulsion that the person accepts any medical intervention, including immunization.” Lang said he objects to state rules requiring foster parents to be vaccinated against certain diseases. Opponents took issue with a section of the bill that says no person may be discriminated against for refusing a vaccine, noting that hospitals require employees to be vaccinated against the flu and that the state requires certain vaccines for schoolchildren, although there are religious and medical exemptions. Multiple physicians spoke against the bill, while supporters included several people who said they moved to New Hampshire in search of “medical freedom” after New York ended its religious exemption for vaccines.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state surpassed 1 million COVID-19 vaccinations administered Monday, Gov. Phil Murphy said. While it marks a milestone, the Democratic governor said the state is short of the number of vaccines it would need to meet demand. New Jersey has administered just over 224,000 second doses, covering about 2.5% of the population. That lags the rate of the country overall, which stands at 2.8%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Murphy has said he wants to complete administration of 70% of the state’s adult population within six months. It’s unclear whether the state will reach that goal, though. The pace of vaccinations has picked up since it began in mid-December. The state took nearly 40 days to reach 500,000 vaccinations but just 16 days to go from 500,000 doses to 1 million. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in New Jersey fell over the past two weeks from nearly 5,084 new cases a day Jan. 24 to about 3,620 on Sunday. Murphy reported 25 new deaths from the virus overnight, putting the overall toll at 19,824.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A new study by a New Mexico State University researcher found that depression and anxiety rates have more than doubled among adults amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The study, published in the Journal of Public Health, represents a comprehensive national assessment of the prevalence of depression and anxiety in the adult population. Jagdish Khubchandani, public health sciences professor in the College of Health and Social Services at NMSU and the study’s lead author, conducted the research in collaboration with faculty members from Ball State University, the University of Florida and the University of Houston. “While a few studies estimated mental health of Americans early in the pandemic, we conducted our study last summer to estimate the true impact of sustained, long-term lockdowns, isolation and excessive use of technology,” he said. “The nature and extent of loneliness and screen-time use, along with the constant news cycle, could have a detrimental impact on the mental health of Americans.” The study found the rates of depression (39%), anxiety (42%) and psychological distress (39%) were more than double the rates from before the pandemic. Psychological distress includes symptoms of both depression and anxiety.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that indoor restaurant dining can reopen in New York City at 25% capacity Friday, two days before the Valentine’s Day opening he had announced earlier. Cuomo said restaurateurs had asked for the ban on indoor dining to be lifted in advance of Valentine’s Day in order to give them a chance to prepare for the day when romantic dinners are traditional. Indoor restaurant service in the city has been prohibited since Dec. 14, when COVID-19 cases started surging. The gradual loosening of restrictions comes as the post-holiday-season spike in cases appears to be ebbing. Restaurant industry representatives praised Cuomo’s decision to reopen restaurant dining rooms a little sooner. “On behalf of all restaurants in New York City, we’re thankful that Gov. Cuomo has heard our plea to allow restaurants to open for the full Valentine’s Day weekend,” said Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association. Randy Peers, president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, said Brooklyn restaurants “are surviving by a thread.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: Faculty at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill can teach remotely until Feb. 17 in light of the crowded and largely maskless celebration of the men’s basketball team’s victory over Duke University on Saturday, officials said. Hundreds of students rushed Franklin Street in downtown Chapel Hill to celebrate the 91-87 victory in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and as variants of the virus spread across the country. UNC Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz and Provost Robert Blouin wrote in a message Sunday that students found to have violated the school’s COVID-19 Community Standards face disciplinary action. The university said it has already received hundreds of student conduct complaints related to the celebrations, news outlets report. Meanwhile, the school is following through with plans to make the transition to in-person classes, which were scheduled to begin Monday. UNC has 31% of undergraduate students taking one or two classes in person, according to the message, and class sizes are small, with students physically distanced. Students taking in-person classes will be tested twice a week, the message said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Legislature has held its regular sessions every other year since statehood, but backers of a bipartisan bill say it’s time to change that. Lawmakers for decades have consistently rebuffed attempts to hold annual regular sessions, arguing that doing so would grow government and turn lawmaking into a full-time job. But advocates for the bill say they need to meet more often due to bigger budgets and pressing issues such as the coronavirus pandemic that hit during an off-year in the Legislature. “Times have changed,” said Republican Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, the bill’s primary sponsor and a Williston dentist. “If mistakes are made in legislation that require correction, we live with that mistake or suffer its consequences for as much as 20 months before the next biennium.” The Senate Government and Veterans Affairs Committee is holding hearing on the legislation Thursday. Normally, the Legislature begins its session in January of odd-numbered years. Bekkedahl’s bill would direct lawmakers to meet in even-numbered years as well, for a period of time chosen by legislative leaders. North Dakota is one of four states where the Legislature still meets every other year.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Pharmacy giant CVS was not allowing Ohioans ages 65 to 69 to make COVID-19 vaccination appointments Monday despite the state making the age group eligible for shots beginning this week. Inoculation hopefuls who entered an age of less than 70 on the pharmacy’s vaccination website were erroneously informed they were not eligible for vaccinations. Another major vaccine provider, Walgreens, had also stated on its website that shots only were available to Ohioans age 70 and older. A Walgreens spokeswoman said the information was changed before 7 a.m. After the Columbus Dispatch flagged the situation to the attention of Ohio Department of Health officials Monday morning, the state contacted CVS. “We talked to CVS, and the issue is getting fixed,” health department spokeswoman Melanie Amato said. In a statement Monday evening, a CVS Health spokesman said its scheduling website would be updated by Tuesday. Vaccinations were restricted to Ohioans age 70 and older prior to Monday. Ohio does not have a single, statewide portal for seeking vaccinations against COVID-19, but Gov. Mike DeWine has said one is under development that he hopes will be up and running by Sunday.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials reported a dramatic decline in the number of COVID-19 deaths Monday after a deadly weekend in which more than 100 deaths were added to the toll. The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported four new deaths and 1,040 confirmed new cases of the coronavirus. The numbers are a steep drop from the near-record 51 deaths reported Saturday and 52 reported Sunday. The state’s death count from COVID-19 now stands at 3,817, and the total number of confirmed cases is nearly 405,000. Oklahoma’s seven-day rolling averages of positivity rate, daily new cases and daily deaths have all declined over the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in Oklahoma declined from 41.71 deaths per day Jan. 24 to 38 deaths per day Sunday, the data shows. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Oklahoma also is continuing to decline from record-high levels in late December and early January, according to health department data.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Thousands of long-term care facility residents, who have been eligible from the start, are wondering where their COVID-19 vaccines are. Oregon officials say they misunderstood which facilities were included in a federal program meant to vaccinate long-term care residents through on-site pharmacy visits. It initially applied to 130 skilled nursing facilities in the state but not to memory care, assisted living, independent living or adult foster homes. “There were hundreds of facilities around the state we thought were eligible that signed up and at the last minute were disenrolled,” Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen told legislators last month. Dianna Kent’s 94-year-old mother lives at Churchill Estates in Eugene, whose 170 residents don’t know when they’ll get shots. “Along with the staff, we have been calling the county, OHA – I even went to county offices to find out why we have not even been scheduled for vaccines yet,” Kent said. “I feel like we fell through the cracks.” The state is now working with Safeway and another pharmacy chain to do mobile vaccination clinics to reach those residents, Allen said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A mediator will decide if teachers must return to their classrooms despite safety concerns as the city’s school district plans to resume some in-person instruction later this month. Teachers and staff protesting outside their buildings Monday said they feared the ventilation systems in aging schools were not sufficient to address the potential spread of the coronavirus. “We do want to come back, but we want to come back safely. That’s all we’re asking for,” said Elanda Tolliver, a paraprofessional at Samuel Gompers Elementary School who has worked for the district for 34 years. Superintendent William Hite wants to offer students who have been learning remotely for nearly a year a chance to return to school Feb. 22 under an optional hybrid instruction model. He said the district has enhanced its cleaning operations and identified ventilation problems, and it will not open classrooms until needed improvements are made. City Council member Katherine Gilmore Richardson, who attended Gompers and has a child in kindergarten there, joined teachers and union officials protesting outside the school Monday. She expressed concerns about the ventilation system and lack of a comprehensive vaccine plan for school employees.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Some CVS and Walgreens pharmacy locations started COVID-19 vaccine distribution over the weekend, but there were some glitches. Customers in Rhode Island reported issues Sunday during the online registration process, WJAR-TV reports. Some CVS customers said they were prompted to book appointments out of state, even though they’re only eligible for vaccines in Rhode Island. CVS said it was working to fix the issue. For now, only CVS locations in Providence and Johnston are vaccinating eligible Rhode Islanders. Walgreens said it also resolved glitches in its registration system. Meanwhile, people visiting Rhode Island from New York, Indiana and Wisconsin are no longer subject to the state’s COVID-19 travel restrictions. The state on Monday updated its travel advisory list to remove those three states, meaning visitors or Rhode Islanders returning from those states no longer have to quarantine or provide a negative coronavirus test upon arrival, WPRI-TV reports. The list now consists of 30 states, with New Hampshire being the only New England state remaining.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The city wrote nearly 50 tickets to people who weren’t wearing masks on city sidewalks on Super Bowl Sunday. Charleston’s emergency mask ordinance requires people to wear masks outside at all times with a few exceptions, including socially distant exercise. Police officers and officers from Charleston’s Tourism and Livability department combined to patrol bars and restaurants and issued at least 47 tickets. The tickets are $100 for a first offense and get more expensive with each additional violation. A few weeks ago, Columbia did its own mask crackdown in one of the city’s bar and restaurant areas popular with college students. On Jan. 22-23, the city issued more than 110 mask tickets, officials said. A different crackdown in November in the same area around Five Points saw more than 100 tickets issued. Columbia’s emergency mask ordinance also has a $100 initial fine.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Lawmakers were attempting to contain the spread of the coronavirus Monday after the first reported case in the Legislature this session. Legislators were informed by email Sunday that Republican Rep. Aaron Aylward had tested positive over the weekend. House Speaker Spencer Gosch said a number of lawmakers were staying away from the Capitol while they awaited the results of testing. Gosch declined to confirm Aylward had tested positive but said the member who was confirmed to have COVID-19 had minor symptoms. The Legislature will hit the halfway mark of its nine-week session this week. Gosch said the session was progressing “well” so far, and legislative leaders had worked to act on bills quickly in anticipation that an outbreak could create a disruption. The House is encouraging lawmakers and the public to wear masks, but that recommendation often goes unheeded. On the Senate side of the Capitol, masks are required for the public and expected for senators. While the state saw one of the nation’s worst virus waves late last year, cases have continued to drop through January and February.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Hospitals will begin to schedule appointments for and vaccinate teachers and child care workers this week, city and school leaders announced Monday. Mayor John Cooper and Dr. Alex Jahangir, the city’s COVID-19 taskforce chair, joined Metro Nashville Public Schools Director Adrienne Battle at a news conference Monday afternoon to announce that the city will move to Phase 1B of its vaccine distribution plan. The news came a day before Metro Nashville Public Schools students in pre-K through fourth grade and students with special needs are set to return for in-person learning Tuesday. In recent weeks, Nashville teachers have traveled to other counties across the state to get the COVID-19 vaccine before returning to schools in person. MNPS teachers can expect to begin receiving their first doses through the city by Feb. 20. “Dr. Battle has taken some important steps to get our schools open for in-person learning, now we must do what we can to keep them open by protecting our educators from contracting COVID,” Jahangir said in a statement Monday. The city expects to receive 11,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine this week – an unexpected but welcome increase from previous weeks, he said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state will likely partner with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to open two vaccination “super sites” in Dallas and Houston, and more could be on the way, Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday. Abbott tweeted those vaccine locations would be open every day and operate for eight weeks, handling up to 6,000 shots per day. The governor said adding more sites is possible, but his office did not immediately release further details, including whether that meant Texas would get more vaccine doses or if those sites would pull vaccine from other areas. The Texas news comes a week after California partnered with FEMA to open two mass vaccination centers under President Joe Biden’s push to create 100 such sites nationwide in 100 days. According to state health officials, nearly 2.5 million Texans have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, and nearly 780,000 are fully vaccinated. As of Sunday, Texas had 9,652 COVID-19 patients in hospitals and a death toll of 38,643.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Washington County School District is adding more staff members at high school basketball games after the district found violations of the COVID-19-related attendance policy. According to WCSD Director of Communications Steve Dunham, the current policy gives each game an attendance limit of 25% capacity. Violations of this policy have been under investigation by the school district the past week, with both students and adults in violation. “After looking into it, it appears that at halftime, when they are done taking tickets, students are sneaking around to different doors and letting other students and adults into the game,” Dunham said in an email. “We are working to put additional staff in place to keep us in compliance with the Health department orders.” Dunham also said any offending schools would be kept confidential as the district sorts out the matter. The measures come after multiple games featured stands where attendance was visibly over the 25% threshold. There were so many spectators that fans were shoulder-to-shoulder from one end of the stands to the other. This wasn’t the instance at all games but was enough to get the district’s attention.\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: The state Department of Health has set up a pop-up clinic in the city to vaccinate refugees and immigrants 75 and up. On Saturday, 50 new Americans received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, WCAX-TV reports. It was the second clinic held for these populations. The Health Department has been working with the University of Vermont Medical School, the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, and other organizations to provide information about the vaccine to these Vermonters in their native language. “For people who are 75 and older and have language limitations, you can imagine those barriers are even greater, so we really want to make sure we are breaking down those barriers,” Heather Danis, director of Burlington’s Health Department office, told WCAX-TV. “It’s a safe, effective vaccine, and we want to make sure everyone has that informed choice, so they can make the decision that’s best for them.” The past summer, an outbreak of the coronavirus hit tightly knit immigrant communities in Winooski and spread to Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Church leaders are partnering with local health districts to get COVID-19 vaccines to the most vulnerable people in their communities. Second Baptist Church, in South Richmond, and First African Church, in North Richmond, were both vaccination sites Saturday. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the churches’ efforts are part of an attempt to find new strategies to reach segments of the community that may not have access to information or to transportation to get vaccinated. About 500 people were set to be vaccinated at these smaller event at sites in the Richmond and Henrico health districts. They’ll all be invited back for a second shot in a few weeks. “We’re really trying different strategies to be intentional with communities of color… and engaging preexisting networks (that are) best positioned to reach out to their most vulnerable,” said Amy Popovich, a nurse manager. Second Baptist Church pastor Ralph Steven Hodge said this new partnership is one way of not just targeting people who haven’t had access but also reaching out to some who may be skeptical about getting vaccinated. “When your pastor calls and tells you to come … we’re credible messengers,” he said.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A bill that increases the minimum weekly benefit for unemployed workers during the coronavirus pandemic and prevents a dramatic increase in unemployment taxes paid by businesses was signed into law Monday by Gov. Jay Inslee. The measure will prevent $1.7 billion in automatic unemployment insurance tax increases from taking effect through 2025, including $920 million this year due to last year’s pandemic-induced layoffs. The bill also boosts the minimum weekly unemployment benefit for workers who make between $21,000 and $27,800 per year, from $201 to $270 per week, starting in July. It allows high-risk workers who cannot work from home to voluntarily quit and still receive benefits and will waive charges for an employer who reduces operations or shuts down due to an infectious public health emergency. The measure is the first bill signed into law by Inslee this legislative session and has an emergency clause, which means it takes effect immediately. On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to vote on a bill passed by the House last week that allocates $2.2 billion in federal COVID-19 relief funding.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Newly confirmed coronavirus cases in the state sharply declined last week, and the number of deaths was the lowest since early December. There were nearly 2,700 confirmed cases, down 30% from the previous week. Weekly deaths linked to COVID-19 dropped to 107 from a record of 206 one month ago. Gov. Jim Justice said Monday that he expects an increase in the federal government’s weekly shipment of vaccines, bringing the state’s allocation of first doses to about 30,000. “We are getting close to 6,000 additional doses per week, and that’s going to help,” Justice said. Officials have said they want at least 125,000 doses a week to reach the state’s full capability of administering shots. Last week, state data shows 25,400 West Virginians received their first doses of the vaccine, with 12.3% of the state’s population now receiving at least one shot. The pace of administering first doses slowed somewhat, with 2,700 fewer shots going out compared to the previous week. But there was a record of 37,497 people receiving their second and final dose, pushing the state population’s share of fully vaccinated residents to nearly 6%.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state will open its first community vaccination clinic next week, Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday, in another sign that the state’s delivery efforts are improving after weeks of struggling to get people inoculated against COVID-19. Evers said his administration will work with AMI Expeditionary Healthcare to open the first community site Feb. 16 in Rock County. His office did not provide an exact location, but it said the facility will be able to vaccinate up to 250 people per day, with a goal of ramping that up to 1,000 per day. Wisconsin Department of Health Services spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said the agency expects to release more details about the location of the Rock County site in the coming days. The state and AMI plan to open up to 10 such centers around the state as needed and as vaccine supplies allow, the governor said. AMI will provide staffing, logistics and site management, and equipment for the first three centers, Goodsitt said. The state will pay the organization only for costs, up to $17.7 million for the first three sites. A Federal Emergency Management Agency grant will cover 100% of the costs, she said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state played a significant part in helping the country increase its wind energy production by nearly doubling capacity in 2020, a new report says. Wyoming installed 1,123 megawatts of wind power, ranking second nationwide behind Texas in new wind capacity added in last year’s fourth quarter, the Star-Tribune reports. A quarterly report compiled by the American Clean Power Association said the U.S. installed 16,913 megawatts of new wind power capacity last year, which was an 85% increase compared to 2019. A significant portion of the development was led by Wyoming’s largest utility, Rocky Mountain Power. Energy experts warned Wyoming should not expect wind power capacity to grow yearly. The Industrial Siting Council, the regulatory board charged with reviewing Wyoming wind project applications, has not received a new project proposal since 2019.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/11/17/plasma-shortage-fight-club-pen-pal-programs-news-around-states/114970028/", "title": "Plasma shortage, fight club: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: The city is moving ahead with plans to hold Mardi Gras celebrations in early 2021 despite the coronavirus pandemic, which is quickly worsening. Some groups already have called off parades and balls because of concerns about spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, but news outlets report that Mayor Sandy Stimpson’s office has released a memo saying Mardi Gras isn’t being canceled in the port city. Instead, the city is getting ready to issue permits for parades that will wind through downtown streets. Stimpson’s memo, which was released publicly by a City Council member on social media, said the number of people riding on floats will be limited, and participants will need to wear face masks. “This is a fluid situation, and we’re in uncharted waters,” said the note, which also said that organizations which rent city facilities for Mardi Gras balls will be able to cancel events as late as one week beforehand without a penalty.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The city will receive its own machine to process coronavirus tests starting in December, which should lead to a quicker turnaround time for results. The Juneau Assembly had authorized $700,000 from the federal coronavirus aid fund for testing equipment in June. But with the machines in high demand across the world, the city expected to have to wait until 2021. The new machine will be able to process almost 400 tests every eight hours. That means people should be able to receive same-day or next-day results, KTOO Public Media reports. “Ideally, we will have the staff and supplies in order to process all of our tests that occur in Juneau on the system,” said Emergency Operations Center Planning Chief Robert Barr. Juneau currently conducts roughly 150 to 200 tests a day on average, Barr said. Every test must be flown to a laboratory to be processed. Most results still take two to three days to finalize, KTOO Public Media reports.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State health officials reported 1,476 new confirmed coronavirus cases Monday but no new deaths. The state Department of Health Services’ latest coronavirus figures showed the number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 including ventilator use continues to trend upward. The total number of positive cases in Arizona since the pandemic started now stands at 276,912, with the death toll at 6,302. Arizona’s outbreak bottomed out in September but has steadily increased through October and into November. Health officials have said the recent increase is due to factors that include business and school reopenings and public fatigue with precautions such as masking. Warning that conditions likely will get worse due to Thanksgiving family gatherings and other socializing, officials advise against congregating outside households that live together.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A newly formed task force dealing with the coronavirus in Arkansas was set to begin meeting Monday, a day after COVID-19 hospitalizations hit a new record high in the state. Hospitalizations rose to 830 on Sunday, which is a record high for the state since the pandemic began. The state also reported 874 new cases of the virus Sunday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. “We had significant testing and lower numbers. This is part of weekend lag, but I am grateful for all who follow the guidelines and are making a difference,” he said. Hutchinson announced the Winter COVID-19 Task Force on Friday, when the state reported a single-day record of 2,312 cases. The task force includes 19 physicians, state officials and health care executives. Hutchinson will serve as the chair of the committee and Arkansas Surgeon General Dr. Greg Bledsoe as vice chair.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: Four San Diego County restaurants and gyms that were forced to halt indoor operations beginning Saturday have filed a lawsuit seeking an emergency injunction to halt the shutdown. The lawsuit filed on behalf of all restaurants and gyms came as 11 California counties, including San Diego, were forced to impose stricter limits on businesses after coronavirus cases rose above thresholds established by the state. Under the purple level of the state’s COVID-19 reopening system, restaurants, bars that serve food, gyms, churches and movie theaters are limited to outdoor operations only. The plaintiffs assert that the state and county orders interfere with their rights and violate the California Constitution, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. They are asking a judge to allow affected businesses to operate indoors under proper sanitation and social distancing protocols, a move they say will “redress the harms suffered by them without undermining the government’s legitimate interest in public health.” A hearing in the lawsuit is scheduled for Tuesday before a San Diego Superior Court judge.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state corrections department would hire a consultant to help it identify and protect medically vulnerable inmates from the coronavirus under a proposed settlement of a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. The deal, which must be approved by a judge, also requires the state to do several things it already says it is doing, such as providing masks to inmates, conducting wide-scale testing, prioritizing placing those most at risk of being harmed by the coronavirus in single cells, and conducting audits of prisons to ensure compliance with policies aimed at preventing the spread of the virus. However, in the proposed deal filed in Denver District Court, the ACLU says that many of the actions taken by the department have only been partially or sporadically implemented. If the order is signed by a judge, either side would be able to ask the judge to enforce its terms.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has requested that the National Guard be allowed to continue supporting the state’s coronavirus response efforts through the middle of next year. The governor, in a letter to President Donald Trump, also requested that the federal government pick up 100% of the cost of using those troops. The current authorization is scheduled to expire Dec. 31. More than 1,000 members of the Guard have been deployed in Connecticut during the pandemic, performing tasks such as setting up field hospitals, distributing personal protective equipment, assisting in nursing home inspections and helping to run COVID-19 testing sites. Between April 2 and Sept. 30, the federal government picked up the entire cost of those deployments. Since Oct. 1, the state has been responsible for 25% of the cost. The governor’s office said Monday that change is estimated to cost the state $2.5 million during the current authorization.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Public health officials on Sunday disclosed that the personal information of thousands of people who were tested for the coronavirus this summer was mistakenly shared with an unauthorized individual. The state’s Division of Public Health said the data breach happened when a temporary staff member sent two unencrypted emails in August that included files with the test results, names, dates of birth and phone numbers of 10,000 people. The files did not include financial information. The emails were meant to be distributed among the employees of a call center who help people obtain their test results, but the temporary agency staffer sent it to an unauthorized user by mistake, officials said. The person who received the emails Aug. 13 and Aug. 20 alerted the division about the error and reported deleting the messages. People with questions can call 1-833-791-1663.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The local teachers union and DC Public Schools are one step closer to making it possible for kids to have an in-person learning option even as the pandemic rages on. After months of negotiations, the two sides have reached a tentative deal, WUSA-TV reports. Washington Teachers’ Union President Elizabeth Davis said many of her members were worried. “They were concerned. Many of them work in schools that are 65 and 70 years old, with windows that won’t open, schools that have no central air conditioning. No heating ventilation system that works properly. They had reason to be concerned,” Davis said. A 50-item checklist for safety is part of the tentative deal. Davis said those protocols will get oversight from teachers and parents. She said teachers will be able to opt out of in-person teaching from now until February. After that, they can opt out unless there’s a shortage of staff.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: State officials reported more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases Sunday – the highest number of daily cases reported since July. According to statistics released from the Florida Department of Health, 885,201 people in the state have contracted the virus. More than 146,000 test results were reported Sunday, which could explain the dramatic rise in positive cases. On Saturday, Florida logged 4,452 new coronavirus cases. The state also tallied another 30 deaths Sunday. Since the start of the pandemic, 17,734 people in Florida have died from the virus. The number of patients being treated for COVID-19 in Florida hospitals has also risen in recent weeks. The state’s online census of hospitals showed numbers hovering between 2,000 and 2,200 for most of last month, but on Sunday, there were 3,118 coronavirus patients in hospitals.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp announced Friday that he is extending coronavirus-driven social distancing and sanitization restrictions for businesses, gatherings and long-term elderly care facilities in the state. Kemp signed an executive order effective at midnight Sunday and running through the end of the month, leaving the current set of restrictions in place. “As COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalizations rise across the country, (Georgia Commissioner of Public Health) Dr. (Kathleen) Toomey and I are asking Georgians to remain vigilant in our fight against COVID-19,” the governor said. “Continue to wash your hands, wear a mask, watch your distance, follow public health guidance, and get a flu shot. By taking these simple steps, we will protect lives –and livelihoods.” The latest order keeps in place a ban on gatherings larger than 50 people and continues to make wearing a mask voluntary at the statewide level rather than mandatory. Cities and counties have been allowed to impose their own mask mandates since August so long as their local requirements do not apply to businesses and residences.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The annual Remembrance Day ceremony to commemorate the attack on Pearl Harbor will be closed to the public this year and streamed online as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The ceremony will begin at 7:50 a.m. Dec. 7 at the Pearl Harbor National Memorial’s Contemplation Circle in Hawaii. A small number of veterans will be in attendance on site, Hawaii News Now reports. A moment of silence will be observed at 7:55 a.m., the time when the Japanese attack on the American naval base began in 1941. “America’s obligation to honor its veterans has been a sacrosanct pillar of our society, and we encourage everyone to join us virtually for this important ceremony,” said Scott Burch, acting superintendent of Pearl Harbor National Memorial.\n\nIdaho\n\nRexburg: Administrators at nursing homes and assisted living centers have started pen pal programs for their residents to safely interact with others during the coronavirus pandemic. Madison Carriage Cove Activities Director Emily Spencer collected the names of residents who were interested and put out a Facebook call asking people to write them, the Post Register reports. Spencer said five residents had signed up for the program in late August. Ombudsman Tera Fellows, who spends her days talking to people, said the program has spread across the region, and she has started her own as well. Fellows is paid by the state to investigate complaints from patients or residents in long-term care facilities in eastern Idaho. Four of the 36 long-term care facilities across nine eastern Idaho counties in which Fellows works are involved in the pen pal program. “It’s still in the early stages,” Fellows said. “I can’t wait one day to be visiting the patients and ask them face to face if they’re still getting letters.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois Department of Public Health on Sunday reported 10,631 new confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 in the state and 72 confirmed new deaths. With the latest announced number, Illinois has reported 573,616 cases of COVID-19, including 10,742 deaths. The latest confirmed and probable cases were the result of 84,831 tests administered over 24 hours. The seven-day statewide test positivity rate is 14.8%. As of late Saturday, 5,474 people in Illinois were reported hospitalized with COVID-19. Of those, 1,045 patients were in intensive care units, and 490 patients with the coronavirus were on ventilators. The latest numbers come after Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday ordered an extension of several of coronavirus-related executive orders for another 30 days, including an extension of a moratorium on evictions. State officials also released data covering the period from Aug. 1 to Nov. 7 showing Illinois is short of its goal of launching contact tracing for 90% of cases.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: The Vigo County Health Department is pleading with the community to take coronavirus precautions seriously after county officials announced they’ve rented four refrigerated semitrailers to store bodies of COVID-19 decedents. With some funeral homes in the area already becoming “overrun with bodies,” health department administrator Joni Wise said there aren’t enough places to put them. “We have to have some place for mass casualties to go, and this is one of those situations that is going to get worse before it gets better,” Wise said Thursday in a video statement. Community spread of COVID-19 continues to increase in Vigo County, said County Commissioner Brendan Kearns. Gatherings at bars, restaurants and similar venues continue to be a main source of virus transmission. “People are not wearing masks,” Kearns said in the video statement. “The hospitals are already pretty much at capacity … they’re busting at the seams … employees are stressed out. This is overwhelming the community.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Eight labor and civil rights groups filed a federal complaint Friday alleging the state has failed to protect workers in meatpacking, dairy, construction, transportation, health care facilities, nursing homes and other industries. The complaint filed with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration office in Kansas City seeks a full investigation and corrective action by the federal government. While it cites several examples of alleged failure of Iowa OSHA to do on-site inspections or investigate unsafe conditions related to the coronavirus pandemic, the groups say Iowa work safety issues go beyond coronavirus problems. Gov. Kim Reynolds is supportive of the work Iowa OSHA has done and “believes any federal review would find Iowa OSHA has followed all guidance to protect Iowa workers throughout this pandemic,” said spokesman Pat Garrett.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Counties that require masks saw about half as many new coronavirus infections as counties that don’t mandate face coverings, a study found, as cases statewide surged again to record levels. “Do Masks Matter in Kansas” produced by the Institute for Policy and Social Research at the University of Kansas found that counties that require masks saw a decrease in their seven-day rolling average of daily cases per 100,000 population starting 14 days after the mandate was issued. “Masks, it is important to note, do not eliminate COVID, but they significantly slow the spread of the disease – at least here in Kansas,” said Donna K. Ginther, the institute’s director, in a video presenting the study’s findings. The Institute for Policy and Social Research at the University of Kansas has been tracking the impact of COVID-19 on the state, The Kansas City Star reports. “We found a 50% reduction in the spread of COVID-19 in counties that had a mask mandate compared to those without,” Ginther said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state again recorded a record-high weekly total of new coronavirus cases, with 1,449 additional cases and three more deaths reported Sunday. The state has set weekly records over the past month, with the rate for positive tests also increasing, sitting at 8.88% on Sunday. Kentucky passed its daily record three times last week, reporting 3,303 new cases Saturday. “Coronavirus is present in every corner of the commonwealth, and it’s spreading at a truly alarming rate,” Gov. Andy Beshear said in a statement. “This is not a drill; this is a health emergency that we all need to take seriously. Let’s come together as Team Kentucky to defeat this virus.” Dr. Steven Stack, the state’s public health commissioner, reminded people to maintain social distance, wear a mask and wash hands often. “Kentucky’s state motto is ‘United We Stand, Divided We Fall.’ This motto has never been more applicable than now, as we fight the most deadly pandemic in over 100 years,” Stack said in a statement. “Unless Kentuckians come together, we will continue on this dangerous trajectory with disastrous consequences.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: Acadiana’s elected leaders leaned on the region’s medical community to lead efforts to prevent a third COVID-19 wave Thursday, with Lafayette Mayor-President Josh Guillory calling on them to do more to avoid the need for economic restrictions. During a conference call with parish leaders, Regional Medical Director Dr. Tina Stefanski warned that Acadiana is experiencing a growth in new coronavirus cases and in hospitalizations for the virus, similar to the increase seen in the run-up to the summer’s massive wave of cases and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Stefanski blamed the increase on risky behavior and fatigue with COVID-19 mitigation measures, reinforcing the need for everyone to adhere to social distancing guidelines, the state’s mask mandate and good hand hygiene in what she called a “pivotal, pivotal” moment in the virus’s trajectory locally. St. Martin Parish President Chester Cedars agreed that people have stopped following COVID-19 protocols and asked Stefanski to coordinate with local health care providers to make another plea with the public to use the mitigation measures.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The organizers of an annual holiday tree and wreath festival have decided to cancel the event this year because of the rise in coronavirus cases in the state. The Midcoast Tree Festival has been postponed to 2021. The event had been scheduled to start Friday. “It just isn’t responsible to hold a major event that will bring hundreds and possibly thousands of people to one location before sending them off to their family Thanksgiving meals and holiday gatherings,” Southern Midcoast Maine Chamber Executive Director Cory King said. The festival is a joint fundraising event between the chamber and other organizations that involves crafts, food and entertainment in addition to the trees and wreaths. The latest average coronavirus positivity rate in Maine is 2.14%. The seven-day rolling average of the positivity rate has risen over the past two weeks from 1.05% on Nov. 1 to 2.14% on Sunday. State authorities said the state surpassed 9,000 reported coronavirus cases Monday.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Drivers have become more aggressive during the pandemic. And the proof is in Baltimore County. The Baltimore Sun reports citations from speed ticket cameras in the county are on track to set a record. Officials say people drove faster this year as more people stayed home because of the pandemic. The county has seen a 10% increase in speed camera violations so far in 2020. It issued more than 180,000 citations between January and Oct. 13. The same period last year saw 164,000 citations. At the same time, revenue from speed cameras rose by nearly 38%. And more than $4.56 million in speeding fines was collected compared to $3.31 million. The city of Baltimore also saw a rise in citations, although not as high. Citations were up by 7% by more than 500,000 through September. Those citations generated more than $12 million in revenue.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city is offering more help to local small businesses struggling to stay viable amid the pandemic. Mayor Marty Walsh on Friday announced three new relief funds totaling $6.3 million. One will provide up to $15,000 to small businesses that are struggling to pay their rent. Another will make $15,000 grants available to businesses owned by minorities, women or veterans. The third will offer grants to restaurants to enable them to retain or rehire employees. Since the start of the pandemic, the city has set aside more than $15 million in total to help businesses survive the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. Massachusetts hit 10,015 confirmed coronavirus deaths Thursday, nearly nine months after the state’s initial case was detected. Confirmed cases have topped 174,000, and the number of cities and towns designated as “high risk” nearly doubled over a two-week period last month.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Monday that she has the authority to issue a second stay-at-home order to curb the spiking coronavirus if necessary and called a comment by an adviser to President Donald Trump urging people to “rise up” against Michigan’s latest restrictions “incredibly reckless.” The Democratic governor spoke with Capitol reporters a day after announcing limits amid a surge of COVID-19 cases that has led to increased hospitalizations and deaths. She has urged the public to “double down” with precautions to avoid a shelter-in-place order like what was instituted in the spring. Under the restrictions that start Wednesday, Michigan high schools and colleges must halt in-person classes, restaurants must stop indoor dining, and entertainment businesses such as casinos, movie theaters and bowling alleys must close for three weeks. Gathering sizes also will be tightened. Whitmer called it a “targeted approach” informed by epidemiologists and public health experts. She renewed her call for the Republican-led Legislature to codify a mask requirement in law in part to send a unified message to the public.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Democratic state senators are calling on Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka to resign from his leadership post after Senate Republicans failed to notify their Democratic colleagues, nonpartisan staff and Capitol security of a potential COVID-19 outbreak among GOP ranks in advance of a special session last week. Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent called on Gazelka to step down Sunday, hours after he disclosed he tested positive for the coronavirus. Kent said GOP gatherings led to an outbreak, and the information wasn’t shared, and there is still uncertainty about who was exposed. Gazelka did not immediately return a message seeking comment Monday. In a statement Sunday, he said he has been in quarantine since he began experiencing symptoms Nov. 9 and “will remain in quarantine as long as my doctor advises me to.” Gazelka is in Florida and said he did not attend the Legislature’s special session Thursday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Officials have identified an outbreak at a prison in the Mississippi Delta in which more than 50 inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Mississippi Department of Corrections and the Mississippi State Department of Health confirm the outbreak occurred at the Marshall County Correctional Facility in Holly Springs. The facility is operated by private prison management group Management & Training Corporation of Centerville, Utah. Marshall County borders the Mississippi-Tennessee state line and the greater Memphis metropolitan area. Dr. Raman Singh, medical director for the correction department’s medical provider, VitalCore Health Strategies, said three inmates in the prison’s 959-inmate population became symptomatic last week and tested positive last Monday. Singh said the facility began contact tracing and identified 109 inmates who were either living in the area of the three positive inmates or had contact with them. He said most of the affected inmates are asymptomatic, with just a few showing mild symptoms.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The number of coronavirus cases continues to steadily increase across the state, and hospitalizations remain at a high level. The state reported 3,729 new virus cases Sunday for a total of 239,451 cases. The number of deaths increased by one to 3,374. The number of people hospitalized with the virus dipped Sunday to 2,447 from the previous day’s record of 2,523, but hospitalizations have doubled in the past month, and capacity is strained in parts of the state. In the St. Louis area, BJC HealthCare and Washington University Physicians announced plans Sunday to suspend some elective surgeries to preserve hospital space for COVID-19 patients. Local health officials have urged Gov. Mike Parson to impose tougher restrictions to limit the spread of the virus, but he has resisted requiring masks and largely left it up to local officials to impose restrictions. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has nearly doubled over the past two weeks from 2,247.71 new cases per day Oct. 31 to 4,379.43 new cases per day Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Hundreds of Montanans who received Pandemic Unemployment Assistance payments have been asked to pay back the Montana Department of Labor and Industry – some receiving bills for over $10,000 – because of a federal change to how a person is deemed eligible for the money. Roughly 21,000 Montanans received at least one payment between March and November from the PUA program, a program created by congressional coronavirus relief legislation to distribute unemployment funds to people not eligible for regular unemployment, such as gig workers or people who are self-employed. As of last Tuesday, the state labor department had identified 8,802 issues on accounts that will require repayment, according to department spokesperson Lauren Lewis. At least 816 people have received full denial and have been asked to pay back benefits in full.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A group of about 35 people gathered outside a grocery store in southwest Omaha on Saturday to protest against the city’s mask mandate. The group originally planned to stage a mask-less shopping trip at the Hy-Vee grocery store, but the event turned into an outdoor march after the grocer worked with Omaha police to keep the protest out of the store. Omaha police said they would have officers at the store who would ticket people who tried to violate the city’s indoor mask requirement. Allie French said the group modified its plan after the backlash against it. French and other protesters gathered in front of the grocery store Saturday with signs and flags. Two police cars were parked among the group, and multiple officers stood at the entrance of the Hy-Vee along with several employees. Grace Willett attended the protest with her husband and 2-year-old daughter to take a stand for individual freedom. “It’s about standing up for our medical freedom to choose whether or not we wear a mask,” Willett said. “I’m fine with other people wearing a mask if they want to, but I think that we should all have the choice.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The city’s annual fireworks show on New Year’s Eve is canceled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said in a statement that it would cancel its annual fireworks show Dec. 31. “Las Vegas has always been a bucket list New Year’s Eve destination, and we are going to make sure that remains the case – celebrating putting 2020 in the rear-view mirror in an ‘Only Vegas’ way,” Authority CEO Steve Hill said. “But as we have said throughout the year, the safety and security of our guests and employees is our top priority, and with that in mind, we will not have a fireworks show on December 31st.” Hill said the city will still “have some special things planned to welcome 2021 with the hope and promise it brings.” Individual hotels and casinos are free to launch their own fireworks independently.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The coronavirus pandemic has underscored the importance of building a system of care that strengthens families and prevents child abuse, neglect and delinquency, according to the head of a watchdog office for the state’s child welfare system. Moira O’Neill, director of the Office of the Child Advocate, said she sees parallels between the experience of living through a pandemic and living as a child in out-of-home care. “The stress and uncertainty we all feel under pandemic restrictions teaches us what children feel when placed away from home,” she wrote in an annual report released Friday. “They never really know when they will go home, if they will go home, or who will be there for them. This may be the greatest lesson of the pandemic.” O’Neill said the Division for Children, Youth and Families has forged partnerships to create new paths to supports and services during the pandemic, many of which are better than previous options. But she said there is an urgent need to implement the expansion of the entire system of care that was authorized in legislation a year and a half ago.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy said he will be reducing indoor and outdoor gathering limits because of the COVID-19 resurgence. The Democrat said Monday at a news conference that he will order the maximum number of people at indoor gatherings to fall from 25 to 10 and outdoor get-togethers from 500 to 150 people. The new indoor limit goes into effect Tuesday, while the outdoor level kicks in Nov. 23. The lower levels come just before Thanksgiving and ahead of the winter holidays. Murphy said he understood the new limits would lead to frustration, but little about this year has been normal. “I must again pull back the reins,” he said. “It gives me no joy.” New Jersey’s coronavirus levels have been spiking, which Murphy has said amounts to a “second wave.” There are some exceptions to the limits, the governor said. Among them are religious services, political activities and weddings. Murphy said the tighter limits are aimed at limiting house parties, which he said contribute to climbing COVID-19 rates.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state started its lockdown Monday as Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and hospital administrators look to curb coronavirus infections. Under the latest public health order, people are being asked to stay home, and only essential businesses such as grocery stores, pharmacies, big box retailers, hardware stores, auto and bicycle repair shops, and other necessary operations will be open. Universities are transitioning back to full online classes, while many municipal and state government offices are closed to walk-in requests. Also as a result of the restrictions, Virgin Galactic said plans for the first space test flight from southern New Mexico will be pushed back. The company had announced recently that the window for the test flight would begin Nov. 19. Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier said in a statement that the company’s operations at Spaceport America will be minimized to the greatest degree possible in accordance with the public health order. New Mexico has been struggling with high case counts and deaths. On Sunday, the number of hospitalizations due to the virus surpassed 500, marking a first since the pandemic began.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s sheriff’s deputies have stayed busy enforcing coronavirus rules, clamping down on several big, underground night spots over the weekend, including a fight club in the Bronx that drew as many as 200 people. Deputy New York City sheriffs enforcing COVID-19 crowd limits broke up an amateur fight night event late Friday in a warehouse. The unsanctioned fight would have been illegal even before the coronavirus pandemic but risked becoming a public health threat as infections rise around the state. The size of the crowd far exceeded the state’s limit on nonessential gatherings of 10 people, authorities said. Across New York, the virus continued to claim victims at a rate unseen since the spring. Nearly 2,000 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 as of Sunday, the state announced. That’s the most since early June, up from a low of 410 on Sept. 5. Over the past seven days, the state has averaged 4,500 positive tests per day. New York’s hospitals and nursing homes have reported 185 deaths over the past seven days.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s depositories for old government and academic records, maps, books and genealogical materials have reopened to the public at reduced capacity after being closed for months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. State Archives public research locations in Raleigh and Manteo and the State Library of North Carolina in Raleigh planned to welcome visitors by appointment starting last Thursday, with the Western Regional Archives in Asheville following Friday. Guests must set up formal appointments online and are required to wear face masks inside. Public computer terminals there will also be closed. State archivists and librarians also urged people to check their agencies’ websites to determine whether research questions or access could be handled online.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Health officials on Monday reported a new high in the number of hospitalizations due to COVID-19, following a weekend in which the state enacted new measures in an effort to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Gov. Doug Burgum announced the restrictions, including ordering the use of face coverings, late Friday. They went into effect Saturday and are set to remain in place until Dec. 13. Meanwhile, the number of virus patients in medical facilities rose by 10 on Monday, to 332. North Dakota has continued to rank first in the country for new cases per capita in the past two weeks. One in every 80 people in the state tested positive in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. A weekend count of available staffed hospital beds in the state showed 11 in intensive care units and 181 in inpatient rooms.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state reported 7,853 new coronavirus cases Sunday, down for the second straight day from a record 8,071 on Friday. The pace of new cases has been accelerating in Ohio, increasing from an average of about 1,000 per day in mid-September to the record-busting counts over the past week. While cases again ticked down Sunday, they still sat well above the 21-day average of 4,761. Another 189 people were hospitalized, and eight more had died from the coronavirus as of Saturday, the state reported. The positivity rate was down slightly to 11.9% on Friday, the most recent day for which data was available. Since the start of the pandemic, Ohio has reported 298,096 cases, and 5,722 people have died from the virus. A total of 22,265 have been hospitalized with COVID-19, and 4,204 were admitted to intensive care units.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Monday announced new restrictions as the numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations surge across the state. In a news conference, Stitt announced new mandates to limit bar and restaurant capacity in an attempt to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Effective Thursday, bars and restaurants must close by 11 p.m., except for to-go and drive-thru orders. Restaurants will also have to space out all tables 6 feet apart. Asked about whether he considered limiting capacity in bars in restaurants instead of the requirement that seating be spaced out, Stitt said limiting capacity could be difficult because businesses vary in size. Stitt also announced that all state employees and visitors to state facilities will be required to wear masks. The mask mandate for state employees will take effect Wednesday. There are roughly 33,000 state employees, Stitt said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State health officials reported 868 new confirmed or presumptive cases of COVID-19 on Sunday and two more deaths. The state is experiencing a spike in coronavirus infections and has reached record-high positivity rates and hospitalizations in November. Oregon has surpassed 1,000 cases a day twice this month. The state total was 56,880 cases Sunday. The two new deaths were those of an 81-year-old man and a 66-year-old woman, both in Umatilla County. On Friday, Gov. Kate Brown announced a two-week “freeze” of new restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the disease. Restaurants and bars will be limited to takeout only, and there will be closures of gyms and indoor and outdoor recreational facilities. The freeze will take effect starting Wednesday and running at least through Dec. 2.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city is banning indoor dining at restaurants and indoor gatherings of any size, public or private, as it battles a resurgence of the coronavirus, officials announced Monday. The city also plans to shutter gyms, museums and libraries, prohibit in-person instruction at colleges and high schools, and reduce occupancy at stores and religious institutions, the health commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley, said at a news conference Monday. The new restrictions take effect Friday and extend at least through the end of the year. The Philadelphia school district had planned to start returning K-12 students to the classroom but said last week that schools will remain virtual for the foreseeable future in light of the explosion in cases. City officials said dramatic action is needed to respond to an exponential growth in cases and hospitalizations. The state is reporting an average of 4,900 new infections per day, up nearly 120% in two weeks, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the COVID Tracking Project. The daily death toll has nearly doubled in that period, to about 42 per day, though it remains far below what it was last spring. Hospitalizations and the percentage of virus tests are also up sharply.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: A state-run psychiatric hospital is dealing with a “significant” coronavirus outbreak caused in part by employees showing up to work sick, authorities said. The outbreak includes a dozen staff members and six patients, according to an email sent to staff Friday by Brian Daly, the chief medical officer at Eleanor Slater Hospital in Cranston, and obtained by The Providence Journal. Randal Edgar, a spokesperson for the state Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals, which oversees the hospital, said in an email to the Associated Press on Monday that the newspaper’s report was accurate but did not provide additional details or updates. “The most troubling information we uncovered in doing contact tracing is that some staff members worked even while they had significant symptoms of cold or flu-like illness,” Daly’s email said. “This means that they signed the attestation we all sign every day saying they did not have these symptoms when they did.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With Thanksgiving and Christmas on the horizon, state health officials are urging people to get tested for the coronavirus before gathering for the holidays, to wear masks whenever they aren’t eating, and to celebrate outside if possible. But so far, health officials aren’t forcefully suggesting people skip holiday celebrations altogether. “We recognize that the holiday season is a sacred time, and we encourage South Carolinians to avoid indoor gatherings and maintain their commitment to activities that reduce the spread of COVID-19,” the state Department of Health and Environmental Control said in a statement Monday. Since the coronavirus pandemic started, South Carolina leaders have placed more emphasis on personal responsibility, such as encouraging people to wear masks, than government edicts such as mask requirements. “Those decisions are best made at the local level,” Gov. Henry McMaster said Thursday, saying local governments better know their businesses, compliance with the commonsense rules and their capacity to enforce mask rules.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: City Council members who pushed for a coronavirus mask mandate that failed to pass last week plan to give it another try as the state continues to be a hot spot for COVID-19. The mask ordinance is on the agenda for the council’s meeting Tuesday, as well as one that would place limits on the number of people allowed in local businesses. The mask ordinance is largely similar to the one that was voted down by Mayor Paul TenHaken following a 4-4 tie Nov. 10. And the second ordinance would place restrictions on businesses similar to those that were in place in May before they were repealed. The COVID Tracking Project said Sunday that there were nearly 2,062 new cases per 100,000 people in South Dakota over the past two weeks, which ranks second in the country behind North Dakota for new cases per capita. One in every 86 people in South Dakota tested positive in the past week.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Vanderbilt University announced Monday that the school will limit attendance for the final two home games of the football season to families of student-athletes and a group of other students due to concerns about the coronavirus. A specified number of graduate and professional students will be able to attend the games, which will be held Saturday and on Nov. 28, but fans and other Vanderbilt students won’t be allowed in, the university’s athletics program said in a news release. The majority of the school’s undergraduate body will leave the campus Friday, when in-person classes for the semester are scheduled to end. The school said it is also planning to begin its basketball season without spectators at the games. “Similar to our approach with fall sports, we owe it to ourselves, our student-athletes’ families and our fans to gather as much information as possible and understand all aspects of what a basketball game day looks like during this pandemic before determining our fan attendance policies,” Vice Chancellor for Athletics & University Affairs Candice Lee said in the news release.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state surpassed 20,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths Monday, as COVID-19 continues to surge in the United States. That is the second-highest death count overall in the U.S., trailing only New York, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. It’s the 22nd-highest per capita at 69.7 deaths per 100,000 people. So far, Texas leaders have given no indication of forthcoming restrictions to keep people from gathering and spreading the virus. Instead, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in recent days has been emphasizing that new therapeutics and vaccines are expected to become available soon. A state appeals court last week sided with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and lifted a local shutdown order in El Paso, where mobile morgues are being trucked in to help overwhelmed hospitals and funeral homes. The El Paso county morgue reached out to the El Paso Sheriff’s Department for help after it became “overwhelmed,” according to El Paso Sheriff’s Department Public Affairs Director Chris Acosta. Inmates of the county’s detention facility “were asked to help for a stipend of $2 an hour,” Acosta said in a statement.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: The City Council has passed an ordinance outlawing demonstrations targeting homes following a protest outside the governor’s private residence. The Orem City Council passed the ordinance Friday after a protest targeted the private home of Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, KSTU-TV reports. The demonstration followed the announcement of a statewide mask mandate issued last week in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Protests must remain at least 100 feet from the property line of any residence, with violations to be charged as misdemeanors. “The public health and welfare and the good order of the community require that citizens enjoy in their homes and neighborhoods a feeling of well-being, tranquility, and privacy, and enjoy freedom from being a captive audience to unwanted speech in their homes,” the ordinance said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state will start testing K-12 teachers and staff for COVID-19 starting this week as a strategy that health officials hope will help to track the spread of the coronavirus in communities. Teachers and school staff are not at a higher risk of contracting the illness caused by the virus, but they “represent a large group of individuals in an organized setting” and could help the state better identify cases before an outbreak, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said this week. The tests will be given voluntarily starting this week and resume monthly after the Thanksgiving holiday break. Those who are tested will not be required to quarantine while awaiting their results. “Testing of school personnel is a public health surveillance strategy,” Levine said. The state reported 94 new cases Saturday, while the number of deaths remained at 59. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Vermont has risen over the past two weeks from 20 new cases per day Oct. 30 to 60 new cases per day Friday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State lawmakers were feuding Monday after Democratic House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn announced plans for that chamber to again conduct its work remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic when it convenes in January. Shortly after the speaker’s office made the announcement, House and Senate Republican leaders said they would use a procedural move to limit the 2021 session to 30 days, rather than the typical, longer session Filler-Corn said she expected. Such a move could hinder the breadth of what Democrats, who have a narrow majority in both chambers and Ralph Northam in the governor’s mansion, are able to address. “I think it’s extremely disappointing that the Republicans would use this moment – a time when we should be helping Virginians through this pandemic -– to exercise their limited power to cut the planned 45-day legislative session short,” Filler-Corn said in an interview. The Republicans said that given the lengthy special session that concluded earlier this month, during which lawmakers approved a new state budget and passed a host of major new criminal justice reforms, 30 days should be sufficient time to complete the year’s work. The 100-member House also conducted its work virtually during the special session.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A long-term care facility reported 94 people have tested positive for the coronavirus since late October, its second outbreak since the pandemic began. Snohomish Health District spokeswoman Heather Thomas confirmed that 53 residents and 41 staff members at Josephine Caring Community in Stanwood have contracted the virus, The Seattle Times reports. It is unclear how many people have been hospitalized. Thomas said in an email over the weekend that at least “a few” were taken to the hospital and that she didn’t know of any deaths. It’s the second outbreak connected to the facility about 50 miles north of Seattle. In the first, the facility reported a handful of infections in March, which grew to at least 34 cases, including six deaths as of April 17. Long-term care facilities account for about 1% of the U.S. population but represent 40% of COVID-19 deaths, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: There were 107 active known cases of the coronavirus among inmates at a federal correctional institution last week. Gilmer County Health Department announced the numbers Wednesday. The county of about 8,500 in central West Virginia has two other active cases. The federal facility has nearly 1,300 inmates. Among state-owned correctional facilities, the largest outbreak among inmates is at McDowell County Corrections, where there are 40 active cases, the state reported Thursday. An additional 40 state correctional employees have the coronavirus overall across over two dozen facilities.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: There is a critical need for blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients in the state, according to officials. Convalescent plasma has been shown to be effective in treating the most seriously ill coronavirus patients, but the demand is far greater than the supply. Versiti Blood Center of Wisconsin’s chief medical officer, Dr. Thomas Abshire, said the need for convalescent plasma in Wisconsin is about double the number of donors giving plasma. Advocate Health Care transplant director Dr. Ajay Sahajpal said Wisconsin has already needed to import plasma from other states, but that might not continue as the shortage of donors continues elsewhere. “For convalescent plasma, specifically, it’s a critical shortage,” he said. Sahajpal said he is worried that as the holidays approach, fewer people will donate blood, which could lead to a crisis across several medical fronts. Saphajpal said plasma and coagulation products, which cause the blood to clot, are being rationed, even for patients in intensive-care units, some with liver failure and those awaiting transplants.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: County officials have said residents could see tighter coronavirus safety measures, including limits on further gatherings, as cases surge. Currently, state coronavirus health orders prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon said Friday that more restrictive health orders could be implemented. But Teton County District Health Officer Dr. Travis Riddell said he felt it was time to take more drastic action now, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. “I’m not willing to wait,” Riddell said. “These cases have totally overwhelmed the capacity of our state and local health departments.” The request will next need approval from state health officer Dr. Alexia Harrist, who has granted other variances. The Wyoming Department of Health reported Teton County, which includes Jackson, has had 41 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, increasing its active total to 175 as of Friday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/17"}]}

And driving these battles are local Facebook groups, grassroots volunteers, nonprofits and even some political action committees working to push like-minded candidates to victory.\n\nThey belong to two camps: advocates of greater parental control over public schools, and advocates of public education.\n\nNew Jersey’s \"parental rights\" movement gathered steam when the Murphy administration rolled out its revised sex education standards in 2022. The administration defended mature discussions of sexuality and gender in health class, saying it is necessary to prepare kids for today’s rapidly changing cultural milieu and challenges.\n\nParental rights groups pushed back, calling on voters to flip school boards to parental rights majorities and overrule the state’s mandates.\n\nNearly two years later, that movement has broadened to push for influence over policies, curricula, textbook selection and school libraries — areas traditionally under the purview of teachers and administrators.\n\nPublic education advocates, meanwhile, have mobilized to preserve K-12 education policy and debunk claims made by the parents' rights camp that the state is trying to indoctrinate or groom students.\n\nSome groups are specific to New Jersey; others are linked with national groups. But both camps consist of people with deeply held convictions about the role of public schools. Facebook posts show how intense and personal this battle is — with webinars, memes and clarion calls to show up in large numbers at school board meetings when policies are being hashed out.\n\nBook bans, anti-LGBTQ positions\n\nSome parental rights groups take clearly anti-LGBTQ+ positions. Gregory Quinlan, head of the Garden State Coalition for Families and a parental rights advocate, actively opposes gay rights and gay marriage.\n\nThe co-founder of another parental rights group, Nicole Stouffer of the New Jersey Project, has said publicly that she is not opposed to gay rights or the LGBTQ+ community but asserts that the New Jersey Department of Education is “gaslighting” parents with some of its policies. Critics say this sort of language promotes mistrust in public education.\n\nMoms for Liberty, a national parental rights group with chapters in South Jersey and in Morris and Bergen counties, has called for book bans nationwide since 2021. It was labeled an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center for undermining public education and opposing inclusive curricula.\n\nMoms for Liberty has a strong ally in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, author of a 2022 state law prohibiting teachers from discussing gender identity or sexual orientation through third grade. Although polls show that most American adults agree that these concepts are not suited for elementary schoolers, the Florida law, named “Don’t Say Gay” by its critics, is broader.\n\nMore:Judge blocks Hanover school district's parental notification policy, citing LGBTQ+ privacy\n\nMore:National right-wing groups enter NJ's legal battles with schools over parental rights\n\nIt also bans teachers from instruction on these topics “in a manner that is not age-appropriate.” It goes on to permit parents to sue schools for not notifying them about mental and emotional health interventions, which critics say puts LGBTQ+ children, who might confide in school staff, at high risk of being targeted.\n\nNew Jersey state law takes the opposite approach, leaving it up to the school district to notify parents about matters relating to gender and sexual orientation, after assessing what is best for the child. This policy, built into the state’s Law Against Discrimination, was adopted almost universally by the state’s schools long before the term \"parental rights\" was in use.\n\nIn May, a few districts, some with parental rights majorities on their school boards, began modifying policies that had protected gay and trans students’ civil rights. The state attorney general sued four districts on grounds that they violated state law.\n\nSparta High School student assistance coordinator Lauren Monaco, who is gay and resigned in September in protest after the Board of Education moved to rescind the district's transgender policy, said that in most cases, schools want to inform parents if their children decide to transition or come out. They hold back only if the child is at risk.\n\nFor many parents on both sides, these controversies represent a clash of personal values. Very few of the state’s 574 districts have changed these policies — but a drawn-out fight looms over public education policy in New Jersey.\n\nThese are some of the groups working to influence next week’s school board elections:\n\nSWEEP NJ\n\nThis Facebook group of public education advocates — the acronym stands for Suburban Women Engaged, Empowered and Pissed — is inspired and modeled after the progressive national group Red Wine and Blue but is independent and volunteer-run, said founder Rosalie Wong. About 90% of its members are women. “Many men in our group are leaders in other groups but understand that we are holding space to raise up women's voices in the political sphere,” Wong said.\n\nThe group promotes candidates' events, calls for volunteers and takes donations but said it does not have any financial backers. The group said it does not endorse school board candidates but vets and supports them. Its members watch school board meetings and use an emailed questionnaire.\n\nIt does not formally endorse legislative candidates but wants to “keep NJ blue,” Wong said. Key issues other than school boards are reproductive rights and sensible gun legislation.\n\nNew Jersey Public Education Coalition\n\nNJPEC is a volunteer-run, nonpartisan “knowledge organization,” created to inform voters about school board candidate positions, said founder and Wayne resident Michael Gottesman. The group was founded on Facebook to inform voters looking for reliable information on whom to support during the 2022 election cycle, when parental rights picked up steam and misinformation — particularly around the state sex education standards — was entering debates around school board elections.\n\nIt does not endorse but has a list of “like-minded school board candidates,” Gottesman said. It is not involved with legislative races and is focused on schools.\n\nNJPEC's budget since it went live in May 2022 has been about $5,000, with Gottesman contributing $2,500, he said, and an \"in-kind\" individual donation to host the group's website. The group said it uses GoFundMe to fundraise but has no financial backers.\n\n“We fight against book banning, radical attempts to eliminate and limit curriculums and attempts to silence our teachers and education professionals from presenting a variety of opinions as part of the education process,” Gottesman said.\n\nDistricts for Democracy\n\nBoth SWEEP NJ and NJPEC said they collaborate regularly, along with dozens of other local social media groups and organizations. Prominent ones include Districts for Democracy, a political action committee founded by Tom Malinowski, a Democrat and former New Jersey congressman. According to Federal Election Commission records, it raised $106,503 between January and June and spent $93,255 during that period.\n\n\"Our mission is to protect our students and educators from culture warriors who would do to New Jersey what they’ve done in states like Florida — banning books, censoring classroom discussions, hounding LGBT kids, defunding student health programs — policies that lower school ratings, drive away teachers, and lead to lawsuits that taxpayers must pay for,\" said Executive Director Darcy Draeger.\n\nThe group raises most of its funds from individual donations and is willing to support board of education candidates, she said.\n\nAction Together New Jersey is another group, focusing on both state politics and school board elections. It was registered as a federal independent expenditure committee from 2017 until 2020.\n\nNew Jersey Project\n\nThe website of the parental rights group New Jersey Project says it was formed by two regular moms who grew frustrated with the “tyranny of the state.” The group endorses school board and some legislative candidates.\n\nRegistered as a nonprofit, it describes its goal as increasing the reach of Republican and conservative voters. It is strongly opposed to Murphy and the New Jersey Education Association, the state’s powerful teachers' union.\n\n“Our goals are to get the New Jersey school system working for the parents and children of our state, not the NJEA or other outside groups,” co-founder Nicole Stouffer said. The group opposed the state’s 2020 sex education standards. Stouffer is known for a provocative parents’ rights blog.\n\nNew Jersey Project has posted mugshots of sitting state Board of Education members it criticized for approving changes to the state’s K-12 equity code. Stouffer also promoted a call by the former director of Project Veritas to equip students with hidden cameras to record teachers in class without their knowledge.\n\nStouffer said she supports expanding charter schools and school vouchers but does not support including religion or any ideology in public schools.\n\nThe project works independently, Stouffer said, but its members have attended rallies with “Gays Against Groomers,” a group that accuses the state of “sexualizing” schoolchildren. It said it does not have funders and does not give candidates financial support.\n\nMoms for Liberty – Morris County\n\nThe chapter endorses school board candidates and said it wants to educate and empower parental rights “at all levels of government.” It supports repealing the transgender student policy that is at the heart of the state’s lawsuit against four school districts. The chapter has also supported challenges to library books.\n\n“Every family deserves the liberty and basic rights that are enshrined in our constitution,” said Nikki Lois, the chapter chair. “I am willing to take responsibility to see that is not lost.”\n\nAsked if the group supports expanding vouchers and religion in schools, Lois did not answer, saying she would comment only on specific laws.\n\nThe group said it does not fundraise or financially back candidates.\n\nGroup member Sherry Nardolillo spoke on behalf of Moms for Liberty at a June 12 meeting in the Roxbury school district in Morris County, where a controversy over library books prompted Roxana Caivano, the high school librarian, to sue four parents, alleging defamation. One of the books is \"Gender Queer,\" which features graphic drawings of sexual activity. Speaking in support of the sued parents at the board meeting, Nardolillo said book selection should be guided by principles of “common decency” and “morality.”\n\nCaivano has defended the right to run an inclusive school library, saying the contested books are not part of curriculum and children are not compelled to read them. \"Gender Queer\" is in high school and not in middle school libraries, said Ewa Dziedzic-Elliott, former president of the New Jersey Association of School Librarians. \"Certified, educated and highly qualified librarians are trained how to make book selections for school age students,\" she said in an email at the time.\n\nNJEA\n\nThe NJEA, the New Jersey Education Association, is the state’s largest teachers’ union and has a registered political action committee that donates to and endorses legislative candidates. It does not endorse school board candidates, said spokesperson Steven Baker, but its associations in school districts do so.\n\n“Where local associations do make endorsements, they are able to request support for those candidates from NJEA PAC,\" Baker said. All contributions are reported to the state. Funding for the union, a separate organization from the political action committee, comes from member dues and donations from retiree members, he said. Another political organization, Garden State Forward, is funded entirely by the union.\n\nThe NJEA, which advocates for inclusive curricula, has been criticized by parental rights groups for hosting drag queen story time sessions at its annual conventions.\n\n“We have long opposed efforts to censor curriculum or ban books, because we believe access to information is fundamental to both education and to democracy,” Baker said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/27/what-is-ohio-issue-1-on-the-ballot-in-august-2023/70359953007/", "title": "What is Ohio Issue 1 on the ballot in August 2023?", "text": "Ohioans will decide this summer if it should be harder to amend the state's constitution.\n\nThe state will hold an Aug. 8 special election on Issue 1, a proposal that would change the rules for enacting new constitutional amendments. The issue is complicated and controversial, and groups on both sides of the fight are working to sell their pitch to voters.\n\nThe USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau compiled answers to reader questions and other information voters should know about the issue.\n\nHow to vote:Key dates to know for Ohio's August special election\n\nWhat would Issue 1 do?\n\nThe proposal, if approved, would require 60% of voters to pass a new constitutional amendment, instead of a simple majority of 50% plus one. It also would:\n\nRequire citizens who want to place an amendment on the ballot to collect signatures from at least 5% of voters from the last gubernatorial election in all 88 counties, instead of the current 44.\n\nEliminate a 10-day cure period that allows citizens to replace any signatures deemed faulty by the secretary of state's office.\n\nIssue 1 needs a simple majority to pass. If approved, the 60% threshold would take effect right away, and changes to signature gathering would be in place starting Jan. 1.\n\nDoes this only apply to citizen-proposed amendments?\n\nYes and no.\n\nThe 60% threshold would apply to amendments proposed by citizens and the Legislature. Changes to the signature-gathering process apply only to citizen amendments.\n\nThat's because lawmakers don't collect signatures to place amendments on the ballot. Instead, they must pass a resolution with a three-fifths majority in the House and Senate.\n\nWhat will my ballot look like?\n\nThe Ohio Ballot Board, which is tasked with setting language for ballot issues, approved the following language for Issue 1:\n\nDoes this apply to initiated statutes?\n\nIn addition to amendments, citizens can propose laws for the Legislature to consider before placing them on the ballot. This is known as the initiated statute process, and Issue 1 does not apply to that.\n\nThat means Issue 1 would not affect the current effort to legalize recreational marijuana in Ohio.\n\nWhat are people saying about Issue 1?\n\nProponents say these changes are necessary to protect the Ohio Constitution from special interests. They contend the constitution contains too many policies that aren't appropriate for the state's founding document, such as the location of casinos in Cincinnati, Columbus, Toledo and Cleveland.\n\nCritics say Issue 1 would make it harder for citizens to be heard, particularly when one party dominates state government. They also believe only well-funded groups could meet the new requirements and successfully put something on the ballot.\n\nThe issue's backers include anti-abortion groups, gun rights lobbyists and business organizations like the Ohio Chamber of Commerce and Ohio Restaurant Association.\n\nIssue 1 is opposed by unions, the Fraternal Order of Police and abortion rights advocates, among hundreds of other organizations. Both sides have attracted support from churches and religious groups.\n\nWhy now? And how does abortion fit in with this?\n\nAdvocates are working to put a ballot question before Ohio voters in November that would enshrine abortion access and other reproductive rights in the constitution.\n\nRepublican officials have openly said Issue 1 aims, in part, to keep that issue from passing. Michigan approved a similar measure in 2022 with 56.7% of the vote. Recent polling in Ohio suggests support for abortion sits over 50% but less than 60%.\n\nHas this idea been floated before?\n\nSimilar ideas for the constitution have been discussed, but were never executed. And they were typically discussed in tandem with reforms to encourage people to pick initiated statutes over changing the constitution.\n\nThe Ohio Constitutional Modernization Commission, established in 2011, debated whether to change the initiated statute process and increase the passage requirement for amendments to 55% of the vote. The commission ultimately decided against those changes before it disbanded in 2017.\n\nDo other states let citizens propose constitutional amendments?\n\nOhio is one of 16 states that allows citizens to take amendments directly to the ballot, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Ohioans sought that right 111 years ago as part of an effort to weed out corruption and make government more responsive.\n\nThe passage threshold varies in other states. Florida and Colorado are the only two states that consistently require a supermajority − 60% and 55%, respectively. In Illinois, an amendment can pass either with a majority of people voting in the whole election, or 60% of those voting on the amendment itself. Last year, Arizona voters approved a 60% threshold for any ballot measure involving taxes.\n\nA dozen other states, including Michigan, Missouri and California, require a simple majority for statewide ballot measures. Amendments in Nevada need a simple majority, but they must pass in two consecutive elections. Arkansas voters decided in November to retain a majority for amendments and rejected a proposal to increase it to 60%.\n\nHow many amendments have passed with at least 60%?\n\nOhio voters have approved 127 of the 227 amendments placed on the ballot since 1913. Seventy-six of them got at least 60% of the vote. Fifty-one amendments passed with a simple majority but fell short of 60%.\n\nThose numbers include amendments proposed by the Legislature and citizens. Lawmakers have sent more than twice as many amendments to the ballot than Ohioans.\n\nRead more here about what policies would and wouldn't be in place under a 60% threshold.\n\nHow can I vote?\n\nPolls will be open from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Aug. 8. Like any other election, you can also cast an absentee ballot by mail or vote early at your local board of elections. Visit voteohio.gov to register, request an absentee ballot find your polling location and find other information about voting. The deadline to register to vote is July 10. Early in-person voting starts July 11.\n\nKey election dates and deadlines are listed here.\n\nReminder: Ohio's new election law requires voters to present a photo ID if they vote in person.\n\nDidn't Ohio just restrict August elections?\n\nPart of that new law limits when special elections can be held in August. Specifically, it states that local governments and school districts can only conduct them if they're under a fiscal emergency. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Republican lawmakers championed the idea last year, arguing August elections are costly and generate low turnout.\n\nAs part of the effort to get Issue 1 on the ballot, Republicans initially planned to pass a separate bill to expand August special elections. They ditched that legislation after it stalled in the House and set the Aug. 8 election with a resolution alone.\n\nGOP leaders say the new law doesn't affect the Legislature's ability to set elections for proposed amendments, a power outlined in the constitution. The Ohio Supreme Court ultimately agreed and decided the Aug. 8 election can proceed after opponents sued over it.\n\nThe court's Democratic justices dissented from the decision, saying the Legislature can't flout the laws it creates.\n\nHow much will the election cost taxpayers?\n\nThe Ohio Senate budget includes $16 million for LaRose's office for the election. LaRose has said he can request additional funds from the state if it costs more.\n\nRead more about Issue 1 and the August election\n\nHaley BeMiller is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Columbus Dispatch, Cincinnati Enquirer, Akron Beacon Journal and 18 other affiliated news organizations across Ohio.\n\nIf you have questions about Issue 1, you can email her at hbemiller@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/maryland/2022/11/02/book-banning-resonates-as-an-issue-in-maryland-school-board-races/69606808007/", "title": "Book banning resonates as an issue in Maryland school board races", "text": "Abigail Warwick and Sasha Allen\n\nCapital News Service\n\nResting on the shelves of some public schools nationwide are two memoirs from LGBTQ+ authors detailing the growing pains they lived through while growing up and finding themselves.\n\nThose books — “Gender Queer” and “All Boys Aren’t Blue” — and others like them have become flash points in school board races nationwide, including in Maryland. Conservative candidates argue that drawings and passages in such books qualify as pornography.\n\n“Any book with pornographic material should not be on school library shelves,” Frederick County school board candidate Olivia Angolia said in response to a Capital News Service survey of the state's school board candidates. “There needs to be a vigorous process to review library books that are already adopted, and any prospective books.”\n\nBut Rae Gallagher, one of Rose’s opponents, offers a different take.\n\n“I am not in favor of banning books within FCPS,” Gallagher said. “The primary purpose of our public education system is to expose students to a variety of resources, perspectives and experiences to help them develop critical thinking skills and teach them how to think for themselves.”\n\nDisagreements like the one between Angolia and Gallagher can be found in school board races across the state. Conservative school board candidates who want to remove books dealing with gender identity, racism and other socially sensitive topics from school library shelves are running in at least 11 of Maryland’s 23 counties, according to a Capital News Service survey of the candidates.\n\nBut those socially conservative school board candidates are in the minority. About 25% of the 102 candidates who responded to the CNS survey said they favor banning some controversial books from school libraries — but about 41% opposed doing so. Meanwhile, about 30% chose a middle path, saying they trust the review process that screens books, or that they think that age should be a factor when deciding what is allowed in schools.\n\nThe scope of the debate\n\nSome of the books that are prompting the debate in Maryland and beyond are quite different from what your grandparents would borrow from their high school libraries.\n\n\"Gender Queer\" is a graphic novel by nonbinary author Maia Kobabe about finding one's gender identity and experiencing sex for the first time. “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is the story of a queer Black kid, George M. Johnson, who describes their first intimate sexual experience after being assaulted by classmates in a high school bathroom.\n\nHundreds of schools have already banned either one or both of the books. Maryland’s Wicomico County school board took action against “All Boys Aren’t Blue.”\n\n“We found two copies in two high school libraries and removed them. We had no objections about their removal,” said Ann Brittingham Suthowski, who is running for reelection in the county’s District 4.\n\nRELATED:Teacher shortage is issue that unites Maryland school board candidates, on right and left\n\n“Gender Queer” and “All Boys Aren’t Blue” are among the most banned books in the country, according to The New York Times and “All Boys Aren’t Blue” author Johnson’s website.\n\nHowever, the American Library Association this year released a survey that said 71% of voters are against any sort of book banning. The CNS survey shows plenty of Maryland candidates are against it, too.\n\n“No education has ever been furthered due to the banning of a book,” said Emily Jackson, a Talbot County candidate.\n\n'Education not indoctrination'\n\nIn addition to voicing concerns about books with sexual content, conservative candidates complain about “indoctrination” in books that, they say, promote critical race theory: a college-level academic theory that examines the impact racism has had on American history, laws and policies.\n\nIn Frederick County, three board candidates — Angolia, Nancy Allen and Cindy Rose — are running together as the “Education Not Indoctrination” slate. The 1776 Action PAC, a conservative group backing like-minded school board candidates nationwide, is backing the right-wing slate in Frederick County, as is Dan Cox, the Republican candidate for governor.\n\nRose said at an Oct. 14 school board meeting that she wants to ban 35 books from schools, the Frederick News-Post reported. The list, which can be found here, includes Kurt Vonnegut’s anti-war classic “Slaughterhouse Five” and “Jesus Land: A Memoir,” which details growing up in an interracial family, as well as several books with LGBTQ+ themes.\n\nRELATED:School board candidates cite learning loss, student performance as biggest issues\n\nThe conservative candidates object to \"Gender Queer\" because it includes a drawing of an older man and a younger man with their legs intertwined, along with a drawing of two young males engaged in a sexual act.\n\n“We recently got ‘Gender Queer’ removed from one of our school libraries. It’s not just vulgar, it meets the federal definition of ‘pornography,’ ” Rose said.\n\nStatewide, only 6.79% of school board candidate survey respondents mentioned LGBTQ+ content or one of the books — but 29.13% of candidates were concerned about sexually explicit literature.\n\nWorcester County candidate Katie Addis said such books have no place in school libraries..\n\n“Most of these books in question are meant for ‘young adults.’ I believe a young adult is someone 18-22 years old no longer enrolled in high school,” she said. “There are no ‘young adults’ enrolled at school, only minors.”\n\n'Regressive, myopic and detrimental'\n\nCandidates like those on the Education Not Indoctrination slate have prompted a backlash, both from progressive activists and candidates who say that such conservative candidates want to take schools back in time.\n\nIn Baltimore and Frederick counties, the Marylanders for Freedom and Opportunity PAC has launched an ad series pushing back on candidates with “divisive, dangerous platforms.”\n\n“Olivia Angolia, Nancy Allen, and Cindy Rose are pushing to censor our teachers and politicize our children’s education. Don’t let them take us in the wrong direction,” the ad says.\n\nThat concern about removing school library materials is shared by many candidates across the counties, including Jonathan Briggs, a candidate from Prince George's County’s District 2.\n\n“I am a firm believer that any book that challenges a student’s perspective is a good opportunity for them to ask questions and investigate the subject matter further to become more knowledgeable about it,\" Briggs said.\n\nSome candidates even said book banning is a blatant form of censorship.\n\n“Banning books is regressive, myopic and detrimental to society as well,” said Leonard Arvi, a candidate in Wicomico County’s District 3. “Banning books is a fascism and has no place in democratic, open society.”\n\nA middle way\n\nOther candidates offered a more nuanced approach to selecting or rejecting school library materials.\n\nSeveral candidates surveyed said that school library books should be age-appropriate, as determined by the media specialists the district employs. Many candidates referred to either the Maryland Library Blueprint or the American Association of School Libraries, both of which have guidelines regarding which books should be included in a public school’s library system.\n\nThe Maryland School Library Media Standards for Learners, Librarians and Libraries, from the Maryland Library Blueprint, does not explicitly state age minimums for certain genres or contents of books. Instead, the focus is on the overall curiosity and education level of the student.\n\nStill, several candidates said that what’s right for older students may not be right for younger students.\n\nWICOMICO SCHOOL BOARD:Wicomico school board candidates talk how history is taught, book censorship, safety\n\n“I never endorse banning books or free speech,” said Steve Whisler, a board candidate in Carroll County. “That said, I do firmly believe that we should limit student access to books that parents and educators deem not age-appropriate.”\n\nIn most counties, a book can be challenged by a parent or community member and it will be reviewed by the Board of Education. That’s exactly what happens in Montgomery County.\n\n“In the event that a parent or staff question the appropriateness of a book, an ad hoc evaluation committee is convened to reevaluate materials whose appropriateness has been questioned,” said Karla Silvestre , an incumbent at-large board member running for reelection in Montgomery County.\n\nBut that evaluation process should not strictly limit the kinds of books that students can read, said Jane E. Lichter, a board candidate in Baltimore County’s District 2.\n\n“It is critical that books are available for students to read about the world in which they live, as well as books that help students understand lives that are different than their own,” Lichter said.\n\nCNS reporters Danielle Hodes and Jenna Bloom contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/18/tombstone-gunfight-sparkler-spoiler-superbloom-news-around-states/111331402/", "title": "Tombstone gunfight, sparkler spoiler: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nColumbiana: A proposed toll bridge over Lay Lake that could spur economic development in central Alabama is drawing concerns from some residents and environmentalists. Some who live near the site on the Shelby-Talladega county line are worried about noise and traffic should the bridge be built, and the Alabama Rivers Alliance has raised questions about issues with construction and the long-term impact of quality of life in the area. Businessman Tim James proposed the bridge, which would link the counties across the Coosa River. He told WIAT-TV some noise is a small trade-off for the historic economic development a toll bridge would bring. A public involvement meeting is scheduled for Tuesday on the bridge, which has become a topic of discussion for state lawmakers as well. Last Wednesday, a bill was introduced that would require voter approval in counties considering toll bridges.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: More than 200 federally recognized tribes would also be officially recognized in the state under a bill that is gaining momentum with bipartisan support. The bill is largely symbolic and would not change how tribal governments already operate, as each of the 229 Native Alaska tribes is already federally recognized, lawmakers said. The legislation would instead enshrine in state law what has been the status of these tribes for years and formally recognize tribal sovereignty. “Just a simple act of recognition can heal decades of hurt,” said Richard Chalyee Eesh Peterson, president of the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska. “One of the things that will happen for the larger community of Alaska, this will normalize the thought of tribes as sovereigns.”\n\nArizona\n\nTombstone: Doc Holliday’s Saloon has challenged the state liquor department’s ruling that the saloon didn’t adequately control firearms within its establishment. That claim, historians will note, was the also the chief concern of the bar’s namesake, John Henry “Doc” Holliday, when he lived in Tombstone in the late 1800s. That dispute, in which Holliday and three other lawmen looked to disarm a group of cowboys by the OK Corral, ended badly. In the current case, the liquor department ordered Doc Holliday’s to temporarily close its swinging doors for two weeks because of four incidents that it asserted violated liquor laws. Three involved weapons; two ended with someone being shot. After one shooting incident, the department’s report noted, the saloon seemed to celebrate with a sign outside that suggested beer was a necessity following a shooting. Doc Holliday remains open for business while it appeals the order.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The city will hold a public meeting at 6p.m. Tuesday at City Hall to discuss a proposed community center. Under a proposal presented to the City Council earlier this month, the facility would include an indoor aquatic center and an outdoor water park in addition to the community center. It would be built at McCabe Park along U.S. Highway 62 West. The plan includes upgrades or renovations – some big, some small – to almost every park under the City of Mountain Home umbrella and carries an estimated $38 million price tag. The proposed indoor aquatic center would be 22,300 square feet and include a competition lap pool, a heated therapy pool and a kids’ play pool. The proposed outdoor water park would feature a diving pool, a shallow play area for small children, water slides and a lazy river.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLake Elsinore: Southern California’s dry winter isn’t good for wildflowers – and that’s OK with officials in this city where last spring’s “superbloom” of poppies drew huge crowds. Riverside County parks official Dustin McLain said the chances of a superbloom in Walker Canyon this year are small because January was dry, and February has started off the same way, The Press-Enterprise reports. Lake Elsinore Mayor Brian Tisdale is hoping the big bloom doesn’t occur. “That kind of attention – even though it’s probably the most beautiful thing in Southern California – has an overwhelming impact on the local community,” he told the newspaper. Last March, after a very wet winter, throngs of people flocked to Walker Canyon. Interstate 15 was jammed for miles in both directions, and streets of the small city were gridlocked. At one point, the city closed the canyon and then barred cars from the area, requiring visitors to pay for shuttle rides to the floral extravaganza.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A ban prohibiting pit bulls in the city is expected to remain in place after the mayor announced plans to veto legislation that would have lifted the dog breed restriction. Mayor Michael Hancock said Friday that he expects to veto a repeal on the ban, citing concerns that the ordinance does not fully address the risk of injury resulting from attacks from these particular dog breeds, the Denver Post reports. “The reality is that irresponsible pet owners continue to be a problem, and it is the irresponsible owners and their dogs I must consider in evaluating the overall impact of this ordinance,” Hancock said. City Council is scheduled to vote Tuesday and must acquire nine votes to override the veto, but the repeal measure only passed the council with seven votes when first introduced, city officials said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A female high school student defeated a transgender female athlete in a state championship race, just two days after a lawsuit was filed in an effort to block transgender athletes from participating in girls sports in the state. Chelsea Mitchell, of Canton High School, won the Class S 55-meter dash title Friday night with a time of 7.18 seconds, edging Terry Miller of Bloomfield High School. Miller, a transgender athlete, finished at 7.20 seconds. The families of Mitchell and two other female high school runners filed the federal lawsuit Wednesday, arguing that allowing athletes with male anatomy to compete has deprived them of track titles and scholarship opportunities. The Hartford Courant reports Miller and Mitchell did not interact before or after the race. “I clapped because, for me, I’m not a hater,” Miller said. “When you take a win, you take the win. And even if you don’t respect me, I’ll respect you.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The air temperature was hanging around freezing when 130 people stepped out of the The Queen Wilmington over the weekend for the second annual Cupid’s Undie Run, most only in their skivvies. The outdoor portion of the event, the namesake run, took panty- or boxer-clad participants on a jog from 5th Street to 10th Street and back to the warm Queen on Saturday. “It’s a fun run, so people run in their underwear or a costume,” organizer Caroline Mouldsdale said, adding that the pre-run partying inside The Queen made the cold a little easier to handle. “It’s a little chilly, but we’ve been dancing and having fun.” The run is in its 10th year nationwide, Mouldsdale said. It’s earned $18 million for the Children’s Tumor Foundation, which is seeking a cure for neurofibromatosis. “The founders who came up with the Cupid’s Undie Run decided if these children (with neurofibromatosis) were going to uncomfortable in their skin every day, then we can go out and be uncomfortable in our skin,” she said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Momentum is building in the nation’s capital for the creation of a museum dedicated to American women’s history, WUSA-TV reports. The House has passed a bill to establish the museum inside the Smithsonian network and take steps toward funding and construction. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.C., was the main sponsor of the Smithsonian Women’s History Museum Act. 374 Congress members voted for the House bill, while only 37 voted against it. A similar bill is working its way through the Senate. If approved, it could take a decade or more to finalize funding, design and construction of the museum.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Officials say 211.6 million gallons of sewage has spilled into city waterways in the past few months. The Sun-Sentinel reports that’s enough to fill 320 Olympic-sized pools. The city’s aging sewer pipes broke six times in December and spewed 126.9 million gallons of sewage – ranking as one of South Florida’s biggest spills ever. The spills fouled the Tarpon River, the Himmarshee Canal and streets in three neighborhoods. According to what officials told the state Department of Environmental Protection, 79.3 million gallons spilled into George English Lake over a 10-day period that began Jan. 30 and ended Feb. 8. Then an additional 5.4 million gallons flooded streets near a park right across from a popular mall. In recent weeks, crews also have rushed to fix another string of water main breaks, forcing the city to warn residents to boil their tap water before drinking, brushing their teeth or washing dishes.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The demand for parking at the nation’s busiest airport has declined with the rise of Uber, Lyft and other ride-hailing services, airport officials say. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is shelving plans to demolish and rebuild its parking decks at the domestic terminal. The airport developed plans several years ago to double the size of the Terminal South and Terminal North decks, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. But airport officials eventually downscaled those plans. Airport parking revenue had begun to decline in 2019, Hartsfield-Jackson General Manager John Selden said at the time. Last week, Selden told a City Council committee that revenue has continued to decrease. Airport car rentals also have declined, he said. “People are just not parking,” he said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Possession of small amounts of drugs that are considered dangerous would be decriminalized in the state under a proposed bill, potentially reducing the amount of money spent on enforcement. The legislation would make it a misdemeanor instead of a felony offense to possess less than 2 grams of dangerous drugs such as methamphetamine, heroin, morphine and cocaine. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing Friday, after which the bill was amended to increase the amount of drugs from one-sixteenth of an ounce to 2 grams, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Enforcement of the offense of promotion of a dangerous drug in the third-degree costs state taxpayers over $13 million each year to incarcerate low-level, non-violent offenders,” the bill says. “Hawaii’s experience corroborates mounting national data demonstrating that incarceration has no effect on rates of drug use or overdose deaths, but actually increases recidivism among those at low risk to reoffend.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An Idaho Transportation Department employee died as he worked along U.S. Highway 20 in southeast Idaho. Mark Reinke, 56, was killed Thursday when his backhoe was struck from behind by a semitractor about 5 miles outside Arco, the Idaho Statesman reports. The semi was traveling west. Reinke was wearing a seat belt but was fatally injured. He died about 7 a.m., the department announced in a press release. Reinke began working for the Idaho Transportation Department last summer. He is the 40th employee to die on the job since 1960.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Nearly a dozen public housing authorities in the area will receive $75 million in federal funding for development, financing and modernization, federal officials said. The money is coming through a capital program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Development. The bulk of the funding, nearly $65 million, will go to the Chicago Housing Authority. Other recipients including housing authorities in Joliet, Aurora, North Chicago, Waukegan, Kankakee and Oak Park. “This federal funding gives local agencies in the Chicagoland region the ability to offer safe and affordable housing to those who need it most,” U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin said in a joint news release with U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth. “In addition, the local economy stands to benefit from this investment in infrastructure projects that will bring safety and modernization to the area’s public housing.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Road crews are getting a new weapon in their endless task of filling potholes: special heaters that should make their road-patching chores easier, especially in cold weather. The city’s Department of Public Works recently acquired two infrared P200 asphalt heaters to assist with road repairs. The new machinery essentially heats up the asphalt, making it easier for crews to fix segments of pavement that are falling apart. The department says the machinery will heat dry pavement to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing crews to remove buckled or decaying asphalt and smooth it over more effortlessly. Workers will pull the heaters behind their trucks so they can cover long swaths at a time. “We’re excited to continue putting tools in the hands of our street maintenance crews that go above and beyond simple filling operations,” DPW Director Dan Parker said in a news release. The machinery is being tested and will be used on roads in the coming weeks.\n\nIowa\n\nClayton: A northeast Iowa company that wanted to withdraw 2billion gallons of water annually from the Jordan aquifer to send to drought-stricken western states has pulled its permit request. Pattison Sand Co. notified the state Department of Natural Resources on Feb. 12 that it was pulling its permit request, which had garnered significant concern from lawmakers and environmental groups. Before the Pattison proposal, the agency had never received a request to move so much water outside of the state, the Iowa DNR said, although it has allowed rural water groups to serve communities across the border in neighboring states. The Iowa DNR wrote Pattison in a Feb. 4 letter that the agency planned to reject the request, saying it would have “a negative impact on the long-term availability of Iowa’s water resources.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s elections chief is pushing to make Kansas’ central voter registration database more secure by changing how counties tap into it, but some officials are nervous about what they see as a big project in a busy election year. Secretary of State Scott Schwab has told county election officials he wants them to use dedicated tablets, laptops or computers not linked to their counties’ networks to access the state’s voter registration database. He says Kansas is getting $8 million in federal election security funds that could be used to cover the costs. Schwab, a Republican and former Kansas House member from the Kansas City area who became the state’s top elections official last year, contends such a setup will decrease the likelihood of foreign nationals, foreign governments or domestic hackers gaining access to voter registration records. His idea has bipartisan support. But even some county election officials who agree Schwab’s initiative would make voter registration records more secure see it as a huge undertaking.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State transportation officials will be out more than $150,000 after losing a legal battle to a man who wanted to put “IM GOD” on his license plate. In November, a federal judge in Frankfort gave Ben Hart the OK to get the controversial license plate after a three-year legal battle against the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Hart applied for the license in 2016 but was denied because it didn’t “meet requirements.” Kentucky statute allows for personalized license plates as long as the letters do not discriminate against anyone because of their sex, race, color, religion or nationality. In Hart’s case, the court ruled that vanity plates were private speech and therefore protected by the First Amendment. On Monday, a judge ordered the defendants in Hart’s case to pay out $150,715.50 in lawyer fees and another $491.24 for additional court costs.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana State University’s Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Joe Burrow has a new honor to add to his long list of awards and achievements: He inspired the name of the newest male giraffe at the capital city’s zoo. A public naming competition selected the name Burreaux – a Cajun-inspired spelling of Burrow’s last name – for the giraffe calf born Dec. 26. The Baton Rouge Zoo announced the selection Friday, saying the public chose the winning name from three options: Romeo, Burreaux and Kiume, a Swahili word meaning masculine and strong. Zoo staff took nominations for the names and narrowed them to the finalists. The public voted with donations, which the zoo said raised more than $2,000 that will go to its conservation efforts. Burrow is LSU’s most decorated quarterback, leading the Tigers to a national championship victory earlier this year. He’s widely expected to be the top player taken in the 2020 NFL draft.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: The new executive director of a museum dedicated to the indigenous people of Maine is a professional educator and member of the Passamaquoddy Tribe. The Abbe Museum in Bar Harbor will be led by Christopher Newell, the museum’s trustees announced last week. The museum documents Wabanaki culture, history and art. Newell was born and raised in Indian Township, Maine, and worked for five years as education supervisor for the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center in Connecticut. He also served as senior adviser on the documentary “Dawnland,” which focused on the Maine-Wabanaki State Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Abbe Museum was founded in 1926 and is also the site of the annual Abbe Museum Indian Market in Bar Harbor.\n\nMaryland\n\nGlen Burnie: Police have arrested a woman suspected of throwing a Molotov cocktail into a place of worship for Jehovah’s Witnesses, according to court records. Heather Meisel, 43, was charged Friday after she told investigators she damaged the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Glen Burnie to “send a message,” the Capital Gazette reports. Meisel, a Baltimore County resident, was arrested on charges including attempted murder and defacement of religious property. Anne Arundel County fire investigators found a door with broken glass and a Molotov cocktail made from an apple cider vinegar bottle inside the building Thursday morning. Police estimated the incident caused more than $1,000 in damage to the building’s front door and more than $1,000 in damage to property inside the building. Meisel resisted arrest and told officers she was “royalty,” charging documents said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bill making its way through the Statehouse would require schools to provide free disposable menstrual products to students. Under the proposal, all “elementary and secondary public schools in the commonwealth serving students in any grade from grade six through grade twelve shall provide disposable menstrual products in the restrooms” of school buildings. The products would be provided at no charge. The bill also requires school districts to make sure the products “shall be available in a convenient manner that does not stigmatize any student seeking such product.” The bill has received the backing of the Legislature’s Education Committee but has yet to come up for a vote in either the Massachusetts House or Senate. Advocates say the availability of free pads and tampons in schools helps chip away at any stigma surrounding the products and makes the products available to students who may not be able to afford them.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is urging businesses to give their workers the day off on Election Day by making it a company holiday. Benson said she’s encouraging companies to give employees the day off work Nov. 3 so they can vote and work as poll workers. She praised Wayne State University for recently announcing such a move, MLive.com reports. “That’s the direction we should be moving in,” Benson said. State Rep. Darrin Camilleri, D-Brownstown, has a bill pending before the Legislature that would make regularly scheduled election days in May, August and November state holidays. When the state makes days like Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Presidents Day state holidays, he said, “many other businesses end up following suit.” “I think that we want to make it as broad as possible, as easy as possible for people to participate in our elections,” Camilleri said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The GOP minority in the state House announced a slate of bills Monday aimed at reducing violent crime in Minneapolis and St. Paul and on the Metro Transit system, drawing a sharp retort from Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. The proposals include higher penalties for gang members who use guns in crimes, boosting funding against gangs and drug trafficking, requiring major sports and entertainment venues to have sufficient police nearby, and increased enforcement on the light rail system. House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, of Crown, and other Republican leaders said at a news conference that their constituents from greater Minnesota and the Twin Cities suburbs worry about their safety when attending sporting and entertainment events in the cities. Frey accused the Republican lawmakers of trying to make public safety a partisan issue and of spreading misinformation while providing too little financial assistance.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: The first part of the state’s recreational red snapper season will run from May 22 through July 12. A midseason closure will let the Department of Marine Resources and the related commission analyze data and decide how to manage the remaining quota, officials said in a news release Wednesday. Mississippi is allocating 151,500 pounds of the popular sport and table fish – about 3.5% of the total quota for private anglers in the Gulf of Mexico, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries. Private anglers with the appropriate Mississippi licenses can fish in federal waters off the state’s coast. Recreational charter boats with Mississippi licenses are restricted to state waters because federal authorities still regulate for-hire boats in federal waters.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The Missouri Pork Association and Missouri Farm Bureau say they support the state conservation department’s approach to trying to eradicate feral hogs. Don Nikodim, director of Missouri Pork Association, said Friday that the association backs the Missouri Department of Conservation’s emphasis on trapping feral hogs rather than opening MDC lands for hunting the destructive animals. MDC banned feral hog hunting on its properties in 2016, a controversial move that’s been opposed by many hunters and landowners. Nikodim said he believes MDC is making good progress with its trapping efforts, although the agency could use more trapping teams to be even more effective. In its 2020 policy statement, the Missouri Farm Bureau also says it supports federal and state feral hog eradication efforts in Missouri. “We believe feral hogs are an unacceptable risk to humans, livestock, crops, and property. We believe eradication of all feral hogs is the ultimate goal,” the Farm Bureau says on its website.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials have been confronted over the past several months by a recurring problem of graffiti at numerous parks and recreational facilities around Cascade County. The department is now seeking the public’s help in identifying who’s responsible for the vandalism. Spray-painted blue and red hearts began appearing last August at six locations, including Giant Springs, Sluice Boxes and the First Peoples’ Buffalo Jump state parks. The damage has now been cataloged in 10 areas and has expanded to include an image of a palmetto tree and a crescent, similar to the South Carolina state flag. “It’s been pretty consistent with the blue hearts and the red hearts,” said FWP Game Warden Kqyn Kuka. “Then recently there’s been this new image. We don’t know if they’re related or not, but it’s the same color paint, so I’m assuming they’re connected.” The graffiti is typically located in high, remote locations – difficult to access but clearly visible to the general public.\n\nNebraska\n\nEricson: State banking officials have closed Ericson State Bank in north-central Nebraska, declaring it insolvent. The Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance announced the closure in a news release Friday night, saying it had named the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver of the bank. To protect depositors, the FDIC entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with Farmers and Merchants Bank in Milford to assume all of the deposits of Ericson State Bank. Ericson bank will be open for business Tuesday under the name Farmers and Merchants Bank, the release says. Ericson State Bank account holders can access their money by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards, the department said. Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed, and loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Officials say the number of weddings in Clark County has been declining. The county had 73,000 weddings last year – more than a 40% drop from 2004, when 128,000 ceremonies occurred. County Clerk Lynn Goya cites an overall decline in advertising to push the industry and available options for consumers. Authorities tell Las Vegas TV station KVVU that some initiatives to push wedding tourism in the county include the possible creation of a “Wedding Way” from the Neon Museum to the Strat, allocating development funds to historic chapels for renovations, and a Wedding Walk of Fame to showcase famous celebrity weddings. Other campaigns include wedding photography contests, personal testimonies from married couples and a dive into the history of Vegas weddings.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: It’s time to count the turkeys again. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department is asking the public to report sightings of wild turkeys through March 31 for its annual winter flock survey. Last year, the department got 486 reports totaling 9,833 birds. Officials say that was fewer than the previous year, likely because turkeys were on the move. With relatively little snow, turkeys were able to move around more and weren’t staying in one place to be counted. Participants are asked to report the number of turkeys in the flock, their location, the type of habitat in which the birds were observed and on what the turkeys were feeding. Officials also are interested in any signs of two viruses that have appeared in turkeys in recent years, with symptoms including warty protuberances in the head and eye area. Wild turkeys had disappeared from the state after over-hunting and habitat loss in the 1800s but have rebounded to an estimated population of 40,000.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nElizabeth: Officials say they are “trying to rebuild” following a fire that ripped through a church that dates back almost a century and a half. Robert Ingram, who organized a GoFundMe campaign, said everything had been lost in the “devastating and tragic” blaze early Sunday at Shiloh Baptist Church. “Instead of waking up and being able to go to church, we woke up to this,” Ingram said. “Now we’re trying to rebuild.” Chief Thomas McNamara of the city’s fire department said the church was “pretty much destroyed.” Arriving fire crews reported the church fully engulfed in flames, and the back of the structure collapsed as crews worked to try to protect nearby buildings, officials said. The church’s Facebook page lists its founding date as November 1879. Gov. Phil Murphy said in a message on Twitter that he was “devastated” by the fire and expressed thanks to first responders. The cause of the fire is under investigation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Statistics show accidental shootings are on the rise in the city. The Albuquerque Journal reports 37 accidental shootings reported last year compared to 14 recorded in 2018. The figure doesn’t include three suspected accidental shootings in which someone died. Two of those cases have been handed over to the District Attorney’s Office for a final determination, and the third ended in prison time for a young man. The rise in accidental shootings comes at a time when the topic of gun access and availability looms large in the eyes of local politicians and the community as a whole as homicide numbers in Albuquerque hit a record high last year. Local concerns have sparked initiatives aimed at stemming gun violence, such as the so-called red flag bill that is awaiting the governor’s signature. Local gun shop owners say there has been an increase in the purchase of guns in the past year, especially over the internet.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A judge has ordered the developers of an under-construction condo tower to remove several floors from the top of the building because it is too tall. State Supreme Court Justice W. Franc Perry’s ruling last week instructs the Department of Buildings to revoke the building permit for the nearly completed tower on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and remove floors that exceed the zoning limit, The New York Times reports. The number of floors to be removed from the 52-story tower is not yet known, but the newspaper said it could be 20 or more. A lawyer representing the project said the developers would appeal the Feb. 13 decision. The building’s 112 luxury apartments are now being marketed, including a $21 million penthouse, which would likely be removed if the decision stands, the Times reports.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: This island on North Carolina’s Outer Banks that was ravaged by a hurricane last year is getting $2 million in grants to help it rebuild. The Virginian-Pilot reports Ocracoke received the grant money from the Golden Leaf Foundation, a nonprofit that was established from a tobacco settlement to help the state’s rural and economically distressed communities. Hurricane Dorian pummeled Ocracoke in September with the worst flooding on record. Most of the buildings on the island were damaged. The island’s only school received $900,000 to help rebuild and elevate buildings. The foundation also provided half a million dollars to build a new emergency medical building that was flooded. And Hyde County received $277,400 to repair the Ocracoke Seafood Co. building. The Ocracoke Seafood Co. is owned by a nonprofit organization that serves as the base for more than 30 watermen.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A freshman congressman who spent much of his first term defending President Donald Trump during impeachment hearings said Monday that he wants to return to Washington and begin working on practical issues. Republican Rep. Kelly Armstrong formally announced his reelection bid Monday by telling supporters he’ll work with Democrats on bills involving prescription drug prices, immigration and criminal justice reform. The state’s lone House member said he won’t budge on support for gun rights and opposition to abortion and federal regulations that would stifle North Dakota’s energy and agriculture sectors. Armstrong predicted that voters will opt for Republican majorities in the House and Senate and give Trump another four years.\n\nOhio\n\nKent: Jane Fonda is among the speakers tapped to mark the 50th anniversary of the Kent State shootings. The 82-year-old actress and activist will highlight four days of events the university has planned to explore the lasting impacts of the events of May 4, 1970, which were considered pivotal in turning public sentiment against the Vietnam War. On that day, the Ohio National Guard fired on students during an anti-war protest, killing four and injuring nine others. Fonda was one of the most prominent figures of the anti-war movement, though also one of the most divisive. Fonda plans to reflect on that era, her life in social activism and the legacy of the Kent State shootings during her speech May 3. The event is free and open to the public, but tickets must be reserved in advance. The commemoration marks the first time students, faculty, university staff and leadership, and May 4 survivors and family members have united around the idea that the date should be forever honored, planners said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The venerable Red Earth Festival is leaving the city even as organizers plan to launch a new event downtown, as well as a series of statewide collaborative celebrations of Native American art and culture. Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell and Mayor David Holt joined members of the staff and board of directors of the nonprofit Red Earth Inc. on Monday morning to reveal the changes. The organization’s marquee event – the long-running Red Earth Festival, an intertribal celebration of Native American visual art, dance and culture – will move from its longtime home in downtown Oklahoma City to the Grand Event Center at the Grand Casino Hotel & Resort in Shawnee for its 2020 edition, scheduled for June 13-14. A favorite aspect of the summer festival, the popular Red Earth Parade, will be staying in Oklahoma City but shifting to autumn, as Red Earth Inc. will launch a significant new event to mark Oklahoma City’s Indigenous Peoples Day.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Officials at the Oregon Department of Forestry say just seven months into the state’s two-year budget cycle, they’ve spent most of the money lawmakers approved for the entire biennium and now need an emergency cash infusion. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports agency officials say they need between $52 million and $132 million, or they’ll have exhausted their budget by March. The request comes as lawmakers and the governor are looking to expand the agency even further, sponsoring bills that would bolster the agency’s firefighting capabilities and forest restoration work – above and beyond the immediate budget requests. In the near term, agency leaders are looking for a minimum of $52 million and as much as $132 million, money they say is needed to keep keep regular programs running; to pay a consultant hired to help them get their financial house in order; and to cover firefighting costs in the upcoming 2020 fire season.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Outdoorsy Pennsylvanians can soon keep their fishing license in a pocket rather than having to attach it to an outer garment. The regulation amendment approved recently by the board of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission adjusts a long-standing rule on license display. The new policy goes into effect once it is published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. The executive director of the commission, Tim Schaeffer, said the change will make things more convenient for anglers and decrease the number of lost licenses and the personal cost that goes into replacing them. The change also aligns fishing display regulations with those of hunting licenses.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: British actor and comedian John Cleese, who once portrayed an inept hotel manager in the series “Fawlty Towers,” has complained about his treatment at a Rhode Island hotel. Cleese, 80, tweeted Sunday to his 5.7 million followers that he was cold inside his room at the Omni Providence Hotel and that the hotel staff could do nothing to help him. He later posted that his tweeting had worked and that the hotel had fixed the problem. The hotel told the Providence Journal its engineering staff was dispatched to resolve the issue shortly after receiving Cleese’s complaint. In “Fawlty Towers,” Cleese played the manager of a substandard English hotel who was known to express disdain toward “that annoying section of the general public who insist on staying at hotels.” Cleese, who also is a founding member of the comedy troupe Monty Python, tweeted that he believed his problem in Providence, where he performed Sunday, was resolved because “I have the power to tweet. But NOT, of course, because I am a member of the public. So much for corporate America.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nUnion: The Union County Council voted to ask its sheriff to step down after a state police report said he requested employees to buy him alcohol while on duty and made sexually inappropriate comments. But the council has no power to fire Sheriff David Taylor, who released a statement after the vote saying he plans to serve until the end of his term in December. “I was elected by the majority of the voters to serve out my four-year term, and that is my intent,” Taylor said in a statement sent to the Herald-Journal of Spartanburg. A prosecutor who reviewed the report by the State Law Enforcement Division didn’t recommend criminal charges, saying Taylor didn’t get any personal financial benefit from his office mismanagement. Taylor said while some of the allegations in the report were true, many others weren’t. He asked for the state investigation after reports of financial problems emerged in 2018.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State lawmakers said they would turn their focus to the state budget this week as they hit the halfway mark in the 2020 session, though Republicans and Democrats laid out different visions of how to use that money. Legislators settled on roughly $1.74 billion in revenue to use in setting the state budget – an increase of $19 million from Gov. Kristi Noem’s projection in December. Once combined with federal funding and other state funds, the budget will likely total more than $5 billion. But Democrats, who hold just three spots on the committee that decides the size of the budget, were not pleased with the final projections, saying Republicans were being too cautious with the estimates. Democrats want the state to fund inflationary pay increases for teachers, state employees and service care providers.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga plans to offer discounted tuition starting this fall to students from nine surrounding states. University officials said the goal of the new regional tuition program is to attract and retain diverse talent in the area as well as reach enrollment goals laid out for the University of Tennessee system, The Chattanooga Times Free Press reports. Under the program, students from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia would pay about $18,000 a year instead of about $26,000 a year as out-of-state students. An existing program that offers tuition discounts to residents of neighboring counties in Georgia and Alabama would remain in effect. The university has an enrollment of nearly 11,700 students. About 10% of those are from outside Tennessee.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: A Monday morning fire at a Citgo refinery in the city was extinguished with no injuries, according to the petroleum company. The fire began in a pipeline owned by a third party shortly after 8:30 a.m. and was put out shortly before 11 a.m. with “no threat to the surrounding community,” Citgo said in a statement. The owner of the pipeline has not been identified. Corpus Christi Fire Chief Robert Rocha said the fire forced the closure of Interstate 37 in the south Texas city, but it had since reopened. People in nearby homes and businesses were ordered to shelter in place until air-quality monitoring found the air to be safe. “We’re still trying to figure out what happened,” Rocha said. “We encountered heavy fire conditions coming from a buried pipeline” after responding to the blaze. Rocha said no one was injured as a result of the fire.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: An important dinosaur site that has fallen into neglect would be protected as Utah’s 45th state park under a measure being proposed in the Legislature. The bill would create Utahraptor State Park in the Dalton Wells Quarry, about 15 miles north of Moab, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The quarry is where the first fossils of Utahraptor, the state’s official dinosaur, and other unique species were found. State Paleontologist Jim Kirkland said the site, west of Arches National Park, has massive deposits of dinosaur bones from at least 10 species found nowhere else in North America. “It’s a gold mine of new dinosaurs,” Kirkland said. “There are 30 that we know are only in Moab Valley.” Grand County leaders have long wanted to safeguard the quarry. There is now unregulated recreational use in Dalton Wells, and the site has been subjected to litter and vandalism. It’s also the site of a Civilian Conservation Corps work camp that was used as an internment camp for Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A legislative committee has approved major changes to the state’s development review law known as Act 250. The House Natural Resources Committee voted 6-3 with two members absent to approve the overhaul after more than a year of work, Vermont Public Radio reports. The bill would exempt developments in designated downtowns from Act 250 review and boost protections to wildlife connector areas. It also would require projects above 2,000 feet to undergo Act 250 review. The legislation stems from an agreement reached between Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s administration and Vermont Natural Resources Council, an environmental group. The bill is better because it will limit dividing Vermont’s forest through piecemeal development, said Brian Shupe, VNRC’s executive director.\n\nVirginia\n\nChesapeake: This southeastern Virginia city has surpassed Norfolk to become the state’s second-most-populous city. The Virginian-Pilot reports Chesapeake has reached an estimated population of 245,745 people, according to the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. Norfolk’s population is just over 245,000 residents. Chesapeake’s population has grown by more than 10% in the past decade. Norfolk’s has ticked up by less than 1%. The center estimates Richmond will also likely overtake Norfolk. Hamilton Lombard, a demographer with the Cooper Center, said one reason behind Chesapeake’s growth is that the city has lots of space for new homes, while Norfolk does not. Virginia Beach is still the state’s most populous city with an estimated 452,643 residents. The populations of the seven Hampton Roads cities constitute nearly a fifth of the state’s population.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: An Asian elephant that spent more than 20 years at Tacoma’s Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium was euthanized Saturday night after a “severe decline in her health,” zoo officials announced. Hanoko the elephant was 56, the Tacoma News Tribune reports. Veterinarians in 2018 diagnosed Hanoko with cancer and with tuberculosis in 2019. She suffered from advanced joint disease and had stopped eating her regular diet, zoo officials said. She showed signs of “significant discomfort” despite pain medication, officials said. The median life expectancy is 47 for female Asian elephants in human care, zoo officials said in the announcement, citing statistics from the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. “With Hanako’s advanced age, significant and chronic medical conditions, and severe decline in health, euthanasia was the humane decision,” said Dr. Karen Wolf, the zoo’s head veterinarian.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Women and lawmakers on Monday commemorated the 100th anniversary of the state’s ratification of the 19th Amendment that gave women the right to vote. Hundreds of women attended various ceremonies at the state Capitol in Charleston. In the Rotunda, a reenactor portrayed Susan B. Anthony in a speech given during Anthony’s trial in New York for voting in an 1872 presidential election. An evening reception was planned at the state Culture Center to recognize female lawmakers. On March 10, 1920, West Virginia became the 34th state to ratify the amendment. Later that year, Tennessee provided the necessary three-fourths majority by becoming the 36th state to ratify women’s suffrage.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Miller Park has generated $2.5billion for the economies of the city of Milwaukee and the state of Wisconsin, according to a new study commissioned by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce. The study, conducted by Conventions, Sports & Leisure International, was released Monday by the MMAC. It comes as the original Miller Park lease is in its 20th and final year, and the five-county sales tax that helped build and maintain the stadium is about to reach its sunset, long after originally expected. The study says the construction and continued operation of Miller Park generated $1.6 billion in direct spending, a total of 1,835 in annual jobs and $1.2 billion in personal earnings. The $2.5 billion overall impact represents “cumulative net new impacts” that would not have been realized without the existence of the Milwaukee Brewers and Miller Park, the report says.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: An attempt to break a world record for the most sparklers lit simultaneously failed on a technicality. Guinness World Records officials ruled each participant was required to light their own sparkler during the attempt in Gillette, The Gillette News Record reports. The August effort was part of the Pyrotechnics Guild International’s 50th annual convention. The event had an apparatus for lighting multiple sparklers, which was built by students and instructors at Gillette College. Volunteers with torches lit sparklers and distributed them to participants. More than 1,700 people attended, and 2,500 sparklers were lit. The current record is 1,713. Basic guidelines are listed on the Guinness website, but the specific guidelines were not received prior to the attempt. “It’s a bummer, but that just means we have to do it again,” says Christen Burdette of the the Campbell County Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/12/weeding-robots-goat-lottery-liquor-shortage-news-around-states/117484386/", "title": "Weeding robots, goat lottery: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state agency said Friday that it will work with private organizations to encourage more elderly and disabled people to get vaccines for COVID-19, which is on the rise as the state’s inoculation rate trails the nation. With Alabama ahead of only Mississippi in vaccinations and just 30% of the state’s population fully inoculated against the illness caused by the coronavirus, the Alabama Department of Senior Services said a new marketing campaign was aimed at overcoming vaccine hesitancy. The agency will work with local agencies for the aging and disability organizations to encourage more people to get shots. A telephone hotline will allow people to reach local services and make vaccination appointments, which has been difficult for some disabled people. Vaccination rates have dropped statewide to the lowest point since early this year, when doses were scarce, and only certain people were eligible to receive shots. While less than a third of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, precautions like face masks and social distancing are increasingly rare in the state. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are rising in a trend that is troubling to health experts. State statistics showed 252 people were being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals Thursday compared to a low of 166 late last month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge is scheduled to hear arguments Monday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a voter-approved initiative that would end party primaries in Alaska and institute ranked-choice voting in general elections. Scott Kohlhaas, who unsuccessfully ran for a state House seat last year as a Libertarian; Bob Bird, chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party; Bird’s party; and Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus sued in December, shortly after the initiative was approved. In court documents, they say people “exercise their right of free political association by forming political parties for the purpose of electing candidates” and advancing issues and principles. They call the new voter-approved system a “political experiment” and say it was designed in a way to harm political parties. They cite concerns that candidates for minor parties, like the Alaskan Independence Party, could get “lost in the shuffle” in a primary where all candidates are listed on one ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. Attorneys for the state Department of Law in court documents say the plaintiffs’ opposition includes a mix of policy arguments and speculation. They say the claims raised by the plaintiffs “rest on a misunderstanding” of what the initiative does, according to court filings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Friday signed legislation banning state or local governments from requiring training in “critical race theory” and a bill creating a new small-business income tax category that will allow small-business owners to avoid paying any of the 3.5% income tax surcharge voters approved in November. The new small-business tax is expected to cut $292 million from the original $836 million schools would have received under Proposition 208, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. Backers of the initiative have vowed to block the new law by referring it to the ballot. Ducey also signed a measure that tightens the state’s sex education law and requires parents to give permission for instruction that includes sexual issues in non-sex ed classes. The broad requirement would block discussions of historic events that have a sexual component, like the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, considered the genesis of the modern gay rights movement, or even the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, without parental preapproval. “Parents should have the right to know what their children are learning in school,” Ducey said in a statement. “This is a no-brainer piece of legislation that protects our children from learning materials that aren’t suited for them.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas State Police on Friday handed over to prosecutors the results of the agency’s investigation into a deputy’s fatal shooting of a white teenager that has drawn the attention of civil rights activists nationwide. Lonoke County Prosecutor Chuck Graham said his office received the case file on the shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain by Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy Sgt. Michael Davis during a June 23 traffic stop. Graham said the file has been taken to the state prosecutor coordinator since he’s requested a special prosecutor to handle the case. Authorities have released few details about the shooting, and State Police earlier Friday referred questions about the case file to Graham’s office. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and holding a jug of antifreeze at the time of the shooting. Prosecutor Coordinator Bob McMahan said a special prosecutor should be named early this week. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath. The Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for efforts to reform police practices.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBurbank: Batman’s secret cave, Harry Potter’s cupboard under the stairs and the apartment from “Friends” are major centerpieces to the huge Warner Bros. studio lot expansion. Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood recently reopened more than a year after doors were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, attendees will have a chance to explore the studio’s nearly 100 years of television and filmmaking history, highlighting the DC Universe and “Harry Potter.” A firsthand look took place a couple of days before the tour opened in late June at the Southern California studio, which now welcomes families with children ages 5 and older. Warner Bros. officials said the expansion – which includes a new building – took five years to develop in Burbank. Officials say the studio tour will follow all city, state and federal COVID-19 safety protocols. “One of the most incredible things about Warner Brothers is the incredible history of epic films that are legendary,” said “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, who helped reopen the tour.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A 10-year-old died of plague in La Plata County, San Juan Basin Public Health said Friday. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and health officials said they are investigating the case and will provide more information as it becomes available, 9News reports. No other information on the child was immediately released. “We are so sad for the loss of this young Coloradan, and our deepest condolences go to the family,” said Dr. Jennifer House of the health department. “Public Health is doing an epidemiological investigation and wants Coloradans to know that while this disease is very rare, it does occur sometimes and to seek medical care if you have symptoms.” Officials say plague is caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals. The risk of contracting certain animal-borne diseases, while present year-round, increases during the summer when humans and animals are frequently in close contact. Most human plague cases are acquired directly from fleas. Officials say it’s important to wear repellent when outdoors and keep up to date on pet vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says symptoms of the plague include fever, headache, chills, weakness, and one or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State employee union leaders are suing to stop Gov. Ned Lamont’s order to have workers return to the office now that much of the state has emerged from the pandemic, accusing him of violating prior telework agreements reached with the unions and ignoring the benefits of having people work from home. The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which filed the request for an injunction in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday, said in a statement that state workers proved throughout the COVID-19 crisis that a flexible teleworking agreement could be beneficial to the state of Connecticut. “From increased productivity and quality performance to the positive environmental impacts like reduced emissions, improved air quality and public health, the benefits of telework are clear and something that the Administration should be taking a proud step in leading,” SEBAC said in a statement posted on its website. In May, Lamont sent an email to state employees announcing that they would be returning to their offices as of July 1 and that any telework would be limited to no more than 50% of their time, with manager approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: More than 111 years after it sank off the Delmarva coast and 43 years after divers found and looted it, researchers can finally – and officially – say where the USS Nina is located and why the U.S. Navy steamer built in the 1860s likely sank. The University of Delaware is a big reason why. A two-day mission out of Lewes led by UD oceanographer Dr. Arthur Trembanis in mid-June used the school’s new autonomous underwater vehicle to help identify the sunken ship. The university has been partnering with the Navy for nearly a decade, and Trembanis’ group has been mapping the seafloor for years. The drone used during the mission has a shape similar to a small torpedo. Trembanis needed to test the new equipment and said the “stars aligned” nicely for this mission since Dr. Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH Inc., a cultural resource management firm, had been talking about a mission to officially identify the Nina. Using UD’s technology, the mission did in hours what divers and researchers may have needed days or weeks to do. “We’re really privileged at UD to have one of the most largest and advanced fleets of autonomous systems in the country,” Trembanis said. A violent February storm appears the likely culprit for the ship’s loss.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With more homicides so far in 2021 than by this same time in 2020 and carjacking incidents skyrocketing, the police department is trying to get a handle on the crimes by getting back to the basics of community policing. D.C. police officers in the 4th District have been hitting the streets, knocking on doors and starting conversations with people in the community, WUSA-TV reports. “This is an opportunity for folks to really give us some feedback – let us know what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong,” Inspector James Madison Boteler said. The work officers are doing is part of an initiative called “100 blocks in 100 days.” “It’s really just a get-back-to-the-basics kind of police work,” he said. Boteler, who is in a newly appointed position with the 4th Police District, is teaming up with officers covering parts of Northwest and Northeast to build better relationships with neighbors. “The amount of folks that live in the city versus the amount of crime that we respond to on a daily basis is ever-increasing,” Boteler said. To help fight that crime and the growing number of homicides year after year in the district, Chief Robert Contee selected a handful of inspectors to serve as second-in-command for larger police districts.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Red tide could cause people along certain parts of the Gulf Coast to experience respiratory irritation, health officials said. The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County on Sunday recommended that anyone with chronic respiratory problems consider staying away from areas experiencing red tide, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Officials also advised people not to swim around dead fish and to keep pets away from water, sea foam and dead marine life. The National Weather Service in Tampa issued a beach hazards statement Saturday evening cautioning that red tide can cause coughing, sneezing and tears in the eyes and that symptoms can be worse for people with asthma, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases. Red tide is an algae bloom producing toxins that kill fish. The toxins may also make the surrounding air difficult to breathe and often turn the water red. Those with allergies also can be affected, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Close told the newspaper. “And just the smell, dead fish smell,” he said. St. Petersburg crews cleaned up 9 tons of dead fish in 24 hours last week, the paper reports. During a news conference Friday, St. Petersburg Emergency Manager Amber Boulding said red tide blooms killed the fish, and Tropical Storm Elsa pushed them ashore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Biden administration’s decision to reevaluate Georgia’s plan to overhaul how residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act came as a “surprise” and suggests it wants to revisit the plan’s approval, which is not allowed, Gov. Brian Kemp’s office said. The “Georgia Access” plan would improve the experience of shopping for insurance and encourage the private sector to enroll uninsured residents, the director of Kemp’s Office of Health Strategy and Coordination said in a letter to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Despite unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, Georgia Access will put more affordable, quality insurance coverage within reach of consumers in our state than a one-size-fits-all federal solution,” said the letter by Grant Thomas. Under the Republican governor’s plan, residents would bypass healthcare.gov and shop for federally subsidized health insurance through private agents. Critics worry the move will make it harder to shop for insurance and drive healthy people to cheaper plans that provide limited coverage, increasing premiums for older and sicker people who need the comprehensive benefits required by the ACA because the move to private websites would make it easier for consumers to simultaneously see plans that don’t provide all the benefits required by the federal health care law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: To protect historic lands from invasive goats, officials will distribute the live animals to the public via a lottery. Hawaii officials will hold the lottery as a way to remove at least 700 goats from Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park, which is an important cultural and historical site on the west side of the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Those interested in the goats may apply for permits, which will be issued through a random lottery July 28. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources will distribute 20 to 50 goats per permit. Applicants must indicate how many goats they want and can’t choose individual animals. Lottery winners must have a 16-foot enclosed horse trailer or equivalent to pick up the goats so that they don’t escape. A permit can be refused if a trailer isn’t secured.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Friday mobilized the Idaho National Guard to help fight wildfires amid an ongoing drought and extreme heat. The Republican governor issued an emergency declaration allowing soldiers to help fight fires on the 9,700 square miles in mostly northern Idaho where the state provides fire protection. “Wildfire is presenting an imminent threat to life, property, and the environment, and we need all hands on deck,” Little said in a statement. “I appreciate our firefighters and fire managers for working so hard under such challenging conditions, and I am grateful that our guardsmen are able to step in once again to support Idaho communities.” It’s the first time the Idaho Department of Lands has requested the governor issue such an emergency declaration. The agency said the soldiers will help with fire suppression and logistics support. State officials didn’t say how many soldiers might be deployed to help with wildfires. Officials also said National Guard Blackhawk helicopters could be used to drop water or other suppressants on fires as well as transport firefighters and supplies. Besides tapping the National Guard, the Lands Department has also requested workers in the agency with fire line qualifications to make themselves available for fire assignments.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to this year’s Illinois State Fair will be able to visit one of the nation’s more historic highways with the creation of the Route 66 Experience. The multiyear project will turn the Springfield fairgrounds’ Gate 2 into a year-round destination for visiting a microform of the Mother Road in Illinois, from Chicago to the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in Madison. It will highlight communities and attractions along the way. The project sponsor, the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway, will have the first phase completed by the state fair’s opening Aug. 12, executive director Casey Wichmann said. “Being able to provide visitors a central location to experience what our historic road has to offer is an amazing opportunity prior to the 100th anniversary of Route 66,” Wichmann said. The 2,448-mile highway, one of the nation’s first interstate “hard roads,” was begun 95 years ago. Dubbed the “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” it runs from Chicago’s Loop business district to Santa Monica, California. Its path through Illinois is similar to that of current-day Interstate 55. Once running, the exhibit will feature Quick Response codes and story boards detailing historic attractions and businesses. Those communities lining Route 66 will be invited to participate.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: Six inmates are alleging in lawsuits that they were kept in near-total darkness for weeks at a time and suffered electric shocks from exposed wires at a state prison. The lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana claim the conditions at the maximum-security Miami Correctional Facility near Peru amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuits claim that the six men were held in isolation cells that had no lights and that some of them suffered cuts from broken window glass and were shocked by dangling wires from a broken light fixture while trying to make their way around in the dark. ACLU of Indiana attorney Ken Falk called the prison’s action “torture.” Inmate Jeremy Blanchard’s lawsuit filed in March said he was kept in nearly total darkness for about a month last year, and the conditions led to hallucinations and severe anxiety. Attorneys for the state have denied the allegations and asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The other five lawsuits were filed this month. A Department of Correction spokeswoman declined to comment on those cases.\n\nIowa\n\nVentura: The road running between a marsh wildlife area and Clear Lake in this small northern Iowa city is dangerous for turtles, even with a turtle crossing sign. So five boys have spent some time this summer helping the turtles cross it. On one recent summer day, they spent several hours assisting turtles, saving 20 to 30 from being flattened by motorists, and they reckon they’ve saved close to 200 overall, the Mason City Globe Gazette reports. “One time, I saw a pile of flattened turtles and two baby turtles – their parents must’ve died – so that motivated me to save other turtles,” said 10-year-old Zacaious Moe. Four friends have joined Zacaious in the turtle rescuing: Keygan Hoover, 9; Blake Meyer, 8; Cole Meyer, 10; and Casen Wenzel, 8. “That’s such a neat thing for them to spend their day doing that,” said Ventura City Administrator Else Taylor. Taylor said the turtle crossing sign and a geese crossing sign have been up for several years. “We have had issues with geese and turtles getting run over in large amounts,” she said. “I walk my dog by some of these places, and there are turtle pancakes.”\n\nKansas\n\nCheney: A central Kansas farmer has invented robots that can whack weeds and reduce the use of pesticides on crops. For years, Clint Brauer has struggled with keeping weeds out of his row crops. Along with keeping living roots in the ground, organic practices and no-till methods, he tried crimping, but the pigweeds just grew taller. Three years ago, Brauer, an ex-California-based executive who farms in Haven and Cheney, decided to implement a wild plan, using robots to behead weeds. “I realized there was no great way to get the weeds out at scale without chemicals,” Brauer said. “I needed to invent one.” So he started Greenfield Robotics. Before chemicals replaced them, workers pulled weeds from the farm. Greenfield Robotics puts the “workers” back in the field with a new kind of worker – a mechanized one. “We want to control weeds with labor and make it robot labor,” Brauer said. “Robotics is our way of putting (mechanized) labor back into the farm.” The challenge was that he felt regenerative farming did not work for large fields without the heavy use of agrichemicals. “I came up with the idea for it and tested it manually,” he said. “No one knew if it would work. It has to fit between rows.” Brauer uses the weeding bots on other farmers’ soybean crops in the area and hopes to work with sorghum, cotton and possibly canola farmers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Capitol is open again for visitors, but some fresh security regulations are in place. The new rules include measures detailing the types of masks allowed in the Capitol and prohibiting visitors from congregating in office entrances but still allow people to carry any gun of their choosing, with certain restrictions on ammunition and how they are secured. Gov. Andy Beshear said the emergency Capitol security measures were needed following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the building and forced the evacuation of members from both chambers. He also cited “a rise in domestic terror around the country.” Armed protesters have been a common sight outside the Capitol since the onset of the pandemic and even after the Jan. 6 insurrection, with the president of the Kentucky Three Percenters notably hanging the governor in effigy at one protest. About a dozen masked men wearing camouflage and carrying rifles posed for photos in the Capitol Rotunda in early 2020 – the same day as a large protest against a proposed “red flag” gun law – near the governor’s office, while the House and Senate were in session. Visitors won’t be allowed to wear their own face mask in the Capitol but will be given one by security as they enter.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: The state’s newest food trail has the quirky name No Man’s Land: Gas Station Eats. No Man’s Land was one of the names for a buffer zone between U.S. and Spanish territories for about 13 years after the Louisiana Purchase. The Gas Station Eats food trail is starting with three stops in each of seven southwest Louisiana parishes, The American Press reports. The 450-mile route runs through Calcasieu, Allen, Beauregard, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon and DeSoto parishes. Stops range from the South Beau Dairy Barn in the Beauregard Parish community of Longville to French Market Express, which offers meat pies, plate lunches, yam cakes, cookies and pies in Natchitoches. There’s also an Exxon station in Natchitoches, Big Thicket BBQ in DeRidder, a Shop-A-Lott in Mansfield and another in Many, Anacoco Mercantile, and a Grab N Geaux in Lake Charles. Several stops offer fried boudin balls and whole sausages such as boudin and andouille. Others have fried fish, burgers, sandwiches – and, in Zwolle, tamales. All are in the seven-parish area known as No Man’s Land and the Neutral Strip from about 1806 until a treaty in 1819 established the Sabine River as the boundary between the United States and what later became the state of Texas.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The state is nearly tripling the number of acoustic shark detectors in coastal waters a year after its first fatal shark attack. The Maine Department of Marine Resources deployed eight acoustic receivers in coastal waters a year ago between Wells and Popham Beach, raising the number of sensors to 11. This summer, the state has deployed 32 acoustic receivers between York and Boothbay Harbor, said agency spokesperson Jeff Nichols. The sensors don’t provide real-time data. They must be brought to shore for the data to be downloaded to determine if they detected sharks that were previously tagged with transmitters by researchers, the Bangor Daily News reports. The extra sensors come a year a fatal attack in Harpswell. Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, was killed by a great white shark while swimming. It was Maine’s first fatal shark attack and the third fatal shark attack in New England. An increasing presence of large sharks in New England waters is tied to a growing number of seals.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Mobile crisis teams in Baltimore County respond to fewer than half of calls to help people having mental health crises. But The Baltimore Sun reports that a pilot program funded by a $1.6 million federal grant aims to add more behavioral health professionals and set up a system to redirect some 911 calls from police to behavioral health resources. Of 4,319 calls for service since September, crisis teams have responded to 1,844, according to police data. When teams aren’t available – about 57% of the time – requests for aid are rerouted to officers, according to Police Chief Melissa Hyatt. “We have a significant capacity limitation,” Hyatt told lawmakers during a state Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health briefing earlier this year. There are 20 part-time and full-time clinicians and 12 officers with 40 hours of crisis intervention training in the county of nearly 830,000 residents. Next month, officials begin planning the program’s rollout, police spokeswoman Joy Stewart said. The program was announced just weeks before a May rampage in which a man set his Woodlawn home on fire and killed three neighbors before police killed him. Police said crisis teams had previous interactions with him but didn’t disclose more details.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Archaeologists combing a hill near Plymouth Rock where a park will be built in tribute to the Pilgrims and their Native American predecessors have made a poignant discovery: It’s not the first time the site has been used as a memorial. David Landon of the University of Massachusetts-Boston’s Fiske Center for Archaeological Research said his team unearthed a cache of personal items he thinks were buried there in the late 1800s, most likely by a brokenhearted settler who had outlived all three of her children. Landon said the objects – eyeglasses, clothing, sewing implements, a pocket watch and a book – gave him chills because they turned up during final excavations of Cole’s Hill, a National Historic Landmark site in Plymouth where Remembrance Park is set to be constructed. “Someone clearly used that space in that fashion in the past to memorialize members of their family,” said Landon, whose team spent the past month scouring the waterfront site where the Pilgrims are said to have come ashore in 1620. Remembrance Park originally was conceived to mark 2020’s 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim’s 1620 arrival, the founding of Plymouth Colony and the settlers’ historic interactions with the indigenous Wampanoag people. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit, idling events as well as construction.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Massive amounts of green are being spent to find green ways to prevent basements, yards, streets and freeways in the city from flooding during heavy storms like one last month. Of $100 million pumped each year into infrastructure upgrades for the city’s aging water and sewer systems, $10 million goes toward installing detention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens and permeable pavement. Called green stormwater infrastructure, the features hold and slowly release rainfall into sewers, lessening flooding that has plagued Detroit and other older cities for decades. “It’s not the end-all-be-all, but it is a type of intervention that reduces wet weather flows into the system or delays them,” said Palencia Mobley, deputy director and chief engineer for Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department. City officials say 6 inches of rain that poured down in the area June 25-26 was the most at one time in 80 years. As with a funnel beneath a swiftly flowing faucet, the volume of water moved faster than it could be pumped out or pushed through sewers to water treatment plants. Water pooled in streets and yards as debris clogged sewer grates. Untreated water pushed up through basement drains. Motorists were stranded on freeways. New vehicles in one auto plant lot were nearly submerged.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state is planning to close all but one of its COVID-19 mass vaccination sites by Aug. 7. A statement from Gov. Tim Walz late Friday said the state will focus on the several hundred smaller vaccination sites around the state, at pharmacies and health care providers. Minnesota Public Radio reports the state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has been stagnant in recent weeks, at about two-thirds of residents 16 and older with at least one vaccine dose. Health officials have been turning to small-scale, targeted efforts to get the shots to more people. As of Friday the state reported administering more than 618,000 vaccine doses at the mass vaccination sites since January. The Mall of America location will be the only state-run mass vaccination site to stay open past the first week of August. As of Sunday, the state-run sites in St. Paul, Oakdale, Lino Lakes, Duluth, Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud are only offering second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in their final weeks of operation. The state-run site at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport will offer the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine until it closes in early August.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: The Justice Department is continuing its investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, the Black teenager whose slaying 65 years ago in the Mississippi Delta community of Money sparked outrage and illustrated the brutality of racism in the segregated South. The department’s latest report on civil rights cold cases, released late last month, lists three investigations dating back decades that were closed because witnesses or suspects have died, leads went nowhere, or cases were too old to prosecute, but the Till case wasn’t among them. Relatives of Till said they didn’t know of anyone in the family who’d received official notification that the review had ended, a key step in the department’s process. “That’s all we know, that it’s still open,” family member Marvel Parker said Friday. Her husband, Wheeler Parker, was with Till the night he was taken from a family home at gunpoint. The youth’s brutalized body was later pulled from a river, where it had been weighted down with a cotton gin fan. Some news outlets reported last year that the investigation had ended. Initially closed in 2007, the case was reopened after a 2017 book quoted a key figure in the case, Carolyn Bryant Donham, as saying she lied when she claimed that the 14-year-old Till grabbed her, whistled and made sexual advances.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three of the state’s top health officials said Friday that trusted local leaders and community representatives must be the primary influencers in the state’s efforts to reduce a surge in COVID-19 cases. During a virtual news conference, Robert Knodell, acting director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said the state continues to have a strong relationship with federal health experts, but they all believe local health department workers and community representatives are the best avenue for persuading residents to be vaccinated. Knodell said federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials agree that people from out of state cannot “parachute” into Missouri to persuade residents to get vaccinated. “We’re on the same page as it relates to that,” Knodell said. The comments came after Republican Gov. Mike Parson said last week that he does not support a suggestion from President Joe Biden’s administration that government employees go door-to-door to urge people to get vaccinated. Jeffrey Zeints, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, responded that the program would rely on local doctors, faith leaders and others, and suggesting otherwise was “misinformation.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has discontinued Montana’s membership in a coalition of two dozen states dedicated to fighting climate change. The U.S. Climate Alliance is a nonpartisan group committed to achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Democratic former Gov. Steve Bullock joined the alliance in 2019. The alliance is made up of nearby Western states, including Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Evan Westrup, of the U.S. Climate Alliance, said Gianforte did not respond to the organization’s invitation to continue the state’s membership, Montana Public Radio reports. Gianforte spokesperson Brooke Stroyke said in a statement that the governor believes the solution to climate change is unleashing American innovation, not overbearing government mandates. She said the Paris Agreement punishes the U.S., while letting countries like China off the hook. Stroyke didn’t respond to requests to clarify Gianforte’s climate goals, or what sort of innovation is necessary in Montana. Amy Cilimburg, executive director of Climate Smart Missoula, said the state needs more than innovation. “The U.S. Climate Alliance was not some kind of a radical group; it was governors realizing that we’re stronger together,” Cilimburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Roughly 200 people were possibly exposed to a rabid bat while staying overnight at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, the zoo said. The zoo and Nebraska health officials recommended that roughly 186 campers who stayed overnight at the aquarium in recent weeks, as well as some staffers, get rabies shots. A camper on July 4 woke up to a wild bat flying around her head. A zoo emergency medical technician didn’t find any bites or scratches on her. The zoo found seven wild bats in the aquarium and euthanized them. One tested positive for rabies. The zoo in a news release Friday said it has recommended that people exposed to wild bats while they were sleeping get rabies shots. The zoo gave campers refunds and is paying for their shots. Animal Health Director Dr. Sarah Woodhouse said in a statement that guests who visited the aquarium during the day shouldn’t be concerned because bats only come out at night. “The bats we identified were little brown bats, a common bat species in Nebraska that anyone could find in their backyard or attic,” Woodhouse said. “It is not unusual for a wild bat to be infected with rabies, which is why you should never directly touch a wild bat.” Zoo staff didn’t find any signs of long-term bat roosting at the aquarium.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Department of Energy has agreed to pay the state $65,000 after the government mislabeled and mischaracterized low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to a disposal site north of Las Vegas for more than five years. The settlement agreement announced Thursday certifies that multiple changes have been made to prevent unapproved waste from being shipped and disposed of at the Nevada National Security Site in the future, state and federal officials said. It also establishes an additional groundwater monitoring well at the site. The Energy Department has said none of the materials shipped to Nevada posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public. They were mischaracterized as the wrong category of low-level waste and should have been classified as low-level mixed waste, the state’s review determined. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in July 2019 that 33 packages of unapproved waste were sent in 10 shipments between 2013 and 2018 to the site from the Energy Department’s Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A council tasked with addressing broad issues around housing affordability and stability in the state seeks to increase housing availability by 13,500 units by 2024, according to its plan released Friday. The plan includes a three-year framework to specifically address homelessness across the state, with emphasis on the need for an increase in inventory of affordable housing. Recommendations include promoting new housing development, reducing barriers to affordable housing, and using a data-driven approach to understand regional needs. “The plan serves as a blueprint for our collective efforts – statewide, regionally, and locally – with a focus on alignment, coordination, innovation, and accountability,” Gov. Chris Sununu, who created the council last year, said in a statement. Sununu created the Council on Housing Stability after state police cleared a homeless encampment outside a courthouse in Manchester. It represents a revamping of the existing Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSeaside Heights: Gov. Phil Murphy signed a package of bills Friday aimed at moving the state closer to its goal of generating 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050. The measures make it easier to develop some solar energy projects and to locate and build electric vehicle charging stations. But still waiting for action by the Democratic governor is another bill that would remove most local control from where and how offshore wind energy projects come ashore. Murphy did not mention that bill at a signing ceremony in Seaside Heights in a municipal parking lot across the street from a popular water park. “From wind turbine component manufacturing to solar to electric vehicles, we are well on our way to putting New Jersey back to its rightful place as a national leader” in clean energy, Murphy said. One measure makes it easier to locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the state, eliminating the need to go before planning or zoning boards to get them approved. A similar bill signed by the governor encourages development of zero-emission vehicle fueling and charging infrastructure in redevelopment projects. Murphy also signed two measures dealing with solar power projects. One allows so-called dual use solar projects located on unpreserved farm land that is still also used for agricultural purposes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Republican lawmakers are asking the state attorney general to weigh in on a spending dispute over $1.75 billion in federal pandemic relief aid. GOP leadership in a letter sent Thursday asked New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, to issue a legal opinion declaring the funds must be allocated by the Legislature to protect the body’s fiscal authority. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said her administration must distribute the money because of the way Congress passed the pandemic relief bill. The Legislature allocated money earlier this year, but Lujan Grisham used her veto power to effectively bring the money under discretionary control by her office. Republican lawmakers took issue. They, along with one vocal Democratic senator, signed a petition that called for an extraordinary legislative session to be convened to override the governor’s veto and bring the funds back under the Legislature’s control. Democratic majorities in the House and Senate did not sign on. “Standing on principle isn’t always popular,” Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, said on Twitter in response to a news article. “Was easy for my Dem colleagues to challenge (the) power of (former Republican Gov. Susana) Martinez. Such a fair weather commitment to the law.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases as vaccination rates slowly rise, according to data released Saturday. About 525 people each day tested positive for the coronavirus in New York for the seven days through Friday. That’s up from 369 people – a 42% increase – for the prior week. It’s unclear why more people in New York are testing positive, at a time when fewer people are getting tested. The state Department of Health said a higher percentage of cases are linked to more contagious variants and urged more people to get vaccinated. New York City is driving much of the increase in positives, though cases are also rising on parts of Long Island. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are flattening: Hospitals reported 342 COVID-19 patients as of Friday, similar to 340 patients from last Friday. About 55% of 20 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated. That’s up from nearly 48% as of June 6. Vaccination rates are lowest in parts of western and central New York; about one-third of residents in Allegany County are fully vaccinated. Rates are also lower in parts of New York City: 43% of Bronx residents and 45.5% of Brooklyn residents are fully inoculated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: Fayetteville State University has used pandemic relief funds to clear $1.6 million in tuition debt for nearly 1,500 students. The Fayetteville Observer reports the historically Black school utilized money from the federal legislation that’s known as the American Rescue Plan. Signed into law in March, it provided nearly $40 billion to higher education institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. FSU cleared tuition that was not covered by federal student grants or loans. The school also plans to use $4.7 million in federal funds to provide free summer classes to 1,400 undergraduates through the summer of 2023. “The university is focused on students’ success by clearing past due balances and erasing debt,” FSU spokeswoman Joy Cook said. “When the burden of financial stress is taken away, student success increases.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Midwestern network and technology services provider says it plans to invest $200 million to upgrade and expand its fiber network in North Dakota. Midco said it’s part of a larger $500 million investment to its network in the upper Midwest that will benefit telehealth, education, government operations and remote working. Upgrading to 10-gigabit speed by 2030 is a goal toward which the cable provider has been working for the past couple years. “Now we think we can do it sooner,” said Midco President and CEO Pat McAdaragh. The phased upgrade begins in earnest in 2022, doubling Midco’s fiber network to 22,000 miles, McAdaragh said. Work in North Dakota will begin with a $100 million first phase in Bismarck, Dickinson and Fargo, lasting about three years. “Then immediately we’ll begin spending the other $100 million and getting to areas we haven’t gotten to done yet, so we’re looking at more of a six-year process than 10,” McAdaragh said. More than 25 communities, many of them rural, stand to benefit from the upgrade in North Dakota, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Midco expects remote work to continue to be an employment trend, sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nRootstown: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver after a man allegedly attempted to swallow a bag of cannabis when he was pulled over for speeding. Ohio State Police Sgt. Ray Santiago said the traffic stop occurred July 3 in Portage County. Trooper Charles Hoskin stopped a vehicle that was allegedly traveling at 94 mph in a 70 mph zone, WEWS-TV reports. Dash camera video posted to the Ohio State Police Twitter account shows Hoskin asking if the driver could breathe before helping him out of the car and performing the Heimlich. The man expelled a bag of marijuana and apologized to the officer. After the man recovered, Hoskins asked: “Do you want to die over a minor misdemeanor?” The man received citations for speeding and failing to wear a seat belt, according to Santiago. The man also received a summons for marijuana and was released at the scene.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Friday urged more residents to get vaccinated amid an alarming spike in new cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19, particularly in the northeastern part of the state. Oklahoma is seeing an uptick in cases with the emergence of the new delta variant of the coronavirus, particularly in rural areas where there are lower rates of vaccinations, said Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye. He said those numbers will likely continue to increase following the Fourth of July holiday. “Vaccination numbers for 12 to 34 years old are particularly low, meaning this demographic is especially at risk,” Frye said. “We want people to get out and enjoy their lives and their freedoms. Vaccination is the way to get there.” Oklahoma has the 11th lowest percentage of its population fully inoculated at 38.9%, compared to a national average of 47.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma has risen over the past two weeks from 190.29 new cases per day June 23 to 278.71 new cases per day Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday said it identified 47 cases, all with the delta variant, in April and May associated with a central Oklahoma gymnastics facility.\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Dozens of baby hawks, desperate to escape a blast of early summer heat in recent weeks, bailed from their nests and plummeted to the ground. Calls poured into Blue Mountain Wildlife day after day as temperatures pushed beyond 110 degrees across Eastern Oregon. Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian that she hadn’t seen anything like it in her 30 years as director of the wildlife rehabilitation center outside Pendleton. “They had no choice,” said Tompkins, 68. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.” In all, the center took in nearly 50 nestling Swainson’s and Cooper’s hawks after they leaped from their nests in the extreme heat wave that baked the Pacific Northwest. Thirteen of the raptors suffered injuries severe enough that they had to be euthanized. “We knew the temperature was going to spike beforehand, and we assumed we might get a few more calls,” said Trisha Marquez, a volunteer who fielded the calls and who is Tompkins’ niece. “But we did not expect this at all.” The influx was more than the small staff could handle. They hardly had the space to put them all and, eventually, asked people to turn on their sprinklers and hoses and set out pans of water for less-injured birds to cool themselves down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A museum has returned to public view a 19th-century diorama that shows lions attacking a camel and its human rider, about a year after covering it up in response to complaints about how the courier was depicted. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports a curtain around “Lion Attacking a Dromedary” at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was removed a week ago, and information was posted to address the controversy. X-rays have confirmed that the figure contains a human skull and jaw, presenting an ethical problem for the museum, which does not know where those remains originated. The courier’s costume has been determined to be derived from at least five separate North African cultures. A new sign tells museum patrons that the exhibit, which vividly depicts two lions attacking a camel and its knife-wielding rider, is popular but reinforces stereotypes. “For the present, the museum is keeping the diorama on display,” the sign says. “We want to engage with visitors, staff, and community members to listen and learn from you as we consider the future of this diorama.” Museum director Gretchen Baker told the paper the curtains “were more harmful than not having them up at all,” and in hindsight covering the exhibit may not have been the right approach. The French-built diorama has been at the Carnegie since 1899.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee has vetoed legislation that would make property owners register with the state before listing short-term rentals through online lodging websites, to the chagrin of some concerned about the unregulated nature of the industry. “I cannot support this bill because it will create additional burden for property owners,” the Democratic governor wrote Thursday in a veto message. “Short-term rental concerns, like other property/land use and small business matters, are most effectively addressed at the municipal level.” Some municipal leaders and residents are worried about properties rented on vacation rental websites like Airbnb and VRBO becoming de facto hotels. Calls for a registry increased in the spring after a 22-year-old University of Rhode Island student was fatally stabbed during a party at a rental property in Newport. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the heavily Democratic Legislature, which can override McKee’s veto. Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement that they were “disappointed” by the veto.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservationists have pulled a historic canoe from a river and plan to put it on display. Volunteers with the Chattooga Conservancy hauled the weathered wooden canoe out of the South Carolina side of the Chattooga River on Tuesday after a group of canoeists headed downstream discovered the craft last fall, The State newspaper reports. Archaeologists at the University of South Carolina say the boat could be 200 to 250 years old, a discovery that could shed light on life in the late 1700s. Canoes of that age are rarely found along the Chattooga, a free-flowing mountain river that runs along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Most of South Carolina’s historic canoes have been found in the state’s Lowcountry region, said underwater archaeologist James Spirek. “Up in the mountains on the rivers, they’re a little rare,” Spirek told the newspaper. “It’s interesting to find people were using canoes on some of these wild rivers.” The experts said the canoe was hollowed out using an iron hatchet or ax, suggesting it was made after Europeans settled in the Southeast. A nail was also found at one end of the canoe. Volunteers are expected this week to pull the boat up a mountain slope and down a bank to then float it down a calmer river stretch to move it out of the river corridor for storage or display.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two Native Americans announced Thursday that they were joining a lawsuit against South Dakota alleging that state agencies failed to offer voter registration services. The two tribal members, along with the Lakota People’s Law Project, said they were asking a federal district judge to allow them to join a lawsuit that alleges state agencies are breaking federal law by not providing ample opportunities to register to vote or update voter registration information at places like motor vehicle and public assistance offices near Native American reservations. Federal law requires the agencies to help people register to vote at those kinds of offices, including ones that provide public assistance or serve people with disabilities. The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe initiated the legal challenge last year. The state has denied those allegations in court documents and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The tribes have argued that state practices already make it difficult for Native American people to register to vote. They alleged that they have documented instances in which people tried to register their votes at state agency offices but were turned away.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday halted enforcement of a new state law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The first-of-its-kind law went into effect July 1 and would require such businesses to post signs on multiperson bathrooms that say: “This facility maintains a policy of allowing the use of restrooms by either biological sex, regardless of the designation on the restroom.” Businesses in Nashville and Chattanooga sued over the law, claiming that being forced to post those signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. The state of Tennessee argued in court that the signs are merely factual. In her Friday decision, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger handed a victory to the businesses that sued, granting a preliminary injunction that effectively prevents the state from enforcing the law while the case works through the courts. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has found that compelling individuals to “mouth support for views they find objectionable” violates a cardinal constitutional command unless justified by “the strongest of rationales.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Houston man who received widespread attention after standing six hours in line to cast a ballot in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was in jail Friday on charges that it was illegal for him to vote at all because he was on parole. Hervis Rogers became an overnight face of Texas’ battle over voting access when he emerged from a polling center at a historically Black college around 1:30 a.m. He was among Houston voters on Super Tuesday who waited more than an hour – some for several hours – in mostly minority, Democratic neighborhoods. Lines in mostly white, Republican neighborhoods were shorter. “The way it was set up, it was like it was set up for me to walk away,” Rogers told reporters. He was arrested this week on two counts of illegal voting, a second-degree felony that carries a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. His bail was set at $100,000. Rogers, 62, voted last March while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Andre Segura, an attorney for the ACLU of Texas who is representing Rogers, said his client did not know he was ineligible to vote. “We shouldn’t be prosecuting people for innocent mistakes,” Segura said. The rare arrest on illegal voting allegations comes as Texas Republicans begin a second attempt at passing many of the same restrictive voting measures blocked by Democrats during a dramatic late-night walkout in May.\n\nUtah\n\nMilford: Just outside this town of about 1,400 people in southwest Utah, researchers behind a major energy project are hoping to tap into a limitless supply of clean, reliable power. The energy exists thousands of feet below the surface, where the natural heat from the Earth’s core can be used to create electricity. Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world, KUER reports. Geothermal power already exists but currently makes up just 0.4% of energy production in the U.S. So far it’s largely been limited to select areas around naturally occurring hot springs, such as the Roosevelt Hot Springs in Beaver County. FORGE lab researchers have recently completed one of two major wells they’ll use to develop the tools to build “enhanced geothermal systems” – human-made versions of natural geothermal reservoirs that pump water through cracks underground, heat it, and use the steam to power turbines or to heat buildings. If successful, the project and others like it could lead to “a 40-fold increase over present geothermal power generating capacity,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “The world is looking at Milford,” said Joseph Moore, a geologist and lead researcher at FORGE.\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: The state is undergoing a pandemic-related liquor shortage, regulators say, leading to empty shelves in some stores and warehouses, WCAX-TV reports. “It is a global issue. A lot of it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s not going to be a quick fix,” said Wendy Knight, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery. It’s a global supply chain issue “from production gearing back up from the pandemic, worker shortages, shipping issues, and a glass shortage. That comes on top of demand from restaurants and bars reopening,” she said. The Burlington bar The Archives planned to open a second location in Winooski last year, but the pandemic kept it closed until Thursday. Now the arcade bar is facing another obstacle. “The liquor shortage has been a challenge,” the bar’s co-owner Matthew Walters said. Bars and restaurants are not the only ones feeling the tight supply. “There’s enough to at least have your second choice, if not your first,” George Bergin of the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski told the news station. “With all the bars and restaurants opening up everywhere, everyone is trying to restock their shelves, and it’s just taking a little bit of time to get caught up with the sudden demand.” Vermont saw a 13% increase in liquor sales amid the pandemic, Knight said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Cheers erupted Saturday as a Confederate statue that towered for nearly a century over downtown was carted away by truck from the city where it had become a flashpoint for racist protests and deadly violence. It was a day of palpable joy and immense relief for scores of residents and visitors who lined neighboring streets to watch the larger-than-life figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee as it was hoisted from its pedestal and taken – at least for now – to storage. The statue’s removal came more than five years after racial justice activists had renewed a push to take down the monument, an initiative that drew the attention of white supremacists and other racist groups, culminating in the violent “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. “I’m ecstatic that we’re here now. It’s sad that it’s taken so much to get us to this point. But this is an incredible day,” said Don Gathers, a local Black activist who long advocated for the statue’s removal. Work to remove Lee’s statue, as well as one of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson shortly after, proceeded peacefully and without interruption. Also removed Saturday was a statue depicting Sacagawea and explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark that has been criticized for a depiction of the Native American guide and interpreter that some view as subservient and weak.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A federal jury has convicted a timber thief who authorities said started a large forest fire in a case that prosecutors said marked the first time tree DNA had been introduced in a federal trial. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, on Thursday of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Western Washington said in a news release. The wood he sold to a mill in the city of Tumwater had been harvested from private property with a valid permit, Wilke said. But a research geneticist for the U.S. Forest Service, Richard Cronn, testified that the wood he sold genetically matched the remains of three poached trees. Wilke used gasoline to destroy a wasp’s nest in the base of a maple tree he was stealing, prosecutors said, though jurors did not convict him of charges related to the fire. Some witnesses testified that, although Wilke was standing next to the nest when the fire began, they did not actually see his actions in the dark. Wilke and others conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal, between April and August 2018, according to records filed in the case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice called on Saturday for the resignation of a state lawmaker who posted a sexually explicit TikTok video to his public account. State Del. Joe Jeffries was stripped of a committee assignment Friday after word spread of the social media posting, according to a statement from House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who called his fellow Republican an “embarrassment.” On Saturday, the GOP governor issued a statement calling Jeffries’ behavior “sad” and “childish.” “Not only did he yell graphic comments about me to a group of senators during the recent Legislative Session, but now we find that his not-so-secret TikTok is full of disgustingly vulgar videos, which are especially insulting to women,” Justice’s statement said. “This is the behavior of an immature child, not a 39-year-old father and elected official.” The governor said he had expected to hear an apology from Jeffries by Saturday morning, “but all he has done is hide from the media and the criticism.” Jeffries, whose district includes a group of counties near Charleston, posted the video Thursday. His account was set to private Friday. Belinda Biafore, chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party, said Jeffries “has a slew of inappropriate and vulgar videos with his own sexually explicit commentary on a social media app aimed at youth.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bishop has taken the unusual step of removing a priest from the ministry after he made a series of divisive remarks about politics and the pandemic. The Diocese of La Crosse said in a statement Friday that Bishop William Patrick Callahan has issued a decree immediately removing the Rev. James Altman as pastor of St. James the Less, a parish in the city of La Crosse. The decree will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time, the statement said. “(The bishop) and his diocesan representatives have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution related to ongoing public and ecclesial concerns of the ministry of Fr. James Altman,” the statement said. “The obligation of a Bishop is to ensure that all who serve the faithful are able to do so while unifying and building the Body of Christ.” Diocese officials didn’t release the decree and didn’t immediately respond to a request for a copy. Altman told conservative news outlet LifeSiteNews.com that he’s not surprised the Catholic hierarchy is trying to silence him. “Unfortunately for the corrupt hierarchy, I will not be silenced by any arbitrary Decree, nor will I be cowed by any action against my priestly faculties,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A rancher who was pinned by an all-terrain vehicle survived on beer and bottled water for two days. Frank Reynolds, 53, was trying to round up a cow and calf on a neighbor’s pasture outside Gillette when the vehicle tipped over on him July 4, Reynolds told the Gillette News Record. “It was scary as hell is what it was,” Reynolds said Wednesday from a hospital room. Family thought Reynolds had gone camping or was with friends, said Quentin Reynolds, the Campbell County undersheriff and Frank’s brother. Later Monday, they began to worry. Eventually, they learned Frank Reynolds had planned to do some work on the property, where he was laying with a dislocated shoulder and broken ribs. A search began. Reynolds, meanwhile, honked the ATV’s horn so much he wore down the battery – to no avail. He was able to ration a couple of bottles of water and Keystone Light beers from a cooler, Sheriff Scott Matheny said. Searching on horseback, neighbor Don Hamm found Reynolds about 8 a.m. Tuesday. By that point, Reynolds recalled he was “pretty much out of it.” “Everything on the left side pretty much hurt, from the top of my head to my toes,” he said. He was expected to remain in the hospital a few more days and eventually recover.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2014/12/30/year-in-review-united-states/20489635/", "title": "Year in review: 50 stories from 50 states", "text": "Compiled by Alia E.

Bennett decided to write a note and send it to UAB, and he included his dollar allowance to help keep the Blazers on the field. The UAB athletics department sent Bennett a few gifts for his amazing act of kindness.\n\nAlaska: The Palin family brawl\n\nIt was a birthday party gone bad, starring former governor Sarah Palin and her family. According to reports, the clan got into a big fight at a party in Anchorage, and Palin was even said to have screamed, \"Don't you know who I am!?\" In October, Radar Online and Extra unearthed what they say is the police recording from the scene. Listen for yourself. Palin eventually addressed the brawl on Facebook, pointing us to her daughter Bristol's version of what went down. Bristol said someone messed with her little sister.\n\nArizona: Dreamers get to drive\n\nThe courts ruled and on Dec. 22 the Arizona Department of Transportation began accepting driver's license applications from young undocumented immigrants known as \"dreamers\" who qualify under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Gov. Jan Brewer had fought to keep driver's licenses out of the hands of dreamers since August 2012, when she issued an executive order denying licenses to anyone approved for President Obama's program.\n\nMore from Arizona:Veterans health care controversy began with whistle-blower allegations in Phoenix VA hospital\n\nArkansas: Voter ID law struck down\n\nIt was unanimous. The Arkansas Supreme Court in October declared the state's voter-identification law unconstitutional. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Arkansas Public Law Center had filed suit on behalf of four voters who argued that the photo ID requirement would disenfranchise them. The justices ruled that Act 595, which required voters to show government-issued photo identification, \"imposes a requirement that falls outside\" the four qualifications outlined in the state constitution.\n\nCalifornia: Storms put dent in state's drought\n\nNASA has said that about 11 trillion gallons of water is needed to end the historic drought in California. That's about 130,000 Rose Bowls full of water. Storms this December offered some relief, but they weren't nearly enough to end the multiyear drought. After the storms, the percentage of the state in the worst drought category — \"exceptional\" drought — dropped from 55% to 32%. That's the state's lowest percentage in six months.\n\nMore from California:Steve Ballmer buys Los Angeles Clippers from Donald Sterling; 'Six Californias' fails to make California ballot\n\nColorado: Lighting up the new year\n\nJan. 1 brought the first sales of legal recreational marijuana to Colorado and the state hasn't looked back. Three more states have now either begun or approved recreational sales, and tens of millions of dollars in new tax money is flowing into Colorado's coffers. The fast-growing industry in 2014 struggled to manage the vast piles of cash it's been generating, and state regulators clamped down on the popular pot-infused candies and treats known as edibles.\n\nConnecticut: Sandy Hook killer carefully planned attack\n\nIt's been two years since the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., shook the nation to its core. A Connecticut agency investigating the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre issued a report in November that found the killer, Adam Lanza, did not \"snap\" but was obsessed with mass murder and had carefully planned the attack. Lanza, 20, killed his mother at their home on the morning of Dec. 14, then went to the school he had once attended and gunned down 20 children and six staff members before killing himself.\n\nDelaware: Beauty queen dethroned for being too old\n\nHere's your dose of Miss America drama. A new Miss Delaware was crowned in June after the one selected earlier that month got the boot — for being too old. Brittany Lewis, 24, originally the contest's first runner-up as Miss Wilmington, got the sparkly crown lost by Amanda Longacre, who was also 24 when she competed. The Miss America Organization website says contestants must be 17 to 24 years old. Longacre was stripped of her crown because she was turning 25 in October.

His trial is scheduled to begin next month.\n\nHawaii: Lava flow is slow-motion horror story\n\nImagine you're kicking back at home and someone tells you that 2,000-degree Fahrenheit lava is flowing toward your house. That's been Hawaii's reality this year. Molten lava emerged from a vent in the Kilauea volcano in June, and a long stretch of the flow began slowly moving toward the town of Pahoa, in a rural region of the Big Island of Hawaii. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes. In late October, the lava crossed a country road at the edge of town, covering a cemetery and claiming a home. Now, the lava is headed for a shopping center.\n\nIdaho: The saga of Bowe Bergdahl\n\nIt was a roller coaster of emotions in Hailey, Idaho. On May 31, the town learned that local boy Bowe Bergdahl, 28, had been released from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan after five years. But joy soon turned to shock. Calls and e-mails blasted locals for planning a celebration June 28 for the Army sergeant who may have walked off his post and whose release involved the Obama administration trading five Taliban leaders. Bergdahl has been accused by some members of his former unit of intentionally leaving his post before he was captured by Taliban insurgents in 2009. This December, the Army decided to forward the Bergdahl investigation for possible court-martial. For now Bergdahl remains assigned to a desk job at an Army headquarters unit in San Antonio.\n\nIllinois: Rahm to Hillary: 'Dead broke? Really?'\n\nHillary Clinton took a lot of heat this summer after she said in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer that she and Bill Clinton left the White House in 2001 \"dead broke.\" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, her old political pal, didn't let the comment slide at an event in Chicago celebrating her memoir, Hard Choices. \"Hillary dead broke?\" Emanuel asked. \"Really?\" Clinton acknowledged to Emanuel that it \"may not have been the most artful way\" of talking about her finances.\n\nIndiana: Colts owner arrested\n\nIt was a tough year for Jim Irsay.

Charles Hicks said it \"feels good\" to know his native town's civil rights contributions will be recognized by the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. Hicks' father, Robert Hicks, a legendary civil rights activist, died in 2010. The family's involvement in the civil rights movement will be part of an exhibit at the museum, scheduled to open in 2016.\n\nMaine: Unlikely lobsters caught days apart\n\nFirst, a rare sight landed in a lobsterman's trap in October. Jay LaPlante and his 14-year-old daughter, Meghan, caught a blue lobster about 10 miles southwest of Portland. The find is like winning the lottery: Oceanographers estimate that only 1 in 2 million lobsters is blue. Then, a week later farther up the coast, veteran lobsterman Joe Bates discovered what researchers consider a 1-in-100-million find: a white lobster.\n\nMaryland: Boardwalk pole dancer makes waves in Ocean City\n\nIt was a mixture of outrage and awe on the Boardwalk in Ocean City, Md., this summer. A 27-year-old dancer raised First Amendment issues when she set up her own pole-dancing operation on one of the busiest tourist thoroughfares in America. The resort community's officials didn't like it, but thanks in part to two federal court decisions involving Ocean City, Chelsea Plymale's show is legal. That doesn't mean it hasn't riled people, including a nearby store owner.\n\nMore from Maryland:Ray Rice won his appeal, but it's likely he still lost his NFL career\n\nMassachusetts: Going back in time\n\nA time capsule buried in 1795 by Paul Revere and Samuel Adams was unearthed in Boston at the Massachusetts Statehouse this December, possibly the oldest such U.S. artifact ever uncovered.

Ten years ago, gay marriage was explicitly legal in just one state — Massachusetts. Same-sex couples now can marry in 35 states. But there are many parts of the U.S. where LGBT citizens not only lack the right to marry but also lack other fundamental protections. According to the Human Rights Campaign, Southaven, Miss., is one of just five cities scoring zero on their 2014 Municipal Equality Index. Others are in Texas: Irving, Lubbock, McAllen and Mesquite.\n\nMissouri: Michael Brown sparks conversation on race in America\n\nMichael Brown's death in Ferguson this summer set off protests throughout the nation. Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was fatally shot by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Witness reports differ on whether Brown had his hands raised. Wilson said Brown became overpoweringly violent after the officer asked him to stop walking in the middle of a street. In November, a grand jury decided Wilson would not face charges in Brown's death, setting off riots. USA TODAY reporter Yamiche Alcindor was there from the beginning and was with Brown's family when they learned of the grand jury's decision.

The 19-year-old freshman at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer and given a short time to live, but she has made a tremendous impact both on and off the court this season. She fulfilled her dream to play college basketball, starting a game with the Lions women's basketball team and scoring a basket (or two) in front of a sold-out arena. Most importantly, she began a massive effort to raise funds for cancer research. Hill is now an honorary coach with the Lions and she's not giving up her fight to live — or the fight to raise awareness.\n\nOklahoma: Death row inmates appeal lethal injection ruling\n\n\n\nCapital punishment in America is in a curious state. Manufacturers are cutting off supplies of lethal injection drugs because of opposition to the death penalty, and prison officials are improvising to make up the deficit — sharing drugs, buying them from under-regulated pharmacies or using drug combinations never employed before in putting someone to death. A group of Oklahoma death row inmates scheduled to die early next year filed notice in December that they intend to appeal the ruling of a federal judge in Oklahoma City who says the state's new lethal injection protocol is constitutional. The four condemned men who have pending execution dates, beginning with Charles Frederick Warner on Jan. 15, maintain the state's use of the sedative midazolam in a three-drug combination poses a substantial risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering.\n\nOregon: Brittany Maynard leaves a legacy\n\nBrittany Maynard, the 29-year-old face of the controversial right-to-death movement, died in November in Portland. When you're 29 years old, you typically don't think about your legacy. You think about the family you want to start, the house you want to buy, the promotion you want to get, the trip you want to take. You think about turning 30 and the amazing life that stretches before you. Maynard moved from California to Portland so she could have access to Oregon's Death With Dignity Act and die as she had planned – in her bedroom, encircled by family and friends. Oregon became the first state in the U.S. with a death-with-dignity law in 1997. Since then, four other states have followed suit.\n\nPennsylvania: One of FBI's Most Wanted captured\n\nIt was a lengthy manhunt that had Pocono Mountain communities near the search area on edge.

Kennedy stayed at Newport's Hammersmith Farm, home of Jacqueline Kennedy's family, according to the Journal. Obama stayed overnight for a morning speech on the economy.\n\nSouth Carolina: Judge throws out black teen's conviction from 1944\n\nWhen George Stinney Jr., 14, was sent to the electric chair in June 1944, he was the youngest person in the country ever executed. In December, a judge threw out Stinney's conviction for the deaths of two white girls. Stinney was convicted of the grisly murders of Betty June Binnicker, 11, and Mary Emma Thames, 7, in Alcolu, S.C. The teen's prosecution had \"fundamental, constitutional violations of due process,\" Judge Carmen Mullen of South Carolina's 14th Judicial Circuit said in her ruling. Her decision effectively exonerates the teen. Stinney's supporters have said he was forced to confess.\n\nSouth Dakota: Case of missing girls solved after 40 years\n\nFinally, some closure. Authorities announced in April that the skeletal remains found inside a car belonged to two teens who had been missing for 40 years.

Convicted of assaulting a police officer while being arrested, she was placed on probation but never received notice that she’d finished the term and was on safe ground legally. Now 82 and slowed by age, Colvin has asked a judge to end the matter once and for all. She wants a court in Montgomery to wipe away a record that her lawyer said has cast a shadow over the life of a largely unsung hero of the civil rights era. “I am an old woman now. Having my records expunged will mean something to my grandchildren and great grandchildren. And it will mean something for other Black children,” Colvin said in a sworn statement. Supporters sang civil rights anthems and clapped as Colvin entered the clerk’s office and filed the expungement request Tuesday. Her attorney, Phillip Ensler, said he was seeking all legal documents to be sealed and all records of the case erased. Montgomery County District Attorney Daryl Bailey later said he agreed with the request to clear Colvin’s record, removing any doubt it would be approved. “I guess you can say that now I am no longer a juvenile delinquent,” Colvin told a crowd that included relatives, well-wishers and activists.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Legislature is in special session, but it’s quiet at the Capitol, where many legislative offices have been dark, floor sessions in some cases have lasted seconds, and little progress has been made toward resolving the state’s fiscal issues. Since the session started Oct. 4 in Juneau, House committees have had five meetings on fiscal-related topics, all in Anchorage; the Senate has had no such hearings. “I don’t think it’s making a lot of sense to be here doing what we’re doing right now. So if we’re not going to do anything, gavel out,” said Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, one of four House members present last week for a so-called technical floor session held to satisfy a meeting requirement but at which no business is taken up. Outside the first day, there has been one regular floor session. That was in the House, and after bill introductions, much of the time was spent on speeches, some memorializing people who died recently, others on topics like COVID-19 vaccines. There has been interest in finding a long-term solution to a yearly, divisive fight over what size dividend to pay residents from the state’s oil wealth. A legislative working group recommended a constitutional guarantee of a dividend as part of a package with elements including new revenue, budget reductions and a revised spending limit. The recommendations weren’t binding.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Activists protested outside a wedding where U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema was officiating over the weekend – the latest confrontation between demonstrators and the Arizona Democrat who opposes key parts of President Joe Biden’s social services and climate change package. A video posted to YouTube shows the bride’s mother tearfully pleading with protesters not to disrupt her daughter’s wedding, which was held at an outdoor venue separated by a wall from a public street in Bisbee, Arizona. Several demonstrators yell at the mother until one peacemaker suggests they walk quietly with their signs so the wedding can begin. At one point, the bride says: “Thanks for ruining my wedding. I really appreciate it.” Among the costumed guests at the wedding were people wearing Native American costumes with a headdress and face paint. “While the Senator knows the bride and groom, she does not know and did not interact with the wedding guests who wore disrespectful and racist costumes to the ceremony, and she strongly condemns such behavior,” Sinema spokeswoman Hannah Hurley said in an email to the Arizona Daily Star. Sinema has faced mounting pressure from Democratic activists over her refusal to eliminate the filibuster and her work to scale back a spending package that started at $3.5 trillion.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Meatpacking giant Tyson Foods says more than 96% of its workers have been vaccinated against COVID-19 ahead of the company’s Nov. 1 deadline for them to do so. The Springdale-based company said the number of its 120,000 workers who have been inoculated has nearly doubled since it announced its mandate Aug. 3, when just 50% of Tyson employees had gotten their shots. “This is an incredible result – not only for our company, but for your families and our communities across the country, ” Tyson President and CEO Donnie King said in a note to employees Tuesday. Tyson, which has long been dealing with worker shortages, said employees who don’t get vaccinated before the company’s deadline will be fired, but the former employees will be welcomed back if they do get inoculated later. “Our doors are open,” King wrote. Spokesman Gary Mickelson said very few employees had left the company over the mandate. The industry was hit hard by the pandemic in spring 2020 when the coronavirus tore through meatpacking plants and forced many to close temporarily because so many workers became ill or had to quarantine. King said Tyson saw a significant decline in virus cases in its workforce as more employees got vaccinated. Tyson remains the only major company in the meatpacking industry to require vaccinations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: In an effort to ease congestion at the nation’s busiest port complex, officials said Monday that they will start fining shipping companies whose cargo containers linger for too long at marine terminals. The twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach said in a statement that arriving containers scheduled to be moved by trucks will be allowed to stay for nine days before fines start accruing. Containers set to move by rail can stay at the ports for three days. After that, ocean carriers will be charged $100 per container, increasing in $100 increments per container per day, the statement said. The new rules will go into effect Nov. 1. “The terminals are running out of space, and this will make room for the containers sitting on those ships at anchor,” Port of Long Beach Executive Director Mario Cordero said in the statement. It’s the latest step aimed at relieving the logjam of cargo ships that has interrupted the global supply chain. The backlog prompted the Biden administration to allow the port complex to operate 24 hours a day to try to get goods unloaded and out to consumers. About 40% of all shipping containers entering the U.S. come through the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports.\n\nColorado\n\nLeadville: After spending hours looking for a hiker who was unknowingly the subject of a search and rescue effort, a search team is urging people who are late in returning from the outdoors to answer their phones if they get repeated calls from an unknown number. According to the Lake County team, it made multiple unsuccessful attempts via cellphone to reach a person reported overdue from a hike on Mount Elbert on Oct. 18, leading rescuers to launch a search that night. Not long after rescuers resumed their search around daybreak the following day, the overdue hiker, who was not identified, was independently able to find a way off the mountain, the state’s tallest, and drive back to a lodging site, the team said in a Facebook post Thursday. The person who reported the hiker overdue notified authorities. The team said one takeaway was that the “subject ignored repeated phone calls from us because they didn’t recognize the number.” However, in response to questions from commenters, one team member acknowledged that it was not known if the hiker had the phone’s ringer and notifications turned off. The member said the team also sent texts to the hiker.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A former marina owner was sentenced Monday to two years of probation and fined $45,000 for intentionally sinking abandoned boats in Long Island Sound. John Magness, 72, of Bristol, Maine, pleaded guilty last November to a federal charge of obstructing navigable waters by sinking a vessel. Magness was in the process of selling the Bluefish Cove Marina in Bridgeport in 2018 when he made a deal with an employee and another man to scuttle several sailboats and motorboats that had been abandoned at the marina, prosecutors said. Investigators discovered that at least five boats were sunk between Black Rock Harbor and the Pennfield Reef Lighthouse at Magness’ request between October 2018 and April 2019, prosecutors said. The two other men involved, Peter Albrecht, of Norwalk, and Carlos Santos, of Westbrook, each previously pleaded guilty to the same charge and were each sentenced to a year of probation. Prosecutors said Magness agreed to forgive Santos’ unpaid dockage fees in exchange for his help sinking the vessels.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The death of an 18-year-old who was shot Sunday night marked a grim milestone for the city, bringing the total number of people killed by gunfire this year up to the level for all of 2017, Wilmington’s deadliest year on record. The teen, whom police identified Tuesday as Zion Davis-Shelton, was the 32nd person to die by gunfire this year in Wilmington, according to police. In 2017, the city’s deadliest year for gunfire, 35 homicides were recorded – one by stabbing and two by drowning. While the total number of people shot so far this year, 133, is down from 2017, which saw a total of 197 shot, 2021 is on track to be a deadlier year for gunfire. In a statement, Wilmington Police Chief Robert Tracy in part blamed the number of illegal guns on the street for the violence. Already this year, he said, his officers have made more than 250 gun arrests, “on pace with last year’s record-breaking numbers and leaps and bounds over the totals we saw in years past.” Mayor Mike Purzycki said in a statement that he grieves for the victims’ families and that the two young men killed over the weekend – another 18-year-old was fatally shot about a day before Davis-Shelton – “are a grim reminder that while so much good is taking place in the city, there is too much isolation from healthy societal norms among our young men.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A coyote was recently spotted on a wildlife camera in Rock Creek Park, WUSA-TV reports. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo posted an image of the female coyote on its Facebook page, saying it was part of the Snapshot USA project, a nationwide study using camera traps in suburban, rural, wild and urban areas across all 50 states. The zoo said conservation biologist Tremie Greogry would upload images into the Wildlife Insights database, which is the world’s largest camera trap database. Anyone can upload analyze and share camera trap photos with the conservation community in order to sample mammal populations. The Smithsonian Zoo said the eastern coyote captured in the photo is a recent arrival to Rock Creek, migrating to the area around 2016. The National Park Service has said the first recorded sighting of a coyote in the park was in May 2004. Last year, a coyote was spotted on the National Mall, and another coyote had to be killed after it attacked three people in the Rockville area.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The state’s surgeon general said that conversations while wearing masks aren’t productive and that he offered to meet elsewhere when a state senator didn’t let him in her office without a mask, citing a serious health condition. Dr. Joseph Ladapo said in a statement released Tuesday that he offered to meet outside or in a hallway for his scheduled meeting last week with Democratic state Sen. Tina Polsky. He said he doesn’t believe he can communicate clearly and effectively while wearing a mask. Polsky was not satisfied, he said. “Having a conversation with someone while wearing a mask is not something I find productive, especially when other options exist,” Ladapo said in a statement posted on Twitter. The incident drew broad attention over the weekend after Polsky revealed that she had breast cancer, though at the time of the meeting last Wednesday she hadn’t disclosed that publicly and told Lapado only that she had a serious health condition. Ladapo said in his statement that he’s “saddened” by that news and wished her “blessings and strength.” Polsky said in a statement that Ladapo’s excuse for not wanting to wear a mask was “absurd” and “insulting.” She said that after the meeting was abruptly canceled, Ladapo was heard saying to his aides that he was “having fun” arguing with the senator.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Faced with deadlocked jurors, a judge on Tuesday declared a mistrial in the case of three former sheriff’s deputies accused of murdering a Black man whom they had repeatedly shocked with stun guns during a 2017 arrest. Senior Judge H. Gibbs Flanders Jr. granted the defense motions for mistrials on the charges against Henry Lee Copeland, Michael Howell and Rhett Scott in the death of Eurie Martin, 58. The jury foreman told the judge that no jurors in the Sandersville courtroom had changed their minds since Friday, the first day of deliberations, and that more time was unlikely to lead to the unanimity needed for convictions or acquittals. Martin had a history of schizophrenia and was walking through the central Georgia town of Deepstep on a scorching day in July 2017, taking a 30-mile journey to see his relatives for his birthday. A resident called 911 to report Martin as suspicious after he approached the person and asked for a drink of water. Responding officers said Martin refused to stop walking, threw down a soda can and took an aggressive stance, prompting them to fire their stun guns when he didn’t follow instructions. Beyond murder, the fired deputies faced charges of involuntary manslaughter, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, simple assault and reckless conduct.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Some Native Hawaiians are objecting to President Joe Biden’s choice for U.S. attorney in the 50th state, saying Clare Connors treated dozens of elders like criminals when her office prosecuted them for blocking a road while protesting the construction of a mountaintop telescope. “She has acted aggressively towards the Hawaiian people during all of our stand for Mauna Kea,” said Kealoha Pisciotta, one of the protest leaders. Pisciotta and other Native Hawaiians who oppose the telescope believe the summit of Mauna Kea is sacred. They say building the Thirty Meter Telescope on the state’s tallest mountain would further desecrate a place already defiled by a dozen other observatories. The 38 Native Hawaiian elders prosecuted for obstruction were in their 60s through 80s, and many of them are community leaders. Pisciotta said she’s concerned about Connors being named U.S. attorney because Native Hawaiians have been deprived of their land and their right to self-determination since the U.S.-backed overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893. “I think of her as a danger to many situations in Hawaii because she doesn’t have to seem to have the compassion or the aloha that is needed considering our political situation,” Pisciotta said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal court has rejected a request by the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee, which argues its rights were violated while campaigning at a school on Election Day. The court last week denied the committee’s request to grant a permanent injunction that would have forced the Coeur d’Alene School District to allow groups to hand out election materials on school grounds even if they interfered with kids getting to school. The court didn’t rule on the merits of the case, which continues. But the court found that the group was unlikely to win the case because, among other things, it misinterpreted Idaho’s campaign-free-zone election law. Specifically, the committee argues that it can hand out election materials anywhere on school grounds as long as the group is more than 100 feet from the building where voting is taking place. While campaigning is allowed at schools, the district contends it can prevent electioneering within 100 feet of campus grounds if groups are interfering with kids going to class. “While Plaintiffs seemingly believe that Idaho (law) is meant to protect their right to electioneer 101 feet or more from the polling place, the language of the statute instead illustrates that it is meant to protect voters from interference,” Chief U.S. District Court Judge David C. Nye wrote.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state Senate voted Tuesday to repeal a law requiring that parents or guardians be notified when girls younger than 18 are seeking an abortion. Building on momentum among abortion rights activists after September’s Texas “heartbeat” law banned most of the procedures there, Democrats who control the General Assembly in Illinois want to dump the 1995 law requiring notification, which both sides of the debate call the last restriction on abortions in the state. But with a 32-22 tally in favor of repeal, the count fell short of approval of all who make up the Democrats’ 41-18 advantage, showing the reticence among moderate Democrats on a law whose proposed repeal now moves to the House with two days left in the General Assembly’s fall session. Republicans have repeatedly pointed out that notification has the support of nearly three-quarters of Illinoisans responding to a poll conducted last spring. And they publicized the nearly 50,000 notices of opposition filed electronically before the vote. Opponents say the notification law, adopted by GOP majorities in 1995 but not in effect until 2013 amid legal challenges, is a means of denying abortion rights to teenagers by delaying the procedure. They say it’s a hindrance to those who live in abusive environments and are intimidated by an alternative process – pleading their case to a judge.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An external review of state police agencies found they need to bolster the recruitment and promotion of minority and female officers and increase training about racial bias. The findings are part of a 100-page report released Monday that was commissioned by Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb following demonstrations across the country and state last year protesting the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The consulting firm Hillard Heintze acknowledged attempts by Indiana State Police to recruit more diverse officer candidates, while citing that white men made up more than 80% of promotions and reassignments in 2018-20. One agency strategy of sending white officers to barbershops and restaurants in predominately Black communities to talk about the job was viewed as “offensive or patronizing” by some Black ISP officers, according to the report. “The ISP provides its members with cultural awareness education and training taught by command-level personnel, demonstrating its importance to the organization. However, this training does not include a discussion of implicit bias or actions officers could take to reduce the influence of implicit bias when interacting with their colleagues and community members,” the study said.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A woman who alleged she was sexually assaulted at a University of Iowa fraternity is suing two men and the fraternity. The lawsuit filed Tuesday alleges two members of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, also known as Iowa FIJI, assaulted her at a party at the fraternity in September 2020. She also alleges the assault was filmed and photographed, with the images widely circulated. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages from the two men and the fraternity. It also names Mu Deuteron, the corporate entity under which FIJI’s chapter at the school operates, and the Phi Gamma Delta Educational Foundation, a nonprofit based in Kentucky. The two men were expelled from the fraternity. The lack of charges prompted several protests on the University of Iowa campus, including on Aug. 31, when about 1,000 people gathered outside the fraternity house and a second location calling for action on the case and to abolish the fraternity. An online petition making similar demands had more than 167,000 signatures as of Tuesday.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: A sheriff’s deputy caught on dashcam video running over a Black man who was fleeing shirtless across a field is now working at the Hutchinson Correctional Facility while under criminal investigation, according to the attorney for the injured man. Lionel Womack, a former police detective from Kansas City, Kansas, alleges in an excessive-force lawsuit filed last year that Kiowa County Sheriff’s Deputy Jeremy Rodriguez intentionally drove over him during the Aug. 15, 2020, incident that was captured on dashcam video. Womack says he sustained serious injuries to his back, pelvis, and right thigh, knee and foot. In a court filing responding to the lawsuit, Rodriguez denied he intentionally swerved his truck to run over Womack. The deputy said he learned later that Womack did not possess a weapon. Rodriguez is currently under criminal investigation by federal and state authorities over the incident. Attorney Michael Kuckelman, who represents Womack, wrote in a letter Tuesday to Kansas Secretary of Corrections Jefferey Zmuda and Warden Dan Schnurr that he was “shocked” to learn in a deposition that they would employ Rodriguez, who works as a master sergeant at the facility.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library book gifting program is expanding throughout Kentucky, the state’s Department of Education announced Tuesday. With the goal of inspiring a love of reading, the voluntary program gives books each month to children from infancy to 5 years old, free of charge to families, through funding shared by Parton, Kentucky’s state government and community partners. “I’m so excited and want to thank everyone partnering with us to make more dreams come true for children and families in Kentucky,” said Parton, a country music icon, actress and philanthropist from neighboring Tennessee. State funding will help increase registration in existing Kentucky Imagination Library programs and find community partners to start new ones, the state said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state will receive $595 million in federal disaster block grant aid to help with housing restoration and other recovery needs from last year’s back-to-back blows of hurricanes Laura and Delta, Louisiana’s U.S. senators announced Tuesday. While welcomed by officials as critical to rebuilding efforts in southwest Louisiana, the money falls far short of the multibillion-dollar estimates of need, offering only about 20% of the $3 billion in assistance requested by Gov. John Bel Edwards. It also comes 14 months after Laura wrecked the Lake Charles region – a delay that had locals questioning whether the nation had forgotten them. “It has been over a year since Louisiana was hammered by Hurricane Laura and this relief has taken far too long,” Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy said in a statement. “This funding is a welcome first step, but there is more work to be done to return southwest Louisiana to wholeness.” GOP U.S. Sen. John Kennedy said the money will provide “a helping hand as we rebuild” but said residents “are still reeling.” Edwards said Louisiana already is drafting its spending proposal for submission once the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issues its regulations. But the Democratic governor also suggested the state will be requesting more federal assistance.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor has announced a series of programs including tuition forgiveness to help the state navigate a need for more health care workers. One of the programs will provide $4 million in tuition support via scholarships and student loan relief to help students pursuing careers in nursing and other health professions, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said Monday. The state will also use $8.5 million for tuition forgiveness to provide money to health care employers and workers to help the workers gain new skills and earn advanced credentials, she said. Another program will use $1.5 million to create a public service campaign to promote health care professions and try to recruit people into the fields, Mills said. The Democratic governor said the state will implement the moves by the end of the year. Maine has lost jobs during the pandemic, and more than 10% of that loss has come in the health care workforce. Health care facilities across the state “have had to grapple with a shortage of workers, and the pandemic has only made the problem worse,” Mills said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A congressman announced Wednesday that he has deactivated his official congressional and campaign Facebook and Instagram accounts until their parent company and Congress make substantial reforms to protect children, health and democratic values. Democratic U.S. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger said his decision follows disturbing whistleblower reports about the company’s own research revealing harm to democracy, the mental health of teens and the amplification of hate speech. In a news release, Ruppersberger cited a report in The Washington Post that Facebook’s algorithm at one time treated “angry” reactions as five times more valuable than “likes,” disproportionately promoting content that was likely to include “misinformation, toxicity and low-quality news.” “Facebook’s basic business model sows division and disinformation and I can no longer use it – and promote it from my official mediums – in good conscience for the time being,” Ruppersberger said. “While Facebook must do better to police themselves, Congress must also act and pass reasonable social media reforms.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously disputed portrayals of the company as one that puts profit over the well-being of its users or pushes divisive content. Ruppersberger said his Twitter account will remain active. He also emphasized that he and his staff are available to take constituents’ calls, emails – even faxes.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Officials are weighing creating a commission to account for the city’s role in slavery and potentially provide reparations to Black residents. The City Council’s Committee on Civil Rights held a hearing Tuesday to hear from Black community activists, academics and the public on how the city can approach the issue. Dr. Jemadari Kamara, a professor of Africana Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston, was among a number of people who spoke in favor of forming a commission on reparations, noting that San Francisco and other major cities have already taken similar steps. Kevin Peterson, founder of the New Democracy Coalition that’s been pushing for years for the city to recognize its role in the slave trade, was among those who stressed that the Black community needs to drive the reparations process. “Any committee must be Black-led and Black-controlled,” he said. “Let Black people lead on the issue.” Many of those testifying said racist policies that persisted in Boston long after slavery ended have led to wide disparities in family incomes, homeownership and other measures between Black and white residents. The city was rocked by violent, racial protests in the 1970s and 1980s as public schools were forcibly desegregated through court order.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state Senate on Tuesday passed legislation that would eliminate the so-called tampon tax on menstrual products, sending the bill to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is expected to sign it into law. Michigan would join over 20 other states that have either ended the sales tax on menstrual products or never had one, according to Period Equity, a legal organization that advocates for making menstrual products tax-exempt. Though several bills to end the tampon tax were introduced in the Legislature in the past five years, none of those bills made it to a floor vote. Both chambers in the Republican-controlled Legislature have voted in the past month to approve lifting the tax. The Democratic governor has backed efforts to abolish the tax in Michigan. One of the sponsors of the bills passed Tuesday, Sen. Winnie Brinks, said it’s been a long road to get the elimination of the tampon tax this far, but she is thankful for everyone who has supported the effort in the past. “This is a commonsense move that will reduce an unfair tax burden that is placed on only half of Michigan’s population for a significant portion of our lives,” the Grand Rapids Democrat said. “These bills will move Michigan toward a fairer tax structure, which is a goal I think we all share regardless of which side of the aisle we sit on.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The case of a man who waited two days for an intensive care bed and later died is among several examples that have frustrated officials in rural hospitals whose facilities are overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. Bob Cameron, 87, spent two days in his hometown hospital in Hallock, Minnesota, where caregivers searched nonstop for space in a larger hospital that could find and fix the source of his severe gastrointestinal bleeding and treat his COVID-19. The bleeding exhausted the hospital’s blood supply, so state troopers shuttled new units 130 miles from Fargo, North Dakota, to Hallock to keep Cameron alive. A bed was secured Oct. 12 at Sanford Health in Fargo, but his condition worsened after surgery there to find the source of his bleeding. He died Oct. 13, the Star Tribune reports. “We can’t say for certain, of course, that if he got to an ICU bed sooner that he would have survived, but we just feel in our hearts that he would have,” said Cameron’s granddaughter, Janna Curry. During a three-week stretch this month, rural hospitals were caring for more COVID-19 patients than Twin Cities hospitals. “We’re playing tag back and forth between Aitkin, Crosby, Brainerd and Princeton,” said Dr. Arden Virnig, supervisor of a five-bed ER at Mille Lacs Health System in Onamia, Minnesota.\n\nMississippi\n\nMadison: A racially diverse school in central Mississippi is honoring its namesake – a woman who was a leader in ensuring Black children received education when the state was deeply segregated. Descendants of Rosa Scott were on campus Monday at Rosa Scott High School, a campus for about 400 ninth graders in the Madison County School District. “Because of her, many African American children began to be educated,” Scott’s great-granddaughter, Maryann Gaylor Kennedy, told WLBT-TV. Scott was born in 1874, was educated at Fisk University, and worked as a teacher and principal in Madison County. She led an effort to raise money for a school that opened in Madison in the 1920s. Scott died in 1938, and her gravesite is part of the courtyard on the current campus. When a new school was built in 1959, it was named for Scott. During the ceremony Monday, principals, educators and alumni talked about the school’s impact and Scott’s mission of advancement. Her family gave the school a copy of Scott’s biography written by one of her granddaughters, Rose Mary Collum Gaylor. Students designed a flag for the school, giving replicas to the family. “Rosa Scott was a powerhouse,” another of her granddaughters, Margaret Bernstein, told WJTV-TV. “She really understood that education is the key to success, and she wanted to unlock that for Black children, so that’s why it was important to be here today.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A man alleges in a lawsuit that police officers punched, kicked and stomped on him before illegally searching the apartment he shared with his girlfriend after claiming he had committed a minor traffic violation. The lawsuit was filed in federal court Monday on behalf of Tranell Stewart, 38, and his former girlfriend, Lisa Jones, against five Maryland Heights police officers and the city of Maryland Heights, a St. Louis suburb. It accuses the officers of unlawful seizure, excessive force and unlawful search. It also accuses the city of liability, charging that Maryland Heights has not addressed years of police stopping and searching Black motorists at rates far above their representation in the city. The city, the police department and the police union did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Stewart pulled into the parking lot of his apartment complex Oct. 26, 2016. Officer David Devouton pulled behind his car and told him he had failed to use his turn signal, which Stewart denied, according to the lawsuit. When Stewart tried to get out of his car to get to his infant son from the back seat, Devouton grabbed Stewart’s hair and tried to pull him to the ground, saying, “You’re going to die today,” the lawsuit says. Stewart said he suffered a fractured nose, a black eye, and emotional pain and fear.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A preliminary report on an Amtrak train derailment last month that killed three people and injured dozens more offered no clues about what triggered the accident but said that the train’s emergency brakes were activated and that Amtrak estimated the damage at more than $22 million. However, one attorney whose client is suing Amtrak and BNSF Railway said he wanted to learn more about the crashworthiness of the train’s observation car, and an attorney for a crew member said she reported seeing a 30-foot dip along the railroad, where it appeared the track bed had given way. The National Transportation Safety Board issued its preliminary report Tuesday on the Sept. 25 derailment of the westbound Empire Builder just west of Joplin, in north-central Montana. It was mostly factual, saying that there were 154 people on board and that 44 passengers and crew were taken to area hospitals with injuries. Passengers without serious injuries were bused to the nearby town of Chester, where residents provided food and other aid. The train was traveling at between 75 and 78 miles per hour, just below the speed limit of 79 mph on that section of track, when its emergency brakes were activated. The two locomotives and two railcars remained on the rails, and eight cars derailed.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts has split with former President Donald Trump over which Republican candidate should become his successor as governor. Trump on Monday endorsed Falls City businessman Charles Herbster, a close political ally. Shortly after the announcement, Ricketts released a statement arguing that Herbster isn’t qualified to serve in the role. “While I agree with President Trump on many things, I strongly disagree that Charles Herbster is qualified to be our next governor,” said Ricketts, who can’t seek reelection in 2022 due to term limits. In a statement, Trump praised Herbster as “an extraordinarily successful businessman who will fight for our farmers and ranchers, support our military and vets, and protect and defend your under siege Second Amendment rights.” Ricketts hasn’t formally endorsed a candidate in the GOP governor’s primary race, but he has made several public appearances with University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, and several of his close political allies work on Pillen’s campaign. Several other other Republicans have launched campaigns, including state Sen. Brett Lindstrom, of Omaha, and Breland Ridenour, an information technology manager. Former Gov. Dave Heineman has said he may run as well, as has Herbster’s former running mate, former state Sen. Theresa Thibodeau.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A private-public partnership has expanded a local program providing mobile shower trailers for homeless people through the Clean the World nonprofit, officials said. Clark County, Caesars Entertainment and the Caesars Foundation announced a three-year commitment Monday to split what Clean the World founder and CEO Shawn Seipler said is about a $250,000-a-year cost. Trailers offer four individual shower stalls with a toilet and sink, and users are provided hygiene kits including soap, shampoo, toothbrush and toothpaste. One stall is compliant with disability accessibility requirements. Visits usually last 20 to 30 minutes. Clean the World trailers have made the rounds in southern Nevada since 2017, providing some 28,000 showers and 30,000 hygiene kits, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Trailers typically park for about four hours at nonprofit service centers in and around the city. Seipler said shower users might also seek help with job placement, drug rehabilitation, mental health care or legal issues. “As folks come to us to shower on a regular basis, they start to build relationships with those that are there,” he said. Partner agencies sometimes also offer health screenings, vaccinations for hepatitis and COVID-19, along with other services.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A drive-in theater and a bandstand are among the historic properties on this year’s “Seven to Save” list from the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance. The list, announced Tuesday, highlights vulnerable historic resources and related threats to community life and economic well-being. The Weirs Drive-In Theater and surrounding land are on the list. It’s the largest of three remaining drive-in theaters in the state and is currently for sale. The theater stands on land that was heavily used by Indigenous people for fishing-related activities as much as 10,000 years ago. Also on the list is the Milford Bandstand, which was built on the town’s Oval in 1896 for the Milford Cornet Band’s summer concerts. “This significant Victorian bandstand now requires extensive renovation to continue to serve future generations as a focal point for community gatherings and activities,” the alliance said in a news release. Two Cornish Colony properties in transition share a spot on the list: the Blow-Me-Down Farm and the Percy MacKaye Home. Opera North is renovating part of the farm, and descendants of MacKaye are seeking new preservation/stewardship solutions for his home and studio. Also listed are the United Baptist Church in Laconia, built in 1892; the Wilder-Holton House in Lancaster, built in 1780; and the Newington Railroad Depot, built in 1873. The alliance also is featuring a thematic listing of the state’s historic theaters, many of which were already struggling when the pandemic struck.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBerkeley Township: Governments, academics and scientists are proposing an ambitious effort to improve the health of Barnegat Bay, a fragile waterway that “has been loved to death.” The Barnegat Bay Partnership, a constellation of groups dedicated to helping the bay, on Tuesday unveiled a detailed and far-reaching plan to improve water quality, increase the number of days that bay beaches are open for swimming, increase the amount of shellfish, and address an explosion of jellyfish in the bay that are making parts of it difficult to use. Officials from federal, state and local governments signed the pledge, but it remains to be seen what, if any, specific actions will be taken in furtherance of those goals. “The Barnegat Bay in its current state is a jewel of the Jersey Shore, but it has some serious problems,” said Stan Hales, director of the partnership. “The bay has been loved to death.” Environmentalists and government officials have long recognized threats to Barnegat Bay, including rampant development along its shorelines and interior watershed areas, as well as the resulting flow of pesticides and nitrogen from lawn fertilizer and agricultural uses that makes its way into the bay. That helps contribute to decreased oxygen levels, which harms fish, shellfish and plant life and can turbocharge jellyfish populations, which thrive in degraded water.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: It’s been years in the making, and now officials say the first leg of a major renewable energy transmission line has been energized. The New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority made the announcement Tuesday, saying the Western Spirit project is expected to be in operation by the end of the year. The transmission line will carry wind-generated power to the grid in New Mexico and other Western markets. The project involved a novel public-private partnership between the transmission authority and Pattern Energy, which is developing a collection of wind farms in the state. New Mexico’s largest electric utility, Public Service Co. of New Mexico, will acquire and operate the transmission line when it’s complete. State officials said the transmission line will be important as New Mexico aims to eliminate carbon emissions within the utility sector over the next two decades. RETA Board Chairman Robert Busch said in a statement that the successful development of the transmission line and the state’s energy policies are spurring interest from renewable energy and transmission developers. He said the line enables new investment of more than $1.5 billion in renewable generation and transmission in the state.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Mayoral candidates lobbed accusations at each other about palling around with gangsters and acting like children or clowns, but their second debate ended on a surprisingly tender note involving cats and veganism. A week before the city of 8.8 million people votes to pick a new mayor, Democrat Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa laid out their plans Tuesday for addressing rising violent crime and how to chart a path out of the pandemic’s deadly wake. It was the second meeting between Adams, the Brooklyn Borough president and former New York City police captain who is widely expected to win the election in the heavily Democratic city, and Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol who’s known for his signature red beret, streetwise proclamations and penchant for stunts. On the pandemic, Adams supports a mandate from outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio that city workers such as police officers and firefighters get vaccinated against COVID-19 or be placed on unpaid leave. But Adams said he would have had more discussions with the workers’ unions before announcing the policy. The rivals were asked to pay each other compliments as they wrapped up the debate. Adams complimented Sliwa for adopting and rescuing cats, 16 of which he and his wife keep in their small Manhattan apartment. Sliwa praised Adams for promoting his vegan lifestyle, saying it “has already probably helped dozens, maybe hundreds, maybe thousands of people.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Dozens of residents have weighed in to say Republicans should shelve proposed congressional district maps that would likely give the GOP the most seats for the foreseeable future while needlessly fracturing the state’s largest counties. Republicans and Democrats have spent the past few weeks creating separate redistricting maps. During the first of two days of public hearings on them, speakers criticized GOP proposals that could make at least 10 of the state’s 14 U.S. House districts favorable to Republican candidates. Republicans currently hold an 8-5 advantage in the state’s congressional ranks, but North Carolina will get another member through at least 2032 because of population gains recorded by the 2020 census. Maps most favorable to Republicans would split predominantly Democratic Mecklenburg and Wake counties among at least three districts, some of which would spill into more conservative and rural surrounding counties, thereby making it harder for Democrats to win. “This is not fair, since North Carolina is a half-and-half state with the two parties,” Kathy Wheeler of Guilford County told redistricting committee members at the Legislative Building. “The maps proposed by Republican members dilute Democratic votes and deprive communities of effective representation.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Enrollment declines at the state’s institutions of higher learning since the COVID-19 pandemic began haven’t been as steep as elsewhere, and some have bucked the trend entirely. According to a new report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, enrollment across the country at colleges and universities is down 6.5% compared to two years ago – the largest two-year enrollment drop in the past 50 years. North Dakota’s numbers haven’t been nearly so steep, and in the case of some universities, including Dickinson State University, enrollment has increased, KFYR-TV reports. “Students that are interested or deciding to go college, that number is kind of going down. But we, in this specific area of the country, don’t have that quite as much as other areas. So we still have a pretty good pool of students that are graduating and going to college,” said Stephanie Osborne, DSU’s admissions director. Overall, North Dakota colleges and universities experienced a 3.4% decrease in enrollment from 2019 and a 1.4% decrease from 2020. Other schools that have actually seen enrollment increases since 2019 include Dakota College at Bottineau, Valley City State University and the University of North Dakota.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state is adjusting its quarantine recommendations for schools in hopes of keeping students and educators in class more even if they’re exposed to someone with the coronavirus in a school setting or activity. The guidance is optional for schools and applies only when direct exposure happens in a school environment, not outside school. Under the “mask to stay” part of the approach, even exposed students who were unmasked and unvaccinated could remain in class rather than quarantining at home as long as they wear a mask for 14 days after their last exposure, monitor for COVID-19 symptoms and get tested if they have symptoms. If they don’t develop symptoms and test negative for the virus between the fifth and seventh days, they could stop those extra precautions. The other part of the guidance, dubbed “test to play,” allows asymptomatic contacts to keep participating in extracurricular activities if they wear a mask when able and get tested both when they’re notified they’ve been exposed to the virus and again between the fifth and seventh day. A negative result on that second test would allow them to resume normal activity after the seventh day. The guidance also encourages districts to consider same-day testing for athletic competitions with potential for school-to-school exposure.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A federal judge ruled Monday that the state can move forward with scheduled lethal injections for five death row inmates, including Julius Jones, whose case has drawn international attention and who is scheduled to die Nov. 28. Judge Stephen Friot denied a motion for a preliminary injunction sought by the five inmates, paving the way for the state to proceed with seven lethal injections scheduled over the next six months. The state is scheduled to conduct its first execution in more than six years Thursday, when John Marion Grant, 60, is set to receive a lethal injection for the 1998 killing of a prison cafeteria worker. Grant, Jones and three other death row inmates were removed from a federal lawsuit challenging the state’s three-drug lethal injection protocol because none of the five offered an alternative method of execution. A trial on that challenge is scheduled before Friot in February. “The case is complete in this court as to these five plaintiffs,” Friot said. Twenty-six of the 32 Oklahoma death row inmates who were on the original challenge provided the court with an alternative method of execution, including the use of different drug combinations or firing squad. Attorneys for the five inmates vowed to immediately appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city’s school board ended an in-person meeting amid controversy over a proposed COVID-19 vaccine mandate for children 12 and older after unmasked protesters showed up and refused to don face coverings. The board that oversees the state’s largest school district resumed its meeting with online streaming Tuesday after protesters refused to comply with requests from security guards to put on masks, according to a statement from Portland Public Schools. Some of the protesters were not from Portland but traveled from elsewhere in Oregon and Washington state, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Conversely, earlier in the day, about 500 students walked out of class in support of the proposed vaccine mandate. Rules to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in schools, such as a statewide school mask mandate for all children, have generated protests in other districts and school boards, and superintendents are often the focus of such actions. In Redmond, critics of state mandates have crowded board meetings and dominated public comment periods. In Adrian, school board members voted to fire Superintendent Kevin Purnell when he refused to buck state policy, the newspaper reports. The Portland school board is set to vote on the vaccine mandate for students older than 12 on Nov. 2.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Prosecutors have dropped a felony theft charge against a man who underpaid for a bottle of Mountain Dew by 43 cents. Perry County prosecutors dropped the theft charge this month against Joseph Sobolewski, 38, and downgraded another charge, the Patriot-News reports. In August, Sobolewski went into an Exxon in Duncannon and saw a sign advertising two 20-ounce Mountain Dew bottles for $3, he said. He took one bottle, slapped $2 on the counter for what he thought was a $1.50 soda and walked out, not realizing the discount did not apply to a single bottle. The bottle really cost $2.29, so including tax, he owed the store 43 cents. State police found Sobolewski and arrested him on a felony charge. A judge ordered him held on $50,000 cash-only bond. He was in jail for seven days before his public defender successfully argued for his release, the newspaper reports. Sobolewski had twice in the past 10 years been charged with theft, once for not paying for a tank of gas and another time for stealing a pair of shoes from a store. Under Pennsylvania’s three-strikes law, a third theft charge must be a felony, regardless of the amount or value involved. He faced up to seven years in prison.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The land where the Rhode Island Narragansett tribe survived near-annihilation in a battle with English colonists in 1675 has been transferred to the tribe. The transfer of the land from the Rhode Island Historical Society was finalized Friday. Tribal members gathered Saturday in the woods in South Kingstown at a monument commemorating what they believe to be the site of the Great Swamp Massacre, The Public’s Radio reports. They lit three fires representing the past, present and future and recognized the return of 5 acres of land they consider sacred. The tribe’s leaders in 1636 granted land to Roger Williams, an exile of the Puritan Massachusetts Bay colony who founded what became the city of Providence. Good relations with English colonists ended in the 1670s when the tribe was nearly destroyed in King Philip’s War. The battle was fought Dec. 19, 1675. Hundreds of tribal members were killed. In 1906, the family that owned the land gave it to the historical society to preserve it. The society has been working on the transfer for four years so the tribe itself could protect the land. It required court approval because the land was held in a trust. The Narragansetts are thankful, the tribe’s medicine man and historic preservation officer, John Brown III, told The Boston Globe. “For many years, the Narragansetts were visitors to a place that was theirs,” he said. “Now that this has happened, we know we can go back to a place of our forefathers, where there was happiness and sorrow, and we can go there as rightful owners.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The acting head of the state’s Office of Juvenile Justice says she faces a staffing crisis, with few applicants for hundreds of vacancies. Juvenile Justice corrections officers get $35,000 a year to start, but the shifts are grueling, and violence is an ever-present danger. Eden Hendrick, who was appointed after Freddie Pough resigned under fire a month ago, told legislators last week that she has more vacancies than working correction officers, The Post and Courier reports. “The applicant pool is the main problem,” she said. “There’s just no one that is applying right now,” The State newspaper reports. Hendrick told a state Senate corrections subcommittee that every recruiter in the office has left, so she plans to hire a recruiting company to find people interested in the 232 corrections officer vacancies. For now, she’s hired a part-time expert who used to recruit for the state Department of Corrections, The State reports. Hendrick also said she is stopping two programs started by Pough, who moved administrators to a building outside the main juvenile jail complex in Columbia and pushed to house juveniles with long sentences in regional facilities rather than the Broad River Road Complex. Regionalization is on indefinite hold because there isn’t enough staff or money, she said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBelle Fourche: Plans are in the works to build one of the largest ramen-producing facilities in the country in a small Black Hills community. CEO Bill Saller of California-based Albany Farms said the complex in Belle Fourche will include a flour mill, production factories and packaging areas that would produce more than 100 million packages of ramen each year and eventually employ up to 900 people. Belle Fourche Rail Park and the state’s agricultural economy are part of the plan, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Wheat will be brought to the factory, while ramen cups and packets will be shipped by train, Saller said. Albany Farms recently bought a building in Belle Fourche for its factory and is working on purchasing 11 of the surrounding acres, according to company spokeswoman Stephanie Magoon. The company manufactures its products overseas but decided it needed to switch gears once the pandemic hit. “With the onset of COVID, importing food became problematic. Transportation has become a major issue for food companies and certainly for us,” Saller said. Saller said the price for the company’s shipping containers has increased an average of $18,000 per container, doubling import costs. So the company decided to move all manufacturing to the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two bills introduced by lawmakers would forbid state licensing officials from disciplining doctors for how they treat COVID-19 or what they say about vaccines, potentially undermining a new effort to crack down on doctors who spread misinformation in the midst of the pandemic. State Reps. Debra Moody, R-Covington, and Chris Todd, R-Madison County, introduced bills Tuesday that each bar the Board of Medical Examiners and Board of Osteopathic Examination, which license and discipline physicians throughout the state, from taking any punitive action against a physician for the recommendations they make about COVID-19 treatment, mitigation or prevention. Moody’s bill protects any recommendation made “so long as the physician exercised independent medical judgment and believes the medical treatment is in the best interest of the patient.” Todd’s bill outlaws disciplining a physician “relating solely (to their) prescription, recommendation, use, or opinion relative to a treatment for COVID-19.” Dr. Stephen Loyd, a member of the Board of Medical Examiners who reviewed Todd’s bill, said he did not believe the legislation as written would have a great impact but conceded it might open the door for a doctor to argue that false claims were opinions protected under the law.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Voting rights advocates are suing the state again, this time with support from a former U.S. attorney general, over newly redrawn congressional district maps that favor the GOP, claiming the maps dilute the vote of communities of color after growth in America’s largest red state came overwhelmingly from Hispanic, Black and Asian American people. The lawsuit was filed Monday by Texas voters and Voto Latino, a voter advocacy organization, in an Austin federal court just moments after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the redrawn districts into law. Texas was the only state to be allocated two new congressional seats earlier this year after U.S. census figures showed the state’s population grew by 4 million people, nearly half of whom were Hispanic. The latest lawsuit alleges the new U.S. House maps violate the 1965 Voting Rights Act by not giving people of color a fair opportunity to elect their representatives. The maps do not include any additional districts in which Black or Hispanic voters make up more than 50% of eligible voters. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Jr., who leads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and whose affiliate organization, the National Redistricting Action Fund, is supporting the lawsuit, said the maps, which pave potentially safer paths for Texas’ majority GOP incumbents to remain in office, were a “desperate grasp for partisan political power.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Former U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop abruptly quit the state’s independent redistricting commission after criticizing it for favoring urban areas. Bishop, a Republican, said Monday that the commission’s congressional map proposals favored Democrats. The commission will present its map proposals to the Legislature’s redistricting committee Nov. 1. “This is a metro-centric group,” Bishop said during the meeting. “When five of the seven are from the Wasatch Front … the majority are from Salt Lake County, we see things in a different way.” House Speaker Brad Wilson, who appointed Bishop to the panel, said he shared Bishop’s frustrations with the commission and does not plan to appoint a replacement. “His decision to step down at this point in the process is further evidence that the duly elected representatives of the people are best suited to redraw district boundaries, as the courts have repeatedly affirmed,” Wilson said in a statement. Better Boundaries, the group behind the 2018 ballot initiative that created the independent commission, said it was disappointed by Bishop’s resignation. “Moving forward, we are encouraged by the work of the remaining six commissioners to suggest objective and qualified maps to the state legislative redistricting committee through this fair and transparent process,” Executive Director Katie Wright said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that he wouldn’t reimpose a state of emergency that would authorize him to put a statewide mask mandate back in place as the delta variant has driven an increase in coronavirus cases. Speaking at a weekly briefing about Vermont’s response to the pandemic, Scott said he doesn’t want to overuse the emergency power he has as governor. “There’s a time and a place for a state of emergency, and I can assure you this isn’t it,” he said. “And I believe that we’ll get through this with all the measures, all the mitigation measures we put into place and doing all the right things and taking some self-responsibility.” Scott said he’s also more optimistic about the future of the pandemic than he has been in weeks: Booster shots have been approved for most people over 18 who have already been vaccinated, the federal government is expected to authorize in the coming weeks vaccines for children ages 5 to 11, and COVID-19 case numbers are starting to decrease across the country and in Vermont. Still, a group of lawmakers, school nurses, and other medical professionals on Monday urged Scott to reinstate the state of emergency and indoor mask mandate, saying school staff, parents, hospitals and health care workers are stressed coping with the pandemic, some to the breaking point.\n\nVirginia\n\nPortsmouth: Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy will partner with Dominion Energy on a $200 million factory making turbine blades for offshore wind projects, creating 310 jobs, Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday. Virginia-based Dominion previously selected the Spanish company as its partner for its $7.8 billion energy generation project 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. The Siemens Gamesa factory at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal will produce turbine blades for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project as well as other offshore wind energy generators around North America. The factory project includes more than $80 million in investments for buildings and equipment at the terminal, where about 50 new service jobs are expected to support the effort. Over the next 10 years, building and operating the offshore wind industry will be worth $109 billion to businesses in its supply chain, according to a recent report from the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind. That figure is up from the group’s $70 billion estimate just two years ago. “Virginians want renewable energy, our employers want it, and Virginia is delivering it,” Northam said in a statement. “Make no mistake: Virginia is building a new industry in renewable energy, with more new jobs to follow, and that’s good news for our country.”\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: An investigation headed by a former U.S. attorney has found a sheriff violated policies against bias-free policing and other standards during a controversial January encounter with a Black newspaper carrier. The 48-page report by Brian Moran, released Tuesday, faulted Pierce County Sheriff Ed Troyer’s late-night decision to follow a car driven by then-24-year old Sedrick Altheimer and subsequently call in a large emergency response with claims that Altheimer threatened to kill him. “We are unable to substantiate Sheriff Troyer’s claim that Mr. Altheimer threatened to kill or harm him during that incident,” a summary of Moran’s report said. “We also find that a reasonable person could conclude that Sheriff Troyer exhibited an improper bias in his confrontation with Mr. Altheimer.” The Seattle Times reports the findings, commissioned by the Pierce County Council, found Troyer, who is white, violated professional conduct policies against bias-free policing and engaging in law enforcement activities while off duty, among others. It concluded Troyer may not have known Altheimer’s race when he first began following him in the early morning hours of Jan. 27, but he did know when he called a 911 emergency dispatcher.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Halloween is still days away, but the West Virginia Division of Highways is thinking ahead to keep drivers safe in snow and ice this winter. Drivers in the division’s District 1 just finished “dry runs” for winter snowplow routes. “We want to make sure that our trucks are well-maintained, greased and that all the equipment is working properly,” said District 1 Maintenance Engineer Kathy Rushworth. Running snowplow routes early allows drivers to familiarize themselves with their routes and get used to driving the plows. District 1 has 215 drivers assigned to drive plows in the snow and ice. They’re the same men and women responsible for cutting grass, trimming trees, cutting ditches and doing other maintenance work during spring, summer and fall. The district has plows dedicated to Boone, Clay, Kanawha, Mason and Putnam counties. Other snowplows are responsible for clearing snow and ice on U.S. 35 and interstates 64, 77 and 79.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Republican-controlled Assembly gave final approval Wednesday to a package of anti-abortion bills, many of which Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed two years ago and is all but certain to reject again. Republicans do not have enough votes in the Legislature to override a veto. Republicans said they were trying again because the measures are a priority, and there’s a chance Evers will change his mind. Democrats, who all voted against the bills, accused Republicans of only taking up the bills to energize conservatives ahead of the 2022 midterm election. One bill, which Evers vetoed in 2019, would impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance in which a baby is born alive following an abortion attempt. Violators would be guilty of a felony punishable by up to six years in prison. The bill also would make intentionally causing the death of a child born alive as a result of an abortion a felony punishable by life in prison. Doctors insist the bill is a solution in search of a problem. They and other opponents say babies are almost never born alive during failed abortion attempts, and in the rare instances in which they are, doctors are already ethically and legally bound to try and keep them alive.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Requiring workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 would result in up to $10 million in fines and at least $500,000 in damages under bills state lawmakers will consider in a rare special session that began Tuesday. In all, they plan to look at 20 proposals – including a few having nothing to do with President Joe Biden’s plans to require COVID-19 vaccination for certain workers – over the next several days after legislators debated whether to adjourn without considering anything at all. The House and Senate voted to move ahead despite rejecting timesaving rules to limit testimony and debate and prohibit bills unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination in an effort to wrap up the session in just three days. “In five days we are going to have hundreds of people, potentially thousands, who are going to lose their jobs because of a mandate,” said Rep. Chuck Gray, R-Casper, the lead sponsor of a bill that would allow people denied work because they’re not vaccinated to collect at least $500,000 in civil damages. A bill sponsored by Rep. Bill Fortner, R-Gillette, would fine any public servant who tries to enforce any COVID-19 vaccine mandate up to $10 million. Schools would be barred from enforcing student mask-wearing and vaccination against any disease under a bill sponsored by Rep. Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie. Wyoming has been one the most vaccine-resistant states, behind only West Virginia, and as a result has one of the highest case rates in the U.S. over recent months.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/12/turtle-power-ditching-dixie-phd-age-news-around-states/49365831/", "title": "Turtle power, ditching Dixie: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabamians can now get limited quantities of beer, wine and spirits delivered to their homes after the first companies have gotten licensed. Lawmakers this year approved separate bills to allow alcohol deliveries from retailers to a person’s home and to allow wineries to ship directly to consumers in the state. Several companies have gotten licensed to deliver the alcoholic beverages or to ship wine, according to the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. The ABC Licensing Division has several other pending applications for both alcohol delivery and wine shipment, spokesman Daniel Dye wrote in an email. As of Monday, four companies have so far been licensed to deliver alcoholic beverages: Shipt, Dippi, Pick Up My Things and Deerfoot Spirits. Five companies have gotten licensed to ship wine directly to consumers in Alabama: Penrose Hill Winery, James Cole Winery, Winecub, Truth Teller and Robert Young. Alcohol delivery may not yet be available everywhere as companies ramp up operations. Shipt announced last week that it is doing same-day delivery of beer and wine from Target. The company said it is working to expand delivery from additional retailers.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s largest airport saw a big jump in summer passengers compared to the 2020 season, when the pandemic kept many people at home. More than 877,000 passengers traveled through the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport between May and September this year compared to the same time last year, Anchorage television station KTUU reports. “The terminal was very busy this summer, so we knew it was going to be a good summer,” said Jim Szczesniak, the airport manager. Airport officials said those passengers injected more than $1 billion into Alaska’s economy. The travel group Visit Anchorage said hotel demand was up 47% over the same time period in 2020. “So we made some really encouraging gains, but we’re not back to where we were pre-pandemic,” Visit Anchorage Community Engagement Director Jack Bonney said. Both are cautiously optimistic for 2022. “I think as long as we stay on a positive course, we have a lot of really encouraging indicators for next year, but so much of this is tied up in national and global developments around the pandemic,” Bonney said. Szczesniak said he is hopeful the increase in passenger numbers will continue to climb with expanded cruises and international travel expected next year.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A conservation group says an additional 1,850 acres of a cattle ranch that is part of an important wildlife corridor in western Cochise County are now protected as open space. With the additional acreage, a total of 3,800 acres of the Rain Valley Ranch are now protected through conservation easements, the Arizona Land and Water Trust announced Wednesday. The ranch along State Route 82 east of Sonoita includes part of a wildlife corridor that links the Whetstone, Mustang, and Huachuca mountains. “With large properties in the Sonoita/Elgin area continuing to be purchased for single-family homes or ‘ranchettes,’ the threat of development increases for locations like Rain Valley Ranch, making its conservation critical,” the trust said in a statement. The additional protected landscape also benefits nearby Fort Huachuca by ensuring that potential electromagnetic interference with military training activities associated with the Army base remains low, the trust said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A man who died in prison more than two decades ago is now being investigated as a person of interest in the disappearance of a girl who went missing in 1995, according to the FBI. The agency is asking the public for more information about Billy Jack Lincks, 75, who died in prison in 2000 and had been arrested for attempting to abduct a girl months after 6-year-old Morgan Nick went missing. Lincks was serving a sentence for a 1996 conviction for sexual indecency with a child at the time of his death. “Today, law enforcement may be closer than ever to identifying” Nick’s abductor, the FBI said in a news release. FBI spokesman Connor Hagan said this is the first time the bureau has publicly identified someone as a person of interest in Morgan’s disappearance. Arkansas’ missing child-alert system is named for Morgan. Hagan declined to say if investigators have any evidence connecting him to Nicks’ disappearance. Lincks was raised in Crawford County and returned to Van Buren in the 1970s after serving in the Army during World War II and working at Braniff Airlines in Dallas from 1962 to 1974, the FBI said. Lincks attempted to abduct a young girl in Van Buren at a location 8 miles from the baseball field where Morgan was taken, the FBI said, asking anyone with any information about Lincks to contact 1-800-CALL-FBI.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The state has begun positioning equipment and locking in contracts with temporary health care workers in preparation for another possible winter surge of coronavirus cases, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. The most populous state in the country still is doing comparatively well with the rest of the U.S. in terms of cases and hospitalizations. But Newsom warned Californians should prepare for another harsh pandemic winter even though the state is among the nation’s leaders on COVID-19 shots, with about 74% of eligible people having received at least one dose of a vaccine. While statewide hospitalizations have fallen by about half since a summer peak at the end of August, they have started creeping up in some areas, particularly the Central Valley and portions of Southern California including Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. “We’ve seen some signs that suggest concerns,” Newsom said. California earlier this fall had the nation’s lowest case rate but is now 16th, he said, while the positivity rate for those tested for the virus is 2.3% after falling below 1% in June. Beyond the upward trend in certain parts of the state, state health officials said they are generally apprehensive because colder weather will keep people inside. There will be more holiday mingling as immunity acquired months ago begins to wane without booster shots.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: An appeals court panel on Wednesday reinstated a lawsuit filed by Republican lawmakers and a Colorado gun rights group challenging a “red flag” law that allows courts to order firearms taken away from people who pose a danger to themselves or others. The lawsuit, filed in 2019, argues that majority Democrats in the state House denied Republican lawmakers their constitutional right to have the red flag legislation be read in its entirety during debate. The bill was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis and took effect in 2020. When one GOP lawmaker requested a reading, multiple clerks read sections of the bill simultaneously, the plaintiffs said. A second representative’s request that the bill be read was denied, they said. Democrats countered that the bill was being read on the floor at the subsequent request of a Republican lawmaker until he withdrew that request. Colorado Politics reports that a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned a Denver district court judge’s ruling that the judiciary should not intrude on the prerogatives of the Legislature or other branches of government. The panel cited a Supreme Court ruling in an unrelated case that the courts can consider whether the Legislature has complied with the constitutional mandate for the reading of bills.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Mayor Justin Elicker appointed Renee Dominguez as the city’s police chief Wednesday, which would make her the first woman to permanently lead the force. Dominguez has served as acting chief since March, after the retirement of Otoniel Reyes. Her appointment must be approved by the city’s Board of Alders. City and state officials believe Dominguez also would be the first female permanent police chief in any of the state’s largest cities. Several women have led police departments in smaller cities and towns in Connecticut. In the state’s largest city, Bridgeport, Rebeca Garcia is currently the acting police chief. “I am very excited,” Dominguez said at a news conference Wednesday. “My entire adult life has been dedicated to serving the community.” Dominguez became a police officer in Newtown in 2000 and moved to the New Haven police force in 2002. She is married with two daughters, ages 3 and 6. “To be the chief and have little girls is a challenge,” she said. “But what better role model than your mother. You can do whatever you want, and you can be whoever you want to be.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Mourners shared laughter, memories and tears Wednesday as they paid their last respects to former Gov. Ruth Ann Minner. Minner, a sharecropper’s daughter, high school dropout and widow, was the only woman to serve as Delaware’s governor, holding office from 2001 to 2009. She died Thursday at the age of 86. Friends, family and fellow politicians, including President Joe Biden, paid tribute to her during a funeral at Milford Church of the Nazarene. They recalled her as a woman who was driven by steely determination but never forgot her humble upbringing and maintained a sense of empathy for fellow citizens. “Each time she climbed up the political ladder, she always stayed grounded in the lives of everyday people,” said Biden, who represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for decades. During her decades of public service as a state lawmaker, lieutenant governor and governor, Minner served as a mentor and role model for many of those who attended her funeral. “Like many of you in this church, I would not be here today as your governor were it not for Ruth Ann Minner. It’s just that simple,” said Gov. John Carney, who served two terms as Minner’s lieutenant governor. “She set the standard for all of us.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district’s government has struck a deal with the U.S. Marshals Service to improve the situation at the city’s main jail after it came under criticism and the Justice Department announced that 400 federal prisoners would be transferred out because of substandard conditions. Conditions at the jail had long been a point of criticism for local activists. The issue took on a national political dimension in recent months because many defendants from the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection were being held there. Wednesday’s announcement said the city Department of Corrections and the federal Marshals Service “will collaboratively assess conditions at the (Central Detention Facility) and develop a plan to address concerns.” Mayor Muriel Bowser said in a statement that she welcomed the attention and resources to “address any deficiencies” at D.C. facilities. “We all agree: everyone who is in our jail or under our supervised care should be treated humanely and have safe conditions,” Bowser said. Supporters of several Jan. 6 defendants filed suit, alleging the defendants’ civil rights were being abused at the jail. One of those cases led to a surprise Marshals Service inspection last month, which found unsanitary and abusive conditions, according to a damning report by Lamont J. Ruffin, the acting marshal for U.S. District Court in Washington.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Biologists were taken by surprise by a record number of leatherback turtle nests found along some South Florida beaches this year. The 79 nests laid by endangered turtles along beaches in Broward County in the 2021 season is nearly double the previous record, the South Florida SunSentinel reports. The previous record was 46 in 2012, and the record low for leatherback nests was 12 in 2017. “It’s difficult to say why Broward County saw such an increase in leatherback nesting this season,” Stephanie Kedzuf, a biologist for Broward County who specializes in sea turtles, told the newspaper. Kedzuf said she will be curious to see whether other areas in the state saw a similar increase. Leatherbacks, named for their tough, rubbery skin, typically crawl onto beaches at night and dig holes to deposit their eggs in the sand. They are among the largest of sea turtles. The nesting season runs from March 1 to Oct. 31. During that time, coastal buildings must shield or lower their lights to prevent them from disturbing the hatchlings. When the turtles hatch, they race toward the sea to avoid crabs, birds and other predators. The lights can draw them inland, where they could be run over or trapped in storm drains. The leatherback population has declined by 40% worldwide, the National Marine Fisheries Service said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gun maker Remington Firearms will move its headquarters from the Empire State to the Peach State. The company announced Monday that it would invest $100 million in the factory and research operation in LaGrange, southwest of Atlanta, hiring 856 people over five years. It wasn’t clear what effect the transfer would have on Remington’s operations in New York and Tennessee. The company owns the parts of the former Remington Outdoor Co. that make rifles, shotguns and some handguns after the former parent auctioned its assets in pieces last year in a bankruptcy proceeding. Remington, the country’s oldest gun maker, began making flintlock rifles in 1816. It swelled into a firearms conglomerate but faced slumping sales, complaints about quality, and legal pressure over the Sandy Hook school massacre. The current company no longer makes the Bushmaster AR-15 rifles used to kill 20 first graders and six educators in the shooting in Connecticut in 2012. “We are very excited to come to Georgia, a state that not only welcomes business but enthusiastically supports and welcomes companies in the firearms industry,” Remington CEO Ken D’Arcy said in a statement. Gov. Brian Kemp famously pointed a shotgun at another person in a campaign commercial when the Republican was seeking his current office in 2018.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Nearly 2,000 Kaiser Permanente health care workers in the state plan to strike later this month over wages and staffing concerns. UNITE HERE Local 5 said the strike due to begin Nov. 22 would affect 20 facilities across Hawaii. Thousands of Kaiser health care workers in California have already said they will strike starting Monday. Local 5 spokesperson Bryant de Venecia said Wednesday that negotiations were continuing. Kaiser and the Alliance of Health Care Unions began national bargaining in April. Local 5 has been negotiating some Hawaii-specific issues with Kaiser as well. Local 5 said in a news release that Kaiser’s latest proposal was for an “insulting” 2% wage increase contingent on the union’s agreement to a two-tier wage system under which new hires would receive lower pay. The union said Kaiser also failed to address concerns about short staffing, while workers report being stressed and overworked during the coronavirus pandemic. Arlene Peasnall, Kaiser’s senior vice president of human resources, said in a statement that Hawaii union-represented employees earn about 26% above the average market wage. She said Kaiser offered up to 4% yearly pay raises – 2% pay increases plus a 2% cash payout each year of a four-year contract. “The challenge we are trying to address in partnership with our unions is the increasingly unaffordable cost of healthcare. … Wages and benefits account for half of Kaiser Permanente’s operational costs,” she said, Hawaii News Now reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: A northern Idaho mayor has announced he’s running for governor. Sandpoint Mayor Shelby Rognstad said Monday in Lewiston that he’s running as a Democrat to defeat first-term Republican Gov. Brad Little. The 47-year-old Rognstad said he’s running to break the lock Republicans have had on the state for 30 years. “For the better part of a generation, Idaho has effectively been a one-party state,” Rongstad said, the Lewiston Tribune reports. “There are no checks and balances, no compromise, no accountability. This is dangerous. The most extreme voices now go unopposed. Commonsense leadership has been replaced by authoritarianism and culture wars.” Democrats have not held the governor’s office since 1995 or statewide elected office since 2007. Only 12 of the 70 House members and seven of 35 senators are Democrats. The Idaho secretary of state’s website lists Rognstad as the second Democrat to join the race, after Melissa Sue Robinson, 70, a transgender woman who owned a construction company before shifting to a career in telecommunications. She lists adequately funding education as a top goal. The race also includes eight Republicans. Little hasn’t yet announced his reelection plans but is expected to run and has been fundraising. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin over Little.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A police oversight agency recommended suspension and in some cases potential termination for more than half a dozen officers following a botched 2019 raid on the home of a Black woman who wasn’t allowed to put on clothes before being handcuffed, according to a report released Wednesday. Earlier this year, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which investigated the wrongful raid on social worker Anjanette Young’s home, noted nearly 100 allegations of misconduct by about a dozen officers. The agency’s report recommended between one day and one year of suspension for multiple officers and “up to and including separation” from the department for some officers. Police Superintendent David Brown has already moved to terminate one sergeant. The raid “reveals problems far more pervasive than any individual incident of officer misconduct,” the report said. It also noted “other concerns, including lack of adequate training and supervision surrounding the Department’s use of search warrants and the disproportionate impact of police actions on people of color.” The botched raid, first reported by WBBM-TV, and the city’s handling of it prompted anger from clergy, lawmakers and civil rights activists who decried it as racist and an affront to a Black woman’s dignity.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Public schools should treat the Black Lives Matter movement as a political group, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said Thursday, potentially limiting the ability of schools and teachers to promote the BLM message in classrooms. “Black Lives Matter is unequivocally a political organization,” Rokita said in a news release Thursday morning. “Promoting or displaying some politically based materials while prohibiting the promotion or display of others could create a liability for schools and could violate the First Amendment.” Rokita issued an advisory opinion on how schools should treat BLM at the request of two state lawmakers amid concerns about the politicization of students’ education and what Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, called the “controversial ideology” of BLM. Rokita’s opinion comes after months of debate around the country about how and what schools should and should not be teaching, particularly with regard to race and racism in America’s history. Conservative groups have decried the teaching of critical race theory in the nation’s K-12 schools, which do not teach the academic framework used by legal scholars to examine the intersection of race and law in America. Still, activists and parents have latched onto the term.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A former Iowa State Patrol officer with a history of excessive force allegations has been indicted on a federal charge over a 2017 traffic stop in which dashcam video captured him roughing up a motorcyclist. A federal grand jury charged Robert James Smith last week with violating the motorcyclist’s civil rights by using unreasonable force during the stop near West Liberty, roughly 15 miles southeast of Iowa City. The indictment notes that the victim suffered “bodily injury” during the encounter, which means the charge could carry a maximum of 10 years in prison. Smith is set to make his initial appearance Tuesday at the federal courthouse in Cedar Rapids. Dashcam video shows Smith pulling over Bryce Yakish for speeding. The routine stop escalated immediately when Smith ran from his car with his gun drawn and pointed at Yakish, then 20 years old. Smith used his left hand to strike the face shield of Yakish’s helmet, knocking him backward onto his motorcycle and to the ground. Smith briefly put his knee on Yakish’s neck while handcuffing him. Yakish can be repeatedly heard in the video complaining of neck pain. Smith falsely accused Yakish of trying to flee and charged him with eluding law enforcement, even though he stopped immediately after Smith activated his lights and siren. That charge was dropped after a prosecutor reviewed the video and concluded it was baseless. Yakish lost his license because of the arrest, his motorcycle was impounded, and he spent the night in jail.\n\nKansas\n\nPeck: A 19-year-old is getting ready to graduate from Washburn University’s School of Law in Topeka. Braxton Moral’s parents have long known he was gifted. He skipped fourth grade and took his first undergraduate class at Harvard University while still in sixth grade. As he got older, he spent his summers at Cambridge. But when the school year started, he switched to online classes so he wouldn’t miss out on experiences like prom and homecoming at Ulysses High School. “He just wants to be like everybody else,” said his mother, Julie Moral. “He’s a blessing from God.” At Harvard, Braxton developed a love for government and realized he wanted to go to law school. But what should have taken three years he completed in two and a half. Next month, Braxton Moral will receive his juris doctor degree. In February, he will take the bar exam. “When I started out, it was more about just something fun to do,” Moral said. “And then you start off, you’re like, ‘Well, I just kind of want to get better now.’ So once you get a little bit of experience, it transfers from just fine to an actual goal.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge has approved a request from Kentucky regulators to force West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice to pay $2.9 million in fines for cleanup violations at some eastern Kentucky coal mines. The Tuesday order from Franklin County Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate requires that the Justice companies finish reclamation work at the mines, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. The order also allows the state to take posted bonds to cover the work. Kentucky officials called the violations at the Justice-owned mines “among the most egregious we have seen in nearly a decade” when the original agreement with Justice was struck back in 2014. Most of the sites are surface mines. The work includes cleaning out ponds, stabilizing land, improving drainage and reshaping the land to its original, pre-mining contours. Under the agreement with Kentucky, the West Virginia governor and his son, Jay Justice, are personally, jointly liable for the $2.9 million penalty. Jay Justice runs the company’s coal, timber and agriculture businesses. The Justices have argued that they have not been able to meet the deadlines because of the economic downturn and safety concerns caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State government agencies lost more than 17% of their civil service employees in the last financial year. Byron Decoteau, director of Louisiana’s State Civil Service, said the turnover rate was nearly 2 percentage points higher in the 2020-21 budget year that ended June 30 than in the previous year. More than 6,000 civil service workers left state government in the latest year, including 21% who retired. Other employees were laid off, died, moved, left to go to school, got private-sector jobs or had other personal reasons, according to the report Decoteau presented to the commission that oversees the state workers who have civil service protection, called classified employees. The highest turnover rates were among prison guards at adult and youth prison facilities, the report showed – a consistent problem year after year. Decoteau noted that 10% of classified state employees currently are eligible to retire across agencies, while nearly 15% will be eligible to retire within five years. The data doesn’t cover political appointees across agencies or workers who transferred to other state government jobs.\n\nMaine\n\nSaco: State park campers set another record this year. Maine is home to 48 state parks and historic sites, and attendance and camping at the parks have soared during the coronavirus pandemic. Preliminary state figures showed Maine state campground attendance set a record for the second straight year, the Portland Press Herald reports. The state’s 12 state park campgrounds experienced an 8% increase in visitors from 2019 to 2020, when campers set a record of more than 270,000. This year, the number grew to about 315,000. The state parks were heavily used before the pandemic, and the onset of the pandemic led to even more use as residents and visitors sought more outdoor forms of recreation. This year’s attendance was especially high even though July, in the heart of camping season, was full of rain. State officials said they expected 2022 to be another big year for the campgrounds.\n\nMaryland\n\nManchester: Five bald eagles were found acting strangely and seemingly sick in northern Maryland, prompting an investigation by state wildlife officials. William Fauntleroy found the birds Sunday in the Manchester area of Carroll County near the Pennsylvania border, The Washington Post reports. He said he saw an eagle near his mailbox that was acting weirdly and appeared to be unable to fly. The group of birds was feeding on a deer carcass, according to Fauntleroy. One died after flying into a power line. “I saw some were flying poorly,” Fauntleroy told the newspaper. “One seemed like it couldn’t get off the ground and couldn’t fly. It was acting like it was drunk.” Wildlife rescuers took the four other eagles to the Phoenix Wildlife Center in Baltimore County. Maryland Natural Resources Police spokesperson Lauren Moses said her department is “actively investigating” to figure out what happened to the birds, a federally protected species. The deer carcass the eagles ate was buried so no other wildlife would feed on it, according to Moses. She told the Post that U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials were expected to take samples from the remains for analysis. “Was it poison? Was it an algae bloom? Was it something else?” the wildlife center said in a Facebook post Wednesday. “We don’t have answers yet.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Marine researchers in New England said Tuesday that they have collected data from tags that were surgically implanted in sea turtles for the first time. Scientists with the New England Aquarium who performed the work said it could lead to improvements in the way researchers monitor threatened species of turtles. The loggerheads were rehabilitated at the Boston-based aquarium’s turtle hospital and released earlier this year with the acoustic tags implanted in their bodies. Acoustic receivers in Nantucket Sound off Massachusetts showed multiple detections earlier this month, the researchers said. Scientists have long used turtle tagging to monitor the animals, but the tags have previously been placed on their shells using an epoxy. Kara Dodge, a research scientist with the aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, said the new tagging method will make it easier to monitor injured turtles that are released back into the wild after rehab. The tags allow scientists to “assess rehabilitated turtles’ survivorship over time and resumption of normal behaviors in the wild,” she said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Wednesday approved a $626 million deal to settle lawsuits filed by Flint residents who found their tap water contaminated by lead following disastrous decisions to switch the city’s water source and a failure to swiftly acknowledge the problem. Most of the money – $600 million – is coming from the state of Michigan, which was accused of repeatedly overlooking the risks of using the Flint River without properly treating the water. “The settlement reached here is a remarkable achievement for many reasons, not the least of which is that it sets forth a comprehensive compensation program and timeline that is consistent for every qualifying participant,” U.S. District Judge Judith Levy said in a 178-page opinion. Attorneys are seeking as much as $200 million in legal fees from the overall settlement. Levy left that issue for another day. The deal makes money available to Flint children who were exposed to the water, adults who can show an injury, certain business owners and anyone who paid water bills. About 80% of what’s left after legal fees is earmarked for children. “This is a historic and momentous day for the residents of Flint, who will finally begin to see justice served,” said Ted Leopold, one of the lead attorneys in the litigation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: COVID-19 hospitalizations have reached their highest level of the year in the state, and hospital capacity continues to tighten amid an alarming surge in cases, Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Wednesday. The Minnesota Department of Health on Wednesday reported 5,277 new coronavirus cases and 43 new deaths, raising the state’s pandemic totals to 831,669 confirmed cases and 8,925 deaths. Minnesota hospitals were caring for 1,159 COVID-19 patients, including 257 in intensive care units. Malcolm called the new case and death numbers “extraordinarily high and concerning” and said that “right now we find ourselves in a really truly alarming spike” in new cases. “Every day now we’re seeing dozens of Minnesotans dying from an illness that they didn’t have to get, and that is beyond heartbreaking for all of us doing this work,” Malcolm said. “The tragedy of this current spike in cases is that more than ever, we have the tools and the knowledge to minimize the impact of this virus.” Those tools include vaccinations, masking in public and staying home when sick, she said. Most Minnesotans are vaccinated, but too many still aren’t, she said. And Kris Ehresmann, the department’s infectious disease director, said the problem of “waning immunity,” which appears to show up around six months after vaccination, seems to be a factor in the rise of breakthrough cases.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state has finished repairing section of highway that collapsed during torrential rainfall brought by Hurricane Ida, and the road reopened Wednesday. Two people were killed and nine injured Aug. 30 as seven vehicles plunged, one after another, into a deep pit that opened up on the dark, rural stretch of Mississippi Highway 26 near Lucedale. One of the injured people died in a hospital Sept. 11. The Mississippi Department of Transportation awarded a $1.8 million repair contract in October. A construction company met the department’s goal of getting the highway back open safely and quickly, southern district Transportation Commissioner Tom King said in a news release Wednesday. “I know how important Highway 26 is for the region, and I appreciate all the work that went into getting it open ahead of schedule,” King said. Department of Transportation Director Brad White told legislators in September that the area had already received more than double its average annual rainfall before the hurricane, and then Ida dumped more than 12 inches of rain in less than one day. The stretch of highway is on a hillside, and White said the deluge blew out a pipe that ran under the roadbed. King said work will continue until early 2022 as crews repave routes that had been used as detours amid the closure.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Security camera footage, shell casings, and a small but distinctive tattoo played pivotal roles in the arrest of a man suspected in at least six killings over the past two months in the St. Louis and Kansas City areas. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s office on Tuesday charged Perez Deshay Reed in the shooting deaths of two people in the city in September. Reed was charged Saturday in two other fatal shootings in September in St. Louis County. He is also suspected of killing two people in Kansas City, Kansas, and the FBI has labeled him a suspected serial killer. Reed, who turned 26 on Wednesday, remained jailed on $2 million bond Tuesday. Surveillance video in Kansas helped lead to Reed’s arrest. Images captured by the cameras showed the distinctive crescent moon-shaped tattoo on Reed’s forehead. Another key factor was evidence left behind at each of the St. Louis-area shootings. “The commonality among them were handgun casings,” said Rich Quinn, special agent in charge of the FBI office in St. Louis. “We knew they came from the same handgun.” Reed is charged in the St. Louis County killings of 16-year-old Marnay Haynes on Sept. 13 and 40-year-old Lester Robinson on Sept. 26. In the city of St. Louis, he is suspected in the killings of 49-year-old Pamela Abercrombie on Sept. 16 and a 24-year-old man, Carey Ross, on Sept. 19. All four victims were shot in the head.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Tribes and conservation groups sued state environmental regulators Wednesday after Gov. Greg Gianforte’s administration dropped a legal claim against a mining executive over decades of pollution from several mines. The lawsuit was filed in state district court in Lewis and Clark County by attorneys for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Fort Belknap Indian Community, the Montana Environmental Information Center and other groups. Under Gianforte, the Department of Environmental Quality in July quit a legal action that sought to block Idaho-based Hecla Mining Co. and its president, Phillips Baker Jr., from involvement in two proposed silver and copper mines. Baker was an executive with Pegasus Gold, which went bankrupt in 1998, leaving state and federal agencies with more than $50 million in cleanup costs at several mines, including the Zortman and Landusky mines near the Fort Belknap reservation. A state “bad actor” law enacted in the wake of the Pegasus bankruptcy punishes companies and their executives who don’t clean up mining pollution. Under the law, companies and their senior leaders can’t receive new mining permits until they’ve reimbursed the state for past cleanup costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A coalition that includes labor unions and civil rights groups has launched a website and social media pages in its drive to get a measure to raise Nebraska’s minimum wage to $15 an hour on the ballot next year. Raise the Wage Nebraska says it wants to highlight the stories of the 195,000 Nebraska residents who’d see higher pay, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The coalition needs to collect 87,000 signatures on petitions by July 2022 to get its proposal on the ballot in November 2022. The measure would increase the minimum wage by $1.50 annually until it reached $15 in 2026. After that, there’d be an annual cost-of-living increase. Nebraska voters widely supported raising the minimum wage in 2014. Nearly 60% backed an initiative that increased it from $7.25 an hour to its current $9 an hour. Business groups oppose the measure, saying it could hurt small-business owners who already are having difficulty filling jobs as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts also is opposed. But supporters said raising the wage will help people living in poverty and working multiple jobs to make ends meet.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The Legislature is finally set to start redrawing the state’s political maps. Gov. Steve Sisolak announced Thursday that lawmakers would convene for a long-delayed special session focused on redistricting at 1 p.m. Friday. Sisolak said in a statement that he was looking forward to “an efficient and productive session” that will fulfill the Silver State’s constitutional duty to revise every federal, state and local voting district after each census. The redistricting process is controlled by whichever political party holds the Legislature, often resulting in districts that favor one party over the other, a process known as gerrymandering. Bitter battles over this practice happen often in Carson City, where a court-appointed panel had to finish drawing boundaries on which politicians couldn’t agree in 2011. The undertaking was almost equally toxic in 2001, when there were also legal challenges, then a special session called after remapping efforts repeatedly stalled in a split partisan Legislature. Draft maps debuted Tuesday point to the possibility of a more harmonious redistricting session in 2021, though Republicans are likely to take issue with proposed changes that could make the state’s two battleground congressional districts more Democratic-leaning over the next decade.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: After rejecting millions of dollars to help increase the state’s vaccination rate, the Executive Council on Wednesday reversed course and approved $22 million for the effort, along with a nonbinding resolution that condemns vaccine mandates. Last month, the Republican-led council, a five-member panel that approves state contracts, rejected $27 million in federal vaccination funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over concerns that language in the grants would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. The language the Republicans opposed has appeared in other contracts they approved, and both Republican Gov. Chris Sununu and Attorney General John Formella said it does not in any way impede the state’s sovereignty. Later in October, the council voted to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funding to help community health centers and regional public health networks set up school-based and community vaccination clinics. With the approval of Wednesday’s funds, that money will now be repurposed. “We are moving full steam ahead,” Sununu said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Garden State businesses owned by people of color were more likely to lose money during the early months of the pandemic and less likely have access to the credit they needed to make up for it, according to a study released Wednesday. The report showed Black- and Latino-owned business were at a particular disadvantage when it came to the government’s main emergency finance plan, the Paycheck Protection Program, forcing them to rely on their own savings to survive. “It was a bit of a worry; it was a bit of a panic attack,” said Tashianna Gayle, 34, owner of Hair Haven, a salon in Asbury Park. She was told she didn’t qualify for a PPP loan because she had only been open for a month before the pandemic hit. The report by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority was designed to look at how racial disparities during the pandemic’s economic crisis played out among small businesses in the state. “It’s discouraging and, sadly, not surprising that the pandemic hit Black- and Latino- owned businesses especially hard,” said Tim Sullivan, the New Jersey EDA’s chief executive officer. The agency rolled out a low-interest micro-loan program Wednesday that aims to address the disparity.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Two of the state’s largest hospitals announced Thursday that they would be focusing on patients who need care the most, meaning procedures that aren’t medically necessary will likely have to be delayed. While most patients are not dealing with coronavirus infections, officials at Presbyterian Healthcare Services and University of New Mexico Health say the ability to grow the capacity that was built over the past year due to the pandemic is now limited by space and the availability of health care workers. The two hospitals announced they were activating crisis standards of care, noting that it’s not really a shift in policy but rather a continuation of how they have been managing the crush of patients since last winter. “It’s really important to recognize we are not deallocating care. That is not part of this. We are not triaging and denying care,” said Dr. Jason Mitchell, Presbyterian’s chief medical officer. “At this point we are trying to make sure that every patient has care in a bed across our state and even in surrounding states.” He saud the decision will not be to take a patient off a ventilator, for example, but rather to find other hospitals within New Mexico or in neighboring states that can take patients or directing patients with less severe issues to urgent care clinics or other providers.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Six state correctional facilities will close next March in a cost-saving move amid declining inmate populations, officials announced Monday. More than 1,700 people work at the six upstate New York facilities, which house more than 1,400 inmates. The inmates will be sent to other locations, and no layoffs are expected from the closures, which are projected to save $142 million, according to the release from the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. The corrections agency said it will work with unions to provide staffers with transfer opportunities to other facilities or to other state agencies. The facilities set for closure March 10 are Ogdensburg Correctional Facility, Moriah Shock Incarceration Correctional Facility, Willard Drug Treatment Campus, Southport Correctional Facility, Downstate Correctional Facility and Rochester Correctional Facility. The governor was authorized by the Legislature this year to close state prisons amid a long-term drop in inmates. There are currently 31,469 inmates in state correctional facilities, down from a systemwide high of 72,773 in 1999. The agency said officials looked at multiple factors before making the decision, including physical infrastructure, program offerings, facility security level, proximity to other facilities and health services.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A trial judge on Wednesday ordered the state to pay out $1.75 billion to help narrow public education inequities, angering Republicans who said the directive usurps lawmakers’ constitutional authority over state coffers. Superior Court Judge David Lee, who is charged with overseeing corrective responses related to school funding litigation that began over a quarter-century ago, said the legislative and executive branches have been afforded every courtesy over the years to act decisively. But “this court’s deference is at an end at this point,” he said. The judge’s action likely will set up a constitutional showdown among the three government branches. Lee said his order wouldn’t take effect for 30 days, giving GOP leaders at the Legislature or others time for a legal challenge, which is likely. Republicans say that only the General Assembly can appropriate funds in state accounts and that Lee is violating the state constitution if he acts contrary to that. The state Supreme Court ruled in 2004 in the Leandro lawsuit – named after an early student plaintiff – that while North Carolina’s children have a fundamental right to the “opportunity to receive a sound basic education” under the constitution, the state had not lived up to that mandate.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A storm system that is expected to bring snow to the state late this week could help improve persistent long-term drought conditions. Forecasters are expecting 2 inches to 4 inches of snow in the eastern half of the state, with up to 6 inches in the northeastern corner of North Dakota. Wind gusts of up to 60 mph are expected along with the snow, potentially making travel difficult, according to forecasters. Drought conditions that brought hardships for ranchers and farmers this summer have made marked improvement. In eastern North Dakota in recent weeks, much of the region is no longer listed in any of the four drought categories, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Much of the central and west regions remain in severe or extreme drought, but even those areas have improved dramatically from last summer. There is no change in this week’s U.S. Drought Monitor map, which is updated every Thursday. “In the Dakotas, where long-term drought is still ongoing, livestock water quality and (mule deer) fawn production were both reported to be suffering as a result of the drought,” wrote National Drought Mitigation Center Climatologist Curtis Riganti. Harvest is mostly wrapped up in North Dakota, though about one-fifth of the corn crop and one-third of the sunflowers remain in fields.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A polar bear who was a fixture at the Toledo Zoo for more than two decades has died due to kidney disease. Michael Frushour, the zoo’s curator of mammals, told The Toledo Blade that the bear named Marty was euthanized Nov. 4, less than a month shy of his 25th birthday, Marty had been diagnosed a couple of years ago with what Frushour described as “age-related kidney disease.” Zoo officials had recently noticed that Marty wasn’t eating as much as usual and had become less active. An examination determined his kidneys were functioning very poorly, so they decided to have him euthanized. Marty was born in late 1996 and came to the Toledo Zoo from Chicago in 1999. In 2007, he went to the Pittsburgh Zoo for a year before he returned to Toledo. Marty and the Toledo Zoo’s female polar bear, Crystal, had several cubs together, and zoo officials believe Crystal – who turns 23 this week – may be pregnant again. The zoo hopes to replace Marty with another male polar bear, though it’s not yet clear when that might happen.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday directed the State Department of Health to stop issuing birth certificates listing a nonbinary option instead of designating a gender, despite a settlement agreement in a civil case in which the agency agreed to do so. The first-term Republican said in his order that his administration never reviewed or approved the settlement agreement, which requires the Oklahoma State Department of Health to amend birth certificates in a manner not permitted under Oklahoma law. The order directs the department to cease amending birth certificates in any way not specifically authorized under state law and to remove from its website any reference to amending birth certificates for nonbinary people. People who are nonbinary do not identify with traditional male or female gender assignments. Stitt also directed the Legislature to pass legislation when it returns next year to specifically prohibit the issuance of birth certificates with nonbinary designations. Freedom Oklahoma, which advocates for nonbinary and LGBTQ people, said in a statement that while the state is facing scrutiny over how it carries out executions, “it felt easy for the governor to try and refocus media narratives and partisan pressure by attacking some of the most marginalized and historically excluded residents of our state.” Nichole McAfee, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, said the governor does not have the authority to overturn an agreement entered into in a court of law.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A school board that recently banned teachers from displaying symbols including those supporting gay pride and Black Lives Matter has abruptly fired the superintendent, deeply upsetting members who opposed the move. The escalating disputes in the Newberg School Board come as schools nationwide have become battlegrounds, with arguments over vaccine and mask mandates, how racism is addressed in teaching, instruction related to sexuality and gender-neutral bathrooms. After Superintendent Joe Morelock was fired in a Zoom meeting late Tuesday night, board member Brandy Penner said Wednesday she believes the conservative board members fired Morelock because he didn’t aggressively implement their ban on controversial symbols, adding that the policy didn’t define what symbols would be unacceptable. Rebecca Piros – one of three who opposed his firing – told Morelock she was sorry. Morelock replied: “Just remember that from the darkest dark comes the brightest light, so everything will work out eventually.” Piros broke down in tears when she heard those words. On Wednesday, some residents of Newberg, a town of 23,000 about 25 miles southwest of Portland, erected signs quoting Morelock’s reply to Piros. Newberg Equity in Education, a group composed mostly of parents who oppose the school board’s recent rightward tilt, planned a demonstration Thursday at the school district office.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Justice was not blind when a lawyer dropped his pants after repeatedly setting off a metal detector at a courthouse. Jeffrey Pollock, 59, was trying to pass through security outside family court Wednesday, but the machine kept sounding an alarm, authorities said. The lawyer told guards his suspenders were causing the alerts, and he could not remove them. The guards asked him to keep trying until the alerts stopped. “After a heated discussion with the guards, Pollock unhooked his suspenders, dropped his drawers, took them off, and placed them in the bin to go through the metal detector,” the Allegheny Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. Authorities said Pollock stood in his shirt and underwear. He was charged with disorderly conduct. “I used poor judgment,” Pollock told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “I was trying to make a point.” The sheriff’s office noted “that visible underwear is not part of the dress code.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: An 89-year-old has achieved a goal he spent two decades working toward and nearly a lifetime thinking about: earning his Ph.D. and becoming a physicist. Manfred Steiner recently defended his dissertation successfully at Brown University. Steiner said he cherishes this degree because it’s what he always wanted – and because he overcame health problems that could have derailed his studies. “But I made it, and this was the most gratifying point in my life, to finish it,” he said Wednesday at his home in East Providence. As a teenager in Vienna, Steiner was inspired to become a physicist after reading about Albert Einstein and Max Planck. He admired the precision of physics. But after World War II, his mother and uncle advised him that studying medicine would be a better choice in turbulent times. He earned his medical degree from the University of Vienna in 1955 and moved just a few weeks later to the United States, where he had a successful career studying blood and blood disorders. Steiner studied hematology at Tufts University and biochemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before becoming a hematologist at Brown University. He became a full professor and led the hematology section of the medical school at Brown from 1985 to 1994.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The amount of money in state bank accounts continues to grow thanks to a quick recovery from the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and people spending money much faster than experts predicted. The latest estimate released Wednesday said South Carolina lawmakers will have nearly $1 billion more to spend this budget year, according to the state Board of Economic Advisers. That boosts the money over which the General Assembly has control to nearly $11 billion and doesn’t count the roughly $3 billion in federal COVID-19 relief money coming to South Carolina. It also doesn’t count about a $1 billion surplus after the state closed the books on the fiscal year that ended June 30. Predictions that economic growth would slow because of supply chain issues, consumers slowing their spending or dwindling federal stimulus money didn’t come true. The 13.2% growth in the 2020-21 fiscal year budget was the largest in at least 40 years, the board said. South Carolina sales tax collections continue to soar, growing by $500 million to $3.8 billion in the past fiscal year. Corporate tax revenues have also risen sharply thanks to retailers benefiting from all that extra money being spent. The state’s economic experts still think the rapid rise in revenue can’t continue.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Only 45% of educators are teaching required standards on Oceti Sakowin Essential Understandings, according to a new survey by the South Dakota Department of Education. OSEUs are basic understandings of Lakota, Dakota and Nakota culture and history. The standards were approved by the Board of Education Standards in 2018, which should make them required for all K-12 students, but DOE officials have said in the past that they were unsure how broadly OSEUs were used and that they weren’t required. Lawmakers have drafted bills to make sure OSEUs were required, but such a bill was shot down in the 2021 session. News of survey results comes months after it was revealed the DOE removed more than a dozen explicit references to the Oceti Sakowin from a draft of social studies standards before they were released to the public. That issue caused state-level protests and outcries from residents and educators. Weeks later, Gov. Kristi Noem ordered the DOE to restart the standards revision process to include more input from stakeholders, including Native Americans. But educators and Indigenous education advocates are still calling on Noem and other top education officials to resign after their mishandling of the social studies standards process.\n\nTennessee\n\nLynchburg: The distillery producing Jack Daniel’s whiskey is teaming with a military support group to help service members and their families get home for the holidays. More than 1,700 service members and relatives will head home through “Operation Ride Home,” organizers said. That’s the most participants in program history. In its 11th year, the program provides financial assistance to active-duty, junior-enlisted military members and their families to travel to loved ones’ homes nationwide. The Jack Daniel Distillery teams with the Armed Services YMCA to offer the assistance. Service members from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard have been assisted with travel to every state. “We are absolutely thrilled they’ll get to reunite with their loved ones this year,” said Chris Fletcher, Jack Daniel’s master distiller. “Providing some financial assistance to see that they make it home is the least we can do.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: An 18-year-old man has been arrested and charged with arson for a fire at a synagogue, officials said. Franklin Barrett Sechriest was held on a $100,000 bond for the Oct. 31 fire at Congregation Beth Israel, KVUE-TV in Austin reports. According to the Austin Fire Department, the fire was a “small exterior fire” that caused no injuries but resulted in an estimated $25,000 damage, including the synagogue’s wooden doors. Arson investigators said broken glass indicated an item might have been thrown at the building, and a flammable liquid accelerated the fire. An arrest affidavit describes surveillance videos from multiple cameras on the property showing a suspect resembling Sechriest driving a black sport utility vehicle registered to a woman living at the same address as Sechriest. The fire at the synagogue came a week after a string of antisemitic incidents, including an antisemitic banner displayed from an overpass on a heavily traveled boulevard. It was not immediately clear if the fire was connected to those incidents.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Southern Utah’s Dixie State University is poised to change a name often associated with the Deep South and slavery after the Legislature approved a new name Wednesday over local backlash. The Republican-controlled Legislature voted to change the name to Utah Tech University after multiple executives from the burgeoning tech sector said the Dixie name is often met with confusion and distaste as the institution grows. GOP Gov. Spencer Cox is expected to sign the bill. The term got new scrutiny following a national outcry against racial injustice after the death of George Floyd. “This process is not about cancel culture. No one is trying to erase the great history of this beloved institution,” said Republican Rep. Kelly Miles, who sponsored the name-change bill. “We as Utahns pride ourselves in our forward thinking … it just makes sense that our students in this great state will be better served by the name Utah Tech University.” A compromise provision will keep the name Dixie on the main campus in St. George, a city near the Arizona border that’s among the fastest-growing in the country.\n\nVermont\n\nLyndon: A federal grant will go toward helping the state to educate more nurses. Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College announced Wednesday that the $240,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce would be used to expand Vermont Technical College’s existing nursing program at Northern Vermont’s University’s Lyndon campus. Vail Hall on the Lyndon campus will be transformed into the Clinical Nursing Education Center, complete with a nursing instruction classroom and skills and simulation lab spaces. “Addressing Vermont’s nursing workforce challenge requires increasing opportunities for Vermonters to pursue careers in nursing,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy said in a statement. Officials say the number of new registered nurses in Vermont declined 69% from 2007 to 2014. It’s estimated that Vermont needs 900 skilled nurses per year. In 2019, 421 completed licensed practical nurse or RN programs.\n\nVirginia\n\nArlington: President Joe Biden saluted the nation’s military veterans as “the spine of America” on Thursday as he marked his first Veterans Day as president in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. “There’s nothing low-risk or low-cost about war for the women and men who fight it,” said Biden, whose administration earlier in the day announced a federal effort to better understand, identify and treat medical conditions suffered by troops deployed to toxic environments. Earlier in the week, members of the Chief Plenty Coups Honor Guard from Pryor, Montana, placed flowers in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and saluted the unknowns. Dozens more Crow Nation representatives, including students from Plenty Coups High School, followed suit Tuesday morning – the first time in 96 years the public and visitors had been allowed to approach the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It’s a privilege typically reserved for the sentinels of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment, “The Old Guard,” according to the Arlington Cemetery. The flower ceremony kicked off a two-day centennial commemoration event. The dedication of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier took place Nov. 11, 1921, according to the National Archives.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amtrak Cascades will resume service Nov. 18 on the Point Defiance bypass between Tacoma and Olympia, nearly four years after a deadly derailment there. The first train to use the bypass is scheduled to leave Seattle at 7:22 a.m. and arrive at the new Tacoma Dome station at 8:08 a.m., according to an Amtrak statement. The first northbound train will leave Eugene, Oregon, at 5:30 a.m., stop in Portland and arrive in Tacoma at 10:54 a.m., The Seattle Times reports. Amtrak said eight trains – including Amtrak Cascades and Coast Starlight – will use the bypass daily, with additional trains added as COVID-19 restrictions ease. Additional safety measures and most of the National Transportation Safety Board’s recommendations have been implemented following the 2017 derailment, Amtrak said. The other recommendations are being pursued, the statement said. Key among the improvements is the installment of activated positive train control, which uses GPS technology to stop or slow a train before a collision or derailment occurs. The NTSB first called for widespread use of the crash-preventing technology in 1990, and in 2008 Congress mandated that it be installed on every passenger route and high hazardous material route across the U.S. within seven years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Health care coverage has been stopped for striking maintenance and service workers at a hospital, according to a union. About 1,000 members of the the Service Employees International Union District 1999 went on strike last week at Cabell Huntington Hospital after their contract expired. Union organizing director Sherri McKinney said in a statement that the coverage was cut off without notification to striking employees and union retirees, The Herald-Dispatch reports. Hospital human resources director Molly Frick said in a statement that “union leadership was well aware that a strike would result in the cessation of pay and benefits. Any employee who wishes to return to work will have all benefits restored, including healthcare insurance.” A Cabell County judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday that was sought by the hospital prohibiting the union from certain activities outside the hospital. Frick said the activities include loud noises, such as the use of bullhorns and loud music, that have disturbed hospital patients. The injunction also prohibits strikers from honking horns and encouraging drivers to honk, blocking hospital entrances, interfering with traffic at the hospital, or making threatening statements to anyone trying to enter or leave the hospital’s campus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: People who receive a COVID-19 vaccine at a Saturday clinic at Fiserv Forum will get to have their picture taken with the Milwaukee Bucks’ championship trophy, according to a Milwaukee Health Department news release. The health department and the Bucks are teaming up for a vaccine clinic from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday in the atrium of Fiserv Forum. “Everyone vaccinated at this clinic will have the opportunity to take a photo with the Larry O’Brien Championship Trophy,” a news release said. The focus of the clinic is on children ages 5 to 11, and the clinic’s offerings will include pediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. “Vaccination is the best tool to keep ourselves and our children safe from COVID-19,” Milwaukee Health Commissioner Kirsten Johnson said in a news release. “We hope the opportunity to ‘take a shot’ in the home of the 2021 World Champion Milwaukee Bucks will encourage Milwaukee children and families to get vaccinated.” The clinic will also offer first, second and booster doses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for eligible individuals, the news release said. Flu shots will be available as well. Those under the age of 18 will need permission from a parent or guardian to receive a vaccine.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A grizzly bear and her four cubs who are already well-known to wildlife watchers got even more attention by taking a nighttime stroll through the city. Security video showed the bears wandering around downtown Jackson on Tuesday night, according to local police. Police and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials shooed the five bears into a less populated area near town, the Jackson Police Department said in a statement Wednesday. Grizzly No. 399, so named for an ear tag she received after being trapped for study, has been familiar to wildlife watchers for years. She’s had a reputation for lingering with her cubs near roadways in Grand Teton National Park, making her arguably the Yellowstone region’s most well-known grizzly. Biologists speculate that hanging around people helps keep away male grizzlies, which are known to kill cubs. Charming as it may seem for a mother bear and four yearling cubs to roam a tourist town, the bears’ behavior has worried wildlife managers. The bears have been raiding garbage, bee apiaries and animal feed in the Jackson area, raising the risk of a dangerous encounter with people. On Saturday, biologists trapped three of the four cubs. They put tracking collars on two in the hope that knowing the bears’ whereabouts will help prevent problems.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/05/deepening-drought-fish-sticks-around-pistol-pete-news-around-states/50805425/", "title": "Deepening drought, fish sticks around: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state has set a November execution date for a man convicted in the 1988 murder-for-hire killing of a pastor’s wife. The scheduled execution follows criticism over the state’s last two lethal injection attempts, including one that was called off after the execution team had trouble finding a vein. Kenneth Eugene Smith, 57, is set to die at Holman Correctional Facility on Nov. 17, according to a Friday order from the Alabama Supreme Court. Smith was sentenced to death for the killing of Elizabeth Dorlene Sennett, a 45-year-old grandmother and pastor’s wife. Prosecutors said Smith was one of two men who were each paid $1,000 to kill Sennett on behalf of her husband, the Rev. Charles Sennett, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance. Elizabeth Sennett was found dead March 18, 1988, in the couple’s home in Colbert County. The coroner testified that she had been stabbed eight times in the chest and once on each side of the neck. The pastor killed himself a week later. Smith maintained it was the other man who stabbed Elizabeth Sennett, according to court documents. Smith was initially convicted in 1989, and a jury voted 10-2 to recommend a death sentence, which a judge imposed. His conviction was overturned on appeal in 1992. He was retried and convicted again in 1996.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Acting state Revenue Commissioner Deven Mitchell has been chosen as the new chief executive officer of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. The announcement was made Monday by the fund’s board. The corporation said in a statement that the selection “is contingent on the successful negotiation of a salary and benefits package” and that a start date has not yet been set. Mitchell has called Alaska’s nest-egg oil wealth fund the state’s “trump card” as a renewable source of revenue, the Anchorage Daily News reports. His message to the board was that he would not chase short-term cash yields, as the fund has been invested for long-term growth. He also said he doesn’t see the CEO’s role as second-guessing investment decisions made by the corporation’s chief investment officer or as overriding his decisions. Earnings from the fund traditionally have been used to pay annual dividends to residents. Since 2018, earnings also have been used to help pay for state government. Mitchell last month stepped down as the state’s debt manager and executive director of the Alaska Municipal Bond Bank Authority when Gov. Mike Dunleavy appointed him to be the acting Department of Revenue commissioner.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An abortion clinic has come up with a way for patients who can end their pregnancy using a pill to get the medication quickly without running afoul of a resurrected state law that bans most abortions. Under the arrangement that began Monday, patients will have an ultrasound in Arizona, get a prescription through a telehealth appointment with a California doctor, and then have it mailed to a post office in a California border town for pickup, all for free. While not as easy as before an Arizona judge ruled that a pre-statehood law criminalizing nearly all abortions could be enforced nearly two weeks ago, the process saves an overnight trip to a major California city with an abortion clinic. And it is more accessible than the previous workaround used by Camelback Family Planning in Phoenix, which was to have a doctor in Sweden prescribe the pills and a pharmacy in India mail them to Arizona. That could take up to three weeks. Ashleigh Feiring, a nurse at the clinic, said the cost of the pills will be covered by the Abortion Fund of Arizona, which is helping women pay for out-of-state access to abortions. Women can use a pill for an abortion until the 12th week of pregnancy. Pills and surgical abortions were legal until about 24 weeks until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June.\n\nArkansas\n\nNorth Little Rock: Authorities say three people have died after a fire early Tuesday at a North Little Rock apartment complex. The fire broke out shortly after 2 a.m. at an apartment near Shorter College, authorities said. North Little Rock Fire Department Capt. Dustin Free told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that three adults died in the blaze. The fire, which was extinguished by about 7 a.m., was contained to one apartment but caused the second floor of the building to collapse onto the first, Free said. “This was an all-hands-on-deck situation,” he said. “We work every day to save a life, but sometimes we are notified too late. The firefighters came in and tried to stop the fire aggressively.” The cause of the blaze remained under investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The past three years have been the state’s driest on record, and officials said Monday that they’re preparing for the streak to continue. The official water year concluded Friday, marking an end to a period that saw both record rainfall in October and the driest January-to-March period in at least a century. Scientists say such weather whiplash is likely to become more common as the planet warms. It will take more than a few winter storms to help the state dig out of drought. Though it’s impossible to predict with certainty what the winter will bring, “we are actively planning for another dry year,” said Jeanine Jones, drought manager for the state Department of Water Resources. Jones spoke alongside state climatologist Michael Anderson about the just-completed water year. The water year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30 so that the rainiest winter months are recorded together. Snow that falls in California’s mountains typically provides one-third of the state’s annual water supply, but last year snow levels were far below average by the end of the winter. The Colorado River, another major source of water for Southern California, is also beset by drought, threatening its ability to supply farmers and cities around the U.S. West.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man survived a bear attack in his own backyard when he fired at the animal and scared it away after it threw him to the ground, state wildlife officials said. The attack occurred Saturday night in the small town of New Castle, Colorado Parks and Wildlife area manager Kirk Oldham said in a news release. The man went into his backyard after hearing a noise and encountered the bear, which threw him to the ground, officials said. He then threw up an arm to protect his face while grabbing a gun with his free hand and firing three shots, they said. It’s unknown whether the bear was hit by the bullets. The man told Parks and Wildlife that he had seen the bear in his yard the previous two nights. Heavy rain made it difficult for Parks and Wildlife officers to find and follow a blood trail and bear tracks as they searched for the animal, the news release said. They were still searching Monday. The man, whose name was not released, was treated at a hospital for minor injuries to his hand and arm and bruising on his chest, the release said. It’s the second bear attack in the western Colorado town in the past three months as bears prepare for hibernation, Oldham said. In August, a bear charged a woman and swiped at her, lacerating her arm and back. She recovered, and a mother bear and cub were euthanized, The Denver Post reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal by the Connecticut State Police Union in its challenge of a police accountability law that allows public disclosure of certain state trooper personnel files and internal investigation reports. At issue were documents in internal probes that end with no finding of wrongdoing. The union argued the 2020 state law violated the 2018-2022 troopers’ contract by stripping away its exemptions from state freedom of information laws and allowing such documents to be publicly released. Union officials say troopers oppose the law because it allows records involving unfounded allegations to become public, possibly tarnishing a trooper’s reputation despite no findings of wrongdoing. The Supreme Court did not say anything about the case in rejecting it among a host of others, as is typical. The decision upholds rulings by lower federal courts that upheld the state law. Andrew Matthews, executive director of the state police union, said the decision is going to have a chilling effect. Proponents of the 2020 law, which included many other reforms, said it answered the calls for reform, including accountability and transparency, after the police killings of George Floyd and other Black people.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Elevated lead levels in water were found at nearly 50 schools, prompting the Delaware Division of Public Health to advise shutting off at least one school’s drinking water supply in New Castle. Water samples were taken from 25 locations at the Wallace Wallin School in the Colonial School District last year and on multiple occasions throughout the summer, with all but three coming back with elevated lead levels. The results prompted the school to shut off its drinking water supply throughout the building at the beginning of the school year and utilize bottled water while the state continues to test the water quality and determine a plan for remediation, said Ted Lambert, director of facilities for the school district. The Wallin School is one of 47 schools across the state that tested positive for elevated levels of lead, according to results released by the state last month. Wallin’s highest results were over 12 times the maximum acceptable level in a staff break room. Lead levels from a water fountain outside a classroom at the school came back nine times higher than acceptable levels. According to federal standards, acceptable levels of lead in water must be lower than 0.015 milligrams per liter; however, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes says there is no safe blood level for young children.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With an ambitious goal of ending generations of racial discrimination, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a plan Monday to boost Black homeownership, hoping to place 20,000 families into their own homes by 2030, WUSA-TV reports. “We know we want to add more homes, but we want to be intentional about making sure people can afford those,” Bowser said in the announcement at the Howard Theatre. According to a report gathered by the Black Homeownership Strike Force, only 34% of D.C.’s Black residents owned their own homes in 2019, compared to 49% of white residents. The task force pointed to a history of discriminatory practices that have prevented Black families from attaining property and generational wealth. Bowser’s plan attempts to correct both. “These recommendations are ambitious but are imminently doable if we all work together,” said Vanessa Perry with the Housing Finance Policy Center. The task force issued 10 recommendations including using the mayor’s allotted $10 million down payment to help families buy and maintain homes and rezoning neighborhoods to allow for more multifamily housing. “I am standing before you as a testament that homeownership is possible,” Brittney Freeman told the crowd at the Howard. “I am indeed my ancestors wildest dreams.”\n\nFlorida\n\nPolk City: A 21-year-old deputy appears to have been fatally shot by friendly fire from deputies with whom he was serving a warrant in central Florida early Tuesday, authorities said. The Polk County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that Deputy Blane Lane was shot in the left arm and chest at a trailer in Polk City while serving a warrant with three other deputies on a suspect wanted for failing to appear on a felony drug charge. Shots were fired after deputies discovered the suspect with what appeared to be a handgun pointed at them but actually was a BB gun. Two of the deputies fired their guns, and “the round that struck Lane came from one of their firearms,” the sheriff’s office statement said. The deputy, who Sheriff Grady Judd described as one of the youngest on the force, was taken to a hospital, where he died “despite valiant efforts,” the sheriff said. The suspect, Cheryl William, also was hit multiple times. She was taken to a hospital where she was in stable condition. She faces a felony second-degree murder charge, among other charges, the sheriff’s office said. The sheriff’s office planned to hold a line-of-duty death funeral with full law enforcement honors for Lane.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The prosecutor investigating whether ex-President Donald Trump and his allies broke the law trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state is seeking search warrants in the case, a sign that the wide-ranging probe has entered a new phase. The revelation came Monday in a court order filed by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who’s overseeing the special grand jury seated to help the investigation. In an order sealing any search warrants and related documents from being made public, McBurney wrote that District Attorney Fani Willis’ office is “now seeking to obtain and execute a series of search warrants, the affidavits for which are predicated on sensitive information acquired during the investigation.” Disclosure of the information could compromise the investigation, McBurney wrote, “by, among other things, causing flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, and intimidation of potential witnesses.” It could also result in risks to the “safety and well-being” of people involved in the investigation, he wrote. It wasn’t immediately clear who the targets of the search warrants are or whether any search warrants had yet to be approved by a judge.\n\nHawaii\n\nJoint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam: The commander of the task force responsible for draining fuel from a World War II-era storage tank facility that leaked jet fuel and poisoned Pearl Harbor’s tap water last year said Monday that he’s exploring ways to get community feedback. Rear Adm. John Wade told reporters at a news conference he may establish an advisory group, but he’s not sure yet what form it will take. He said getting input from the community will help him be more responsive. He said Hawaii’s elected officials told military leaders that it would be valuable for them to give the community a voice in their work. “I don’t have the structure yet. It’s still a work in progress, but I think it’s something that’s important,” said Wade, the commander of Joint Task Force Red Hill. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Wade’s appointment last month. In November, jet fuel spilled from a drain line at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, flowing into a drinking water well and then into the Navy’s water system serving 93,000 people in and around Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. Nearly 6,000 sought medical attention for ailments like nausea, headaches and sores. The military put about 4,000 families in hotels for several months. Wade said he’s started reaching out to Hawaii’s congressional delegation and other local leaders.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal judge has ordered the state and its prison medical care provider to pay more than $2.5 million in legal fees to a transgender inmate who sued after she was denied gender confirmation surgery. The cost, however, will not come out of taxpayer dollars. Instead, it will be covered by Corizon Correctional Healthcare under a separate agreement with the state. Adree Edmo sued the state and the Idaho Department of Correction’s health care provider, Corizon, in 2017, alleging they were violating her Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment by denying her gender confirmation surgery. Edmo identifies as female, but she had long been housed in the men’s prison while she served a 10-year sentence for sexually abusing a 15-year-old boy. In her lawsuit, she asked a judge to order the state to allow her to change her name, provide her with access to gender-appropriate clothing, transfer her to a women’s correctional facility and provide her with gender-confirmation surgery. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled in 2018 that the state must provide Edmo with the surgery and said that continuing to deny the treatment would place her at risk of irreparable harm. The state appealed Winmill’s ruling, and it was two more years before she received the gender confirmation surgery, becoming the second person in the U.S. to undergo the surgery while incarcerated. She was transferred to a women’s prison to serve the remainder of her sentence and was released in 2021.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Cook County judge on Monday threw out convictions for eight more people whose cases were linked to a notorious former Chicago police sergeant who regularly framed people for drug crimes they didn’t commit. Judge Erica Reddick vacated the convictions and sentences of the men in response to motions filed jointly by their attorneys and the Cook County State’s Attorney Office. The action followed the dismissal of 44 convictions in April and brought to 237 the number of vacated convictions in recent years linked to former Sgt. Ronald Watts and his tactical unit, State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said. Watts, a Black sergeant, led a team that for nearly a decade until 2012 planted drugs or falsely accused residents of a public housing complex and others who were visiting or simply happened to be in the area. Watts and another officer pleaded guilty in 2013 to stealing money from an FBI informant. Watts received a 22-month prison sentence. “Vacating these convictions provides just a fraction of relief for those who spent time in prison, away from their families, and we will never be able to give them that time back,” Foxx said. “We will continue to review these cases as we seek justice for all his victims.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: At the start of the pandemic, the number of people killed in homicides across the state as a result of domestic violence jumped 180%, as shutdowns and stay-at-home orders sometimes led to unintended consequences such as locking people in with their abuser. But while businesses, schools and workplaces have reopened, and building capacities have returned to normal, experts say domestic violence homicides have not decreased as much as they expected. In the past decade, Indiana has averaged 55 to 60 deaths from domestic violence annually, according to the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence. From June 2020 to July 2021, domestic violence homicides jumped to 98. The coalition tracks such deaths through news media and advocacy organizations that report when a person dies as a result of domestic violence. It often means the numbers are much lower than reality, which makes the rising number of deaths recorded in the past two years more concerning. The coalition’s latest data show there hasn’t been a corresponding reduction in homicides from domestic violence as shelters returned to full capacity and social distancing requirements loosened. Seventy-seven people from 2021 from late June this year died in Indiana from domestic violence.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state board on Monday rejected claims for $1 million payments for 52 prison inmates who were given six times the proper dose of COVID-19 vaccines last year. The three-member State Appeals Board, which considers state legal financial obligations, unanimously denied the claims from inmates who received the extra doses in April 2021. The 52 inmates who each sought a $1 million payment were among 77 prisoners at the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison who had been given overdoses of the Pfizer vaccine by prison nursing staff. The board – made up of State Auditor Rob Sand, State Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald and Iowa Department of Management Director Kraig Paulsen – accepted the recommendation of the Iowa attorney general’s office lawyers to reject the claims. The lawyers advised that under the federal Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, “the state is immune from claims arising out of administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.” The mistaken doses occurred after the vaccine was delivered in concentrate form that was supposed to be diluted with saline solution. Two nurses were fired after the incident. A spokesman for the union representing prison staff said the overdoses happened after the prison abruptly switched from using the Moderna vaccine to the Pfizer version.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Enrollment in the state’s public universities and colleges is on a downward trend that started before COVID-19 but surged as more teenagers have pursued other options after high school. Headcount enrollment, or the raw number of individual students across the Kansas Board of Regents system, decreased by 1% overall, according to the Regents’ count released Thursday. Meanwhile, full-time equivalent enrollment – calculated by dividing the total number of credit hours taken by 15 hours for undergraduates and 15 for graduate students – fell by a slightly lower amount of 0.9%. In a statement, Regents chair Jon Rolph, Wichita CEO of the Thrive Restaurant Group, said the board acknowledges the declines but is working as a system to reverse the trend. “Our system is taking decisive action to reverse declining enrollments, better serve students and ensure that our state has the workforce needed to grow the Kansas economy,” Rolph said. “Initiatives such as our general education package and implementation of student success initiatives will help our system serve and graduate more students.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: While the battle over a voter referendum that will determine the future of abortion rights in Kentucky has drawn considerable attention, it is not the only constitutional amendment on the ballot this fall that could have a large political impact on the future of the state. Constitutional Amendment 1 is a rather lengthy, 744-word ballot referendum that essentially would give more power to the General Assembly – letting legislators call themselves into a special session and potentially extending regular sessions to end later in the year. Currently, only a governor can call legislators into a special session, in which they may pass bills that are within the parameters set by the governor. The Republican supermajority that pushed for the ballot referendum wants to be able to initiate special sessions with legislation of their choosing, while Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear wants to retain this power in the governor’s office. Under the proposed amendment, the Legislature could be called into a special session by a joint proclamation of the House speaker and Senate president, though they could only meet for a maximum of 12 days per calendar year in such sessions. Kentucky is one of just 14 states in which only the governor can call the legislature into a special session.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: An outspoken Christian conservative attorney has asked a federal appeals court to revive a pastor’s damage claims against state officials over long-expired COVID-19 restrictions. A federal judge this year dismissed minister Tony Spell’s lawsuit against Gov. John Bel Edwards and others over enforcement of the ban. Spell drew national attention for his flouting of the restrictions early in the pandemic at his church in Central, near Baton Rouge. One of Spell’s attorneys is Roy Moore, the former Alabama Supreme Court justice and U.S. Senate candidate, who insisted in arguments this week before a panel of judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the state had no authority whatsoever to restrict church gatherings. Panel members appeared skeptical of that claim in arguments Monday. But they raised the question of whether Spell’s church was unfairly restricted, compared with other public gathering places, such as shopping mall food courts. “They have treated us differently,” Moore said. “But the basis of our argument is there is no jurisdiction to limit a church attendance.” Spell has had some legal victories in his fight with the state. Louisiana’s Supreme Court threw out state charges against him in May, ruling 5-2 that restrictions in place at the time violated Spell’s freedom of religion.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunkport: The Kennebunkport Heritage Housing Trust, a local nonprofit organization whose mission is to build 25 affordable or “attainable” homes in town by 2025, has completed one neighborhood and is now actively seeking properties on which to build a second and third, according to Executive Director Larissa Crockett. Heritage Woods, the completed neighborhood, includes six new homes, all purchased and now occupied. One morning last month, Crockett stood on Briggs Way – named after Patrick Briggs, the president of KHHT – and said the new homes there are designed to accommodate the way people live today. “Inside, they have really bright, open, sunny, airy, shared spaces,” she said, looking at the duplexes and single homes in view. Tanya Alsberg and Jennifer Armstrong are an example of two people whom KHHT has helped attain their own home in Kennebunkport. In April 2021, Alsberg and Armstrong stood at the edge of an excavated, gravel-filled hole and dreamed. Now, at the very same site, they live in their own home, thanks to KHHT. They bought and moved into the place in February. “We’re kind of crazily happy,” Alsberg said. “Every single day, we do the happy dance. Now that we’re here, it has changed our lives. ... It’s a lovely home.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A Johns Hopkins University scientist who created a website to track COVID-19 cases worldwide is the recipient of this year’s Lasker award for public service. The $250,000 awards, announced last week by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, recognize achievements in medical research. The public service award went to Lauren Gardner, an engineer who studies the spread of diseases. She worked with her lab team to develop the COVID-19 tracker as the coronavirus began spreading worldwide in January 2020. The dashboard became a key resource and now tracks global cases, deaths, vaccines and more. Through it all, the team has made the tracker freely available to the public. The dashboard set “a new standard for public health data science” and helped inform both personal decisions and policy, the Lasker Foundation said in a release.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former Northeastern University employee who said he was injured when a package he was opening on campus exploded last month was charged Tuesday with fabricating the incident. Jason Duhaime, formerly the new technology manager and director of the university’s Immersive Media Lab, was charged with “conveying false and misleading information related to an explosive device” and then lying to federal investigators, federal authorities said. “This alleged conduct is disturbing to say the least,” U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said at a news conference. “Our city, more than most, knows all too well that a report or threat of an explosion is a very serious matter and necessitates an immediate and significant law enforcement response, given the potential devastation that can ensue.” Duhaime told investigators the hard plastic case exploded when he opened it Sept. 13, causing “sharp” objects to fly from the case and injure his arms, but his arms only had superficial marks, and there was no damage to his shirt or signs the case had been near an explosion, investigators said. The case also contained a rambling yet “pristine” typed note full of misspellings and exclamation points that railed against virtual reality, referenced Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and threatened to “destroy” the lab. And investigators found a word-for-word electronic copy stored in a backup folder on a university computer in Duhaime’s office – written just hours before he called 911.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A judge dismissed charges Tuesday against seven people in the Flint water scandal, including two former state health officials blamed for deaths from Legionnaires’ disease. Judge Elizabeth Kelly took action three months after the Michigan Supreme Court unanimously said a different judge acting as a one-person grand jury had no authority to issue indictments. Kelly rejected efforts by the attorney general’s office to just send the cases to Flint District Court and turn them into criminal complaints, the typical path to filing felony charges in Michigan. “Simply put, there are no valid charges,” Kelly said. Kelly’s decision doesn’t affect former Gov. Rick Snyder because he was charged with misdemeanors, and his case is being handled by a judge in a different Flint court. But he, too, was indicted in a process declared invalid by the state Supreme Court. In 2014, Flint managers appointed by Snyder took the city out of a regional water system and began using the Flint River to save money while a new pipeline to Lake Huron was being built. But the river water wasn’t treated to reduce its corrosive qualities. Lead broke off from old pipes and contaminated the system for more than a year. Separately, the water was blamed for an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, which typically spreads through heating and cooling systems.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two of the four former police officers who were convicted of violating George Floyd’s civil rights during the May 2020 restraint that killed him were scheduled to begin serving their federal sentences Tuesday. The Bureau of Prisons typically would assign J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao to a federal facility, but authorities had not publicly said where they would go. They are scheduled to go to trial on state charges of aiding and abetting both murder and manslaughter later this month. The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office said it anticipated Kueng and Thao would be transferred into its custody for the trial, but further specifics were not provided for security reasons. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill issued an order Monday saying the sheriff’s office must provide the men with access to three sets of clothing for the trial – as well as for two hearings scheduled for later this week – further suggesting that they will be in local custody. Kueng, Thao and Lane were convicted earlier this year of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care as the 46-year-old Black man was pinned under former Officer Derek Chauvin’s knee for 91/ 2 minutes while handcuffed and facedown on the street. Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back, Lane held his legs, and Thao kept bystanders back.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Forty years after Mississippi University for Women started enrolling men, its president says the school should consider choosing a more inclusive name. Previous attempts to remove “women” from the name, including the most recent one in 2009, have brought strong backlash from alumni of the school, nicknamed the W. Men make up about 18% of the 2,700 students at MUW. In a letter to alumni, President Nora Miller said the university is creating a task force to examine a name change, the Commercial Dispatch reports. Miller said she received a letter in May from the Deans Council at the university, acknowledging the current name presents “challenges.” “I assure you, no matter what happens, we maintain our historic commitment to academic and leadership development for women, forever embracing our status as the first state-supported college for women in the United States,” Miller wrote in the letter sent Sept. 28. The president of MUW in 2009, Claudia Limbert, proposed changing the name to Reneau University to honor Sallie Reneau, who wrote to the Mississippi governor in the mid-19th century to propose a public college for women. That renaming effort fizzled amid opposition from outspoken graduates.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A $40 million tax credit package for farmers and other agricultural businesses neared passage Monday, when a committee voted to send the bill to the full state Senate. The bill was expected to come up for a final Senate vote Tuesday. The measure extends several agricultural tax credits that expired and creates some new tax credits, including breaks for gas stations that sell biodiesel and fuel with a higher percentage of ethanol. The legislation also would expand government loan programs for farmers in the state. The Republican-led Missouri Legislature passed a bill with similar provisions during the regular legislative session this year, which ended in May. But GOP Gov. Mike Parson vetoed the measure, citing a two-year sunset attached to the tax credits that he said was too short. He also said the bill unconstitutionally included a provision on recycled asphalt shingles, violating a rule against including multiple topics in the same legislation. Parson called a special session – primarily focused on cutting individual income taxes in the state – and tasked lawmakers with extending the agricultural tax breaks for at least six years. Lawmakers last week sent Parson a bill to cut individual income taxes from 5.3% to 4.95% beginning next year.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A judge struck down as unconstitutional three laws that restricted voting in the state, saying there was no evidence of the widespread voter fraud that the 2021 Republican-sponsored laws ostensibly were targeting. The laws ended same-day voter registration, imposed new identification requirements on students and restricted third-party ballot collections. The restrictions were put on hold in April under a temporary injunction later upheld by the Montana Supreme Court. Election officials declined to say if they would appeal the latest ruling to the state high court. And with the election just over a month away, it’s uncertain if justices would render a decision before Nov. 8. Native American tribes that sued over the laws argued the student ID and ballot collection measures would hurt voters on remote reservations, where many people live far from polling places and are dealing with poverty and other challenges. Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen, who oversees elections in the state, requested the voting measures last year as Republicans around the country changed voting laws in the wake of the November 2020 election. The moves followed claims made by ex-President Donald Trump and parroted by his supporters that the election was stolen.\n\nNebraska\n\nHalsey: Progress has been made in containing a large Sandhills wildfire where one firefighter died while fighting the flames, which also destroyed much of a popular youth campsite and threatened a small village, officials said Tuesday. The Bovee Fire in west-central Nebraska’s remote Thomas County was 30% contained Tuesday morning, according to a statement from the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team, which has taken over management of the scene. Favorable weather conditions, including high humidity, temperatures in the 60s and some rainfall, are helping fire crews contain the grasslands blaze that was sparked Sunday afternoon and ballooned to 15,000 acres, or about 24 square miles, within six hours. The fire destroyed the main lodge and cabins of the Nebraska State 4-H Camp, as well as an observation tower in the Bessey Ranger District of the Nebraska National Forest. Purdum Volunteer Fire Department Assistant Chief Mike Moody died Sunday after suffering an apparent heart attack while battling the fire, officials said. Officials ordered the evacuation of the nearby village of Halsey and shut down a stretch of Nebraska Highway 2 as smoke from the fire cut visibility. The highway was reopened by Monday. Officials have said the fire was “human-caused” but have not released details.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A $20,000 reward is now being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever killed five wild horses in eastern Nevada late last year, the Bureau of Land Management announced Monday. BLM officials said the National Mustang Association pledged to double the previous $10,000 reward in the case. Authorities said five mortally wounded horses were discovered Nov. 16 in Jakes Valley, about 30 miles west of Ely. They said the horses all were located within 600 yards of each other about 2 miles south of U.S. Highway 50, and an aborted fetus was attached to one of the dead animals. The BLM is investigating and prosecuting the killings as part of the enforcement of the Wild Horses and Burro Act of 1971.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has resumed COVID-19 mobile vaccination clinics and a home-based vaccination program. “As we move into the fall and winter, we want to make sure everyone has access to the updated COVID-19 booster doses that better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variants,” Patricia Tilley, the state’s director of Public Health Services, said in a statement Tuesday. Three mobile vaccination vans are available to provide free COVID-19 inoculations, both primary series and updated booster doses. Public and private clinics will be available statewide. The home-based program visits any part of the state to provide free COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses to those individuals who are unable or have difficulty leaving their home or have been advised by a medical provider that their health or an illness could worsen by leaving their home. The programs are funded through the American Rescue Plan and will run through March 2023. Groups can schedule a mobile vaccination clinic at on-sitemedservices.com/van or by calling (603) 826-6500, and residents can make an appointment for a home-based COVID-19 vaccine or a booster dose at on-sitemedservices.com/vaccine or by calling (603) 826-6500.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The Assembly approved a revised version of a state child tax credit Monday, fixing an error in the legislation that would have delayed payments for two years. The Legislature passed the program in June, and Gov. Phil Murphy signed it into law, providing a refundable credit of up to $500 per year for each child under the age of 6. The program was a response by Democrats to soaring costs of living and closer-than-expected state elections last fall. But a drafting error in the initial legislation meant the credit could not be claimed until the end of the 2023 tax year, and families would not get the benefit until 2024. Monday’s vote by the Assembly moved the eligible tax year forward, so the credit will be available next year. The state Senate approved the fix last week. The program will cost the state $135 million to $156 million annually, according to a state fiscal analysis released last week. The credit is $500 per child for families earning up to $30,000 a year. The benefit decreases by $10 for every $1,000 increase in yearly family income, until it reaches a minimum of $300 per child for a household earning up to $80,000, according to the legislation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Pete’s Most Wanted Salsa, a new product bearing the image of New Mexico State University mascot Pistol Pete, celebrated its launch last week with a party at La Posta de Mesilla, and the university says more branded products will soon be joining a growing family of licensed NMSU merchandise. “There’s a realm of possibilities out there, and as long as it’s a good-quality product, I don’t see why this thing won’t keep expanding,” NMSU athletics director Mario Moccia said. Sales of NMSU-licensed beer, wine and whiskey are reportedly robust. Precise data was unavailable, but non-apparel licensed products – including the alcoholic products but also its other consumable and non-consumable items such as lawn chairs and tents – totaled approximately $116,700 in the last fiscal year. And the university’s licensing company stated in a recent report that NMSU ranked second among college institutions with licensed alcoholic products, including the first collegiate-branded spirit, Pistol Pete’s Six Shooter Rye Whiskey. Moreover, NMSU ranked fifth in sales of consumable licensed products among colleges and universities, according to the Collegiate Licensing Company/Learfield Licensing Partners, which licenses university-branded products\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Giant tents for temporarily housing migrants arriving in the city are being moved to an island off Manhattan from a remote corner of the Bronx, after storms raised concerns about flooding at the original site. Mayor Eric Adams announced Monday that the city’s humanitarian relief center will now be on Randall’s Island, which sits in the waters between Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx. It’s connected by five bridges to the three boroughs, and people can take buses or walk off the island to reach the city’s subway system. The center’s tents had been put up in a parking lot at Orchard Beach, in the northeast part of the Bronx on Long Island Sound, where access to public transportation is limited. Images online showed water ponding at the site following rainfall over the weekend. In a statement announcing the change, Adams said while the city could have made the original location work, moving the center “is the most efficient and effective path forward.” The city’s plan for Orchard Beach had been met with concern by immigration advocates, who cited its inaccessibility among other reasons, and that concern extended to the new location. “The city must look to other solutions instead of tent cities, where our clients will be isolated, vulnerable to extreme weather, and far from public transportation and other critical services,” the Legal Aid Society and the Coalition for the Homeless said in a statement issued Tuesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The State Board of Elections directed county election officials Monday not to engage in signature matching when reviewing absentee ballot envelopes this fall after a judge rejected the GOP appeal of a state board ruling prohibiting the practice. According to a directive sent to county election directors from the board’s legal counsel Paul Cox, the judge’s ruling maintains the status quo outlined in state law, which requires that all absentee voters fill out their ballots in the presence of two witnesses or a notary. Absentee ballot request forms in North Carolina must also include a date of birth and either a driver’s license number or the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. The North Carolina Republican Party had filed motions in Wake County Superior Court last week, asking the court to block the state board from enforcing its declaratory ruling that prevented county election officials from comparing signatures on absentee ballot request forms and return envelopes with the signatures included in voter registration records. Superior Court Judge Stephan Futrell ruled from the bench Monday afternoon, denying the party’s motion for a temporary restraining order and preventing the use of signature matching in the 2022 general election, state board spokesperson Pat Gannon said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A trial has been set in a federal lawsuit brought by two Native American tribes that allege the state’s new legislative map dilutes tribal members’ voting strength. The bench trial is scheduled for June 12, 2023. A bench trial means the verdict is up to the judge alone. The lawsuit filed in February by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and the Spirit Lake Tribe alleges that North Dakota’s new legislative map violates the Voting Rights Act. The Legislature during its special session last fall approved the map, based on updated census data. The map includes the new state House subdistricts for the Fort Berthold and Turtle Mountain Indian reservations. Turtle Mountain argues the split House district “packs” tribal members into a single subdistrict on its reservation, while diluting their vote in the non-reservation subdistrict. Spirit Lake alleges the new redistricting map dilutes American Indian voters on and near its reservation. A federal judge in July dismissed the state’s argument that the tribes lacked the standing to sue. Tim Purdon, an attorney for the tribes, said about half of the 14-member GOP-led redistricting committee will be called as witnesses in the trial. He would not name them.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The nation was shocked when a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim was forced to obtain an abortion in Indiana after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. But in the months since, court records detailed at least two other minors who traveled out of state for abortions because Ohio banned doctors from performing the procedure after cardiac activity was detected. New data from the Ohio Department of Health offers some insight: In 2021, 538 children ages 17 and younger legally obtained abortions in Ohio, including 57 who were younger than 15 years old. That represents 2.5% of the 21,813 abortions performed in Ohio last year. The state does not track how many abortions were performed on victims of rape and incest. The age of consent in Ohio is 16 years old. The Ohio Department of Health report offered a snapshot of abortion access in Ohio before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and the state’s six-week ban took effect. The “heartbeat bill” is now on hold, blocked temporarily by a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge. The number of abortions performed in Ohio increased by nearly 6% in 2021, the second year in a row of increased abortions. Of the 21,813 abortions performed in 2021, 20,716 were for Ohio residents, and 1,097 people came from other states.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Department of Human Services has implemented a 25% rate increase for providers who work with some of Oklahoma’s most vulnerable individuals as part of the agency’s push to eliminate its 13-year waiting list for developmental disability services. DHS on Saturday bumped its provider reimbursement rates to increase pay for a variety of medical professionals, including nurses, speech therapists, group home employees, direct care staffers who help developmentally disabled Oklahomans, and those who help low-income seniors. An official from a Sallisaw-based provider that serves Oklahomans with intellectual and developmental disabilities said this is the largest one-time rate increase nationally. Sheree Powell, government liaison at Sequoyah Enterprises Inc., said the reimbursement rate increase is key for providers to recruit and retain the best employees as businesses across the state have increased wages due to the pandemic and related worker shortage. The Legislature this year earmarked $32.5 million in new appropriations for DHS to clear its developmental disability services waiting list. Roughly one-third of that funding will go toward the provider rate increase. The boost brings hourly wages from about $9.50 to $12, DHS Interim Chief of Staff Samantha Galloway said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A jury has awarded a racial justice demonstrator more than $1million in a federal lawsuit she filed against the city in 2020 accusing officers of violating her civil rights. Eleaqia McCrae, a Black woman, sued the city and the police department, accusing police of intentionally targeting Black people with deadly force during the protest, which followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police officers in May 2020. The jury found McCrae proved that Officer Robert Johnston shot her in the eye and chest with rubber bullets and violated her “Fourth Amendment right not to be subjected to excessive force.” McCrae said the bullets caused permanent vision loss and a chest injury. The jury also found she did not prove by “preponderance of the evidence” that Johnston violated her First Amendment right to lawful assembly or that he committed battery against her. She was awarded $250,000 in economic loss and $800,000 in non-economic loss, the jury verdict documents said. McCrae’s attorney, Kevin Brague, said in the lawsuit that McCrae attended a demonstration May 31, 2020, and after nightfall, people unrelated to the march arrived and began throwing objects. McCrae said she, her sister and a friend were kneeling at the front of the march when she was shot twice.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A judge has barred enforcement of an executive order signed by Mayor Jim Kenney last week banning guns and deadly weapons from the city’s indoor and outdoor recreation spaces, including parks, basketball courts and pools. Common Pleas Judge Joshua Roberts on Monday ordered Philadelphia “permanently enjoined” from enforcing the order after a legal challenge, citing Pennsylvania state law that prohibits any city or county from passing gun-control measures, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. The Gun Owners of America, on behalf of several state residents, filed a lawsuit immediately after Kenny’s order, the latest attempt by Philadelphia officials to regulate guns inside city limits. Attorneys for the city had cited its role as a property owner managing its facilities, saying that distinguished the order from previous legislation passed by the City Council and struck down in court. Andrew Austin, who represents the plaintiffs, said in a statement that he was gratified by the court’s quick action. But he said it was “in large part because the law is so explicit: The city is not allowed to regulate possession of firearms in any manner.” “It is unfortunate that the mayor and city are willing to waste their time and taxpayer money on these type of ‘feel-good’ measures,” Austin said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: With the “Superman Building” as a backdrop and an unsheltered woman surrounded by her belongings just yards away, more than 50 protesters gathered at Burnside Park on Monday to demand that Gov. Dan McKee declare a state of emergency and take more action to provide immediate shelter to Rhode Islanders experiencing homelessness. “It’s your friends. It’s your neighbors. It’s your relatives. These people are not a separate category of human beings. They’re people who need help,” said Eric Hirsch, a Providence College professor who’s spent three decades advocating for people without housing. At last count, there were 405 people living without shelter in the state, not factoring in others who are staying with family and friends, said Hirsch, co-chair of the state’s Homeless Management Information System Steering Committee. The protest came as McKee and state Secretary of Housing Josh Saal participated in Crossroads Rhode Island’s Celebration of Housing to highlight “record investments in housing.” The event touted $12 million in state and federal money for the development of Crossroads’ Summer Street Apartments in Providence, a 176-apartment complex that will provide current residents of the Crossroads Tower with one-bedroom units that include private bathrooms and full kitchens.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Every year, law enforcement agencies across the state turn in crime data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a voluntary basis. The optional nature of this self-reporting can leave gaps when comparing crime data from the FBI to local agencies. “You likely have seen news stories where a crime was solved or an investigation was supported or a missing person was found. It was a crime analyst who connected those dots,” said Michele Covington, executive director of USC Upstate’s Greenville programs and an associate professor of criminal justice. “When you see crime trends, and an agency is able to trend downwards, there’s usually an analyst behind that.” The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on the U.S. criminal justice system, compiled a report of which agencies fully reported, partially reported, or neglected to report crime data for the 2021 calendar year. Eighty-five percent of South Carolinians saw their jurisdictional law enforcement agency fully report 12 months of 2021 crime statistics to the FBI, despite only 30% of agencies in the state fully reporting. The largest agencies in the state by population coverage not to fully report were the York County Sheriff’s Office, Charleston Police Department and Aiken County Sheriff’s Office. Most of the major agencies missing data were located in the Midlands and Lowcountry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Native Americans who plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter in South Dakota receive on average 11 years longer in prison than their white counterparts, according to an analysis and investigation of court records spanning 10 years. But prosecutors and judges called into question the sample size and said several factors go into sentencing decisions, such as criminal histories and the specific nature of the crime. The Sioux Falls Argus Leader pulled data from the South Dakota Unified Judicial System, filtering by charged convictions made by offenders who were Native American. The data only captures those who pleaded guilty and/or avoided a trial, reflecting the majority of convictions in the state during the past decade. The data also excludes those who were given life sentences. A total of 84 offenders pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in South Dakota during the past 10 years, according to the data. Of those cases, 44% were white, 32% were Native American, 16% were Black, and 7% were Hispanic or Latino. Four of the 84 received a life sentence, according to the data. None of the four were Native American. White people convicted of first-degree manslaughter on average were sentenced to 35 years in prison, Native Americans to 46, Black people to 40 years and Hispanics to 42.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The snail darter, a tiny fish that derailed a federal dam during an epic battle over Endangered Species Act protection in the 1970s, is no longer considered imperiled, officials announced Tuesday. The fish held up construction of the Tellico Dam in Tennessee for more than two years as biologists and others fought to protect its only known habitat, the free-flowing Little Tennessee River. The battle, which went to the U.S. Supreme Court and beyond, is still sometimes cited as an example of environmentalist overreach, although the reality is much more complicated. The dam eventually was built, with snail darters collected and transplanted into other rivers. They were also later discovered in several additional streams. Snail darters went from being considered an endangered species in 1975 to a threatened species in 1984 as they continued to recover. Three years ago, the Center for Biological Diversity, Jim Williams and Zygmunt Plater petitioned to remove the fish from federal protection altogether. Williams is the biologist who listed the snail darter as endangered. Plater is the attorney who sued to protect it. The U.S. Department of the Interior on Tuesday announced the snail darter’s official removal from the federal list of threatened and endangered wildlife.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A man accused of killing 22 elderly women in the Dallas area and stealing jewelry and valuables has been linked by DNA evidence to one of the deaths, a prosecutor said Monday. Billy Chemirmir, 49, is on trial for capital murder in the death of 87-year-old Mary Brooks. It’s Chemirmir’s third trial. His first trial, in the smothering death of 81-year-old Lu Thi Harris, ended in a mistrial last November when the jury deadlocked. He was retried and found guilty in April and sentenced to life without parole. If convicted in Brooks’ death, he’ll receive a second sentence of life without parole. Prosecutor Glen Fitzmartin said in opening statements that while presenting evidence in the deaths of Brooks and Harris, he would also show that DNA links Chemirmir to the death of 80-year-old Martha Williams. Chemirmir has maintained his innocence. His attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf Monday but declined to make an opening statement. His arrest was set in motion in March 2018 when Mary Annis Bartel – 91 at the time – told police that a man had forced his way into her apartment at an independent living community for seniors, tried to smother her with a pillow and took her jewelry.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Five years after they allegedly snuck into a pig farm and recorded video of themselves smuggling two piglets away from what they said were inhumane living conditions, two animal rights activists are set to face a jury trial this week despite protests about a mistake made during Monday’s jury selection process. Wayne Hsiung and Paul Darwin Picklesimer, the two remaining defendants facing charges from the 2017 incident, could face more than 10 years in prison on charges of felony burglary and theft. They were part of a group of five people who reportedly recorded a series of disturbing videos at Circle Four Farms in Milford, Utah, where owner Smithfield Foods was operating one of the country’s largest pig farms. The other three people charged in the case struck plea deals earlier, but Hsiung and Picklesimer pursued their cases, saying they hoped they could raise awareness about animal cruelty at factory farms and potentially set new precedent if a jury determined they were justified in taking the piglets because they feared for the animals’ lives. Jury selection in the trial was set to start Monday at the 5th District Courthouse, but there was controversy even before the trial could begin after defense lawyers protested they had not received information on prospective jurors and asked for a mistrial.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: The state Health Department has confirmed five cases of Legionnaire’s disease in Franklin County, including one death, but the source of the infection is unknown, it said Tuesday. The cases were reported between Aug. 12 and Aug. 29 and appear to be clustered in the St. Albans area, the department said. The death was in a person in their 70s, it said. The general risk to residents is very low: Most healthy people exposed to the bacteria do not get sick, the Health Department said. The disease can be treated with antibiotics. Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. Air-conditioning units for large buildings, hot tubs, cooling misters, decorative fountains or plumbing systems are common sources of infection, officials said. Symptoms, which start two to 14 days after exposure, can include a cough, muscle aches, fever, shortness of breath and headache, the department said. The disease is not contagious and almost never spreads from human to human, the department said. People with symptoms who live or work in Franklin County are encouraged to contact a health care professional. Those age 50 and older who smoke or formerly smoked, have chronic lung disease, or have a weakened immune system are at increased risk of serious illness.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Higher prices at the grocery store mean more and more people in the area are relying on food banks to feed themselves and their families. The Thomas Jefferson Area Food Bank has been packed, its warehouse holding rows of pallets of canned goods stacked to be packed into kits for seniors or distributed to members of the community who need emergency food. As of late, it’s also held lines of people. “This is the one day this week where it hasn’t been crowded,” said the food bank’s partner engagement manager, Joe Kreiter. Rising food costs are being blamed. Prices swelled 11.4% between August 2021 and August 2022, according to the most recent Consumer Price Index report Michael McKee, CEO of the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, which partners with the Thomas Jefferson Area branch, said the organization served 110,000 people in July, an increase from 106,000 in June. He expects the upward trend to continue. High rent in Charlottesville and Albemarle County and a lack of affordable child care often leave little room in a family’s budget, McKee said. Single mothers, seniors and children are the three groups who depend on food-assistance programs the most. Food banks used to provide emergency food assistance, but they’ve become a regular source of food for low-income people, Kreiter said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amazon has sued the state’s labor agency following disputes with regulators over citations and fines imposed on the company for worker safety issues. In the lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court for the Western District of Washington, Amazon asked a judge to prohibit orders from the Washington Department of Labor & Industries to remedy any types of workplace hazards during the company’s pending appeal over the citations. Amazon argued in the lawsuit that the agency has not proven any of its allegations and that requiring companies like it to remedy alleged hazards before that happens violates the due process protections under the 14th Amendment. Matt Ross, a spokesperson for the agency, said the department is aware of the lawsuit and will review it along with the state’s attorney general’s office. The agency had said in March it inspected an Amazon warehouse in Kent, Washington, and found workplace processes that “create a serious hazard for work-related back, shoulder, wrist, and knee injuries.” It said workers were expected to perform tasks, such as lifting and carrying items, at a fast pace that heightened the risk of injury. Amazon’s warehouse injury rate has been higher compared to other warehouses, which CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged earlier this year and said the company was attempting to improve.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A voucher program that would provide parents state money to pull their children out of K-12 public schools is blatantly unconstitutional and would disproportionately affect poor children and those with disabilities, a lawyer representing parents who sued the state argued Tuesday in West Virginia’s Supreme Court. The Hope Scholarship Program, which was passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature last year and would have been one of the most far-reaching school choice programs in the country, “negatively and intentionally” impacts West Virginia’s system of free schools, lawyer Tamerlin Godley told justices during oral arguments. “It decreases enrollment and thus funding,” said Godley, who is representing two parents of children who receive special education supports in West Virginia public schools. “It utilizes public funding for subsidizing more affluent families that have chosen private and home-schooling, and it silos the poor and special needs children who cannot use the vouchers.” Signed by Republican Gov. Jim Justice last year, the program was set to go into effect this school year but was blocked by Circuit Court Judge Joanna Tabit in July.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Republican-controlled Legislature took mere seconds Tuesday to reject Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ call to create a way for voters to get a chance to repeal the state’s 1849 abortion ban, even as Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson voiced support for letting the people decide the issue. The move by Evers is the latest by Democrats in the battleground state to turn the Nov. 8 election into a referendum on abortion. But Evers’ GOP opponent, Tim Michels, Johnson and other Republicans are focusing instead on crime and public safety in arguing that Democrats have failed to keep the state safe. “What people want to talk about (is) reducing crime, they want to talk about reducing inflation, they want to talk about getting more money in their pocket, and they want better schools in Wisconsin,” Michels said at a campaign stop in Baraboo when asked for his reaction to the Legislature’s action. A Marquette University Law School poll last month showed both the state’s governor and U.S. Senate races to be about even, while a majority of voters support abortion rights.

Lisa Blunt Rochester. Many notable leaders came to pay respect to Blunt including Sens. Chris Coons and Tom Carper, Delaware State University President Tony Allen, former Wilmington mayors Jim Sills and James Baker, and current Mayor Mike Purzycki.\n\nBishop Silvester Beaman, who had served as pastor of Bethel A.M.E. Church in Wilmington during Blunt's tenure on Wilmington City Council, officiated the proceedings at the Chase Center. Beaman, a friend of President Biden, delivered the benediction at Biden's presidential inauguration. President Biden himself attended a Sunday visitation service for Blunt, sent flowers and appeared in a recorded video message during the Monday service.\n\nBlunt was eulogized as an ambitious young man who grew up in the projects in Philadelphia to become a widely respected powerbroker in Wilmington. Beaman praised Blunt for his ability to unite those with opposing perspectives and rally support for shared objectives. He said Blunt was always in the room if it meant the uplift of people \"politically, socially, and economically.\"\n\nOne of his successors, Ernest \"Trippi\" Congo, the current president of Wilmington's City Council, said he sees Blunt's work and feels humbled by his predecessor's accomplishments, including post-secondary education scholarship funds for Wilmington high school seniors and grants that support community organizations.\n\n\"He taught everybody who he came into contact with so much about our politics and how it gets done and how to work together and what's best for the community,\" Congo said.\n\nA career devoted to education and justice\n\nBlunt devoted his career to education and justice, with a particular passion for guiding and educating young people. He began his profession as a juvenile gang worker in Philadelphia and later moved to Wilmington in 1969 to work as a program director at the Peoples Settlement Association.\n\nFor more than 30 years, Blunt worked as an administrator with a focus on elementary education, special education, ESL programs and parental engagement in the Wilmington, New Castle County, and the Red Clay Consolidated School Districts. He also taught evening classes at the University of Delaware and Delaware Technical and Community College.\n\nThroughout his career, Blunt held roles at organizations such as Head Start and the Wilmington Housing Authority. Additionally, he served as president of the Haynes Park Civic Association and the Wilmington Optimist Little League and established a youth basketball tournament.\n\nTheodore Blunt died Jan. 11 at 80 years old. He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Alice; their three daughters, Lisa, Thea and Marla; his brother, John, a former news anchor for the NBC station in Philadelphia; his sister, Catherine; six grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to the Ted Blunt Memorial Fund, which will provide scholarships in his honor. Contributions by check should be payable to the Delaware Community Foundation with \"Blunt Memorial\" in the memo line. The mailing address is PO Box 1636, Wilmington, DE 19899.

He went on to serve on Wilmington City Council starting in 1985, eventually rising to council president.\n\nOn Tuesday night, she continued her family legacy.\n\n\"I looked at the ballot and just saw the list of names, and I knew I had to take a minute to take this in because a lot of people fought for our right to vote,\" Blunt Rochester said Tuesday morning minutes after pulling the lever for herself at the Brandywine Hundred Fire Company in Wilmington.\n\n\"My sister recently found something from our great-great grandfather where he marked an X in Georgia to have the ability to vote himself. He took an oath to vote. It was incredible to see that because it put it in perspective for me, not that many generations later, an ancestor of mine was a former slave and now I am actually, hopefully, going to be our next Congressperson.\"\n\nSTORY: Rochester boosts campaign with personal loans\n\nSTORY: Running for Congress, Rochester draws on experience\n\nShe won her first elected seat Tuesday by surviving a long and crowded primary and besting a general election opponent who started his campaign when there still was an incumbent.\n\nShe acknowledged earlier this year that there's a learning curve to running for office.\n\nShe was the third Democrat to announce her candidacy, following State Rep. Bryan Townsend of Newark and State Rep. Bryon Short of Highland Woods. Her Republican opponent, Reigle, a U.S. Air Force veteran and aeronautical instructor at Delaware State University, had served in the town of Wyoming as a councilman and mayor.\n\n“We ran a great race. Everybody worked hard, but it’s that blue wall in New Castle County,\" Reigle said. \"It’s the canal. We’re a blue state and just couldn’t break through. During the campaign, I stayed on message, talking about jobs and education. Lisa had good name recognition from the primary and I think that helped her a bit. I think she’ll do well.\"\n\nTownsend and Short jumped in early when John Carney vacated the House seat to make his now-successful bid for governor. After Rochester joined, so did Sean Barney, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who made a serious play for dollars and votes, and Mike Miller, a downstate businessman and accountant who'd run for the seat before.\n\nThose candidates polled the highest and were included in the most high-profile debates, though Miller did not appear as often as he would have liked and the roster of attendees sometimes was scrambled. But they weren't even the only candidates in the race. Scott Walker's signs appeared all over Delaware with promises like \"ban guns\" and \"cut taxes\" and also on the ballot was Elias Weir, only about a year into his Delaware residency after an unsuccessful political career in New York.\n\n“As we look at our country right now and as we look at what happened in this past election, we need to come together more than ever,\" Rochester said. \"What I vow to you is I will go to Washington and fight for you.”\n\nEarly in the year she brought index cards to campaign events and handed them around, asking constituents to write down the issues that mattered most. She talked about doing a lot of listening, about common threads and finding commonalities with the people she hoped would vote for her.\n\n\"One of the things I can say about myself is I try to be a quick study,\" Rochester said. \"I think that's going to be really important as our congressperson. We have a great delegation already and a lot of people who will be there to support us. But at the beginning of this campaign I came into it at a time, my daughter says it was probably my lowest time, after losing my husband. I reached for a very high thing.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say I'm a veteran. I think I'm like many people who've never run for office before. But I felt motivated, and every day, the more stories I heard from people up and down the state whether it was a businessperson, whether it was a single mom, the more I knew this was the right time and this was the right thing to do.\"\n\nA mother of two grown children, Rochester pushed her campaign through a period of racial upheaval across the country. She backed tighter regulations on firearms and decried street violence. She spoke proudly of the 2001 Blunt-Bradley Report, a study of discrimination in the State Police she presented as state personnel director to then-Gov. Ruth Ann Minner.\n\n“Serving in two different governors’ cabinets, work in the private sector and the non-private sector, I think Lisa’s going to be a fantastic congresswoman, and I’m really excited to serve with her,” said U.S. Sen. Chris Coons Tuesday night.\n\nRochester couldn't have asked for a more appropriate foil on the federal level than Donald Trump, the Republican who campaigned against another history-making woman from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton. Trump and Rochester both oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but the similarities stop there.\n\nTrump was a popular candidate in southern Delaware and won the primary in part thanks to a surge in registered Republicans. But Rochester found significantly more people in the First State who were likewise frightened and offended by the billionaire's rhetoric throughout the campaign, decrying his comments about sexual assault and minorities.\n\nHer victory had a lot to do with her strength in Wilmington, which houses the state's most concentrated mass of black and Democratic voters. It's where she grew up, and between 2004 and 2007, she was the CEO of the civil rights-focused Wilmington Urban League.\n\nHer campaign got a funding lift from outside groups like Emily's List, which supports pro-choice Democratic women running for office. But she bolstered her own victory with a huge infusion into her campaign, a total of $403,900 in personal loans. Her husband, Charles Rochester, died in 2014 and left her a millionaire.\n\n“It was because of Charles I am able to stand here,” she said in her victory speech. “He strengthened me throughout this process and allowed me, through my loss, to hear stories of people throughout this state. People who lost their jobs. People who maybe lost their homes. People who lost a child to gun violence. That’s what inspired me. That’s what kept me going.”\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 324-2785 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com.\n\nAn earlier version of this article should have said Emily's List supports pro-choice candidates.\n\nU.S. House\n\n100% precincts reporting\n\nLisa Blunt Rochester (D): 233,542 55.52 %\n\nHans Reigle (R): 172,290 40.96 %", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/07/31/delaware-addiction-services-opioid-crisis-settlement-grants/70427872007/", "title": "Delaware addiction services get boost with $10M in settlement grants", "text": "The state reported that 136 organizations applied for the money, with their requests totaling over $74.3 million.\n\nThe selected organizations said they needed more than $21.2 million to fund their work.

However, these same assets disqualify the program from federal grant funding, forcing DSAMH to wait to apply for a different grant next month.\n\nUntil then, Champney said people with substance use disorder would need to go back to relying on more traditional assistance, whether through non-opioid-specific state-sponsored benefits like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or other DSAMH programs.\n\nOPIOID CRISIS:From patent to Percocet: How this powerful opioid got its start in Delaware\n\nBut qualifying for that help — and getting through potentially complicated screenings and paperwork — takes time and effort. And those are two resources that not everyone has, especially in the early stages of recovery.\n\n“When people are in need, that immediate need has to be met somehow,” said atTAcK Addiction board member Jill Fredel.\n\nFredel said atTAcK Addiction decided to use its own funds to create its own housing scholarships fund to fill in the gaps in assistance. People recovering from addiction can now receive about two months’ rent to cover their stays at recovery homes — a sort of “bridge” until larger state-funded scholarships are able to get more money and resume operations.\n\nHumes said it’s possible that other organizations are providing their own versions of scholarships, too, and said that he wished DSAMH had given more of a heads-up about the funds running out so that a community response could be better coordinated.\n\nOVERDOSES:Wilmington police didn't use a tool to combat overdose deaths. Now, they carry Narcan.\n\nChampney said that advanced notice of the pause in the scholarship program \"was unfortunately not possible due to the uncertain picture of when additional funding would be available.\"\n\nShe said DSAMH previously expected the funding would last through the end of this fiscal year, and the reality that \"the awareness and success of the program created more demands than the available funds\" only \"became apparent\" in April.\n\nState sends help from Behavioral Health Consortium\n\nA month after the scholarship program was put on pause, a state-sponsored solution will finally be on its way.\n\nThe state’s Behavioral Health Consortium, chaired by Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, has pledged $100,000 to fund an adapted version of the Opioid Impact Fee scholarships for the month of June.\n\nMENTAL HEALTH:He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Nearly a year later, he died by suicide in prison\n\nUnlike the previous iteration, these funds can be used only on housing — more specifically, emergency hotel placement of up to seven nights or the security deposit and one month’s rent at an Oxford House or “privately obtained” housing, according to DSAMH.\n\nAnyone over 18 who has been diagnosed with substance use disorder, overdosed in the last year or used intravenous drugs can apply starting May 30.\n\n“We don't want anyone not to have a roof over their head and the services that they need to get complete recovery,” Hall-Long said. “Having complete wraparound services for a person in recovery is critical.”\n\nHow to find help\n\nDelaware Hope Line: 833-9-HOPEDE for free 24/7 counseling, coaching and support, as well as links to mental health, addiction and crisis services.

Physicians, hospitals and health systems are taking extraordinary steps to keep these babies and their mothers healthy amid the opioid crisis.\n\nFor example, the Mothers in Recovery program at Memorial Healthcare System in Florida is helping pregnant women who are trying to overcome drug addiction. Since its inception in 2015, according to internal data, MIR has treated over 134 women and maintained a 92% success rate of babies born drug-free. These outcomes are attributed to an emphasis on immediate access to treatment and a multidisciplinary approach to care. The program provides integrated treatment — obstetrics, maternal fetal medicine, behavioral health, social services and peer support — with a focus on the health and well-being of mom and baby.\n\nEarly, immediate intervention works\n\nPhysicians at ChristianaCare in Wilmington, Delaware, meanwhile, recognized that early intervention in the emergency department and inpatient settings could help patients struggling with drug and alcohol misuse. Dr. Terry Horton saw an opportunity for early intervention through peer counseling, and with Project Engage, patients in recovery share their experience and help guide those entering treatment.\n\n“When someone raises their hand for help it is a fleeting moment and you have to be there to grab that hand,” Horton says.\n\nSince 2008, Project Engage has seen 10,000 patients; about 24% accepted treatment, whereas almost none did before.\n\nOther examples can be found in almost every state, city and community. In some areas, evidence-based services have been started after health care professionals witnessed the unmet treatment needs.\n\nDespite these efforts, patients still face many obstacles on their path to recovery. Some insurers have made it difficult to access care, and stigma often keeps patients from seeking treatment. Government funding alone is inadequate, but additional resources may become available from the opioid litigation cases working their way through courtrooms across the country.\n\nPending settlements in cases filed against opioid manufacturers, wholesalers, pharmacies and distributors offer another path forward — a path that should lead toward additional funding for research, education, prevention and treatment of overdose, opioid use disorder and pain.\n\nJudges and juries are being asked to hold companies responsible for their alleged misconduct. A tentative settlement was reached Monday in a large group of cases consolidated in Ohio. In this and other lawsuits, whether they settle or go to trial, we strongly urge courts and juries to ensure that all funds received from the defendants are directed to help treat patients.\n\nNot what you think:We thought we knew what drug addiction looked like. Then our nephew died in our house.\n\nIn 2017, almost 48,000 Americans died from drug overdoses involving opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 2 million Americans struggle with an opioid use disorder.\n\nProviders have been on the front lines, caring for those addicted to opioids and their families from the beginning. They have done so whether those patients and their families could pay for care — and many of them could not. We need to continue to expand our treatment efforts. Yet, the prevalence of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine threaten to overwhelm available resources.\n\nApply settlement money to treatment\n\nThe lessons from the national tobacco settlement are clear: Unless there is a dedicated commitment to promptly put judgment awards and settlement funds directly to providers — where they are assured of being used for prevention and treatment of opioid addiction — it won’t happen. The support of the courts is needed to make sure this history does not repeat itself.\n\nA personal tragedy:The opioid crisis hits home. Mine.\n\nThis was a system failure recognized far too late. Pharmaceutical manufacturers relentlessly promoted opioids to physicians as pain panaceas that were safe and systematically minimized the risk of addiction. Patient satisfaction surveys mandated by the federal government that influenced payment rates were also a factor, as they unintentionally encouraged this kind of pain medication on demand.\n\nEven insurance coverage, which is more available for prescription opioids than for alternative methods of treating pain, played a role. Illegal pill mills contributed significantly to the epidemic.\n\nPhysicians must absolutely be judicious in prescribing, and most were trying to do their best for their patients. These same physicians are still working to ensure patients have access to appropriate treatment and are not deterred by the ongoing stigma against those with opioid use disorder or pain.\n\nThe opioid epidemic has contributed to one of the first declines in life expectancy in decades. Taking the steps above will help offer relief to overwhelmed communities and get patients the support they need when they are receptive to it — in the “reachable moment,” as Horton puts it, that is crucial to recovery.\n\nDr. Patrice A.

The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}]}

The Delaware State Fair was featured on an episode of the Cooking Channel's \"Carnival Eats\" last year.\n\nWith fried tacos, fried burgers and shark on a stick, the 99th installment of the Delaware State Fair does not disappoint.\n\nThere's even a new concept introduced just three months ago in the United States that features cappuccino in a cone.\n\nThe News Journal sent photographer Jason Minto and me to the fair Saturday afternoon, and the rain and wind meant no waiting in line to eat all the fried and cheesy goodness.\n\nOur experience, of course, is best consumed through the video on this page, but here's more on some of the places we ate and what we tried.\n\nJim's Deep Fried Tacos\n\nJim's is a New York-based operation that takes a taco and drops it in a fryer. What could go wrong?\n\nWe tried the beef taco. The batter on the outside made for a perfect crunch leading into a meaty, cheesy treat.\n\nThe stand also has buffalo chicken tacos, pork and mac tacos and more.\n\nDELAWARE STATE FAIR:Health inspectors report on food violations\n\nChester's Gators and Tators\n\nThis state fair staple obviously specializes in gator, so we had some on top of mac and cheese and had a shark kebab on the side.\n\nI fancy myself an eater and hadn't had gator or shark before hitting the fair. The gator, on top of a generous portion of mac and cheese, kind of had the consistency and taste of chicken. You've probably had some form of chicken on your mac and cheese before. So just pretend you're doing it again.\n\nThe shark kebab is served on a stick and coated in a \"special sauce\" that gives the bland white fish a needed boost.\n\nAfraid of shark or gator and still want to push the limits? Try the Mac Attack. It's a plate of loaded bacon mac and cheese with ribbon fries, sour cream, jalapeños and chives.\n\nChompers\n\nThis stand, from owner Thomas Barletta, is making its Delaware State Fair debut this year with a simple idea: Take an American classic, make it into a ball and drop it in fryer oil.\n\nBarletta calls them crunchy balls of goodness.\n\nChompers serves two flavors. The bacon cheeseburger variety is a crunchy ball filled with bacon, ground beef and cheddar cheese served with a zesty ketchup dipping sauce. The chicken parm ball is filled with chicken, fresh basil and mozzarella and parmesan cheeses and served with marinara dipping sauce.\n\nDELAWARE STATE FAIR:How officials keep the rides, food safe\n\nDragon Breath\n\nNo, fire doesn't come out of your mouth, but sometimes playing with liquid nitrogen can be fun ... when you get past the warning sign on the cash register that indicates the risks of consuming liquid nitrogen are unknown.\n\nWhatever.\n\nDragon Breath uses liquid nitrogen to \"cook\" corn puffs and Oreos at cold temperatures. The result is cold sugar products – who hates that? – with a side of smoke.\n\nCoffee in a Cone\n\nThe slogan for the new company is \"The World's Most Instagrammable Coffee.\" I won't agree or disagree – latte art takes some skill – but the concept is cool.\n\nOne of the owners, Sean Bruckner, said he and a few partners brought it to the U.S. after learning about the popular treat in South Africa. The Delaware State Fair is the first of many stops this year for the company. Bruckner said he expects to sell about 10,000 to 12,000 cones this week.\n\nIce cream cones are coated in chocolate before being filled with cappuccino, coffee or hot chocolate. A solid bottom keeps the liquid in the cone, but the chocolate quickly melts, and the combination of whipped cream, caramel and chocolate makes for a warm, smooth, delicious sip through a straw that will keep you coming back for more.\n\nGood thing there are free refills.\n\nContact reporter Jeff Neiburg at (302) 983-6772, jneiburg@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @Jeff_Neiburg.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2017/02/15/rascal-flatts-darius-rucker-lead-delaware-state-fair-lineup/97938494/", "title": "Delaware State Fair: Rascal Flatts, Darius Rucker lead lineup", "text": "Ryan Cormier\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe 98th annual Delaware State Fair will be stacked with familiar faces this summer with three of its biggest acts making return trips to Harrington.\n\nCountry trio Rascal Flatts ($54-$89), former Hootie & the Blowfish frontman Darius Rucker ($44-$84) and tattooed country rocker Brantley Gilbert ($44-$84) will lead the charge at the Grandstand this year.\n\nAlso on this year's lineup: country singer and Big Barrel Country Music Festival alum Joe Pardi ($31-$66), comedian Gabriel Iglesias ($32-$42) and Christian rock/folktronica act Crowder ($25-$50).\n\nSTORY: Weed-themed game show lands in Wilmington\n\nSTORY: Chris Robinson, Dr. John lead Bromberg's Big Noise\n\nSTORY: Firefly '17: Weeknd, Muse, 21 Pilots, Dylan\n\nA batch of acts will perform on the same night – July 22 – as a \"Rock of the '70s\" revue, part of the Craft Brew Festival ($35-$45), which will feature 60 beers from Delaware and regional breweries.\n\nFoghat (\"Slow Ride\"), Atlanta Rhythm Section (\"So Into You\"), Pure Prairie League (\"Amie\"), the Pat Travers Band (\"Snortin' Whiskey\") and Rare Earth (\"I Just Want to Celebrate\") will each play three to five songs during the 2½ hour show, focusing on their hits, fair organizers say.\n\nAll three of this year's biggest acts have played the state fair stage before: Rascal Flatts in 2005, Rucker in 2009 and Gilbert in 2014. And both Rascal Flatts (Harrington Raceway and Casino) and Rucker (the Freeman Stage at Bayside near Selbyville) returned to play Delaware in 2013.\n\nGilbert is the hottest act on this year's bill with his new album, \"The Devil Don't Sleep,\" sitting at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, which also features Pardi's \"California Sunrise\" at the No. 10 spot.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: If you do not see a poll question below, please refresh this page.\n\nAfter Big Barrel and Delaware Junction Country Music Festival arrived in Delaware in 2015, the state fair had planned for a lighter-than-normal country lineup for 2016. But when both major festivals closed after one year, fair officials were left scrambling to pump more of fan-favorite country into the mix.\n\nThis year, they were prepared. Four of the seven entertainment acts are country.\n\n\"This year, we knew going in that we wanted to go back to our model of four nights of country since it's the genre of choice for folks coming out to the fair,\" says Danny Aguilar, Delaware State Fair assistant general manager.\n\nJust like last year when the fair hosted a musical act on the night before its official opening for the first time – country star Jake Owen drew about 5,000 fans while the rest of the fairgrounds were dark – the fair will host Pardi for a special fair kickoff show on Wednesday, July 19.\n\nThere will be no gate admission charge for Pardi because the fair’s carnival rides, livestock animals and circus performers will not be up and running.\n\n\"The stage and food vendors are in place, and since it worked out well, we're doing it again,\" Aguilar says. \"And the livestock exhibitors really liked it because they can actually attend a concert.\"\n\nThere was only one miscue. Because there was only a show running that night, some fans thought they could drive in and park right on the fairgrounds by the track instead of the normal Delaware State Fair parking areas.\n\n\"We'll be ready this year with security and such,\" Aguilar adds.\n\nRecently, the fair introduced a standing-room-only pit in front of the Grandstand stage, and last year it added a loft called the Roost with preferred seating, private bathrooms and VIP parking passes. Both will be back this year, although the Roost will have only one viewing platform instead of two.\n\nA more spacious track seating layout with extra legroom also will return after the Grandstand shrank from a 9,800-person capacity to 7,647 in 2016.\n\nOther than a few of the fair's major recent bookings – acts like Luke Bryan and Toby Keith, who can draw large-scale crowds – some seats had largely remained empty for other shows, leading to the change.\n\n\"It's getting harder and harder to find artists who can sell 10,000 seats at the fair and still fit within our budget,\" Aguilar says. \"We want to focus on keeping our tickets at a reasonable price and target more artists.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

And one chain in Delaware is about to double its footprint in the First State.\n\nPoke Bros., a fast-casual chain specializing in Hawaiian-style raw fish rice bowls, will soon open new stores in Fairfax and Middletown. The Ohio-based chain has locations in the Mill Creek Shopping Center and on Main Street in Newark.\n\nAccording to the company's website, the Fairfax location will be in the Fairfax Shopping Center on Concord Pike. In Middletown, Poke Bros. will set up shop in the shopping center anchored by Food Lion on Del. 301 near the intersection of Middletown Warwick Road and Main Street.\n\nThe opening date for these two locations is not yet known. According to its website, Poke Bros. has 14 locations and seven more on the way. At the end of this round of openings, the company will be in Ohio, Delaware, South Carolina – where it has nine of its 14 open stores – and North Carolina.\n\nPoké, pronounced POH-KAY, is taking the fast-casual restaurant industry by storm. Sometimes described as sushi in a bowl, poké originated in Hawaii. Most often a poké bowl features cubes of raw fish, sushi rice – though Poke Bros. has white and brown rice and also salad greens as a base – and fresh crunchy toppings like cucumbers, mango, seaweed and more.\n\nHealthy eating: Give Poke Bros. a try\n\nIn 2017, Bloomberg reported 300 Hawaiian restaurants opened in the U.S. between 2015 and 2017. The majority of those restaurants, Bloomberg said, featured poké because of the relatively low startup costs. To open a poké restaurant, all one needs is an electrical outlet to cook rice and to power refrigeration units for the rest of the menu.\n\nThe trend on the mainland first caught traction in New York and Los Angeles, where poké options these days are aplenty. Philadelphia is currently seeing an uptick in poké restaurants, with New York and Los Angeles chains moving to the city this summer.\n\nSoon, Delaware will have four Poke Bros. locations and a fifth option in Newark's PoBu.\n\nDELAWARE FOOD\n\nSeasons Pizza has popular crab cakes.

(There are some picnic tables out front.)\n\nSpecialty doughnut flavors include surfer dude, yabba dadda doo-nut, cookies 'n' cream, jingle shells, chocolate-covered pretzel, blue moon, pony party, cow trail, banana cream, thin mint, sand dune and big pearl.\n\nWe especially liked the \"Ms. Sandy,\" a honey-glazed doughnut topped with cinnamon sugar, and the \"Charlie Brown,\" a peanut butter-glazed doughnut with mini chocolate chips. One doughnut is $1.65, six is $8 and a dozen is $14.\n\nSandy Pony doesn't forget about our four-legged friends. They offer Doggy Donuts for $3 each. They're made by Sweet Paws Dog Bakery in Severna Park, Maryland.\n\nLooking for something offbeat? Try the $4 Bana-Nutella Roll. It's bananas and Nutella in an Asian spring roll wrapper that's tempura-fried and then rolled in cinnamon sugar.\n\nThe shop also sells acai bowls, $8.50; deluxe funnel cakes, $9, and 16-ounce bubble tea, $4.25, with such flavors as green tea, coconut, taro and mango.\n\nHours: 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. It's a seasonal operation from May to September, weather permitting.\n\n74 Geoffrey Drive, Stanton, 302-894-4030; firstwatch.com\n\nFirst Watch was one of the first in a wave of new breakfast-brunch-lunch eateries opening in New Castle County.\n\nThe Florida-based chain eatery is planted in a complex off Churchmans Road in Stanton that includes Naf Naf Grill and Chipotle.\n\nThe restaurant's name is a nautical term referring to the early shift for a ship's crew.\n\nRestaurants offer traditional morning foods like omelets, frittatas, French toast and lemon ricotta pancakes. Some dishes change with the seasons.\n\nRight now, you can get the summer crab omelet made with crab, house-roasted corn and red peppers, Jack cheese and scallions that's topped with hollandaise and Cholula sauces.\n\nIt comes with lemon-dressed organic mixed greens, whole grain artisan toast and all-natural preserves.\n\nCHEW ON THIS: Follow Guy Fieri's footsteps: The Delaware places he visited and dishes he ate\n\nFor a cool down, try the Summer Brush, a drink made with watermelon, pineapple, Fuji apple, lemon, cane sugar and mint.\n\nThe coffee is Project Sunrise coffee from Huila, Colombia.

We like the sound of the Avocado Toast Benedict, $13.99, which includes smashed avocado with grilled tomato on multigrain toast topped with two poached eggs, along with hollandaise and chimichurri sauce.\n\nOther brekkie items include omelets, bagel sandwiches and egg-based dishes including the Eggs San Marzano, $12.99, or two eggs poached in San Marzano tomato sauce with fresh cherry tomatoes, basil, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, topped with fresh baby arugula.\n\nIt's served with Lyonnaise-style potatoes and garlic crostini.\n\nThey also serve pancakes, salads, burgers, pasta and dinner entrees such as lasagna and lobster macaroni and cheese.\n\nMost breakfast options range from $10.99-18.99. Dinner prices are comparable.\n\nThe drip coffee, $2.99, is custom-roasted with Arabic beans. The espresso is from Italy.\n\nHours: 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., daily.\n\nChristiana Fashion Center, 3204 Fashion Center Boulevard, Newark, 302-738-4326; theturningpoint.biz/christiana\n\nThe New Jersey-based chain, founded in 1998, serves breakfast, brunch and lunch in dining rooms decorated with natural wood floors, bright traditional colors and real plants.\n\nTurning Point founders Pam and Kirk Ruoff said they don't open the restaurants in the evening because they want to go home to family. Their motto: “Work to live, don’t live to work.”\n\nA porky start to the meal is the bacon lollipops, $6.95, or thick, brown sugar-smoked bacon wrapped around a golden apple wedge. We also like the \"flight of pancakes,\" $10.25, which includes three different varieties of hotcakes.\n\nA different take on an omelet is the Key West shrimp, $10.79, which is three eggs mixed with sautéed shellfish, avocado, bacon, tomato, cilantro and Monterey jack cheese. It's served with an English muffin and either breakfast potatoes or tossed greens.\n\nA \"Popeye skillet,\" $9.89, is an egg dish with baby spinach, sliced mushrooms, potatoes, melted jack cheese, a big plop of sour cream and an English muffin.\n\nThe French press coffee, from Warrington, Pennsylvania-based Cowabunga Coffee Roasters, is ground per order and infused with purified water.\n\nPrices for coffee range from $5.75 to $8.99. Turning Point offers over six varieties, including flavored coffees.\n\nHours: 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily.\n\n405 N. King St., Wilmington, 302-654-0500; wildwich.com\n\nUPDATE: WiLDWiCH closed its King Street location in August.\n\nOwner Mike Stanley started his popular WiLDWiCH food truck in 2014, and two years later he added a brick-and-mortar cafe at 800 Delaware Ave. in downtown Wilmington.\n\nThis year, Stanley added a new cafe on Wilmington's King Street when he took over the former Cocina Lolo Mexican eatery.\n\nBreakfast sandwiches are a house specialty.\n\nLooking for a regional breakfast of champions? Try the Dumpster Fire sandwich, or scrapple, American Cheese and spicy \"dragon’s breath\" spread with an egg on a grilled English muffin.\n\nAnd if you wake up really hangry, there's the Double Trouble sandwich, a choice of two cheeses, two meats and two eggs on a grilled English muffin\n\nCoffee comes in two sizes: 12- and 16-ounces.\n\nHours: 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday.\n\n502 Rehoboth Ave, Rehoboth Beach, 302-567-2588; riseupcoffee.com\n\nRise Up Coffee, an independent small-batch coffee roaster and retailer for the past 14 years, has popped up next to the traffic circle as you drive into downtown Rehoboth. It takes over a former 7-Eleven location.\n\nThe business was founded in St. Michaels, Maryland, by owner Tim Cureton in a tricked-out coffee trailer.\n\nIt has a full breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as a full bar. There's also outdoor seating and, a rarity in downtown Rehoboth, a parking lot.\n\nBEST RESTAURANT CRAB CAKES: We took your suggestions and found our top 5\n\nYou order at the counter. House specialties include $9 made-to-order burritos such as the Sunrise which comes with organic eggs, potatoes, peppers, onion and cheese.\n\nBangers and smash, $9, is a fried organic egg with a sliced sausage link, peppers and onions on smashed potatoes.\n\nA breakfast board, $20, is a good sharing option. It's served on a wooden board, almost like a morning charcuterie spread. One order includes fresh seasonal fruit, habanero candied bacon, sliced avocado, hard-boiled eggs, turkey tamale pie, local cheese, crusty bread with local honey and brown sugar-cinnamon butter.\n\nRise Up serves only organic coffees that are generally considered a medium roast.

They also offer offbeat wing sauces such as peanut butter and jelly, poached pear and molasses barbecue, apple bourbon, root beer barbecue, garlic butter and ginger Thai.\n\nCo-owner Tom Craft is always working on new flavors, so keep an eye out for the featured wing sauce of the day.\n\nAll wings ($11) come with celery, carrots and blue cheese dressing.\n\nLooking to eat wings with a fork? Buffalo chicken tenders are a boneless version of the 2 Fat Guys' wings.\n\nThe restaurant also offers variations on wings that include herb-roasted \"carrot wings\" and Carolina \"pork wings,\" both of which can be tossed with any sauce.\n\nFour of the six locations are in Delaware: Hockessin, Brandywine Hundred, Middletown and Newark; https://twostonespub.com/\n\nWhen the flagship Two Stones Pub location opened in 2011 off Del. 4 in Newark's Chesmar Plaza, it was mainly known as a craft beer only destination.\n\nStill, owner Mike Stiglitz tapped into the growing market of serving excellent beer and food that pairs nicely with it.\n\nThe hog wings or meaty pork shanks that graced the very first menu have been nudged aside for more traditional chicken wings.\n\nTwo Stones' offers gluten-free jumbo wings (10 pieces for $12.95, 20 pieces for $23.95) and boneless wings ($9.95 for a half-pound, $17.95 for 1 pound).\n\nTRY THESE PLACES:Our Top 20 favorite dishes and drinks of 2019 (and maybe a few more)\n\nSauces include Asian, barbecue, Buffalo, \"sweet\" heat, and fiery ghost chile.\n\nWings come with blue cheese dressing, sriracha mayonnaise or ranch dressing, along with celery sticks.\n\nThe Chesmar Plaza location has closed, and the latest Two Stones Pub Newark site is now at 1203 Christiana Road.\n\n1801 W. 14th St, Wilmington, 302-658-4600; harryshospitalitygroup.com/\n\nKid Shelleen's, a solid American bistro, has always had a busy bar crowd.

The wings are served with celery sticks and ranch or blue cheese dressing.\n\nLook at the menu board near the kitchen.

They're roasted in an 800-degree coal-fired oven.\n\nWhile that could be a deal breaker for some, the wings are crispy and seem somewhat healthy than the fried version. Anyway, it's certainly a nice change of pace from the Buffalo-style wings served at many casual restaurants.\n\nAnthony’s Coal Fired Pizza is a Florida-based chain with additional locations in Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nIt was founded by Anthony Bruno and former Miami Dolphins quarterback and NFL Hall of Famer Dan Marino is a partner.\n\nAnthony's wings are marinated overnight with garlic and fresh herbs like rosemary and parsley, along with lemon juice and olive oil. A blanket of caramelized onions and a side of focaccia bread finishes the dish.\n\n“We are known for our pizza and the golden, bubbly, slightly-charred crust that our coal fire oven turns out,\" said Wayne Jones, CEO of Anthony’s Coal Fired Pizza.\n\n\"But the wings on our menu have always had a way of stealing the spotlight. The coal fire oven gives the chicken a smokiness that simply can’t be found anywhere else.”\n\nAnthony's now also offers wings flavored with its \"Dry Rub No. 2\" that is a little salty, a little spicy and a little sweet.\n\nThe wings are served with a house-made creamy gorgonzola dip.\n\nWorth a look\n\nSome places that didn't get as many votes, but we still think are worth a look when it comes to chicken wings, include the legendary Stanley's Tavern in Brandywine Hundred.\n\nOwner Steve Torpey, who has operated the family-friendly restaurant at 2038 Foulk Road for 37 years, has long served crispy wings ranging in flavors from mild to \"suicide.\"\n\nTOP PIES:This is the best pizza in Delaware, according to our readers\n\nAnother best bet is the new La Pizzeria Metro at 3101 Miller Road in the Miller Road Station.

This year the fair won’t offer Pit or VIP Loft tickets.\n\nThe track area will feature 222 pods seating 888 ticket holders. Each pod will seat up to four people, and the pods will be socially distant from other pods. Track seats can be purchased only as a group of four seats.\n\nTicket buyers looking for two, four or six seats will have choices in the stadium bleacher and Grandstand areas. In the bleacher and Grandstand areas, every other row has been taken out of service, and two empty chairs must be preserved between ticket-buying parties.\n\n“Fair leadership and management genuinely appreciate the advice we were able to receive from the Department of Public Health” General Manager Bill DiMondi said.\n\n“Unfortunately, the six largest shows on sale until this week have to be cancelled because they were not compatible with the COVID-19-mandated, lowered capacity of only 2,500 sellable seats for each concert, and 1,500 seats for our wheel events,\" he added.\n\nIs this a bad sign for Firefly?\n\nThe state fair's fight against COVID-19 restrictions has led some to wonder if that means the writing is on the wall for the Firefly Music Festival, which has been relatively quiet since March 29, when they announced plans to return to The Woodlands in Dover from Sept. 23 to 26.\n\nThe festival hasn't unveiled its lineup yet.\n\nWhen asked about possible COVID-19 restrictions at Firefly, Nick Trentacost – marketing director for the Great Lakes region at AEG Presents – told Delaware Online/The News Journal on March 29 that \"more information is forthcoming and will be publicly available on our website.\"\n\nState officials said the Division of Public Health has been in communication with AEG.\n\nJake Owen: Former state fair headliner coming to Freeman Arts this summer\n\n\"Event organizers are aware they will need a formal plan approval from the agency before the event takes place.

John Carney signed the eighth revision to the COVID-19 emergency order, increasing outdoor gatherings to 150 people. More will be allowed with state health department approval.\n\nDr. Jennifer Horney, an epidemiology expert at the University of Delaware, weighed in on what COVID-19 requirements might look like at Firefly.\n\n\"The public health saying is that nothing is 100%, but we gain a little bit through each thing. … They could require people to be vaccinated.

Neshaminy will launch its first collaborative flavor, Rita's Fruit Brews Mango, “a refreshing seasonal Blonde Ale brewed with mango at an easy-going 5% ABV,’’ on Saturday, April 15, according to press materials.\n\nTo try Rita’s Fruit Brews Mango, beer lovers can visit Neshaminy Creek locations in New Hope, Croydon and Dublin, Pennsylvania.\n\nThey also can score 12-ounce can six-packs much closer to home. While supplies last, Rita’s Fruit beers will be at beer distributors, liquor stores and supermarkets that carry Neshaminy products throughout Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey.\n\nThe new brew also will show up on taps at select bars and restaurants, but will not be sold at Rita’s Italian Ice stands or shops, Neshaminy folks said.\n\nPizza challenge:Last pizza places standing: Two Delaware pizzerias vie for first place. Vote for your favorite now\n\n“A tribute to the brand’s most popular flavor, Rita’s Fruit Brews Mango is brewed with 2-Row malt, white wheat, flaked oats, and hopped with Herkules and Chinook then conditioned on loads of sweet mangoes,’’ the company says in promoting the new line. “The result is an easy-drinking beer with a nostalgic aroma and big fruity flavor transporting you back to waiting under the signature candy-striped awning for an icy sweet treat.\n\nBeer feature bright fruity flavor\n\n“Highly sessionable with bright fruity flavor, the new Blonde Ale will appeal to craft beer drinkers looking for something fresh this spring and summer along with newcomers who may have a sentimental soft spot for Rita’s.’’\n\nNeshaminy and Rita’s are neighbors, with both brands based in Bucks County.\n\n“Rita’s first location opened in 1984, just minutes from Neshaminy Creek’s production brewery and taproom,’’ the press release says.\n\nNeshaminy Creek also plans to host launch parties at its Croydon and Dublin taprooms, offering live music, circus performers, food trucks, Rita’s Italian Ice and more on Saturday, April 15, beginning at noon.\n\nMore:Dogfish Head Brewery releases new canned 'Crush' cocktail offerings\n\n“As a lifetime Bucks County resident and Rita’s fan myself, I couldn’t be more excited or proud to launch this beer,” said Kyle Park, director of sales and marketing at Neshaminy Creek. “The idea originated during the height of the pandemic when taking my kids to Rita’s was one of the few escapes from the monotony of working from home. The brand continues to be such a big part of our summer memories, creating a line of beers inspired by them felt like a no-brainer. Just as fans look to Rita’s to mark a special occasion or treat themselves, I’m hoping they do the same with Rita’s Fruit Brews.”\n\n“We’re thrilled to see Neshaminy Creek bring Rita’s to life in a new, exciting way for our adult fans,” said Linda Chadwick, CEO of Rita’s Licensing, LLC. “Rita’s Fruit Brews Mango is delightfully refreshing, unexpectedly not too sweet, and is true to the beer quality you can come to expect from Neshaminy Creek. It is sure to be a staple for craft beer lovers and Rita’s adult fans alike, and we can’t wait to see what flavor mashup their brewing team comes up with next.”\n\nNeshaminy Creek Brewing Co.: Brewery, Taproom, Beer Garden, 909 Ray Ave., Croydon, Pennsylvania; Ferry Market Satellite Taproom, 32 S.

(More than 60 shows are expected to be on the schedule when the bookings stop.)\n\nThe anniversary concert, which sold out in less than a week, will feature a trio of longtime favorite cover acts headlined by Mr. Greengenes, which retired in 2013. Also on the bill: Love Seed Mama Jump, who are celebrating their 25th year this summer, and Jefe, former lead singer of Burnt Sienna.\n\nWith a new wave of cover bands dominating the Cork's stage in recent years, it will be a blast-from-the-past-type show for fans like Hockessin's Dane Ciarlo.\n\nWhen he heard about the anniversary show, he went online the moment the $40 tickets went on sale and bought 20, knowing that a ton of friends would want to go.\n\n\"I only have one left,\" says Ciarlo, 45, who estimates he's seen Mr. Greengenes about 50 times over the years.\n\nBut for country fans, it's the cherry-picking of would-be Big Barrel acts like Clare Dunn (Aug. 11), the Eli Young Band (July 6), A Thousand Horses (June 16) and The Lacs (June 15) that helps soften the blow of the state losing both Big Barrel and the Delaware Junction Country Music Festival since last summer.\n\nCork owner Highway One Group along with Live Nation co-produced Delaware Junction, which debuted in Harrington last summer and is also not coming back. Even so, Cole Swindell and The Cadillac Three, both of whom played Delaware Junction last year, will be at the Cork this summer. Swindell is July 8 and The Cadillac Three is June 22.\n\nPair those country acts with the fast-selling country singer Kane Brown's show June 26 and the already sold-out Old Dominion concert June 24 and country will undoubtedly be alive and well in Dewey this summer.\n\nWalls has successfully booked up-and-coming country acts for years, having had everyone from Miranda Lambert and Eric Church to Jason Aldean and Ryan Bingham.\n\nOld Dominion's show might fall into that category since the Nashville country rock five-piece is touring stadiums this summer with Kenny Chesney, Lambert and more. Old Dominion's Dewey show is squeezed between Chesney tour stops in Virginia Beach and Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field on June 25.\n\nTickets for all shows are on sale now at deweybeachlife.com, except for Swindell, whose on-sale is expected to be sometime next week.\n\nIn addition to country radio favorites, Walls has also lined up several acts that she has been trying to book for years, including a trio of singer/songwriters: Lucinda Williams (Aug. 31), Alejandro Escovedo (July 20) and Anders Osbourne (Aug. 16).\n\nOther first-time Cork acts this summer include rockers Buckcherry, whose \"Crazy Bitch\" dominated Dewey cover band setlists in 2006.\n\nAmong the returning favorites is 79-year-old blue dynamo Buddy Guy (July 25), who is making his third appearance, and funk/soul act Robert Randolph & the Family Band (July 27), who will get the crowd dancing for the eighth time in Dewey.\n\nThe Cork also regularly hosts a few tribute acts each summer and some familiar names are on the bill this year, including a pair of Grateful Dead-filled shows by Dark Star Orchestra (Aug. 8, 9), Badfish doing the songs of Sublime (June 29) and Who's Bad: The Ultimate Michael Jackson Experience (July 14).\n\nBut it's the wave of country music at the Cork that will give Big Barrel and Delaware Junction fans some solace.\n\nWalls knew the acts that were announced for this year's Big Barrel would be traveling through the area and jumped on the opportunity.\n\nLos Angeles-based Goldenvoice, which puts on Dover's Firefly Music Festival with Chicago's Red Frog Events and founded Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, told The Desert Sun in April that Big Barrel was not canceled because it didn't do well financially.\n\nIt simply didn't have \"magic.\"\n\n“If they don’t work, you should get rid of them,” Goldenvoice president Paul Tollett told the Palm Springs, California-based newspaper. “Almost every single festival we’ve had has lost money in the beginning – for two, three, five years. But, sometimes you start a festival and it just doesn’t have any magic. So it needs to go away.”\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

She is a very cool young woman with a style that is all her own, vintage yet modern.”\n\nHER STYLE: Eclectic and comfortable. “I get a lot of my clothes from thrift stores and second-hand stores. I like to mix feminine clothes with rugged things.”\n\nWEARING, at Gibraltar Gardens in Wilmington:\n\nFIRST OUTFIT — Peach silk vintage Dwalyne overshirt, passed down from her mom; BDG jeans from Marshall’s; thrifted white cotton tank top; Vans Sk8-Hi orange-ginger high tops; gold hoop necklace with a crystal in the center she received as a gift; and gold dangle earrings with bird detail at the top, purchased for $3 from New Life Thrift Shop.\n\nSECOND OUTFIT — Green vintage Inner Most brand slip, found for $3 at New Life; J.Crew black and white skirt purchased at American Veteran’s Thrift Store for $2; black low-heeled Bernardo brand shoes from New Life; choker-style necklace of rectangular pearls and golden bangle bracelet with equine details, both passed down through the family.\n\nTHIRD OUTFIT — Yellow, high-waist Levi Strauss & Co pants, found at Goodwill Newark for $3; Brandy Melville white cotton off-the-shoulder top; Nine West thrifted white flats with gold details; dark wash denim Tantrums jacket with sequin details and embroidery, purchased for $8 at New Life; gold-tone hoop earrings from Forever 21; and gold ring with black bands, passed down from her grandmother.\n\nWHERE SHE SHOPS: New Life Thrift in Lewes, God’s Way Thrift in Rehoboth Beach, and Goodwill in Newark.\n\nHOW SHE SHOPS: She is a social shopper. “I love to go thrifting with friends. When you find something exciting your friends get excited, too.”\n\nFASHION ICONS: Actress and singer Zendaya, model Bella Hadid and actress Emma Watson.\n\nMOST RECENT PURCHASE: High-waist yellow pants from Goodwill in Newark.\n\nOLDEST ITEM IN HER CLOSET: “I have a lace top that used to be my grandmother’s. It buttons up the back with little pearl buttons, which keep falling off.”\n\nMANE, MANICURE AND MAKEUP: “I rely on my mom to cut my hair. I put on a shirt with horizontal stripes and she cuts along the stripes.” She paints her own nails. “I try to be comfortable not wearing makeup but find I feel better when I make an effort. I wear concealer, eyebrow gel and mascara. I like products that are cruelty-free and produced responsibly.”\n\nBEST FOOT FORWARD: “My favorites are orange high-top Van’s.

That may be a generational thing.”\n\nORGANIZATION TIPS: “If I notice my closet getting messy, I go through and take things out. If something doesn’t spark joy I get rid of it.”\n\nFASHION NO-NO: “People who go for what is expected of them instead of finding their own style.”\n\nGO-TO OUTFIT ON SATURDAY NIGHT: “I have a pair of black leggings with a shine to them that are my go-to. They look cool but feel like sweatpants. A one-piece top, very simple, with a pair of very tough boots, big hoop earrings and pendant that reaches down to my belly button.”\n\nFASHION EVOLUTION: “When I was in junior high, I did what was expected. As I’ve evolved, I don’t care what other people think. My mom helped by encouraging me to buy eclectic things.”\n\nINDISPENSABLE WARDROBE ITEM: “A pair of jeans that are really comfy and make you feel great.”\n\nACE ACCESSORY: A thick gold band with black stripes, handed down from her grandmother. “It’s big, kind of rough, not very feminine but very interesting.”\n\nPANTS OR SKIRTS? Skirts.\n\nHEELS OR FLATS? Flats.\n\nDIAMONDS OR PEARLS? Pearls.\n\nWHY FASHION IS IMPORTANT: “For me, fashion symbolizes self acceptance, about being OK with what you have.

The remaining 13 states have not yet reported their respective numbers.\n\nOregon Department of Agriculture officials are working with state and national diagnostic laboratories \"to identify the causative pathogen,\" asking veterinarians to report cases to the department as soon as possible, AVMA reported, and advising pet owners to work with a vet if their dog is ill.\n\nBoarding your dog:As mystery respiratory illness spreads in holiday season, is it safe to board your dog?\n\nIn another affected state, the association reported, Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biological Sciences reported, “The possible virus, which is under intense observation by Colorado State University veterinarians, has been linked to cases of severe pneumonia and, tragically, resulted in some fatalities.”\n\nThe exact fatality number nationwide was not immediately known, AVMA spokesperson Mark Rosati told USA TODAY Monday.\n\nHere is where the disease has been reported as well as information about symptoms, treatment and tips for dog owners as the mysterious respiratory illness lingers:\n\nMystery dog respiratory illness:These are the symptoms humans should be on the lookout for.\n\nWhat states have the mysterious respiratory dog disease been confirmed in?\n\nAs of Monday the illness had been reported in the following states:\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nFlorida\n\nGeorgia\n\nIdaho\n\nIllinois\n\nIndiana\n\nMaryland\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nOregon\n\nRhode Island\n\nVermont\n\nWashington\n\nDogs gone:Thieves break into LA pet shop, steal a dozen French bulldogs, valued at $100,000\n\nSymptoms of mysterious dog disease:\n\nAccording to the AVMA, common symptoms of the respiratory illness in dogs include:\n\nChronic mild-moderate tracheobronchitis − a sudden or long-term inflammation of the trachea and bronchial airways, according to Merck Veterinary Manual − lasting 6-8 weeks that is barely or non responsive to antibiotics.\n\nChronic pneumonia not responsive to antibiotics.\n\nAcute pneumonia that quickly turns severe sometimes in as little as 24-36 hours.\n\nDifficulty or rapid breathing, wheezing, dehydration, fever, nasal or eye discharge, weight loss, loss of appetite and lethargy.\n\nMan celebrates lotto win with his dogs:He won $500,000 from a Virginia Lottery scratch-off\n\nHow is the illness spread?\n\nAlthough the exact transmission of the disease remains unknown, University of New Hampshire’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory senior veterinary pathologist David Needle said he believes the illness, which causes chronic respiratory problems, is likely spread through close contact and breathing in the same air as an infected animal.\n\nNeedle, who told USA TODAY he has been studying the illness for more than a year at the school's Hubbard Center for Genome Research, said the disease is not always fatal and so far, the dogs who contracted it and died had underlying issues.\n\nNeedle said he and a team from the university have been studying samples from Oregon, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island and are slated to begin receiving samples from Colorado and Illinois this week.\n\nTreatments of mysterious dog illness\n\nAccording to the University of Illinois School of Veterinary Medicine, outbreaks of canine infectious respiratory disease complex − also called kennel cough − often occur in shelters, boarding or training facilities over animals living in homes.\n\nUnlike more common infections associated with kennel cough, that university reported, new cases do not respond to \"standard medical therapy and can have a prolonged illness that can progress to pneumonia.\"\n\nCurrently the treatment that dogs receive is symptomatic and supportive, Dr. Marta Vidal-Abarca, with Petkeen.com told USA TODAY.\n\n\"This means that, since the agent causing the infection has not been identified, the treatment is not aimed at killing any pathogen in particular,\" Vidal-Abarca said Monday. \"Instead, the treatment is aimed at mitigating clinical signs and facilitating the dog’s recovery.\"\n\nTreatment, Vidal-Abarca said, includes:\n\nOxygen therapy.\n\nUse of a nebulizer (a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the dog's lungs).\n\nAntibiotics (to treat secondary infection).\n\nMeasures to ensure the dog has \"adequate nutrition\" and hydration (including the use of intravenous fluids).\n\nTips for dog owners to avoid the mystery respiratory illness\n\nAlthough researchers are not yet sure what causes the illness, below are tips from the AVMA and Vidal-Abarca as well as other vets, to help avoid your dog from becoming infected with it.\n\nMake sure your dog has been fully vaccinated - especially for kennel cough. While the existing vaccines may not specifically target the unknown infection, maintaining overall health through routine vaccinations helps support a dog’s immune system.\n\nAvoid dog parks, pet stores and grooming facilities with your canine companion, if possible.\n\nBe mindful of boarding. It is recommended to avoid boarding your dog \"unless absolutely necessary. Caution is advised rather than worry. There is a lot of interstate mobility among people and their pets and this may facilitate the transmission of the disease, as it appears to be highly contagious.\"\n\nIf your dog shows any signs of respiratory issues, including the symptoms listed above, contact your vet and keep your pet isolated from other animals until the matter is resolved.\n\nUntil the cause is determined, Michael Stepien, a spokesperson with the United States Department of Agriculture, said the federal agency will \"continue supporting states with testing when needed,\" but noted the agency's support role is limited to testing and collaborating with partners.\n\nContributing: Saman Shafiq\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

An anonymous artist has given 70 of the much-needed N95 masks – as well as items like gloves, goggles and full-coverage body suits – to the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, according to Cynthia Milledge, the museum’s director of marketing and public relations. The masks and other items, which the artist normally wears while making pieces, are crucial items for health care workers during the coronavirus pandemic. They are being donated to Wesley Gardens assisted living facility for use by the nursing staff and residents. Part of the donation has already been presented to meet the facility’s immediate needs. The remaining masks and gloves will be presented April 17 with public artwork and words of encouragement through the museum’s HeART for our Heroes program. “Because the artist wanted to remain anonymous, we didn’t want it to be a thing that was coming straight from the museum,” Milledge said. “We wanted to get the community involved. So that’s when we asked for the artwork.”\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: Hundreds of dogs living in largely Alaska Native villages won’t go hungry this spring after more than 8,000 pounds of dog food were delivered, a humanitarian effort coordinated by two of the nation’s largest animal welfare groups in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The goods arrived in Bethel, a southwest Alaska hub community, late Thursday on a cargo plane from Seattle. The Bethel Friends of Canines will store the food for eventual distribution to those in need, including dog owners from about 35 communities dotting southwest Alaska’s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. The dog food drop from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society of the United States was necessary in roadless western Alaska because travel restrictions and dwindling supplies are making delivery of dog food to the region difficult during the pandemic.\n\nArizona\n\nGlendale: With little hope of getting the 5,000 ventilators it requested from the dwindling national stockpile, the state has revised its request down to fewer than the 500 it expects to need soon to treat coronavirus patients, the state’s health director said. Most of the ventilators would be used to equip a Phoenix hospital that shut down last year but is being reopened as an acute care facility, Health Services Department Director Dr. Cara Christ said. About 50 would be sent to the Navajo Nation, where a severe coronavirus outbreak is ongoing. The health department reported Monday that the state now has 2,465 known coronavirus cases with 65 known deaths. Christ expects cases to peak late this month and hospitals to see their maximum patient load in May. The federal government only has about 10,000 ventilators in reserve, and New York state alone had requested 30,000 and got only 4,000, Christ noted.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A third state lawmaker said Monday that he has tested positive for the coronavirus, days before the Legislature is set to meet for this year’s session. Rep. Les Warren said in a statement that he was told by his physician Sunday that he had tested positive and was self-isolating at home. Warren said his symptoms were minimal. Warren is the third lawmaker to test positive since the Legislature met for a marathon special session to approve a $173 million coronavius fund. Lawmakers are set to convene Wednesday for this year’s fiscal session. The Arkansas House plans to meet in the same 5,600-seat basketball arena it used for the special session. The Senate will meet in the Capitol, but with restrictions on the number of members in its chamber. Warren said he will vote by proxy in this year’s session. Health officials said the number of coronavirus cases in Arkansas on Monday has risen to at least 854. Arkansas has had 16 deaths.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBeverly Hills: Los Angeles County transportation officials are taking advantage of light traffic during the coronavirus pandemic to expedite subway construction by shutting down a section of a major thoroughfare. The closure of a couple of blocks of Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills will allow contractors to advance work on the Wilshire/Rodeo station for an extension of the Purple Line subway, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. Completing the work sooner is expected in turn to minimize future construction impacts to local businesses during the economic recovery period that follows the pandemic, Metro said. The Purple Line extension will add 9 miles to the existing route. When complete, commuters will be able to travel all the way from downtown to the Westwood area near UCLA. The line currently terminates in the Wilshire Center area of Koreatown.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Some law enforcement agencies in the state have reported an increase in police impersonators pulling over drivers since the governor ordered residents to stay at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Police in Aurora, Greeley and Erie have been in contact about similar police impersonator cases, KDVR-TV reports. “It’s very frightening because we don’t really know what their intentions are,” Crystal McCoy of the Aurora Police Department said. Several residents in Greeley reported being waved through a fake roadblock and questioned for “violating the COVID-19 law” by men wearing reflective vests who told drivers they could face citations, police said. The Greeley Police Department said none of its officers, Weld County Sheriff’s deputies or Colorado State troopers conducted the March 27 traffic stops. On the same day, a woman in Erie reported being pulled over by a black vehicle with flashing emergency lights and asked where she was going and told her to return home due to the stay-at-home order. The man followed the driver to her residence before leaving the area.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The peak of the coronavirus outbreak is still a few weeks away for Fairfield County, more than a month away for New Haven County and may not hit the eastern part of the state until June, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday. “The next few weeks are going to be tough,” the Democratic governor told Connecticut Public Radio. “The state is as well prepared as we can be with the things that we control.” He also expressed frustration with not being able to get ventilators, personal protective equipment and other medical supplies from the federal government. Lamont said he talked Sunday with Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and repeated his plea that Connecticut be considered part of a hot spot region that includes New York for the purpose of federal government allocation of medical supplies and equipment.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state on Sunday become one of the latest declared a major disaster area by President Donald Trump amid the new coronavirus outbreak, giving the state access to more federal assistance to confront the outbreak. The declaration came as Delaware health officials reported more than 670 positive COVID-19 cases in the state, an increase of 80 cases compared to Saturday. The number of deaths remained at 14, with about 100 hospitalizations. A second correctional officer at the largest state prison has tested positive for COVID-19, according to the Department of Correction. The latest officer at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center with the virus was assigned to the maximum-security housing area. The officer started feeling bad last Tuesday, received a test and remained at home. Officers who worked with the officer over the past 14 days are being told self-isolate and check for symptoms, the department said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: There are 99 new positive coronavirus cases in D.C., bringing the overall positive case total to 1,097, WUSA-TV reports. Two more COVID-19-related deaths were also reported Monday – a 67-year-old woman and a 69-year-old woman. So far, 24 residents of the district have died. D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson, Mayor Muriel Bowser have announced funding efforts and programs to help residents during the pandemic. The district needs to cut more than $600 million from the fiscal-year budget covering this year and next, Bowser said. Spending for the D.C. government will mirror 2017 spending levels, she said. D.C. Council members plan to discuss funding virtually at their next scheduled meeting in an effort to put the city in the best position financially to deal with the impacts of the pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that the state’s heavily criticized unemployment system should now be able to handle the crush of applicants it is receiving as workers lose their jobs because of the coronavirus outbreak. He said the computer system’s capacity has been increased to handle 120,000 simultaneous connections, about double the peak usage in recent weeks, and by Tuesday 750 additional state employees will be trained to handle and process phone calls. Private call centers are also being contracted to provide additional service. Last week, 3.8 million calls were made to the department, 50% more than all of last year. More than 520,000 Floridians have applied for unemployment since March 15, compared to 326,000 in all of last year. But despite assurances from the governor that help was on its way, some said they still weren’t getting it.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Drive-thru testing for COVID-19 began Monday at Georgia Institute of Technology, Gov. Brian Kemp announced. Kemp said the state was partnering with CVS Health to set up rapid testing that can accommodate multiple lanes of cars at one time at a parking deck on Georgia Tech’s campus in midtown Atlanta. The process is expected to take about 30 minutes from the time of the test to delivery of results, Kemp said in a statement Monday. “Increased access to rapid testing remains one of our top priorities in order to identify more cases, get Georgians the care they need, and prevent further infection in our communities,” Kemp said. At full capacity, the site will be able to conduct up to 1,000 tests per day. “It will help us get a better sense of how widespread the virus is in the community,” said Dr. Marybeth Sexton, an infectious disease expert at the Emory University School of Medicine. Patients must preregister for a same-day appointment online.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s insurance commissioner has encouraged businesses to keep providing health insurance for employees as many companies close or limit operations in response to the COVID-19 virus. State Insurance Commissioner Colin Hayashida urged insurers to offer continuing coverage during the pandemic, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The commissioner encouraged providers to ensure policies do not lapse and to refrain from canceling or failing to renew policies because of nonpayment while the state is dealing with the virus outbreak. Under the Prepaid Health Care Act of 1974, Hawaii employers are required to provide health care coverage for eligible employees who work 20 hours or more after four consecutive weeks of employment. Furloughed employees generally receive health insurance benefits, but workers who are laid off do not.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little’s stay-at-home order to limit the spread of the coronavirus is legal and clearly defined by law, Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden said. Wasden said the Republican governor’s power to assert such an order is found within Idaho code. Little issued the 21-day order March 25. Some lawmakers and a northern Idaho sheriff had questioned Little’s authority to do that, contending it violated the U.S. Constitution. “The law in this area is clearly defined,” Wasden, also a Republican, told the Idaho Statesman. “I have no problems with providing a legal defense of the governor’s order and stand ready to do so should the need arise.” Idaho has 1,078 confirmed cases and 10 deaths because of the virus, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally Sunday morning.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state needs thousands more ventilators than the federal government plans to send and is desperately searching for more before Illinois’ expected peak in coronavirus cases later this month, the governor said Sunday, hours before officials announced the number of people to test positive in the state more than doubled in a week. Appearing on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday morning, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he requested 4,000 ventilators from the federal government last Tuesday and has received 450, far short of even the 1,400 ventilators that Vice President Mike Pence said the state needs. Pritzker, who has been critical of the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic, disputed the president’s claim that many states were unprepared. “If they had started in February building ventilators, getting ready for this pandemic, we would not have the problems that we have today, and frankly, very many fewer people would die,” Pritzker said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Riley Children’s Foundation is seeking donations toward a new fund that will provide emergency assistance to families of hospitalized children facing additional financial struggles during the coronavirus pandemic. The Riley Relief Fund will also provide support for the Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis during the ongoing public heath emergency, foundation officials said. Foundation President Elizabeth Elkas said the virus outbreak is pushing many families further into crisis while they are caring for children with complex medical needs. The first $100,000 donated is being matched by a donation from car dealership owner Bob Butler and his family, the foundation said. Donations can be made at the foundation’s website. The new relief fund is meant to provide families with emergency assistance for housing, utilities, transportation, medications, food and other necessities.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s coronavirus death toll jumped by 57% over 24 hours, an increase from 14 to 22. Sunday was the single-deadliest day so far for the state where Gov. Kim Reynolds has pushed back against national calls that she issue a statewide stay-in-place order. Iowa is one of just a handful of states where governors have so far not issued a statewide or partial stay-at-home order, according to tracking by The New York Times. Reynolds’ administration is using a 12-point scale that weighs age, hospitalization, population and long-term care outbreaks to determine if and when a shelter-at-home order is necessary, according to documents made public last week. A stay-at-home order would require Iowa reach at least 10 points in any one of six regions in the state. A map released Thursday showed the highest score was a seven.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Operational changes have been implemented at Lansing Correctional Center – the largest prison in the state – after an inmate and a fourth staff member tested positive for the coronavirus, state prison officials said. As of Sunday, the state had confirmed 747 infections and 22 deaths, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment said. The number is 49 cases higher than the 698 on Saturday, with one more death. At least 183 people have been hospitalized in Kansas with the virus. Lansing also is dealing with absenteeism, as 40 of its 310 front-line uniformed officers are out for reasons related to the virus, an agency spokesman told The Wichita Eagle. Corrections Secretary Jeff Zmuda said that includes ill employees, those who have preexisting conditions that put them at risk, those caring for children home from school or others who are monitoring at-risk family members.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A new city order cracks down on pop-up COVID-19 testing sites after a handful of operations across the city were accused of being scams. The order, signed Monday by Louisville’s health director and county attorney, requires operators not affiliated with health facilities or already approved by the city’s public health agency to get written approval before starting. All approved sites, it said, will be subject to inspection by local health officials and must comply with all guidelines from the health department and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sites that do not comply will be immediately shut down, the order says. And any individual who fails to comply with an order issued by the court will face additional criminal charges. At least two mobile coronavirus testing sites opened in Louisville last week, claiming to be medical marketing companies with relationships to labs that do testing and charging up to $250 per test.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State health officials reported 68 coronavirus-related deaths Sunday, marking the state’s biggest jump in reported deaths since the outbreak began. The number of infections reported to the Louisiana Department of Health also increased by more than 500 cases from 12,496 to 13,010. Before Sunday, the largest number of deaths reported in a single day was 60. The numbers represent when the tests were reported to the state, not necessarily when the infections or deaths occurred. Dr. Alexander Billioux, assistant secretary of Louisiana’s Office of Public Health, said in a statement that it was a “large increase” but that it’s important to note that not all the deaths occurred over the prior 24 hours. He said authorities are analyzing the cases to determine when the deaths occurred and will release the information in coming days.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Public health officials said Monday that there are still no cases of the new coronavirus in Piscataquis County, one of the least densely populated countries in the eastern United States. The virus has appeared in 15 of the state’s 16 counties, and two counties in southern Maine are in the midst of community transmission of the virus, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention director Nirav Shah said. But Piscataquis, which has a population of about 17,000 and only about four residents per square mile, remains free of cases. Shah said residents shouldn’t develop a false sense of security due to Maine’s relative low number of cases compared to other states. “I hope that there is not anyone out there who is taking a look at our relatively low numbers compared to Boston, New York and others and saying, ‘This is not a risk in Maine,’ ” Shah said. Piscataquis is in the interior of Maine and is home to Baxter State Park, one of the most beloved natural areas in New England.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan on Sunday announced new mandates for the state’s nursing homes in order to dull the spread of COVID-19, which has invaded dozens of facilities in Maryland. Under the threat of criminal penalties, Hogan’s order and directive from his health secretary demand that nursing home employees in close contact with residents wear face masks, gloves, gowns and other personal protective gear when providing care. Nursing homes must have expedited testing for the new coronavirus and designated areas where residents with known or suspected COVID-19 are treated, according to the new rules. Violating the rules is a misdemeanor punishable by fines and prison. Hogan said more than 80 nursing homes and long-term care facilities have positive cases or clusters of cases. The most intense cluster is at the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Mount Airy.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Federal officials are providing aid to veterans at nursing homes in the state that have been hard-hit in the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie said Sunday at a White House briefing that the federal Department of Veterans Affairs will provide the assistance at two nursing homes. He didn’t name the facilities, and spokespersons for the agency at the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services didn’t respond to emails seeking comment Monday. More than 20 residents have died at the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home in recent days in one of the deadliest outbreaks of the virus in a veterans’ home in the nation. At least three residents have also died at the Chelsea Soldier’s Home, and residents are being transferred from that facility. The two facilities are state-run and licensed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A field hospital at Detroit’s downtown convention center could gets its first COVID-19 patients this week, officials said Monday. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Detroit-area hospitals are running “dangerously low” on personal protection equipment. She also reported an “incredible surge” in the number of unemployment claims and promised that people would get paid, despite computer woes and bureaucratic red tape. “We will get to you,” Whitmer said. The governor gave an update on the coronavirus after the number of cases rose to 15,718 and 617 deaths over the weekend. Whitmer said she plans to extend a stay-at-home order, which limits people to essential trips outside their homes and shuts down most businesses. “We are not out of the woods yet,” said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s medical executive. “Our hospitals continue to be overwhelmed, especially in southeast Michigan.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Legislature will reconvene Tuesday to pass a bill that would ensure first responders and health care workers who are infected with the coronavirus qualify for workers’ compensation without having to prove they were sickened on the job. Minnesota’s count of confirmed cases rose to 986 on Monday, up 51 from Sunday. The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, rose by one to 30. Of the positive cases, 470 no longer need to be isolated. As of Monday, 115 patients were hospitalized, up 11 from Sunday, with 57 in intensive care, up nine from a day earlier. Legislative leaders announced the agreement on workers’ compensation late Sunday night. The new rules will protect a wide range of emergency and health care workers, including police officers, firefighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, correctional officers, nurses, home health care workers, and people who provide child care for the offspring of first responders and health care workers.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state has been declared a major disaster area by President Donald Trump amid the new coronavirus outbreak, giving the state access to more federal assistance to confront the pandemic. Gov. Tate Reeves announced Friday that he had asked Trump to issue the declaration. Trump has issued a series of major disaster declarations around the country. Each declaration makes federal funds available to state, local and tribal governments and some private nonprofits for emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance. The Mississippi Health Department said Monday that as of Sunday evening, the state had 1,738 positive tests for the virus and 51 deaths. The state has about 3 million residents.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Nearly 500 people are hospitalized in the St. Louis region with the coronavirus, including 139 requiring ventilators, and the leader of a new pandemic task force is warning that the peak of illnesses isn’t expected until later this month. Dr. Alex Garza, head of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force, said Sunday that 468 patients are hospitalized in the St. Louis area, including 164 in intensive care units, the vast majority of whom are on ventilators. The patients either have tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, or are showing symptoms and awaiting test results. Garza said the number of hospitalized patients is expected to peak in two to three weeks. “We have every reason to believe that the surge is still coming,” Garza said. “So it is extremely important that we all follow the strategy, which is to stop the spread” through social isolation, frequent hand-washing and other measures.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s health department is concerned with a sharp decline in the number of calls to the child abuse and neglect hotline since schools were closed to decrease the spread of the coronavirus, the agency said Monday. From March 8 to 14, 765 calls were made to the hotline at 1-866-820-KIDS (5437). Gov. Steve Bullock announced school closures starting March 17. Since then, the number of calls dropped to an average of 425 per week, a 45% decrease. “This decrease in calls is very concerning because teachers and school staff are mandatory reporters of child abuse and neglect, and we know they are one of the main sources of calls to the hotline,” said Sheila Hogan, director of the Department of Public Health and Human Services. “With schools closed, it’s important for all us to take an active role by calling the hotline if you suspect abuse or neglect.”\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: All staff and residents of the Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Center in Kearney are being tested for the new coronavirus after two center employees tested positive for COVID-19. Two Rivers Health Department in Holdrege and the Nebraska National Guard set up the on-site testing for all 162 residents and staff, state health officials said in a news release. Test results are expected midweek, officials said. Officials reported last week that a center staff member had tested positive for the coronavirus. That employee did not return to work after becoming symptomatic. Later, a second employee was found to also have the virus. A pandemic plan has been activated to check residents and staff for symptoms and to set up quarantine areas, if needed, said Dannette Smith, CEO of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. “As outlined in our pandemic plan, staff did everything right,” Smith said.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The state is reporting 94 new coronavirus cases, pushing the statewide total to 1,836, but the state Health and Human Services Department’s website shows the death toll remaining at 46. Most of the cases and deaths have been in Clark County, which is Nevada’s most populous and includes metro Las Vegas. Elko County has become the third county in the state to report a coronavirus death – a woman in her 50s with underlying medical conditions who wasn’t hospitalized. Washoe County has had four deaths and reported 16 new cases Saturday, pushing its total to 245. Gov. Steve Sisolak announced Saturday that the federal government has approved Nevada’s request to declare a major disaster declaration for the state. He said that move will unlock additional federal assistance for residents affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: An employee who works at the state prison for men in Concord has tested positive for the coronavirus and is now quarantined at home, the Department of Corrections said Monday. The department learned late Friday that the employee had tested positive, spokeswoman Laura Montenegro said in a news release. The employee last worked at the prison March 25 and did not return until Wednesday but was denied entry based on the COVID-19 screening process and was directed to follow up with a health care provider, Montenegro said. That follow-up resulted in the positive test confirmation, she said. The screening for staff includes a temperature and visual check, Montenegro said. The prison suspended visitation and volunteer services March 16 and is promoting social distancing by reducing movement and transfer with other correctional institutions.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus has surpassed 1,000 people, even as evidence begins to show the state is beginning to flatten the curve of the virus, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. In the past 24 hours, New Jersey fatalities from COVID-19 climbed from 917 to 1,003, Murphy said. He also said the data is beginning to show that the social distancing he mandated last month is starting to pay off. He said there may still be anomalous days, but overall the curve “is beginning, and I use that word cautiously, is beginning to flatten.” New Jersey and New York are among the hardest-hit states in the country. New Jersey is likely weeks away from hitting the peak of the outbreak, according to health officials. The state has more than 41,000 cases of COVID-19. Among the fatalities was Jersey City Councilman Michael Yun, according to Murphy and Mayor Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: While federal environmental regulators have waived enforcement on a range of legally mandated public health and environmental protections, the state is marching ahead. Food inspections are ongoing, as is the tracking of methane emissions and other critical work related to drinking water protections and worker safety, as the number of new coronavirus cases in the state grows. On Sunday, President Donald Trump signed off on a federal disaster declaration for New Mexico, freeing up funding to supplement state, tribal and local recovery efforts. Officials say about 25% of the New Mexico Environment Department’s staff is focusing on COVID-19-related critical services. The rest are working on permitting actions and compliance activities to the extent possible during the public health emergency, from developing new water quality improvement projects to analyzing air quality data and answering questions about the state’s hemp program.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended stay-at-home restrictions through the month and increased fines on violators to up to $1,000, citing fresh evidence Monday that the outbreak-fighting rules could be helping the state avoid a worst-case catastrophe. New York state has tallied 4,758 deaths from COVID-19, with 599 reported in the past 24 hours. It remains the most affected state, with more than 130,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and close to 17,000 people hospitalized. But the number of new people entering hospitals daily has dropped, as has the number of critically ill patients requiring ventilators. Recent data suggests the state could be at or near the peak of the outbreak, state officials said. Warning it was no time the relent, Cuomo said schools and nonessential businesses will remain closed until April 29. He said the maximum fine for violations of state social distancing protocol will soon be $1,000, up from $500. “This virus has kicked our rear end. And we underestimate this virus at our own peril. We’ve learned that lesson,” Cuomo told a news briefing at the Capitol. “Now is not the time to slack off on what we’re doing.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Mission Health has announced a new payment policy and other services designed to protect employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, spokeswoman Nancy Lindell said in a release. In recent weeks, the health system – which has its largest facility, Mission Hospital, in Asheville – has seen a decrease in surgery and outpatient volume because of the coronavirus pandemic. This has led to a reduction of hours for many employees. In response, Mission’s owner, HCA Healthcare is implementing a “pandemic pay continuation” policy for all HCA employees. Lindell said the measure is designed to “help protect the financial security for front-line caregivers at all facilities.” According to Lindell, HCA will attempt to redeploy employees with reduced hours who work in clinical facilities or support areas. Those who cannot be redeployed will receive 70% of base pay for up to seven weeks. Workers in patient care facilities who are quarantined due to COVID-19 exposure will receive their entire base salary.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The number of positive COVID-19 cases in the state increased by 18 in the past day, including 11 people from Cass County, state health officials said Monday. The state has confirmed 225 cases of the coronavirus, which has caused 32 people to be hospitalized. About 75 people have recovered after testing positive. Three people have died from the virus. The testing count went over 7,000 on Sunday after 426 people were screened. While officials have encouraged residents to enjoy the outdoors as long as they’re taking social distancing measures, the virus has affected one of the state’s favorite activities. The North Dakota Game and Fish Department on Monday postponed all fishing tournaments for April and May and could extend the order through October depending on COVID-19 conditions. The department announced Friday that it was canceling the paddlefish snagging harvest season.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Four prisons are under full quarantines following two positive tests for inmates last week, and the state health department said it plans to start random coronavirus testing to better determine how widespread the virus is in Ohio. Prisons in Columbus, Marion, Pickaway County and Toledo are under full quarantines following positive tests for one inmate at the Marion prison and one at the Pickaway prison last week, as well as the transfer of a Marion inmate to Franklin Medical Center in Columbus. One inmate in Toledo is in isolation pending testing results. More than 4,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus, and 119 people have died, with more than 1,100 hospitalizations as of Sunday, according to the state health department.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of coronavirus cases in the state surpassed 1,200 Sunday, and four more people died of COVID-19, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported. There are at least 1,252 cases and 46 COVID-19 deaths, the department said, up from 1,159 cases and 42 deaths reported Friday. Of the 46 deaths, 35 were people ages 65 or over, and the four latest deaths, three men and a woman, were each in that age group. Nine deaths were people ages 50-64, and two were in the 36-49 age group. At least one case is reported in 57 of the state’s counties 77 counties, and President Donald Trump on Sunday declared a major disaster in the state, making federal funding available for recovery efforts. The funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments and private nonprofit organizations for emergency protective measures for areas in the state affected by COVID-19, according to the White House.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: As hospitals struggle to get new supplies of personal protective equipment such as face masks, gowns and gloves due to the shortage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, officials think thousands of inmates could be one solution. Oregon Corrections Enterprises, a semi-independent state agency, is producing 30,000 non-medical face masks for use by the Department of Corrections and is seeking to make medical-grade masks for hospitals that could help fill the shortfall. “In an emergency you can’t get the help quick enough,” OCE Administrator Ken Jeske said. A 1994 ballot measure required inmates in Oregon to work 40 hours each week or receive on-the-job training. Oregon Corrections Enterprises’ inmate employees normally produce items such as park benches, gun safes, grills, furniture and clothing. Jeske said the 30,000 non-medical masks OCE is making from cotton are for the Department of Corrections for use by inmates and guards to reduce the risk of infection. “They’re not a medical-grade masks, so they would just go to everybody,” he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Unemployment compensation claims have vaulted the state past 1 million since the coronavirus began taking a severe toll on the economy in mid-March, as the state Department of Health on Monday reported more cases and more virus-related deaths. The state exceeded 283,000 jobless claims last week. Also Monday, lawmakers were scheduled to convene in Harrisburg, as top Republicans in the House of Representatives press legislation to force Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration to allow construction activity and retail operations to continue unabated during the coronavirus crisis. However, top Democrats oppose such efforts, saying it is more important to clamp down on the spread of the coronavirus and try to avoid exposing workers to the virus. Wolf’s administration has called for all “non-life-sustaining” businesses to close indefinitely and suggested now is not the time to stray from that course.\n\nRhode Island\n\nLincoln: CVS Health is rolling out a free, rapid COVID-19 test at its new drive-thru testing site at a casino, Gov. Gina Raimondo announced Monday. The testing site, which will be by appointment only, opened Monday at Twin River Casino in Lincoln. Results from tests being administered at the site could be ready in as little as 15 minutes, the governor said. The site is expected to perform about 1,000 tests per day, doubling the state’s testing capacity, Raimondo said. “Today marks a giant leap forward in our efforts to combat this virus,” she said in a statement. “Making testing rapid and readily available is the key to slowly reopening our economy, and today we are one step closer to that goal.” The Woonsocket-based company says Rhode Island and Georgia are the only two states where it’s offering the rapid tests so far.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: An inmate in a local jail has tested positive for COVID-19, leading officials to isolate the nearly three dozen inmates in his housing unit. The inmate in the Charleston County jail appears to be the first inmate to test positive for coronavirus in the state. No state prisoners have tested positive, although at least 17 Corrections Department employees have been infected, according to the agency. Several police officers across the state also have COVID-19. Meanwhile, an order from Gov. Henry McMaster went into effect Monday, closing several additional categories of businesses, including jewelry stores, bookstores, department stores and flea markets. Even though the list of actions seems similar to those other states with so-called stay-at-home orders, the Republican has steadfastly refused to give his executive orders that name. The coronavirus also prompted the Forestry Commission to ban all outdoor burning until further notice because smoke can cause symptoms similar to COVID-19 and make respiratory problems worse in people already infected.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials on Monday reported the highest day-to-day jump in confirmed coronavirus cases as 48 more people tested positive for the disease. State epidemiologist Josh Clayton said 288 people have tested positive in total, while confirming that two more people in the state have died. Clayton cautioned against reading too much into the uptick in confirmed infections, saying the state would have to see several days of similar increases to count it as statistically important. He also said there has been an increase in testing at both the state lab and commercial labs. The total number of people who have tested positive has doubled since Wednesday. Health officials reported 91 people who have tested positive have recovered so far, while 23 have required hospitalization.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A man has been charged with violating the governor’s stay-at-home coronavirus order after a confrontation with officers at a birthday party. Jeremial Lee, 28, also was charged Saturday with disorderly conduct, marijuana possession and possessing a gun without a permit, Memphis police said in an affidavit. Officers responded to a call of shots being fired Saturday evening and found a large crowd gathered for the party in spite of the Republican governor’s order to avoid gatherings of 10 people or more. Jeremial Lee “became upset because of being told to leave” and threatened an officer, the affidavit said. Gov. Bill Lee’s guidance to law enforcement on carrying out the order says officers should first seek to educate, then warn, then give the opportunity to comply and, if needed, take further steps including charging violators with a misdemeanor. The emergency order law is punishable by up to 11 months and 29 days in jail.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Officials in this popular South Texas city said they’re looking at ways to discourage vacationers from visiting amid the coronavirus outbreak. Mayor Joe McComb is looking at possibly restricting residential vacation rentals in his coastal city during the upcoming weeks. “We’re going to be looking at the possibilities of trying to convince them that coming down here is not in their best interest or our best interest,” McComb said. “Because the traveling bug comes with them, and we just want to protect our citizens.” The majority of COVID-19 cases in Nueces County, where Corpus Christi is located, are travel-related, according to public documents.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: Northern Utah jail populations are falling, and police are delivering fewer detainees for jailing, except violent offenders, as law enforcement responds to the coronavirus pandemic. The Weber County Jail in Ogden had about 780 inmates this time last year, but the head count is down to about 685 recently, said Lt. Joshua Marigoni, spokesman for the Sheriff’s Office corrections division. Davis County’s jail population at Farmington dipped below 500 last week, Sheriff Kelly Sparks said, compared with daily averages last spring ranging from 600 to 700. Police departments that feed arrestees to the county jails are participating in the effort to limit those populations, which are at high risk of spreading infection if any inmates contract COVID-19. “The public should understand that if we get COVID-19 in the jail, we’ve got a serious issue,” Marigoni said. “We don’t have the option of social distancing.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermonters need to prepare for what could be a bleak time over the next several weeks as the state continues its efforts to control the outbreak of COVID-19, but there are glimmers of hope, Gov. Phil Scott said Monday. Scott reiterated that Vermonters need to stay home and stay isolated from others as the most effective tool to stop the spread of the virus. “This is a once-in-a-century challenge, but with each of us sacrificing for the greater good, with neighbors helping neighbors and using Vermont common sense and ingenuity, and by uniting around the common cause of protecting one another, we will beat this.” Twenty-two Vermonters have died from COVID-19, and projections for the number of people expected to die range from about 40 to 100, Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said. One projection estimates the effort to contain the spread of COVID-19 could save 1,700 lives, Levine said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRoanoke: State officials are warning of possible scams related to the coronavirus epidemic and are particularly worried about the $1,200 checks that many Americans will receive from the federal government in the coming weeks and months. The warning comes from the Internal Revenue Service as well as a new state task force that’s been set up specifically to battle epidemic-related fraud. It’s made up of U.S. attorneys for the state as well as the FBI and the Virginia State Police. They issued a warning late last week. U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger said in a statement that Virginians are “likely to see an uptick” in things such as advanced-fee schemes that promise government relief checks. Scammers may ask people to sign over their checks or get them to “verify” filing information in order to steal money.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee said Sunday that the state will return more than 400 ventilators of the 500 it has received from the federal government so they can go to New York and other states hit harder by the coronavirus. The Democratic governor said Sunday that his statewide stay-at-home order and weeks of social distancing have led to slower rates of infections and deaths in Washington. The state Department of Health said Sunday evening that Washington had nearly 8,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 338 deaths. New York has more than 122,000 confirmed cases and more than 4,000 deaths. Washington received 500 ventilators last month from the Strategic National Stockpile. “I’ve said many times over the last few weeks: We are in this together,” Inslee said. “This should guide all of our actions at an individual and state level in the coming days and weeks.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: West Virginia National Guard members who have lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic will be used to process mounting unemployment claims, Gov. Jim Justice said. “As of Monday, the Workforce call line will be operating 24/7 and I have directed the West Virginia National Guard to spare no expense, and use all their resources in as many physical locations as possible, to get the backlog of calls under control,” Justice said in a news release. The West Virginia Office of Technology is assisting with implementing technology, he said. Workforce WV employees are trying to process 90,000 claims from last month compared with 2,400 in March 2019, Justice said. Information from the state Department of Health and Human Resources, including the state’s toll-free hotline, is available online.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Deaths and confirmed cases of the coronavirus are spiking in the city’s black community, leading public health and civic leaders to sound the alarm that decades of social, political and economic disadvantages are creating a toxic stew that puts people’s lives at risk like no time before. “I wish I could say I was surprised or shocked by that,” said Joshua Garoon, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies the sociology of public health. “But it’s precisely, given the situation in Wisconsin, what I would expect to see. … All else is not equal, especially in a city like Milwaukee.” Milwaukee is Wisconsin’s largest city, with about 600,000 people, and is home to the state’s largest minority population. As of 2018, black people accounted for about 38% of the city’s population, with about 35% white and 20% Hispanic. The city is repeatedly ranked as one of the worst for black people in the country, based on income and employment disparities, a wide education gap and high levels of incarceration.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Lawmakers are considering holding a special legislative session to decide what to do with the federal stimulus money coming to the state and to confront other issues brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. Republican House Speaker Steve Harshman of Casper said the likelihood of the state’s first special session since 2004 is pretty good, and there may be more than one, according to the Wyoming Tribune Eagle. It’s not clear how lawmakers would convene a session in the middle of a pandemic. Gov. Mark Gordon has the ability to call an emergency session to convene outside the Capitol, which would allow lawmakers to meet via a virtual format. The Legislature also has the constitutional power to call itself in, but that route requires the session be held in Cheyenne.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/03/virus-sniffing-dog-vegas-boom-vaccine-hecklers-news-around-states/115956336/", "title": "Virus-sniffing dog, Vegas boom: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Vaccines for COVID-19 are now widely available, but some people remain hesitant to take the shots, State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday. After months of struggling with getting an adequate supply into the state, Harris said health officials are now trying to battle some people’s reluctance to sign up for doses. While people can be reluctant to take the vaccine for a variety of reasons, one is the false belief that the vaccine is more dangerous than the coronavirus, he said. “If you can identify one single issue that is a problem, it’s that there are people who are just convinced that the vaccine is somehow more dangerous than the disease,” Harris told reporters. “That’s a false belief we have to try to combat as often as we can. It’s simply not true.” Nearly one-third of Alabama’s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. However, that figure ranks the state third from last in the nation, ahead of Mississippi and Louisiana, and Alabama is last nationally in its overall rate of vaccination. Harris said health officials are conducting media campaigns and asking doctors to contact their patients about the benefits of getting vaccinated. He emphasized that vaccination “is the fastest way to get back to normal.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Friday ended the state’s COVID-19 disaster declaration, saying the state is in such a good position he doesn’t need emergency powers bestowed by the Legislature. “Alaska is in the recovery phase where an emergency declaration is no longer necessary,” Dunleavy said in a statement. “Our systems are fully functioning with vaccine distribution, adequate testing, and health care capacity. It is important our focus remains on getting Alaska’s economy back on track and welcoming summer tourism throughout our great state.” Dunleavy acted on the recommendation of health commissioner Adam Crum, who concluded the emergency disaster declaration is no longer necessary. “While COVID-19 is still present in Alaska, the urgent nature of the pandemic has passed and we are no longer anticipating the widespread emergency that Alaska faced earlier in this pandemic,” Crum wrote in a memo to Dunleavy. The Republican governor also signed a bill that his office says ensures the continuation of COVID-19 federal relief to affected Alaskans and liability protections for businesses in the state.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Numerous doctors’ offices and clinics will be able to directly obtain COVID-19 vaccines starting this week, state health officials said Friday. Dr. Cara Christ, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, announced eligible physicians and local health care providers will no longer have to rely on allocations from their county public health department. That means nearly 1,200 providers registered with the state can order up to 200 doses within a two-week period from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They will receive the Moderna vaccine because it has less complex storage requirements. The hope is that being able to go to a primary care doctor for a shot will “be a major driver,” Christ said. “Based on our community listening sessions, people indicated that a recommendation from their health care provider, that would be one of the things that would drive them to get vaccinated,” Christ said. State officials are expecting 100,000 doses to be available for these smaller providers to order directly during the first week. As vaccine demand declines, state health officials have been working with community groups on pop-up vaccination events in underserved areas like Yuma and south Phoenix. Strategies include telephonic town halls, door-to-door canvassing and targeted social media posts.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson has signed into law legislation banning state and local mask mandates for preventing the spread of the coronavirus, even though the prohibition will not take effect until later this summer. Hutchinson dropped the state’s mandate in March, but cities including Fayetteville and Little Rock were allowed to keep their requirements in place. The bill is the latest measure the Republican governor has signed to curb Arkansas’ pandemic-related restrictions. On Wednesday he signed bills prohibiting the state and local governments from requiring vaccinations against COVID-19 or “vaccine passports” to access services. The mask mandate ban does not prevent businesses from imposing their own requirements, unlike an earlier version of the bill Hutchinson had said he would veto. The new law doesn’t take effect until late July at the earliest. Hutchinson cited the delay in the prohibition taking effect and its exemption of private businesses. “It is important to respect the individual decisions made by private businesses,” Hutchinson said in a statement. “It also does not have an emergency clause, so the law will not go into effect until the current school year ends.” The measure doesn’t apply to state-owned or state-controlled health care facilities, state prisons or facilities operated by the Division of Youth Services.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Friday that the COVID-19 mass vaccination site at Dodger Stadium will close by the end of May, part of a trend in California to bring doses closer to where people live as appointments in some places go unfilled. Winding down operations at the stadium marks the transition of the city’s vaccination efforts to appointment-free options and putting more doses into walk-up centers and mobile clinics, the mayor said in a statement. Dodger Stadium became one of the nation’s most prominent sites for coronavirus response, first for testing and then for delivery of vaccines to people waiting in long lines of cars. “Dodger Stadium set the standard for sports franchises and community institutions playing a starring role in our COVID-19 response for the country,” Garcetti said. More than 1 million people were tested at the stadium, and the number of vaccine doses administered there has topped 420,000, according to the city. Orange County’s big vaccination site at Disneyland closed Friday as the theme park reopened to visitors for the first time in more than a year. Similarly, a major site at Six Flags Magic Mountain in northern Los Angeles County recently closed as that park welcomed visitors back. North of San Francisco, Marin County will close two mass vaccination sites in San Rafael by the end of May.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A little more than a year since schools and all their events shut down, some traditions, like prom, are returning – or, as some schools called them, “prom-like events.” Poudre School District’s four comprehensive high schools – Fort Collins High School, Fossil Ridge High School, Poudre High School and Rocky Mountain High School – hosted proms Saturday night, with a few stark differences from those of years past. At this year’s events, students could choose to wear formal or informal attire, food was not served for safety reasons, and the dances were all hosted outside to allow for social distancing and airflow. Tickets had to be bought ahead of time through an application that allows a school’s COVID-19 response team to perform contact tracing if a student who attended tests positive for the coronavirus. Students also had to register for the dance in a “pod” of no more than 10 and be limited to hanging out with that group for the evening. The district said by having students register in groups, kids within a pod were able to be less than 6 feet away from each other. Students were unable to attend if they had “any illness symptoms or are probable/positive for COVID-19.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Several of the state’s best-known museums have signed on to a proposal by Gov. Ned Lamont designed to combat some of the learning lost during the pandemic by allowing children to visit for free this summer. Mystic Aquarium, Mystic Seaport Museum, Beardsley Zoo, the Connecticut Science Center and the Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk have all expressed interest in participating, Lamont said Friday. Under the initiative, all Connecticut children 18 and under and one accompanying adult can visit the museums free of charge from July 1 to Sept. 6. “By participating in this program, we hope to provide more children access to a fun and educational destination and instill a love of the ocean that motivates young audiences to make a difference in our world,” said Dr. Stephen M. Coan, president and CEO of Sea Research Foundation Inc., the nonprofit that operates Mystic Aquarium. The governor’s plan would fund the program with $15 million from the state’s federal recovery funds. “Connecticut has some of the best museums in the region, and they were significantly impacted by the pandemic,” Lamont said. “Investing these recovery dollars into our museums just makes sense.” The Legislature must sign off on the proposal.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state had the highest foreclosure rate in the country so far this year, according to a nationwide realty data analysis. One in every 1,705 housing units in Delaware had a foreclosure filing in the first quarter of 2021, according to the report from ATTOM Data Solutions. Of the state’s three counties, Kent County saw the highest foreclosure rate at the start of this year, with 1 in every 1,281 housing units seeing a foreclosure filing. New Castle County saw 1 in every 1,691, and Sussex County saw 1 in every 2,094. While the First State ranked first in terms of its foreclosure rate this past quarter, it was 31st in the total number of foreclosure filings, according to the data. The state had 254 filings, showing that even a small change in the small state can have a big impact on its ranking. And some state officials questioned the data. The Delaware State Housing Authority launched a mortgage assistance program in August to help people struggling to make their payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. That program was paused at the end of last year because the state was unsure if the federal government would continue to help fund the program, according to Jessica Eisenbrey Welch, a spokeswoman for the Delaware State Housing Authority.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Fully vaccinated people may do more without wearing a mask under a new order from Mayor Muriel Bowser, WUSA-TV reports. People who are fully vaccinated – meaning at least two weeks have passed since their final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine – may now gather outdoors with a small group of vaccinated and unvaccinated people without wearing a mask, but social distance must be maintained, and people in the group who are not fully vaccinated must continue to wear masks. Fully vaccinated people can visit with a small group of fully vaccinated people only at a private indoor setting without wearing a mask. They may travel within the United States without getting tested for the coronavirus before or after their trip. Those flying into the U.S. from another country still need to show a negative test before boarding and get tested three to five days after their return. Fully vaccinated people may also continue activities after being exposed to someone with COVID-19 without needing to get tested or quarantine, unless they have symptoms or live in a group setting. Businesses and other institutions may ask to see a person’s vaccine card or other proof of inoculation. Employers are also required to provide masks for their employees and can implement mask mandates at the office, according to the order.\n\nFlorida\n\nSarasota: Three days a week, Buffy greets visitors at the entrance to Doctors Hospital of Sarasota. If they grant permission, she sniffs their feet, seeking a whiff of active COVID-19 infection. Few decline the offer when they see the yellow Labrador retriever with a wagging tail. People generally don’t love going to a hospital, said CEO Robert Meade, but “who doesn’t love labs?” Buffy was trained by Palmetto-based Southeastern Guide Dogs as part of a four-dog pilot program for scent detection. The original plan was to train dogs to detect heightened levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. The coronavirus pandemic derailed that plan but opened the door to another. Small, early studies on dogs trained to detect the virus in Europe – though still unproven – showed promise. Southeastern decided to give it a shot. The four dogs selected had flunked out of Southeastern’s guide dog training, seen as easily distracted or “a little high-energy,” trainer Laska Parrow said. But “they were dogs that never gave up when a treat was hidden somewhere.” Saliva samples were collected from Doctors Hospital patients with active COVID-19 infections and “inactivated,” rendering them noninfectious. The dogs trained for three months. At the end, Buffy was 95% accurate at detecting the virus samples. Meade said he believes Doctors Hospital of Sarasota is the first hospital in the U.S. with such a pooch.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is removing many remaining requirements for social distancing and masked employees from businesses, saying the state’s efforts to control COVID-19 have been successful – even as its vaccination rate lags and as federal officials continue to warn that infection rates remain relatively high. While Kemp was touring the Mexican border in Texas on Friday, the Republican’s office released a new executive order that took effect Saturday and runs through May 30. “Businesses across the Peach State have followed COVID-19 restrictions for over a year to keep their employees and customers safe and will now be able to make informed decisions about how their business operations move forward,” said Mallory Blount, a spokesperson for Kemp. “Georgians know best how to protect themselves and their families, and they deserve to be able to return to normal.” But public health experts fear another surge, possibly driven by more infectious variants of the coronavirus. “Too soon,” Emory University infectious disease expert Carlos del Rio wrote on Twitter, pointing to federal statistics. “We still have ‘substantial transmission’ and our percent of population fully vaccinated is low.” More than 6 million doses of vaccines have been given in Georgia, but the state ranks 44th in doses per capita to people 18 and up.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige says the state’s mask mandate will remain in place for now. Ige urged people to continue wearing masks despite the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about vaccinated people not having to wear masks in certain outdoor situations, Hawaii News Now reports. “We believe that the basic mask mandate is still appropriate, and we won’t be making changes, or making significant changes, at this time,” Ige said. He said said it would be difficult to determine who has been vaccinated against COVID-19 when it comes to enforcement. Some people at a beach park agreed. “It’s great that he’s not going to change it because how can you tell if somebody’s vaccinated or not?” said Terry Kakazu. “For my own protection, I’m gonna wear it anyway.” And beachgoer Claire Nakamua-Rochon asked: “What are we gonna do, put a ‘V’ on everybody’s arm to let everybody know you’re the vaccinated one?” Ige said he believes masks have helped keep the coronavirus in check in the state. “Hawaii continues to have amongst the lowest per capita infection rates and fatality rates in the country,” he said. “I do believe that our mask mandate is part of that success.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers hesitant to leave the governor in charge of pandemic decisions after the legislative session are delaying their adjournment, a move that analysts say could cause a government shutdown by threatening the start date of some 200 pieces of legislation. A measure intended to change the effective date of the legislation should be amended to avoid a potential government shutdown starting in June, a legal analysis has determined. The Idaho attorney general’s office sent the analysis Thursday to the Idaho Legislative Services Office, a nonpartisan government entity that supports state lawmakers. The document obtained by the Associated Press said the legislation as written could pass a court challenge, but the consequences for failing could be severe. The 200 bills include 65 critical appropriations bills. They would typically not take effect until at least 60 days after the Legislature adjourns. But the Legislature still being in session pushes their effective date past the start of the new fiscal year, starting July 1. If the bill is found unconstitutional, “some 200 bills, including appropriations bills to fund parts of state government, would not take effect on July 1, 2021,” wrote Chief Deputy Brian Kane, and “there could be funding issues for parts of state government as early as June 12.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Consistent statewide procedures and ongoing drills that target infection response and other emergencies will be routine at Illinois veterans’ homes after COVID-19 caught the LaSalle Veterans’ Home unprepared and claimed 36 lives last fall, said the newly appointed director of the state Department of Veterans Affairs. Terry Prince, a 31-year Navy veteran and former senior adviser to the U.S. surgeon general, has issued a six-point plan for improving readiness at the state’s veterans’ homes in Anna, Manteno, Quincy and LaSalle. The plan follows a blistering investigative report that laid out a string of miscommunications, lax policy and missed opportunities when the pandemic hit the home in LaSalle, 94 miles west of Chicago. The report by the inspector general of the Illinois Department of Human Services, released Friday, noted that despite escaping all traces of the deadly respiratory illness for eight months after it entered Illinois, little was done to devise protocols for preventing or managing infections. After the first four cases were reported Nov. 1, the virus spread to 60 residents and 43 employees as confused staff operated in an environment that was “inefficient, reactive and chaotic,” the report said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gamblers will have to keep wearing face masks inside the state’s casinos at least through the end of May. Updated health guidelines issued by the Indiana Gaming Commission said operators of the 13 state-licensed casinos decided to keep the mask rule in place to stem COVID-19 spread even though Gov. Eric Holcomb lifted the statewide mask mandate as of April 6. The casino rules require customers to wear masks except when eating, drinking or smoking while seated at a slot machine, bar or restaurant table. Gamblers must wear masks at table games, and employees are required to have masks on at all times. The gaming commission said casinos will review whether to continue the mask requirement past June 1. The state guidelines direct casinos to obtain permission from local health officials before holding any events involving large crowds and continue extra spacing between slot machine players.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds said she rejected $95 million in federal money for coronavirus testing in schools because she didn’t think there was a need for the funding. Reynolds, a Republican, announced her decision on a Thursday night Fox News show and criticized President Joe Biden’s administration for offering the money aimed at expanding testing. “I think he thinks that COVID just started,” Reynolds said on the show, which was televised from a forum with other Republican governors in Florida. ”I just returned $95 million because they sent an additional $95 million to the state of Iowa to get our kids back in the classroom by doing surveillance testing. And I said we’ve been in the classroom since August. Here’s your $95 million back.” Kelly Garcia, director of the Iowa Department of Human Services, confirmed later that Iowa had turned down the funding. The Republican Party of Iowa praised Reynolds’ decision, saying the Biden administration had failed in its efforts to return students to in-person classrooms, but “Gov. Reynolds fought back against the teachers unions and succeeded.” Democratic state Auditor Rob Sand questioned the rejection of federal money that would have assisted testing at schools and funded Iowa jobs.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A Kansas City-area high school athletic director is pleading with families to take pandemic safety protocols seriously after instructing about 200 students to quarantine last week. John Johnson, who oversees athletics at Shawnee Mission South High School, said in a message to parents and athletes that “there are more students with positive tests, and that is causing an extreme domino effect of COVID transmission concerns.” He also warned that post-season play could be affected, The Kansas City Star reports. Elected officials in Johnson County voted Thursday to switch the mask mandate to a recommendation, although the decision doesn’t affect schools. Health officials in the county, which is the state’s largest, have warned that while the number of new coronavirus cases is down, the drop in testing makes it more difficult to know how widespread transmission of the virus has become. And they are urging eligible residents to get vaccinated, saying demand has slowed. District spokesman David Smith said it is typical for student-athletes to be quarantined from playing sports after a potential exposure but still be allowed to attend class. “At school, we have protocols, including mask-wearing and social distancing. But when you’re participating in sports, it’s not always possible to do those things,” Smith said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Thousands of spectators gathered in the infield at Churchill Downs on Saturday for the Kentucky Derby, many not wearing face masks required amid the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds stood in lines that were not spaced out to use ATMs or buy food. Unlike some Derby tickets this year that are all-inclusive, infield tickets don’t include drinks or food, so fans have to use cash to make purchases. Sydney Lowe of Columbus, Ohio, said she and her friends were fine with not wearing masks because they were outside and had been vaccinated. “We’re outside; I feel like it’s not that big a deal,” Lowe said. “I wish there were more ATMs and that it wasn’t only cash, that’s one thing,” added her friend Halle Vozar. A recording played over a loudspeaker at the entrance said guests were required to wear masks over their mouths and noses. Ticket-takers reminded people coming in the front gate: “Please have your mask on! Masks on! Masks on!” A sign posted indoors by the wagering windows reminding spectators to wear masks largely went ignored. Others had masks pulled down covering their chins. The crowd at the Downs reportedly topped 50,000 people, which would make the Derby the biggest gathering for a U.S. sports event since the pandemic began.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards has proposed spending $1.6billion of the state’s $3.2billion in federal funding from the latest pandemic relief package on Louisiana’s bankrupt unemployment trust fund, tourism and infrastructure to help stand up the economy. “It’s my belief that these are the three most important things we can do right now ... to have a transformative, positive impact on Louisiana,” Edwards said at a Thursday press conference. Edwards, who will need approval from the Legislature, wants to direct $230 million to repay federal loans that have propped up the state’s unemployment trust fund and another $400 million to replenish the trust fund to avoid triggering tax hikes on businesses. “I don’t believe it’s a good thing to increase taxes on businesses when we’re trying to grow the economy coming out of a pandemic,” he said. Edwards is proposing $750 million go toward infrastructure – $400 million to roads and bridges, $300 million to upgrade dilapidated water systems and $50 million for ports. He’s also recommending $125 million for Convention and Visitors Bureaus and other tourism venues and $20 million for the Office of Culture, Recreation and Tourism. “That’s incredibly important to jump-start our economy,” he said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Cities and towns would be able to get access to federal coronavirus aid under a pandemic law change. The Legislature on Wednesday passed a proposal to set up an account for the state to receive and distribute federal funds for the municipalities via the American Rescue Plan. The proposal, which was a governor’s bill, is now before Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. Democratic Senate President Troy Jackson said the money is important for Maine cities and towns to “work to rebuild local communities and economies.” The American Rescue Plan allocated funds to Maine municipalities based on their populations, the Maine Legislature Office of the Presiding Officers said. Every town in the state will receive money, Democratic Rep. Teresa Pierce said. That will result in more than $600 million going into the communities, she said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Preliminary data from 2020 reveals a dramatic increase in deaths linked with opioids in the state, particularly fentanyl, and health officials blame the pandemic. The number of unintentional intoxication overdoses – those involving all drugs and alcohol – rose 18.7% to 2,773 in 2020 from 2,379 in 2019, according to data collected by the Maryland Department of Health. In more than 90% of cases, opioids were detected in bodies postmortem. That’s the highest rate recorded in the state’s history of collecting this data. While too early to formally determine the extent to which COVID-19 has influenced this increase, experts agree the pandemic is likely to blame for the widespread increase in drug use. Dr. Aaron Greenblatt, medical director of the University of Maryland Medical Center Addiction Treatment Programs, said pandemic-induced stress is likely a major factor in drug users’ relapses, but COVID-19 restricted treatment options, too. “I think that access to treatment – particularly access to psychosocial treatments – was really significantly impacted by COVID … we haven’t had groups,” Greenblatt told Capital News Service. Outpatient addiction treatment programs are intense and may require patients to visit an office or a clinic to get supervised therapeutic medication dosing up to six days a week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is pouring $70 million into summer educational programs to benefit students who have fallen behind academically and socially while learning remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday. “Studies continue to show that amid the school closures, many students did miss out on some fundamental issues around math and reading,” the Republican governor said after touring a Canton middle school. The programs designed for every grade level – including high school seniors graduating this spring – will feature a mix of academic and recreational opportunities at schools, after-school providers, community colleges and recreation sites, he said. Many students were out of school for longer than a year during the pandemic, and some high school students continue to learn remotely. The programs include so-called Acceleration Academies, which will offer intensive instruction in one subject with smaller classes, longer instructional blocks and individualized attention. Under the Summer Acceleration to College program, class of 2021 high school graduates will be able to take math and English courses for credit at no cost at 14 community colleges. Another program is aimed at incoming kindergartners.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Republican legislative leaders on Friday welcomed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s metric-based approach to further relaxing coronavirus restrictions, but they questioned what will happen if Michigan’s COVID-19 vaccination rate falls below targets. Their comments came a day after the Democratic governor announced four benchmarks that will trigger additional economic reopening – when 55%, 60%, 65% and 70% of people ages 16 and up get at least one shot. About half have done so to date. The state, where the seven-day infection rate remains highest in the U.S. but is dropping, now needs at least 2 of every 5 unvaccinated residents to receive a dose. “I think that we need a little more of a discussion on this metric of vaccines alone. I believe there’s a little more breadth that needs to be taken into consideration there, especially if we run into resistance and reluctance that causes us to plateau below the numbers that have been indicated,” Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, said during a virtual event sponsored by the Detroit Regional Chamber. It included all four legislative leaders. House Speaker Jason Wentworth, R-Clare, applauded Whitmer for providing people “some sense of hope” and said both the vaccination rate and vaccine accessibility are important.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: About 100 people gathered at Lake George on Saturday morning to memorialize the nearly 400 area residents who have died from COVID-19 in the past year and to share messages of resilience and hope for the future. The event was organized by St. Cloud Times journalists Nora Hertel and Sarah Kocher. “I had the idea to do something like this in January,” Hertel said after the memorial. “I just thought, how are we honoring these people?” Each death has added to a “huge community loss,” Hertel said, and “I just felt like we needed to reckon with it.” The memorial took place on the deck on the east side of Lake George. Guests were invited to tie strips of cloth, donated by Gruber’s Quilt Shop in Waite Park, to the railing, where they will remain until Friday. Those ribbons fluttered in the breeze behind each speaker during the event. The Rev. James Alberts, of the Higher Ground Church of God in Christ, was the first guest to speak, opting to use his “pastor voice” instead of a microphone. “It’s good to see your faces, in a shared space and to be able to do this together,” Alberts said, before leading the group in prayer. “It’s so important that we recognize the loss of nearly 400 people in our area,” Mayor Dave Kleis said. “I hope there’s a day not too distant in the future where we will celebrate the last case of COVID.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves on Friday erased most restrictions he had set to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The Republican governor left one rule in place: a mandate for students 6 or older to wear masks in schools for the rest of the current academic year. The school year ends within the next few weeks in most parts of the state. Reeves’ new executive order removes capacity restrictions for sports events. Previously, indoor arenas could only fill two-thirds of their seats to allow for social distancing. School sporting events and other activities were limited to 50% capacity for both indoor and outdoor events. Now, both indoor and outdoor school activities are no longer under capacity restrictions. “Getting our kids back in school last August was one of the most important decisions of the pandemic and keeping them in the classroom is one of my top priorities,” Reeves said in a statement Friday. “Even so – our class of 2021 has not been afforded a normal senior year. I want every one of them to attend their graduation and I want everyone in their family to be able to join them!” Reeves had already removed mask requirements in public spaces and all capacity restrictions for restaurants, bars and other businesses.\n\nMissouri\n\nReeds Spring: A southwest Missouri school district that dropped its mask mandate last month has decided to reinstate it after several students became infected with the coronavirus, leading to dozens of quarantines. The 1,700-student Reeds Spring district had gone weeks without a case when it decided to make masks optional beginning April 22. Several other districts in the Springfield area also have ditched mask orders in recent weeks. “It’s getting harder and harder to even get kids to keep those masks on as they are seeing people, adults and everyone in the community, not wearing masks,” Superintendent Cody Hirschi said in a video at the time. The change didn’t last long, though, before the district decided to reinstate the mandate starting Friday. “The cases of quarantine are really our biggest concern,” said district spokesman Ben Fisher, noting that six positive tests led to 95 quarantines in several buildings. “We really think it is essential for kids to be able to participate in end-of-year activities, so we decided this was the best option to keep kids in school.” Statewide, the percentage of Missouri residents receiving at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine barely budged Friday, remaining a little above 37% of the state population, KMIZ-TV reports.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state posted 169 new COVID-19 cases Saturday, bringing Montana’s total to 108,985 confirmed reports. Of the 108,985 cases, 106,324 are recovered, and 1,087 remain active. There are 53 people who are now hospitalized out of 5,021 total COVID-19 hospitalizations since the pandemic began, according to the state website covid19.mt.gov. Montana added two deaths overnight, bringing the total to 1,574 fatalities related to the respiratory illness. The state has thus far administered 1,302,221 tests for the coronavirus. The first case of COVID-19 in Montana was reported March 11, 2020. The state’s highest daily total of newly detected cases came Nov. 12, when 1,429 new cases were reported.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A community college is using federal COVID-19 relief funds to pay for tuition and books for high schoolers from the state to take courses this summer. The Omaha World-Herald reports officials at the Metropolitan Community College hope their newly approved offer will pull in thousands of students. The college saw about a 15% drop in summer enrollment from 2019 to 2020, said Bill Owen, the college’s vice president for strategic initiatives. “If we’re truly in recovery mode, and we hope we are, we think we’ll see a return to those numbers,” he said. Typically, high school students pay $33 per credit hour – half the full rate – if they enroll in a program called CollegeNow that is designed for high school students to jump-start their college education. While those students will be allowed to attend courses for free this summer, they will be responsible for tools and other required supplies.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The city has been almost elbow-to-elbow lately with pandemic-weary tourists looking for excitement and entertainment, after casinos rose from 35% to 50% occupancy March 15 under state health guidelines. Capacity limits in Las Vegas casinos dropped again Saturday – allowing 80% occupancy – while person-to-person distancing went from 6 feet to 3 feet. Masks are still required. “People were just yearning to go someplace and let loose,” said Alan Feldman, a former casino executive who is now a fellow at the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Among the first arrivals were people ages 60 and older who were recently vaccinated with time and disposable income, he said. Analysts said pent-up demand, available hotel rooms and $1,400 federal pandemic recovery checks have contributed to the rush. “People are feeling more comfortable traveling as science appears to be getting ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Jeremy Aguero, principal analyst at Applied Analysis in Las Vegas. And every Sunday, a nearly 20-mile line of vehicles jams southbound Interstate 15 near the Nevada-California state line. “You have visitors coming throughout the week, all leaving at the same time,” Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Travis Smaka said. “It’s very busy every Sunday.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu says state health officials and private agencies have begun a number of initiatives to encourage residents to get vaccinated. Officials warn that New Hampshire, which has been leading the nation in the percentage of the population that’s received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, is starting to see growth in the number of fully vaccinated residents slow down. WMUR-TV reports many people who are eligible to receive a shot have not signed up for an appointment. Data from the Department of Health and Human Services shows more than 790,000 New Hampshire residents have received their first dose, about 60% of the population, while more than 351,000 of those people are fully vaccinated, or about 26% of the population. The state says a series of public service announcements and electronic billboards will encourage people who may be hesitant to get vaccinated. Experts say it is important for everyone to get inoculated. “They may not become ill. They may be a transmitter and simply part of an asymptomatic transmission,” said Martha Wassell, director of Infection Prevention at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital. “That could in turn spread this to someone who either was vaccinated, and it didn’t work well, or for whatever medical reason could not be vaccinated.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Business, casino and political officials called on Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday to ease coronavirus regulations enough to allow conventions and trade shows to resume in the city. Saying the convention industry generates nearly $2 billion in annual revenue for Atlantic City, the groups asked the Democratic governor to allow meetings to utilize available space at 50% of capacity, as is permitted on the gambling floors of the city’s nine casinos. Michael Chait, president of the Greater Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce, praised Murphy’s handling of the pandemic but said state-imposed rules are inconsistent and are hurting the convention industry. “I can only have 25 people in a meeting room, but I can have 225 people in a banquet hall,” he said at a press conference on the Boardwalk as workmen attended to the facade of Boardwalk Hall in anticipation of the summer tourism season. “I can have 50% capacity on the casino floor, but I can only take 25 of them and put them into an adjacent meeting room.” Chait said the city would like to be able to host conventions and trade shows at 50% of capacity, using the same safety and distancing protocols the casinos have been using since they were allowed to reopen last July. He said the casino industry has proven it is possible to operate at higher levels without compromising safety.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A judge has ordered education officials to provide computers and high-speed internet to students who still don’t have them in a landmark ruling that for the first time in the state has set a standard for internet speeds for public school children. The ruling requires state officials to immediately determine which students covered by the sweeping lawsuit are still lacking quality internet or devices and to provide them with what they need, including transportation if they can’t get fast internet from home. “Children who are lacking access to internet and technology for remote learning are not getting much of an education, if at all, let alone one that is sufficient to make them college and career ready,” state District Judge Matthew Wilson said in the ruling Friday morning. It’s unclear how the court might compel state officials to act on the ruling or when it might hold them in contempt. The vast majority of New Mexico schools are open to in-person learning. But school districts serving tribal areas, which were particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 cases and deaths, are still under lockdown orders, and some are still in remote or partially remote learning. About 10% of New Mexico children are Native American and often confront major barriers to online and in-person learning.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Restaurants in New York City can increase their indoor dining to 75% of capacity starting Friday, May 7, in line with the rest of the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday. That will let city eateries fill more of their tables on Mother’s Day, May 9. Cuomo on Friday also said personal services including hair salons and barbershops could expand to 75% capacity starting May 7 as well. Gyms in New York City can go to 50% capacity starting May 15. Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio both spoke Thursday about wanting to see coronavirus-related restrictions lifted in the next couple of months. Infection rates throughout the state have continued to fall at a steady pace in recent weeks as more people have become vaccinated against COVID-19. The number of new infections reported daily in New York has dropped 56% since the start of April, even as more and more social activity has resumed. Still, the crisis isn’t over yet. A majority of New Yorkers have yet to receive even a single dose of the vaccine. The state recorded 25,000 positive coronavirus tests in the prior seven days, more than it did in the entire month of September.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Some low-income families missed out on getting coronavirus relief grants last year because of administrative and qualifying hurdles required by the General Assembly, a state audit concluded last week. The legislature in September approved using federal COVID-19 relief funds to give families one-time $335 payments. The “Extra Credit Grant” money was designed to assist with virtual schooling and child care costs during the pandemic but could be used for any purpose. Lawmakers tasked the Department of Revenue with managing the program. More than 1.1 million payments had been sent by the department through December totaling about $375 million, according to State Auditor Beth Wood’s office. They were sent automatically to families who were 2019 tax filers and reported having at least one child age 16 or under. But parents or guardians who didn’t make enough money in 2019 to file a return were required to fill out an application to obtain payments. By the end of 2020, about 25,000 payments had been made to those who had applied, the performance audit said. Wood’s report found that other low-income families didn’t receive payments because of the additional steps the Revenue Department had to complete within a matter of weeks to accept applications and award payments.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The 2021 Legislature reached its finale early Friday in a session marked by a record-high state budget, the first expulsion of a lawmaker and pandemic protocols that greatly dampened public participation at the state Capitol. Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford, the state Senate’s presiding officer, hit the final gavel at 12:26 a.m. Friday. House members officially completed their work at 12:18 a.m. after finishing a brief chorus of “Auld Lang Syne.” Lawmakers from both sides exchanged handshakes and hugs after a marathon day that came to an end after approval of the spending bill for the Office of Management and Budget, which also serves as Legislature’s last-minute catchall measure. Thursday was Day 76 for the Legislature, just short of the 80-day maximum set by the North Dakota Constitution. The Legislature will use the remaining days later in the year to approve new legislative districts. The Republican-led Legislature has passed record-setting budgets in most of the past several sessions, but the spending plan for the next two-year budget cycle is particularly eye-popping, due in part to federal coronavirus aid. As the session wound down Thursday, lawmakers completed work on a nearly $17 billion, two-year budget, about $2.1 billion more than the current budget cycle ending June 30.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Teens have been trickling into COVID-19 vaccination clinics ever since Gov. Mike DeWine opened up eligibility to everyone 16 and older March 29. Soon, experts say it’s possible a vaccine will be allowed for children as young as 5. Dr. Robert Frenck, director of the Gamble Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, said that could happen by August or September. Until then, public health officials are working to get more and more eligible teens vaccinated. In some cases, that means bringing clinics to school buildings. Milford High School in Clermont County hosted a vaccination clinic in partnership with Clermont Public Health last month. District spokesperson Wendy Planicka said about 200 people came to the clinic, 150 of whom were students. Milford senior Jack McKenney, 18, said he caught the coronavirus in the fall. He said he didn’t feel very sick, and a sinus infection he had last March was much worse. Still, he went to Milford’s clinic because he’s worried about spreading COVID-19.“I mean, I know if I were to get COVID again, I would most likely be OK, but it’s just I’m relieved that I wouldn’t give it to someone else as easily,” he said. Other school districts are considering hosting vaccine clinics or at least encouraging students to get shots if able.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Mask mandates intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus are ending in the state’s two largest cities, Oklahoma City and Tulsa. The requirement ended Friday in Oklahoma City and Saturday in Tulsa, although the mandate continues at places such as city offices. Mayors David Holt in Oklahoma City and G.T. Bynum in Tulsa both credited COVID-19 vaccinations for lowering the number of virus cases and hospitalizations. “It is possible we are taking the miracle vaccinations for granted,” Holt said during a Friday news conference. “These proven, safe vaccines are remarkable.” Bynum said residents should also continue wearing masks when in groups of people outside their family. “While we’re in a position to end the city’s mandate that people wear masks in public, that doesn’t mean everyone should have a mask-burning party over the weekend,” Bynum said Thursday. In both cities, private businesses can continue requiring masks if desired. The Oklahoma State Department of Health on Friday reported 448,305 total virus cases since the pandemic began. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in the state has declined from 314.4 daily to 240.7, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: A vaccine clinic set up inside a high school attracted anti-vaccine protesters who heckled teenagers as they entered the site Thursday, prompting the church that provided a parking lot for the event to call police. The Bend-La Pine School District plans to offer COVID-19 vaccines at six different clinics at Central Oregon high schools through June 3 in hopes of stemming an outbreak that’s sickened at least 95 students and staff, The Bulletin reports. Before the school clinics began, Bend-La Pine School Board members received hundreds of angry emails from anti-vaccine activists, said board member Julie Craig. Most had the exact same copy-and-paste wording, but a few were especially nasty, she said. Board member Carrie McPherson Douglass shared emails with The Bulletin that called the school board Nazis for allowing vaccine clinics. In one, a parent promised to “exact cruel and inhuman revenge” if their child was harmed by the shot. “I’m frankly so done with it,” Craig told the newspaper. “I’m so disappointed in community members who feel that is the best way to try and have a conversation, when they don’t agree with something that we’re doing.” In Oregon, teens 15 and up can agree to medical services – including immunization – without parental consent, according to the Oregon Health Authority.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Light of Life Rescue Mission’s plans to hold a vaccine clinic for homeless people last month were upended about three hours before the event was supposed to start, when news broke that use of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine had been paused, the Tribune-Review reports. The shelter quickly shifted gears and administered the Moderna option instead, said Jerrel Gilliam, executive director. But the development altered Light of Life’s vaccine strategy, as clinicians had to inform patients without consistent housing that they needed to return for a second dose. “It is very frustrating,” Gilliam said. “This was part of our strategy to use in the camps because of the one shot.” U.S. health officials later lifted the 11-day J&J vaccine pause, but many of the challenges facing shelters and the homeless during the pandemic will remain. More than 70% of residents in Light of Life’s long-term program have been fully vaccinated, which provides some peace of mind, Gilliam said. But in a population with so much transience and turnover, he said the shelter can’t let its guard down. Barriers to health care, mental health care, food and other basic needs will remain, even after COVID-19 is resolved. “There is some concern that this population will once again go to the back burner,” Gilliam said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Health is partnering with nine colleges and universities to make getting a COVID-19 shot as easy as possible for all students, faculty and staff before the end of the spring semester. Under the program announced Thursday, schools will either hold on-campus vaccination clinics or provide free shuttle service from campus to vaccination sites. “Now that vaccine eligibility is open to all people 16 and older who live, work, or go to school in Rhode Island, it’s important that we get our young people who live in congregate settings vaccinated,” Gov. Daniel McKee said in a statement. For example, Brown University is participating at a designated day at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center in Providence by providing shuttle service to the clinic. Roger Williams University is partnering with the town of Bristol to host an on-campus clinic. Bryant University, the University of Rhode Island, Providence College, Community College of Rhode Island, New England Institute of Technology, Rhode Island College and the Rhode Island School of Design are also participating in the program. Many colleges are requiring students to be vaccinated before returning to campus for the fall. There is no cost to get a shot, and participants do not need health insurance.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Masks continue to be important in schools and many other crowded public settings, state health officials said Friday, after Gov. Henry McMaster last week called masks in schools the “height of ridiculosity.” McMaster criticized the requirements Wednesday, and in a Twitter post he also urged cities and towns to remove mask requirements. Other state officials, from education and health departments, have voiced concern about the Republican governor’s mask recommendations. The South Carolina Department of Education and state Department of Health and Environmental Control have both issued statements saying mask usage is critical to preventing the spread of the coronavirus. South Carolina’s assistant state epidemiologist said Friday in a media briefing that mask mandates in cities and towns continue to be important. Even in cities that have taken away those orders, Dr. Jane Kelly said, “I would urge you to protect yourself, your family and your community by wearing a mask.” She said masks work and likened wearing a mask to wearing a seat belt because once traffic fatalities began to drop, and seat belts were widely adopted, the belts remained, and the fatalities stayed low.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: The 2020 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally caused “widespread transmission” of the coronavirus across the United States, finds a new study released Thursday. More than 463 COVID-19 cases across 30 states were directly connected to the Sturgis Rally in August and September 2020. Seventeen patients were hospitalized, and one person died, according to the report by the Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The information was reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including members of the CDC COVID-19 Response Team, though a disclaimer in the study says the findings “do not necessarily represent the official position.” A total of 649 primary and secondary cases were attributed to the South Dakota event in the study. About 56% of the Sturgis-associated cases were reported in South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska and Wyoming. “While the number of cases identified is sizable – 140 cases per 100,000 attendees – it is likely that the true national impact of the Sturgis event is underestimated,” the report says. Some attendees could have been asymptomatic or hadn’t been tested when they returned home from the rally, leading to untraceable infections.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: For the second year in a row, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville has recommended no increase in tuition or fees for students. It’s a purposeful decision to help students in a challenging time as families continue to recover from the economic effects of COVID-19, UT Knoxville Chancellor Donde Plowman said Friday. “The proposed budget with no increase in tuition and fees represents our commitment to provide affordable access to a world-class education, especially as students and families continue to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic,” Plowman said. “We are also grateful for the state support we receive, which helps us keep tuition flat and continue to offer the academic opportunities and college experiences that make our university special.” The chancellor’s advisory board approved the flat tuition and fees for the 2021-22 school year Friday morning, as part of the budget recommendation for the next fiscal year. The budget and tuition recommendations still needs to be approved by the board of trustees later this year. Last year, tuition and fees were kept flat at all UT campuses because of financial hardship caused by the coronavirus. The year before that, tuition increased by 2%. There was no tuition increase in 2018.\n\nTexas\n\nArlington: A runoff for a U.S. House seat is set between Republican Susan Wright, whose husband was the first member of Congress to die after being diagnosed with COVID-19, and Republican Jake Ellzey. Democrat Jana Lynne Sanchez was narrowly locked out of the runoff in Texas’ 6th Congressional District, which has long been GOP territory. With nearly all votes counted, Sanchez had trailed Ellzey by 354 votes. She said in a statement Sunday that her campaign “came up short.” “Democrats have come a long way toward competing in Texas but we still have a long way to go,” Sanchez said in a statement. Ellzey is a state lawmaker who narrowly lost the GOP nomination for the seat in 2018 and carried the backing of former Gov. Rick Perry. Susan Wright had already been seen as a favorite in a crowded race to fill the seat of her late husband, who died in February after being diagnosed with COVID-19. He was 67. The date of the runoff has not yet been set. Wright will enter the runoff with the backing of former President Donald Trump, who waited until just days before the election to endorse Wright.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: In the past year, lifestyle changes sparked by society’s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to more time at home, more time in front of a screen and a propensity for more frequent snacking. “We call it the COVID diet,” said Dr. Daniel Cannon, a pediatrician with Red Rock Pediatrics in St. George. “We’ve seen a real uptick in weight gain in a lot of kids.” Although the problem may have increased due to factors related to pandemic-era lifestyles, it’s definitely not the first time medical professionals have seen this problem. “Childhood obesity is basically an epidemic,” Cannon said. The problem stems from an increasingly unhealthy lifestyle in children and adolescents and from behaviors sometimes learned from generations of family obesity, he said. Other causes may include a lack of education on the topic of health, poverty, home environment, and accessibility of health care and healthy nutrition. “We call these ‘social determinants of health,’ ” Cannon said, adding that these determinants and others are screened for and discussed at each well visit in order to identify concerning trends before they become a problem. When it comes to increasing activity in children and young adults, Cannon said it’s best to find something the child is interested in and build activity around that.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state relaxed its guidance on mask-wearing outside Saturday while also moving to the second phase of reopening that allows larger gatherings, lifts industry-specific guidance for most businesses, and requires them to all follow the same rules about wearing masks, distancing and staying home when sick, Gov. Phil Scott said Friday. Vaccinated and unvaccinated Vermonters will no longer be required to wear masks outdoors if they are able to physically distance themselves. The new rules follow updated guidance last week from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Scott said during his twice-weekly virus briefing. Masks will only be required in crowds or with multiple households when distancing isn’t possible, said Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine. “The science and data show that outdoor transmission is rare; it poses little risk if you follow our guidance,” the Republican governor said. Municipalities and businesses can have stricter policies if they want, Scott said. More than 60% of adult residents are vaccinated, meeting the state’s goal to move to the second phase of reopening, Scott said. If the state reaches 70% of adults vaccinated by June 1, it will be able to take its final step to turn mandates into recommendations in July, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: Republican candidates for governor touted plans to reopen schools and lift pandemic restrictions as they made videotaped pitches to the tens of thousands of party delegates who will choose a nominee at a convention next Saturday. Pandemic restrictions on mass gatherings have prevented the GOP from holding a traditional convention, so the party has instead opted to hold an “unassembled convention” in which delegates who preregistered to participate will cast ballots at more than 30 locations to choose a nominee. The convention will use ranked-choice voting to more closely mimic the balloting at a traditional convention, where the field is winnowed in successive votes until one candidate gets a minority. And because the candidates won’t be able to make traditional convention speeches to assembled delegates, the GOP arranged for candidates to submit videos touting themselves on the party’s website, which were posted Saturday night.\n\nWashington\n\nRepublic: About 10% of the population of this small city in north-central Washington has tested positive for the coronavirus in an outbreak traced to large indoor events last month at the local Fraternal Order of Eagles hall. Ferry County Memorial Hospital officials have confirmed more than 100 cases, with one reported death, since the April 9-11 events, including a membership drive that featured dinner, live music and a 1980s-themed karaoke night. Some patients have had to be transferred to Wenatchee and Yakima because of a lack of capacity at the 25-bed hospital – the only hospital in a 50-mile radius – and other closer facilities. “In Ferry County especially, we’re seeing really sick young people showing up in the emergency room to get care,” Northeast Tri County Health Officer Dr. Sam Artzis said, according to The Spokesman-Review. The county previously had relatively few COVID-19 cases, and many in the conservative, rural community saw mask mandates as infringing on their liberty. Less than one-quarter of the county’s residents have received a vaccine to date, according to the health district, but officials said the outbreak has increased interest in it. The situation should serve as a warning to other communities about the danger of large indoor events with unvaccinated people, they said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: Signs featuring the words “Now Hiring” and “Help Wanted” are an increasingly common sight outside restaurants locally, but surprisingly few people are stepping forward and taking those jobs, business owners and hiring managers say. The COVID-19 pandemic put many people out of work as restrictions kept diners out of restaurants. Adjustments such as more drive-thru traffic, deliveries and limited seating helped, but restaurants cut back on wait staff and other employees. Restrictions are starting to relax, but now they are having trouble bringing new employees in. Jamie Null, executive director of the Mercer County Convention & Visitors Bureau, said local restaurants and service industries have been looking for new employees, but they are not receiving many applicants. Some area restaurants are seeing people ask about jobs, but few are taking the next step from applicant to employee. The Corner Shop in downtown Bramwell has been hiring for months, manager Mandy Fink said. She said she believed some of the people who apply but never follow through are listing applications so they can keep receiving unemployment benefits. “Right now, there’s a lot of people who are able to work,” she said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Capitol, closed to the public since late March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, will reopen Monday, Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced Friday. It will be opened for limited hours, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and only on weekdays. Before the pandemic, the building stayed open until 6 p.m. during the week and was also open on weekends. There will be no public tours of the Capitol, but the tour desk will be staffed for visitors to get information. Only one entrance to the building will be open to the public. Capitol staff, including those who work for Evers, lawmakers and the state Supreme Court, have been working out of the building for months. The Legislature has also been holding hearings and floor sessions, which are open to the public. State office buildings that surround the Capitol remain closed, but Evers has said he’s targeting a return to work for many this summer. Republicans have been pushing Evers to move faster to open the offices. As of Friday, more than 43% of people in Wisconsin had received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine, while nearly 34% were fully vaccinated, according to the state Department of Health Services.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Telephone scammers are trying to take advantage of an accidental Wyoming Department of Health data release affecting over a quarter of the state’s population, agency officials said Friday. Scammers request insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or other financial information and in some cases look like they’re calling from state government numbers, department administrator Jeri Hendricks said in a statement. “No one representing the department will ask you for insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or personal financial information. No one representing the department will call you about the breach unless they are returning a call you made to us first,” Hendricks said. The scammers appear to be targeting residents at random and not through access to phone numbers inadvertently released, department spokeswoman Kim Deti said. A department employee working with computer code accidentally posted coronavirus test results as well as associated names, addresses, birth dates and other information on GitHub.com, an internet-based software development platform. The employee released coronavirus plus flu test results for 145,698 Wyoming residents. Also posted were blood alcohol test results for 18,312 people, mainly from Wyoming but also other states, dating to 2012.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/18/community-efforts-navy-ship-prison-changes-news-around-states/111433474/", "title": "Community efforts, a Navy ship: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state is postponing its Republican primary runoff between former U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions and a rival because of the coronavirus, the governor announced Wednesday. The runoff between Sessions and former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville will now be held July 14, Gov. Kay Ivey said. The winner of the GOP runoff will face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in November. The delay also affects primary runoffs for state and local races. “We would be taking a human health risk just by having people stand in line waiting to vote,” Ivey said. “I’m also aware that our faithful poll workers are often retired, and many among those have the highest risk.” Alabama has 46 confirmed case of coronavirus, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health, which has cautioned that the number of people carrying the virus is probably higher.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Norwegian musher Thomas Waerner easily won the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, one of the few U.S. sporting events not canceled by concerns about the new coronavirus. Waerner crossed the finish line in Nome, Alaska, early Wednesday morning. “This is awesome,” he told reporters at the finish line. “This is something special.” It took him 9 days, 10 hours, 37 minutes and 47 seconds to travel nearly 1,000 miles across Alaska. Waerner immediately thanked the 10 dogs in harness, petting and rubbing each, ending his with lead dogs, K2 and Bark. Then each dog got a snack. Fans didn’t employ social distancing as they poured out of bars and hotels to cheer Waerner as he drove the team off the Bering Sea ice and down Front Street to the finish line under the famed burled arch. He will earn a minimum of $50,000 and a new pickup truck for winning the race.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Inmates in the state’s prisons are being offered free soap and are no longer routinely being moved between prison complexes in the latest efforts to guard against the risks of the coronavirus. The Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry also announced a requirement Wednesday that all employees entering prisons undergo a check for infectious disease symptoms. The agency had previously suspended visitation at state prisons and a $4 copayment on inmates who seek medical help for cold and flu symptoms. Meanwhile, Phoenix and Tucson joined Flagstaff on Tuesday in ordering bars, gyms and other indoor facilities to close immediately and restaurants to offer to-go service only in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The closures came as state health officials identified three more coronavirus cases, including the first two on the Arizona portion of the Navajo reservation in Navajo County. The Navajo Nation, a sovereign tribal government, already had declared an emergency on the reservation, closed tribal parks and limited travel for tribal employees.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor announced new financial assistance for people and businesses affected by the coronavirus outbreak, including a temporary waiver of the state’s work requirement for food stamps. Gov. Asa Hutchinson ordered the changes Wednesday as Arkansas saw its coronavirus cases rise from 22 to 33, its largest single-day increase. Hutchinson says the new assistance will include loans for some mid-sized businesses and incentives for child care providers to remain open. Hutchinson on Tuesday had announced he was also easing restrictions on seeking unemployment.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom’s assessment that it’s likely “few if any” California schools will reopen before summer break surprised parents, who wondered Wednesday how distance learning would work. Some parents are making their children get up at the same hour as if they are in school and have a scheduled day of online learning. Others are taking advantage of the online resources provided by school districts, like “Skype with a scientist” offered by the San Diego Unified School District and virtual tours through museums worldwide. While urging Californians to stay united and promising that “we will get back to the life that we have lived,” Newsom also acknowledged that much is unknown, and so the state is preparing for frightening worst-case scenarios. The California National Guard is on alert for potential duties that include humanitarian missions like ensuring proper food distribution and public safety as some grocery stores resorted to rationing to control panic-buying. Newsom said the state is acquiring two vacant hospitals to beef up capacity as it faces the possibility of a surge of hospital patients. California also is negotiating with about 900 hotels to acquire tens of thousands of rooms that could be used for hospital patients and for the homeless, a group particularly susceptible to coronavirus.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A relief fund and child care program have been created for state residents facing challenges from the coronavirus, Gov. Jared Polis announced Wednesday. Polis also said it’s unlikely that many public school districts will stay open or that ones that have been closed would reopen this school year. To date, the state is allowing individual districts to decide whether to stay open, but distance learning is being encouraged. Denver and some other districts have suspended classes. The state human services department and Office of Early Childhood are coordinating efforts to create an emergency child care system to help an estimated 80,000 first responders, health care workers and others whose jobs are essential during the pandemic and who have young children. Dubbed the Colorado Emergency Childcare Collaborative, the public-private effort is seeking applicants who can help. An effort called Help Colorado Now is designed to assist people who lost work because of business closures and economic disruptions or face other virus-caused hardships.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials are trying to speed up the certification of new nurses and urging retired nurses to come back to work to help handle the state’s anticipated spike in patients afflicted with the coronavirus. “We need you. And we’re gonna (look) to you over the next two, three, five, six weeks,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday. “So please reach out to your former hospital where you were. We need you to be able to step back.” While the state now has close to 70 diagnosed cases, State Epidemiologist Matthew Cartter warned many more are expected in the coming weeks. “Really, this is just starting to move across (the state). This is the beginning of this,” he said, noting that doctors and nurses at hospitals in the western part of the state are already working around the clock in facilities full of patients with many other ailments. Cartter said 26 patients are currently hospitalized in Connecticut with the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The number of new coronavirus cases in the state has doubled following a hospital system’s drive-thru testing event. The Division of Public Health announced eight new positive cases Tuesday, bringing the statewide total to 16. Seven of the new cases involved New Castle County residents, with the other being the first reported case in Sussex County. One of the New Castle County residents is hospitalized. The others are self-isolating at home. Officials said six of the seven New Castle County residents participated in the ChristianaCare Health System’s drive-thru testing event Friday, when 536 people were tested. Officials are awaiting more results from that event. Authorities said the Sussex County resident had travel-related exposure, but the exposure sources of the other individuals is still under investigation as the state and others confronts the global outbreak of the new coronavirus strain. Meanwhile, the Delaware Department of Labor said Tuesday that it is expanding unemployment benefits to workers affected by the virus who would otherwise not typically qualify for benefits.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Volunteers are banding together to help people in some of D.C.’s most underserved communities during the coronavirus pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. Samantha Davis, who founded the Black Swan Academy, said she asked herself, “How are people going to eat? How can people get health care? How are people going to get to work?” Davis desperately worked to find answers to her questions the moment the coronavirus hit the district, she said, and while local governments across the D.C. area are all doing something to address people’s concerns, “it’s never enough. ... That’s the role that I play along with other organizers and community folk throughout the city.” A coalition of organizations and community members also launched a hotline as a part of the D.C. Mutual Aid Network to help create a rapid response to some of their neighbors’ most pressing needs. The group has stations set up throughout neighborhoods and schools east of the Anacostia River where people in need can get food, toiletries and hand sanitizer. Volunteers will also deliver items if people are not able to leave their homes or pick up those lacking transportation.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Health officials are deploying three field hospitals statewide as Florida’s number of infected with coronavirus jumped by nearly half with possibly two deaths tied to the disease at a Fort Lauderdale nursing home. Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz announced in an email Tuesday night that one field hospital is currently staged in Orlando and can be sent to other areas if needed as the pandemic spreads. Another is on its way to Broward County, which has 80 infected people, more than a quarter of the state’s confirmed cases. Mobile COVID-19 testing also is being implemented in Broward, and the National Guard has been deployed to assist there. The third field hospital will be set up in Ocala, north of Orlando, and moved elsewhere as needed. Moskowitz said he’s also working with federal officials to determine whether the state can add U.S. Navy Mercy-class hospital ships at Florida ports. Officials said more than 310 people test positive for COVID-19, including 21 out-of-state residents who tested positive in Florida and six Florida residents who tested positive elsewhere, according to the state’s dashboard. Six deaths have been reported in Florida.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Coronavirus infections were blamed for two new deaths in southwest Georgia on Wednesday, bringing the state’s total death toll to three. Officials at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany said in a news relase that two patients had died from the virus. The hospital is in Dougherty County, one of the hardest-hit Georgia counties outside metro Atlanta. “The entire Phoebe Family is saddened to learn of the first COVID-19 deaths in our area,” said Dr. Steven Kitchens, the Albany hospital’s chief medical officer. “Unfortunately, more deaths are likely to occur, and we will certainly see more positive cases as we receive more test results.” Georgia has 197 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, the Georgia Department of Public Health reported Wednesday. Its latest numbers did not include the two new deaths.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Tuesday encouraged visitors to postpone their island vacations for at least the next 30 days as the state tries to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Ige announced the plea along with a directive that all bars and clubs close and that restaurants shift to serving food through drive-thru, takeout and delivery service. He called on gatherings to be limited to a maximum of 10 people. “The actions I’m announcing today may seem extreme to some of you, and we know that it will have negative effects to our economy,” Ige said. “But we are confident that taking aggressive actions now will allow us to have a quicker recovery when this crisis is over.” Hawaii welcomed 10 million visitors last year, an all-time record. Tourism is the engine of the state’s economy, accounting for nearly one-fifth of local jobs. To date, Hawaii has recorded 14 positive cases of the new coronavirus. Officials have closed schools and facilities and postponed events to prevent the disease from spreading widely in the community and overwhelming the health care system.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Wednesday announced stricter guidelines for social interactions to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. The Republican governor said the state was adopting federal guidelines that include avoiding social gatherings of more than 10 people. The guidelines also call for not eating or drinking in bars, restaurants and food courts but allow for drive-thru or pickup options. Little also recommended avoiding discretionary travel and shopping. The goal, he said, is to slow the spread so that health care facilities aren’t overwhelmed and to protect the elderly and people with health conditions, who are more susceptible. Health officials say nine people in Idaho have now tested positive, and two are hospitalized. State epidemiologist Christine Hahn said they didn’t know if any of the nine cases involved community spread, a serious escalation in that it would mean someone hadn’t traveled out of their community and didn’t know how they came in contact with the virus.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Operations at Midway International Airport remained limited Wednesday, a day after federal authorities closed the control tower after technicians tested positive for the coronavirus. The city’s second-largest airport was open, but the Federal Aviation Administration said the air traffic control tower was still closed for cleaning. According to the city’s Department of Aviation, 337 flights had been canceled over the prior 24 hours at Midway out of 527 total planned flights. By early afternoon Wednesday, 26 flights were listed as delayed. “We’re working with the FAA to resume normal operations as quickly and safely as possible which ultimately means having the tower back in service,” the Department of Aviation said in a statement. “Given this reality, and for their own business and network reasons, the airlines are making the decision to cancel many flights.” Travelers are being encouraged to check with their airline about flight schedules.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local restaurants are suffering the worst crisis they’ve ever faced, yet the industry is stepping up to help others by establishing neighborhood food markets, offering free meals to those in need and funneling resources to suddenly out-of-work food-service employees. A few hours after Gov. Eric J. Holcomb ordered all restaurants to cease dine-in service through the end of March to help slow down the spread of coronavirus, restaurant owners and workers gathered Monday at Liter House restaurant and brainstormed not just how to save their businesses but also how to help the communities they serve. Establishments started rolling out efforts by Tuesday afternoon. Joella’s announced it would give kids 10 and younger free meals 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. The restaurant also offers complimentary catering to hospitals and health care facilities near its locations. At Liter House, owners transformed the banquet room and rear barbecue hall into a mini food depot where staff packs groceries for curbside pickup. “It’s like the reusing of the factories in World War II, like they repurposed those,” said Ed Sahm, founder and CEO at Sahm’s restaurant group, which owns Liter House. “We have an army of people, and we have a bunch of equipment. Let’s feed people.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A man has removed the books from the little free library he erected at his home and replaced them with newly treasured items: toilet paper, wet wipes and medical gloves. After Bob Meeley stocked those mundane products – much-sought-after as the coronavirus spreads and people heed officials’ advice to stay home – he posted the location last week on the neighborhood app Nextdoor. Several items had been taken and replaced within two days, he said. “I don’t care who you are, where you’re from, or what you’re taking and why – it’s none of my business as long as it helps,” Meeley said. His goal is for others with little free libraries to fill them with supplies that other people can’t get due to shortages. Meeley knows what it feels like to need help: He and his family were temporarily displaced in 2008 when their home was flooded by the Raccoon River. “I know the feeling intimately, the sort of helplessness you can feel, and here’s something I can control at least from the baseline that we have, and we’ll see if it takes root,” he said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly has ordered financial institutions to temporarily suspend business and residential evictions to help those financially affected by the spread of the coronavirus. The executive order signed by Kelly on Tuesday says the action will allow Kansans to “retain their homes and businesses to avoid immediate danger to their health, safety and welfare.” Financial institutions were ordered to suspend initiating mortgage foreclosure or judicial proceedings and commercial or residential evictions until May 1. The order was not announced by Kelly or her office, and the governor did not mention it during a news conference Tuesday, during which she required all the state’s K-12 schools to close and move lessons online for the rest of the spring semester. On Monday, she banned all gatherings of 50 or more people. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Kansas doubled on Tuesday to at least 18, with one death.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear has ordered the closure of theaters, gyms, hair salons and many other businesses where people gather, taking new action in a bid to contain the new coronavirus. Beshear’s order exempts a cross-section of businesses that will be allowed to stay open. The exempted list includes grocery stores, banks, pharmacies, health care facilities, gas stations, hardware stores and hotels. The governor acknowledged the latest closures will disrupt daily lives but said it’s necessary to deter the virus and protect the most vulnerable people. “These are all places that people congregate, and it’s another step that we have to take to make sure that everybody’s sacrifice works,” Beshear said. Kentucky’s K-12 schools shut down for at least two weeks at the governor’s request. He signaled Tuesday that schools may remain closed longer than that. “We ought to be prepared to go longer than that,” he said. “I would ask everybody to begin to make the preparations.” Twenty-six virus cases have been reported in Kentucky, the governor said in his daily update Tuesday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three more area residents have died from the coronavirus, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Wednesday, bringing the state’s death toll to seven as the number of positive cases in Louisiana rose above 250. The epicenter of the virus in Louisiana remains the New Orleans region, with most of the positive tests and all of the state’s deaths. Four of the people who died from the virus were residents of a retirement home, Lambeth House, which has seen a cluster of cases. Two of the victims announced Wednesday, aged 98 and 92, were residents there, Edwards said. The third was from the New Orleans suburb of Jefferson Parish, the governor said. But increased testing showed the COVID-19 disease also had reached the capital, Baton Rouge, according to the Louisiana Department of Health. Positive tests for the virus statewide jumped to 257, up from 196 a day earlier. Edwards warned the numbers likely will “jump tremendously” within 36 hours as testing ramps up statewide. “I want people to be prepared for this,” the governor said. “It is going to get much worse before it gets better.” Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor, said Louisiana has the third-highest rate of COVID-19 cases per capita in the nation.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The state’s provider of family planning services is taking steps to make sure patients don’t see an interruption in birth control prescriptions while much of the state enters shutdown mode. Maine Family Planning has 18 clinics in the state and serves thousands of residents. The nonprofit said Tuesday that it’s extending birth control services for three months. The move will make sure people maintain access, limit unnecessary office visits and potentially help avert a “baby boom,” representatives for the group said. “We wanted to accommodate our patients. For women and families, there’s already enough anxiety, so the idea that you can’t get access to birth control is just too much,” Maine Family Planning vice president of program services Evelyn Kieltyka said. There’s precedent for an unexpected stretch of isolation at home leading to a spike in births, the Bangor Daily News reports. Such a bump happened in Maine and New Hampshire after the 1998 ice storm that shut down parts of the Northeast.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The House of Delegates passed the state’s $48 billion budget Tuesday with added money to deal with the new coronavirus. The House voted 126-8 for the state’s spending plan for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. Approving a balanced budget for the next fiscal year is a requirement of the General Assembly’s annual session. It had been scheduled to end April 6, but legislative leaders instead set Wednesday for adjournment. Del. Maggie McIntosh, a Baltimore Democrat who chairs the House budget committee, said the budget has a $231 million fund balance, about $105 million higher than the spending plan had when Gov. Larry Hogan submitted it in January. “We’ve also again, I want to reiterate, left nearly $1.4 billion to protect against economic uncertainty,” McIntosh said. Del. Kathy Szeliga, a Republican who is the House minority whip, described the budget as “fiscally prudent and socially responsible.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The area’s transit system is again revising schedules to ensure that workers at hospitals, government offices and food distribution facilities can easily get to work during the coronavirus pandemic. Starting Wednesday, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority added additional Blue Line service in the morning and additional Green Line E Branch capacity in response to crowding Tuesday, the first day of the agency’s revised schedule. The MBTA also added service on some key bus routes Wednesday. The Green Line serves the Longwood medical area in Boston. “We recognize that some employees in key industries, including those in the medical community, rely on the MBTA to get to their places of work, and we’re committed to providing service to those folks who rely on the T,” General Manager Steve Poftak said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Fiat Chrysler factory that makes pickup trucks and employs thousands of people was shut down for cleaning Wednesday in suburban Detroit after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus. The U.S. and Canada, meanwhile, agreed to temporarily close their shared border to nonessential travel, although truck drivers carrying goods between countries are exempt. Buses were back on the road in Detroit, a day after drivers stayed home because of virus fears. Rides are free, and passengers enter and exit through the side-rear door, steps that greatly limit contact with drivers. An average of 85,000 people ride the buses each day. “I feel comfortable now,” said driver Wayne Clayton, who wears a mask. “It’s certainly an important job. We’ve got to get people to work.” In Sterling Heights, Fiat Chrysler sent evening shift workers home Tuesday. Work resumed early Wednesday before the company closed the factory again for deep cleaning “out of an abundance of caution.” The plant employs 7,271 hourly workers. Michigan has at least 65 COVID-19 cases.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A long-term care hospital will be converted into a treatment center for coronavirus patients in order to keep infected patients out of other hospitals. M Health Fairview cut operations in half at Bethesda hospital this winter for financial reasons but said Tuesday that it will now expand the facility from 50 beds to 90 in order to provide specialty care for COVID-19 patients. The Minnesota Department of Health said Tuesday that 60 residents had tested positive for the virus, but infectious disease director Kris Ehresmann acknowledged the figure is an undercount because not everyone who is infected gets tested. Patients now at Bethesda will be transferred this week to other hospitals or skilled-nursing homes, the Star Tribune reports. Bethesda will have 35 intensive-care beds and ventilators, officials said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s jails are not prepared to handle a coronavirus outbreak, and judges should consider releasing people who are waiting for trial on nonviolent crimes but cannot afford to post bail, a human rights attorney said. Cliff Johnson is director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi law school. The center tracks jail and prison conditions, and it released new figures Wednesday showing a continued pattern of thousands of people remaining in Mississippi jails for months because they cannot afford to post bail. The state reported 34 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Wednesday, though there was no indication any were in jails. Nonetheless, Johnson said jails could become more dangerous as the new virus spreads. “Mississippi sheriffs will be the first to tell you that they don’t have the expertise or the resources to deal with a pandemic like COVID-19,” Johnson said Wednesday. In some jails, inmates sleep in “open bay” settings, with multiple beds in a single large room.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A man in his 40s who recently traveled abroad is the 16th person in the state to test positive for the coronavirus, health officials said. The man is doing well and is in isolation at his home, while his family is in quarantine, Jackson County health officials announced late Tuesday. It was the second case in the county that includes Kansas City. Missouri health officials have reported cases of COVID-19 in Boone, Cass, Cole, Greene, Henry, Jackson and St. Louis counties, as well as one case in the city of St. Louis. In a statement to The Kansas City Star, Cerner spokeswoman Misti Preston said the company asked anyone who had contact with the individual to self-quarantine and closed its sprawling campus in south Kansas City for deep cleaning. Cerner, a health care technology company, has 14,000 employees on campuses in the Kansas City region.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two men from Gallatin County have tested positive for coronavirus, the governor’s office said Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases of the respiratory illness in the state to 11. They will be isolated or quarantined adhering to public health guidelines, officials said. Others who came into close contact with the people will be monitored for 14 days for fever and respiratory symptoms per CDC guidance. The newest cases were announced Wednesday morning by Gov. Steve Bullock after the tests were performed by the Department of Public Health and Human Services Public Health Laboratory. One of the confirmed cases is a Montana woman who tested positive in Maryland. She had reportedly left the state in November. The DPHHS says 30 people have been monitored, and of those, four remain under monitoring.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: After more cases of COVID-19 were reported in the state, including a doctor, Omaha-area health officials took steps Wednesday to further limit gatherings to try stop the virus’s spread. The Douglas County Board of Health issued an order limiting gatherings within the county, which includes Omaha, to no more than 10 people. The order also says a venue must be large enough for all people in any gathering to be at least 6 feet apart from each other. The order is effective through April 30. It excludes a multitude of businesses, services and situations, such as courts, government operations, airports and public transportation, shopping venues, shelters and households with more than 10 people. Child care facilities, however, are limited to the 10-person order, which calls on law enforcement to ensure compliance.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The governor ordered a monthlong closure of casinos and other nonessential businesses like bars, movie theaters and gyms and told restaurants to shutter their dining rooms and only offer takeout or delivery in order to stem the spread of the new coronavirus. “Today it’s clear additional steps must be taken immediately in order to slow the spread of this deadly virus in our state,” Gov. Steve Sisolak said at a news conference. “We absolutely must take this step for every Nevadan’s health and safety. Please, please take this seriously. … Please stay home for Nevada.” The order from Democrat Steve Sisolak on Tuesday night follows similar moves by more than 10 other governors as states scramble to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19. Sisolak’s order gave thousands of businesses in the tourism capital less than a day to prepare. Though a number of casinos started to close their doors this week, the governor’s sweeping order shutters Nevada’s main industry, anchored by glitzy casinos lining the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: A Vermont man accused of prompting an evacuation Tuesday on a public bus after making claims of having the coronavirus was arrested. David Ladeau, 65, was charged with creating a false public alarm and disorderly conduct in New Hampshire, WPTZ reports. Lebanon police said the Hartford resident was telling bus riders he “was infected with coronavirus” Tuesday. His statements caused a number of people to call the police, according to his arrest warrant. Riders were evacuated shortly after, but the bus company said Ladeau refused to get off. It is unclear if Ladeau has actually tested positive for the virus. “He created a situation where, you know, people were extremely upset and fearful, causing a bus service to stop and be delayed for people to evacuate,” police chief Richard Mello said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The coronavirus outbreak has claimed two more lives in the state, bringing the total number of deaths to five, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. His announcement came on the first day students across the state were staying home as statewide school closures went into effect. Murphy repeated his ban on gatherings or events featuring more than 50 people and stressed that includes private gatherings. Murphy ordered the school closures Monday, though many schools already were ordering students to stay home. Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said the state had identified 260 additional hospital beds that would be available Wednesday, the majority in the northern half of the state, where most of the positive cases are centered. Murphy said drive-thru testing would begin in Bergen County, the state’s hardest-hit area, by Friday, and testing in Holmdel, Monmouth County, is expected to begin next week.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state has qualified for a federal disaster loan assistance program aimed at helping small businesses affected by the COVID-19 public health emergency, state officials said Tuesday. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the Small Business Administration’s loan program is one of several tools that can help businesses, many of which have seen rapid declines in customer traffic and sales over the past week as officials have encouraged people to stay home in order to limit the spread of the virus. “We are dedicated to assisting every business that we can to endure the significant hardship this emergency has already caused,” the governor said. State labor officials also announced that employees at businesses that close temporarily can access unemployment benefits without having to search for a new position.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship will be sent to New York to relieve pressure on hospitals bracing for an expected surge in coronavirus patients, officials announced Wednesday. The USNS Comfort, which was sent to New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, would bolster the health care system by treating non-coronavirus patients while hospitals treat people with COVID-19. The Comfort’s planned deployment comes as New York City-area hospitals are clearing out beds, setting up new spaces to triage patients, and urging people with mild symptoms to consult health professionals by phone or video chat instead of overrunning emergency rooms. The Navy said in a statement that it was “working to complete scheduled maintenance cycles and identify necessary medical staffing to deploy as soon as possible.” It’s not clear when it would arrive. Virus cases in the state topped 2,300 Wednesday, with at least 20 deaths.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s power to demand a dine-in prohibition at the state’s restaurants and bars is being challenged by Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Forest. Cooper had announced a new executive order Tuesday with the new customer restrictions, which he said were a painful but necessary action to blunt the intensity of the new coronavirus. Forest, who is running against Cooper in November, said the governor didn’t have the authority to issue the prohibition because he didn’t receive support for it from a majority on the Council of State, comprised of 10 statewide elected officials. A provision in state law gives many additional powers to the governor under a declared emergency with “the concurrence of the Council of State.” A majority of the council voted not to concur, according to Forest, who said the mandate “will devastate our economy, shutter many small businesses and leave many people unemployed.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Department of Health said another case of the new coronavirus is the first evidence of community transmission in North Dakota. The latest case announced Wednesday is a Morton County woman in her 30s who has had no travel history and has had no contact with anyone confirmed to have the disease. It brings the total number of COVID-19 cases in the state to six. Community spread means people are testing positive even though they hadn’t traveled to areas with a high concentration of the virus or knowingly been in contact with someone who has it. “This is the first confirmed case of community transmission in North Dakota, and it reinforces the importance for all North Dakotans to practice social distancing and stay home when you’re sick, even if it’s minor,” Gov. Doug Burgum said in a statement. The health department said as of Wednesday morning 274 people had been tested for the virus, with 268 coming back negative and six positive.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court set a speedy schedule to hear an elections lawsuit filed by the Ohio Democratic Party, while the state said it has received nearly 78,000 unemployment applications in just three days. As of Wednesday the state has more than 65 confirmed cases of the virus, with no reported deaths. Those include a 2-year-old boy in central Ohio and two Ohio State University employees. Meanwhile, the Ohio Supreme Court wants all arguments and counterarguments filed by March 27 in a lawsuit filed by the state’s Democratic Party challenging the decision by Secretary of State Frank LaRose to move the primary to June 2. No time extensions will be granted. The Bernie Sanders campaign has not taken a position on Ohio Democrats’ push for all-mail voting, said state Rep. Mike Skindell, a state co-chair.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of coronavirus cases in the state has risen from 17 to 29, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported Wednesday. State Health Commissioner Gary Cox said Tuesday that more positive cases are expected. Oral Roberts University in Tulsa said an employee of a company with which the university contracts for grounds maintenance tested positive for COVID-19. ORU said the man did not interact with students, his co-workers were sent home, and the shop where he worked and machinery with which he worked has been cleaned. Meanwhile, bars, restaurants and other business in the state’s largest cities, including Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Norman and Stillwater, are being ordered closed by local officials in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Tens of thousands of workers have been laid off, losing income as rent or mortgage payments are due. Small businesses that shut down because of the coronavirus outbreak are at risk of never reopening their doors again. A new committee of the Legislature, which held its inaugural meeting Wednesday, is tasked with finding solutions to these cascading problems affecting so many across the state. Larry Brennan, owner of Arch Rock Brewing Company in Gold Beach, said Gov. Kate Brown’s closure of bars and restaurants for on-site consumption – necessary to slow transmission of the highly contagious COVID-19 virus – meant orders for beer deliveries were canceled. “Without some type of economic relief, we will be unable to make our payroll nor pay outstanding invoices and bills within 30 days,” Brennan wrote to the committee. “We need some help, please.” The panel met as authorities said two more people died of coronavirus, raising the total number to three, the Oregon Health Authority reported Wednesday. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state rose to 75.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Penn State University on Wednesday canceled in-person classes for the rest of the spring semester, citing the coronavirus pandemic, as state officials announced a 40% jump in the number of confirmed cases. Penn State, which enrolls about 100,000 students at 20 campuses, had previously planned to resume live classroom instruction April 6 but said it needed to take more dramatic action “based on on evolving federal guidance and statewide mitigation plans.” Cases confirmed in Pennsylvania exceeded 130 as of Wednesday, rising by 37, according to the Department of Health. Meanwhile, Philadelphia police announced officers will stop taking nonviolent offenders into physical custody. The department said those offenders who are placed under arrest will be released once their identities are confirmed. From there, they’ll be issued the equivalent of a summons. The city’s new police commissioner, Danielle Outlaw, said Wednesday that “the department is not turning a blind eye to crime” and will continue to enforce all laws. Officers will continue to have discretion if they believe the suspect poses a threat to public safety.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Election officials want the state to delay its presidential primary by more than a month because of the coronavirus pandemic. The state Board of Elections on Tuesday voted 6 to 1 to ask Gov. Gina Raimondo to postpone the April 28 primary to June 2. The Democratic governor has expressed skepticism about moving the primary, but her office said she was “open to the idea” following the board’s vote. Democratic Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, who oversees elections, has called for moving to a mail ballot-focused primary. The elections board on Tuesday said moving the primary date would allow officials to better prepare for such an election. The state has recorded more than 20 positive cases of coronavirus.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Public classrooms throughout South Carolina have emptied out in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak – except in the state’s juvenile jail. On Tuesday, Department of Juvenile Justice spokesman Jarid Munsch said instruction remained ongoing in agency-operated classrooms to which more than 6,700 juveniles were admitted during the past calendar year. Earlier this week, Gov. Henry McMaster ordered the immediate closure of all of the state’s public K-12 schools, colleges, universities and technical schools. All of the facilities were planning to provide long-distance learning for the next two weeks at least. But that order doesn’t apply to the Department of Juvenile Justice. Munsch said agency Director Freddie Pough, after conferring with McMaster, had determined educational services were crucial to DJJ’s mission, thereby making the agency’s instructors part of the “essential, or mission-critical,” employees who needed to continue to report to work at the discretion of their agency heads. That determination prompted eight teachers at the agency’s main complex in Columbia to walk off the job on Monday, Munsch said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state’s public health lab has halted COVID-19 testing due to a shortage of supplies, officials announced Wednesday. The lab had to stop this week after running out of supplies both from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from private suppliers. It ran tests for medium- and high-risk patients Monday. The Department of Health said there is “no timeframe” for when tests will be available due to a nationwide shortage of supplies for testing. Two of the largest health care providers in South Dakota indicated Tuesday that they are working to develop testing. The Department of Health recommended people exhibiting symptoms of the coronavirus isolate themselves. The department is still telling physicians to send samples to the lab in Pierre for testing when it becomes available.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Wednesday proposed funneling money into relief for tornado and health crises, scaling back planned teacher raises, and socking more cash away into reserves, as the state reacted to the global impact of the coronavirus on everyday life. The Republican’s administration unveiled the scaled-back budget to lawmakers, who are scrambling to pass the spending plan for the 2020-21 fiscal year and other items they said are “mission critical” before they recess this week and head back to work as soon as June 1. “We are now likely embarking on a recession caused by this rare health pandemic,” state Finance Commissioner Stuart McWhorter told lawmakers. Lee’s latest budget – which has a suggested 0% economic growth rate – creates a $150 million fund “to help us be responsive to health and safety issues resulting from COVID-19” and sets aside $575 million to increase the state’s rainy day fund to $1.45 billion by 2021. At the same time, he is now slashing his original proposed teacher pay increases from 4% to 2% and eliminating a proposed $250 million K-12 mental health trust fund.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A third person in the state who was infected with the coronavirus has died, health officials said Wednesday. Collin County health officials said a 64-year-old man from the Dallas suburb of Plano died Tuesday night at a local hospital. Officials said the positive test was confirmed after the death of the man, who had an underlying health condition. The second death in Texas related to COVID-19 was announced Tuesday. Large Texas cities including Dallas, Houston and Austin have restricted the sizes of gatherings in efforts to fight the virus’s spread. Tarrant County officials said Texas’ second death linked to the virus was a 77-year-old man who lived in a retirement center in the North Texas city of Arlington. On Tuesday, Gov. Greg Abbott activated the Texas National Guard in response to the outbreak, describing it as a “preparative measure.” He said there were no current plans for deployments.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Gary Herbert ordered statewide dine-in closures at restaurants, bars and other eateries Tuesday while health officials in the national parks hot spot of Moab halted new overnight tourists to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. The steps came as the number of statewide cases grew to more than 50. Herbert said he was “very sorry” for the disruption to business and jobs but “convinced this will save many lives.” Restaurants can remain open for takeout, delivery and drive-thru. The statewide order begins Wednesday, following similar steps in Salt Lake City, Park City and other places. Meanwhile, health officials in southeastern Utah issued an order barring anyone except work travelers and locals from overnight lodging, including camping. Those already in hotels before Tuesday night can stay through the duration of their reservation.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: N95 masks, used as protection against coronavirus, are increasingly difficult to procure in Vermont, a state official said this week – and he’s asking businesses to share supplies with health workers. The masks are “urgently needed in our health care facilities,” Ted Bundy, deputy secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, wrote Wednesday in an email to regional business groups. Workers in some manufacturing and construction operations routinely use the N95 face mask to filter out fine, airborne particles. They have been proven effective in lowering the risk of breathing in water droplets that could transmit the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, the health department announced five additional cases of COVID-19 in the state, bringing the total reported cases in Vermont to 17.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s confirmed coronavirus cases rose to more than 75 Wednesday as schools and many businesses remained shuttered and a ban on large gatherings reshaped daily life. Gov. Ralph Northam, who spoke at what has become a daily news conference with other top leaders, did not announce any new restrictions in Virginia’s fight against the global pandemic. Across Virginia, much of the state’s workforce has been encouraged to work from home, and state officials have asked anyone 65 or older or anyone with chronic health conditions to self-quarantine. “This is a very stressful and concerning time for every Virginian,” Northam said. “It is likely to remain so for some time.” Virginia Health Commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver said he expected the number of positive cases of COVID-19 to continue increasing. Virginia has had two deaths so far. Among the cases are three “outbreaks,” which health officials define as two or more cases that can be traced to a common exposure, Oliver said. Two outbreaks are in Richmond and the third is in James City County.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Staff members who worked while sick at multiple long-term care facilities contributed to the spread of COVID-19 among vulnerable elderly in the Seattle area, federal health officials said Wednesday. At least 30 coronavirus deaths have been linked to Life Care Center in Kirkland. A report Wednesday from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided the most detailed account to date of what drove the outbreak. Public health authorities who surveyed long-term care facilities in the area found they didn’t have enough personal protective equipment or other items such as alcohol-based hand sanitizer. They also said nursing homes in the area are vulnerable because staff members worked with symptoms, worked in more than one facility, and sometimes didn’t know about or follow recommendations about protecting their eyes or being careful while in close contact with ill patients. Nursing home officials also were slow to think symptoms might be caused by coronavirus and faced problems from limited testing ability, according to the report.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State election officials on Wednesday said they are expanding vote-by-mail options to increase primary election turnout in response to concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Secretary of State Mac Warner said his office will “ramp up” the absentee ballot system to allow people who are worried about getting the virus to cast their votes by mail in the May 12 primary. He encouraged voters to apply for an absentee ballot on the secretary of state’s website as soon as possible. “These are unprecedented times,” Warner said. The move comes after a legal opinion from Attorney General Patrick Morrisey that found absentee balloting can be broadened during a state of emergency. Gov. Jim Justice on Tuesday announced West Virginia had its first resident test positive for the virus. The person in Jefferson County has been voluntarily quarantined since first showing symptoms, according to local health officials who said they are reviewing the person’s contacts to trace the spread of the virus.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Policymakers scrambled Wednesday to help displaced workers, shuttered bars and restaurants, and others reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic, even as new limitations were placed on child care facilities and the number of confirmed cases in the state topped 100, including a children’s hospital doctor. Gov. Tony Evers ordered that child care settings have no more than 10 staffers and 50 children present at the same time. Providers were asked to prioritize families of health care and essential service providers. The restrictions take effect Thursday at 8 a.m. and are to remain in place indefinitely. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported Wednesday that 106 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in 14 counties. There was community spread – where officials can’t trace how or where a person caught the disease – in Milwaukee, Dane and Kenosha counties. Community spread is one factor that is expected to continue to drive the numbers even higher.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Airlines are wrapping up winter-season flights to Jackson Hole weeks earlier than usual due to the new coronavirus. During ski season, Jackson Hole Airport sees regular flights from a dozen major cities. The flights continue until Jackson Hole Mountain Resort closes in the first week of April. This year, the resort and two others in northwest Wyoming – Grand Targhee resort and Snow King Resort – have shut down early amid spread of the COVID-19 virus. Along with the ski shutdowns that began Monday, airlines are cutting back service early, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Meanwhile, the number of people testing positive for the COVID-19 virus in Wyoming has reached 15. And two men recently broke into a Douglas hospital to steal protective masks. They also tried to steal gloves and toilet paper, the Casper Star-Tribune reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/22/art-incarceration-glacial-melt-hurt-fly-news-around-states/40684481/", "title": "Art against incarceration, glacial melt that could hurt a fly: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: It’s inevitable that a disease that is always fatal to whitetail deer will spread to the state, a top conservation official says, and the effects it will have economically, culturally and even medically are unfathomable. Chronic wasting disease is likely “three to five years” from showing up in the state, says Chuck Sykes, director of the Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Hunting generates $1.8 billion in annual economic impact in Alabama, according to the Hunting Heritage Foundation. And whitetail deer are the most popular game animal in the state, according to the state conservation department. Firearms deer season opens Saturday and runs through Feb. 10. Sykes predicts CWD “will be brought here” by “that negligent, uncaring hunter who harvests a deer out of state and doesn’t take the time to properly handle the carcass.”\n\nAlaska\n\nNorth Pole: Seasonal ice park officials, missing a crucial ingredient, have announced the closure of a Christmas-themed park amid lack of ice in the area. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports Executive Director Keith Fye says the annual ice park called Christmas in Ice was canceled for the first time in the city of North Pole. Fye cited winter conditions including not having enough ice on ponds to harvest for ice carving this year. Officials say the winter ice park is located next to the Santa Claus House east of Fairbanks and normally runs for six weeks through December. Fye says this would have been the 14th year. Officials say the park features Christmas-themed ice sculptures, ice slides, hot cocoa and an annual visit from Santa Claus.\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: An apartment development with no parking for its expected 1,000 residents – the first of its kind in the nation – is planned across from a light-rail station in the city. The $140 million development will have scooters, bicycles and some ride-sharing cars. It also has plans to offer residents of the 636 apartments deals on light rail, buses, and rides with Uber or Lyft. Developers of the complex called Culdesac Tempe, scheduled to open next fall, say it will be the first car-less apartments built in the U.S. The development wouldn’t be entirely parking-free: There would be guest spaces on site for visitors and parking for the development’s commercial retail. The Development Review Commission will vote next month on a zoning map amendment and development plan review for the first phase of the project.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Several state universities have reported a drop in international student enrollment. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville indicates its international student population is down about 2% from 1,461 in fall 2017 to 1,433 in 2018. Southern Arkansas University’s data shows its international student population declined by about 46% in the 2018-2019 academic year from 730 students in 2017-2018. The Institute of International Education’s annual Open Doors report shows a dip in international students in undergraduate and graduate programs across the country. The downturn is a worry for universities that rely on tuition from foreign students, who are typically charged higher rates. Some U.S. schools have blamed President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric for driving students away, but State Department officials dismissed the idea.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The teenager who shot five classmates, killing two, at a Southern California high school used an unregistered “ghost gun,” Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva says. Villanueva told media outlets that 16-year-old Nathaniel Tennosuke Berhow’s .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol was assembled from gun parts and did not have a serial number. Berhow pulled the gun from his backpack Nov. 14 in an open-air quad at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita and in 16 seconds shot five students at random. At one point, the gun jammed, but he quickly cleared it and continued shooting. Berhow counted his rounds, Villanueva has said, saving the last bullet for himself. Sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Dean of the homicide bureau said in a statement that authorities do not know who assembled the pistol or bought its components.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: The state’s top water quality official says wastewater from two slaughterhouses in the city violated safety limits for five years straight as it flowed into a South Platte River tributary. State Water Quality Division Director Patrick Pfaltzgraff tells KMGH-TV that Swift Beef Co. started meeting its discharge permit standards in January. Swift – part of the world’s largest meat-processing corporation, Brazil-based JBS S.A. – has not been fined. Pfaltzgraff says a review of how the case was handled is underway. A lawsuit against Swift filed by two advocacy groups alleges 3 million to 4 million gallons of wastewater discharged daily into Lone Tree Creek exceeded limits for ammonia, nitrogen and suspended solids from 2014 to 2018.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A new report shows nearly half of households in the state have an income that’s insufficient to cover their basic needs. The Connecticut Self-Sufficiency Standard Report, released by the Connecticut Office of Health Care Strategy and state Comptroller Kevin Lembo, finds that 44% to 48% of Connecticut households are below the self-sufficiency standard. It also finds that 25% of those are in Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven and Waterbury. The amount necessary to cover basic needs such as child care, housing, food and health care can vary greatly by family type and geography. The report finds a single adult in Hartford needs $22,398, while a single adult in Stamford needs $37,703. For a household with two adults and two young children, it ranges from $63,896 in Windham to $99,668 in Stamford.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state has teamed up with Google to help people seeking treatment for opioid addiction. Words related to the opioid crisis are searched for in Delaware more than in any other state. But the top set of results won’t lead to local information or someone who can help. Google is trying to change that. It will curate an information box for people searching for addiction treatment. It will include a hotline as well as a link to information specific to Delaware, which is the first state to team up with Google as well as the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids. The initiative comes at a time when the state is on pace to match last year’s record-setting death toll of 400 fatal overdoses.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A driver tried to get into the White House complex early Thursday by following an official vehicle through an external checkpoint, according to the Secret Service. The Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit of the D.C. police department and the Secret Service responded to the suspicious vehicle near the White House about 6 a.m. Thursday after the driver tried to illegally gain entry to the White House complex, WUSA-TV reports. The vehicle, later identified as a Mercedes with Texas plates, was stopped, and the individual was taken into custody by Secret Service, the agency confirmed. The vehicle has amassed more than $1,300 worth of tickets since Oct. 10, most issued near the White House, according to DMV records.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A man accused of molesting a child and possession of child pornography could go free after a judge found that a detective lied to obtain a search warrant in the case. The Tampa Bay Times reports Circuit Judge William Burgess III found Pinellas County Sheriff’s Detective Michael Alvarez engaged in a “ruse” to obtain a search warrant for a crime used to obtain evidence to prosecute for other crimes. Burgess concluded the “likely effect of this order” is that charges against 63-year-old James Rybicki will be dismissed. Rybicki was arrested following a 2016 search of his home. Detectives found videos of him inappropriately touching a child. Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said the detective left the department two years ago. Defense attorney Lucas Fleming called the judge’s decision “extraordinary.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city is searching for artists to design two street murals in the West End as part of its Placemaking Program, which works to transform city streets and public spaces into cultural areas. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the murals will sit at the intersections of White Street and Joseph E. Lowery Boulevard and White Street and Hopkins Street in southwest Atlanta. Artists must submit proposals to the Department of City Planning, the Mayor’s Office of Cultural Affairs and the West End Neighborhood Development. The selected artists will be awarded $2,000 each for their design. For full details on the project, artists can view the request for proposals packet. The deadline to submit a proposal is noon Dec. 6.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A U.S. Marine Corps plan to install a steel barrier to protect part of a local training facility from beach erosion has raised concerns among neighbors and advocates. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports residents near Ewa Beach are seeking further study of the environmental impact of a proposed 1,500-foot barrier. The Marines say modifications are needed at the Puuloa Range Training Facility to protect the training range shoreline from erosion. Democratic U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz called on the Marines on Tuesday to review the environmental impact of its plan to build the retaining wall. A change.org petition signed by more than 1,100 people as of Tuesday seeks a thorough environmental impact statement analysis beyond the less robust environmental assessment already conducted.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal appeals court has ruled that a Philadelphia-based agribusiness company that left millions of tons of toxic waste on tribal land in eastern Idaho must pay the tribes nearly $20 million plus $1.5 million annually. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday upheld a lower court ruling against FMC Corp. involving a now-shuttered Idaho plant that turned phosphate into fertilizer. FMC for about 50 years up to 2001 operated the fertilizer plant that produced 22 million tons of waste stored on the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes Fort Hall Indian Reservation. The company contended it wasn’t obligated to pay the $1.5 million annual permit fee to the tribes for storing the waste after closing the plant. The tribes say the money will be used for monitoring and cleanup at the site.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Wednesday ordered the state’s public schools to immediately restrict the use of isolation rooms for students who don’t pose a clear safety risk. The Democrat said he directed the Illinois State Board of Education to issue emergency rules governing so-called timeout rooms after a published report found tens of thousands of instances in which schools secluded students without proper justification. State law allows for students to be placed in “isolated timeout” if they pose safety risks to themselves or others. They’re also known as “calming,” “reflection” or “quiet” rooms. But an investigation by the Chicago Tribune and ProPublica published Tuesday examined more than 20,000 records and found children often described as crying, screaming, begging to be released, ramming their heads into padded walls and prying at doors.\n\nIndiana\n\nGoshen: A northern Indiana hospital has alerted more than 1,000 surgery patients who may have been exposed to hepatitis, HIV and other infectious diseases due to a sterilization failure. Goshen Hospital leaders said in a letter to patients that between April 1 and Sept. 30, a sterilization technician failed to complete one crucial step in the sterilizing process of surgical equipment. The hospital says the risk of infection is low. It is offering free testing for patients to determine if they were infected. Patient Lori Deboard told WSBT-TV that she’s scared of the risk, regardless of how low the hospital says it is. The hospital hasn’t announced any disciplinary action against the sterilization technician and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State Supreme Court Justice David Wiggins will serve as chief justice until a successor to Mark Cady can be appointed. Cady died unexpectedly Nov. 15 at age 66. A court spokesman said Thursday that Iowa law requires the chief justice to name another member of the court to fill in when the chief cannot act. Cady had issued an order in November 2016 appointing Wiggins to act in his place. Wiggins was appointed to the court by Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack in 2003. State law says Wiggins will serve as acting chief justice until the current vacancy on the court is filled and the full court selects a chief justice. Finding a successor for Cady could take 90 days. The court’s elected chief will serve until the court holds its first meeting in 2021 and holds another election.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A persistent buzz about Mike Pompeo stepping down as the top U.S. diplomat to run for an open Senate seat in his home state has built to a roar as impeachment hearings into President Donald Trump have intensified scrutiny of the State Department. The U.S. secretary of state was in Brussels on Wednesday, brushing off questions about the impeachment inquiry and dismissing speculation about how long he’ll stay in Trump’s administration. Against the backdrop of impeachment, strain has set in between Trump and Pompeo. And Republicans already have speculated for months that Pompeo will resign to run for the Senate. Enthusiasm from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and others regarding such a move has not cooled. Many Republicans still see Pompeo as their best candidate for preventing the race from becoming competitive in a state where a Democrat hasn’t won a Senate seat since 1932.\n\nKentucky\n\nHenderson: Federal officials plan to announce a new national wildlife refuge in western Kentucky. A statement from the U.S. Department of the Interior says Secretary David Bernhardt and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell will join other dignitaries Friday in Henderson to announce the Green River National Wildlife Refuge. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the ceremony will take place on the first 10-acre tract of what will eventually to be a 24,000-acre refuge. The area offers habitat for a variety of plants, animals, birds and fish, as well as outdoor recreation opportunities for visitors. It is the second such refuge that is located solely in Kentucky.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards has sketched out the broad outlines of his agenda for a second term, proposing new investments in education and transportation. The Democratic incumbent says his top priority will be new dollars for early childhood education, an issue he frequently cited as he campaigned. Edwards also says he’ll continue to seek K-12 teacher pay raises and boosted spending on public colleges, building on increases he and lawmakers adopted this year. He says he’ll propose to spend some state surplus dollars on transportation and coastal protection projects. And he says he’d oppose any efforts to roll back taxes if that could destabilize Louisiana’s budget. Several Republican lawmakers are pushing for tax decreases. Edwards spoke Thursday at his first news conference since winning reelection, defeating Republican challenger Eddie Rispone.\n\nMaine\n\nManchester: A state trooper made a wise move in rescuing a jeopardized owl who managed to fly to safety after the assistance. The Maine State Police says Trooper Sam Tlumac found the disoriented owl Nov. 15 in the middle of a much-traveled road in Manchester, not far from the state capital, Augusta. Tlumac took the owl to a nearby fire department and consulted with a warden, who said the bird might’ve been stunned by a car. Police said in a Facebook post that Tlumac then “had to bring a person to jail (unrelated to the owl)” but returned to check on the bird and found it doing much better. He then took the owl outside, where it took flight to trees in the area.\n\nMaryland\n\nLuke: An environmental nonprofit says a shuttered paper mill is leaking a toxic sludge into the Potomac River. The Baltimore Sun reports the Potomac Riverkeeper Network says the 131-year-old Luke facility has been fouling the river with black liquor, a paper-making byproduct the state considers a renewable energy source. It can fuel mill operations. The Environmental Integrity Project, on behalf of Riverkeeper, notified owner Verso Corp. on Tuesday that Riverkeeper plans to sue under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The act requires such a notice be issued 90 days before filing a lawsuit in federal court. The complaint says state environmental officials noticed the leak in April, weeks before the closure’s announcement. Department spokesman Jay Apperson says Verso is working to stop it.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State lawmakers have passed a ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes. The ban won approval in the Senate early Thursday before the Legislature broke for a holiday recess. It had earlier been passed by the state House of Representatives. “This nation-leading step will save lives,” House Speaker Robert DeLeo said of what’s believed to be the first such statewide legislation in the country. The legislation now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, who in September declared a public health emergency and ordered a temporary ban on the sale of vaping products. Jonathan Shaer, president of the New England Convenience Store Owners and Energy Marketers Association, says the bill will have “disastrous implications for public health, public safety, state tax revenue and jobs.”\n\nMichigan\n\nYpsilanti: The Michigan Department of Corrections has been hit with a class-action lawsuit on behalf of inmates who say they’ve been overwhelmed by chronic mold and other unsanitary conditions at the state’s only prison for women. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Detroit federal court, says the Huron Valley prison in Washtenaw County is “operating under a state of degradation, filth and inhumanity.” Lawyers say women have suffered health problems because of mold, and their complaints have gone unheeded. Spokesman Chris Gautz says the Corrections Department “disagrees with the claims.” He declined further comment. Paula Bailey says exposure to mold has given her a rash, scars and respiratory problems. Another prisoner, Krystal Clark, says she suffers from chronic coughing and wears a mask when visiting with people.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLitchfield: Authorities say someone left “booby traps” in a farmer’s field that were apparently meant to damage farm equipment. Meeker County Sheriff Brian Cruze says a farmer near Cedar Mills on Monday reported minor damage to a combine after a chain was drawn into the machine during harvesting. Cruze told Minnesota Public Radio News it’s premature to speculate on motive. The sheriff says the chain may have been in the corn for weeks or months. But he says when the farm family got deeper into the crop, it happened again. Mindy Johnson’s family farms about 2,000 acres of corn and soybeans. She says the second incident involved a 6-foot piece of steel rebar pounded into the ground near a cornstalk where it was hard to see. Johnson says she doesn’t know why her family’s farm would be singled out.\n\nMississippi\n\nIndianola: Work is starting on the $2.5 million expansion of a museum in the Mississippi Delta that’s dedicated to a native son who became a blues legend. A groundbreaking ceremony was held Tuesday for new space at the B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center in Indianola. The museum opened in 2008 near the area where King grew up. The 15-time Grammy winner died in 2015 and is buried on the museum grounds. The 4,500-square-foot addition will house King’s tour bus and two of his vehicles, a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow and a custom-painted Chevy El Camino. The museum says in a news release that other artifacts acquired since his death are being preserved and cataloged, including a guitar given to King by Les Paul.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A federal judge has upheld the University of Missouri’s ban on carrying concealed guns on campus. Circuit Judge Jeff Harris on Monday rejected the Missouri attorney general’s arguments that the ban violates the state constitution. He also said the ban supports the university’s interest in promoting safety on its campuses. The Columbia Daily Tribune reports the case began in 2015 when Royce Barondes, a professor of law on the Columbia campus, sued because he wanted to keep a firearm in his locked vehicle. Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office declined to comment on the ruling and has not decided whether to appeal. The university said in a statement that the ruling serves the best interest of students, staff, faculty and others on campus.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Federal wildlife officials say the continued existence of two species of insects is in doubt because the glaciers and year-round snowfields on which they depend are melting away. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials said Wednesday that the western glacier stonefly and the meltwater lednian stonefly will be protected as threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The stoneflies live in high-elevation, cold-water streams fed by glaciers and perennial snowfields in and around Glacier National Park in Montana, Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming and Native American tribal lands in western Montana. Wildlife officials say melting glaciers, higher water temperatures, and changes in the volume of snowmelt and runoff are harming the habitat they need to survive. Most glaciers and snowfields in one of the species’ main locations, Glacier National Park, are expected to disappear by 2030.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is the first agreeing to share driver’s license records with the U.S. Census Bureau as the federal agency tries to comply with President Donald Trump’s order to count the number of U.S. citizens. The Associated Press has learned that the Census Bureau and Rhonda Lahm, Nebraska’s motor vehicles director, signed a memorandum of understanding to share the records earlier this month. The move has alarmed civil rights groups, which see it as part of a backdoor move by the Trump administration to reduce the political power of minorities. Last month, the American Civil Liberties Union urged states to decline the Census Bureau’s request. The agency has promised to keep the records confidential, and Nebraska officials concluded that sharing the records complied with state law. Nebraska only issues driver’s licenses and identification cards to people who can prove they are living in the U.S. legally.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state’s highest highway pass is ready for avalanche season, according to the Nevada Department of Transportation, the agency responsible for keeping Mt. Rose Highway open. The highway – officially known as State Route 431 – is the most direct link between Reno and the Lake Tahoe Basin. At 8,911 feet, it’s also the highest year-round highway pass in the Sierra Nevada, which makes clearing mass amounts of snow a big challenge. That’s why confirming reliability of a remote avalanche triggering system means frequent highway users can breathe a sigh of relief. Reliability questions cropped up in October following a preseason inspection that showed a need for carpentry and electrical improvements to the building that houses equipment for the system.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: Plans to hold a “Frost Fest” instead of a traditional holiday celebration are getting a worse-than-frosty reception. After concerns last year that the tree-lighting ceremony at a park in Durham was too focused on Christmas, including a decision to deny a menorah to be displayed next to the tree, town councilors came up with the idea of a celebration that pays tribute to winter. This year, there’s no tree lighting ceremony or grand entrance from Santa planned. But councilors said in trying to make the holidays welcoming and inclusive, they’ve been yelled at and have received hateful emails and social media posts. The debate over what to include in the holiday season even extends to the wreaths on light posts. For now, they’re going up again.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The state is doubling down on expanding its wind energy production, and then some. Flanked by former Vice President Al Gore, a longtime climate activist, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed an executive order Tuesday that commits the state to produce 7,500 megawatts of electricity through wind energy by 2035. That’s more than double the 3,500 megawatt goal Murphy set for 2030. He said if the goal is realized, wind energy could power half the state’s energy needs and about 3.2 million homes. “We are putting ourselves on a steeper curve, and I wouldn’t do it if I wasn’t totally confident in our ability to crest this hill,” Murphy said at Liberty Science Center. The announcement drew praise from New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel, who called it “a huge step in the right direction.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state’s Environment Department needs $1.2 million to study plumes of toxic chemicals seeping into groundwater from two U.S. Air Force bases, a state official said. Agency Secretary James Kenney said he will request the money from state lawmakers to investigate and learn more about how to contain the contamination from Holloman and Cannon air bases, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. “We know who caused it, and they’re unwilling to take responsibility for it even to identify where it is and isn’t,” Kenney said. “The state is having to take that on now.” The state sued the Air Force in March after groundwater sampling showed levels in some areas were hundreds of times higher than a federal health advisory limit. The lawsuit calls for the Air Force to pay for studying and cleaning up contamination. The Air Force has sought dismissal of the case and repeatedly declined to comment on the litigation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Law enforcement officials and prosecutors are intensifying a debate over the implementation of sweeping changes to the state’s criminal justice system. They voiced concerns Thursday with changes that are set to take effect at the beginning of 2020, including an overhaul of the state’s bail law. It removes pretrial detention and money bail for the vast majority of misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases. Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple says the changes will jeopardize public safety. He made the comments at a press conference in Albany while joined by prosecutors and other law enforcement officials. Supporters of the changes say it will prevent poor people from languishing in jail for low-level crimes while their cases work through the system.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Visitors driving the Blue Ridge Parkway about 30 miles southwest of the city can expect to smell smoke and see flames shooting from the summit of Cold Mountain. The U.S. Forest Service has closed the entire 18,000-acre Shining Rock Wilderness Area, including all 53 miles of its trails, to the public while a wildfire burns on the iconic Cold Mountain in the Haywood County area of Pisgah National Forest. Bruce MacDonald, public information officer with National Forests in North Carolina – an office of the U.S. Forest Service – said the 50-acre fire burning on the Cold Mountain summit was called in about 3 a.m. Thursday but had grown to 106 acres as of 5 p.m. Some 30 firefighters were monitoring the situation, including personnel from the U.S. Forest Service, N.C. Forest Service, National Park Service, Haywood County Emergency Services and Cruso Fire Department.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Planners say a new $114 million indoor recreation complex would be funded by a new sales tax and private donations. The Bismarck Parks and Recreation District staff talked about the proposed facility at a meeting Wednesday night. They say the center would have a main building with a separate ice arena. The concept includes a four-lane running and walking track and an indoor cross-country track with elevation and obstacles. Recreation staff also recommend six indoor tennis courts, adjacent to five indoor pickleball courts. Other amenities would include two indoor basketball courts, four racquetball courts and an indoor playground. The Bismarck Tribune says the Capital Ice Complex would be larger than 25 acres. Planners say if the project is approved next June, the center could open in 2023.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: After months of negotiations between the City Council and the Board of Hamilton County Commissioners, the planned music venue at The Banks garnered final approval Wednesday. The council approved the music venue plan and a development agreement that will allow the project to go forward. It comes on the heels of an ordinance, approved earlier this month, changing the cooperative agreement between the city and county that has long guided development at The Banks. The $27 million music venue is being built by Music and Event Management Inc., the nonprofit concert arm of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. It will have indoor and outdoor event spaces that can host different events at the same time. It will have a capacity of 4,500 indoors, with general admission seating for 2,700 people. Outdoors, the venue will be able to hold an additional 8,000.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Attorney General Mike Hunter says he plans to appeal a judge’s order directing consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson to pay the state $465 million to help address the opioid crisis. Hunter said Thursday that the judge’s final order only covers one year of the state’s proposed abatement plan and that the actual costs to clean up the damage from the opioid crisis are much higher. Attorneys for the company also say they plan to appeal. Johnson & Johnson had asked the judge to consider reducing the final award based on pretrial settlements totaling $355 million the state reached with other defendants in the case. Cleveland County Judge Thad Balkman initially ordered the company to pay $572 million but later reduced that amount after acknowledging a miscalculation.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: New data from the state Department of Education shows the number of homeless students in Oregon increased 2% last school year, continuing a trend over the past decade. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports in the 2018-19 school year, 22,215 students were living on the street, in shelters, in temporary housing or doubled up with other families. The U.S. Department of Education requires states to use a broader definition of homelessness than the federal housing authority, which typically means that tens of thousands more children are counted in the yearly student tally than the county-by-county census of homeless people of all ages. The state reported 15,800 homeless Oregonians in the 2019 count. Oregon’s homeless student count has stayed in the range of about 22,000 in each of the past three years, including hitting a record high of 22,541 in the 2016-17 school year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A man sent to prison for life as a 17-year-old has been chosen for a Mural Arts Philadelphia residency and will design a public mural that addresses mass incarceration. James “Yaya” Hough is among the “juvenile lifers” released since the U.S. Supreme Court banned mandatory life sentences for minors. The 45-year-old Pittsburgh man has been free since this summer after serving 27 years in state prison for murder. Hough took classes behind bars through the mural arts program and will now be an artist in residency at the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office. At a news conference Thursday, he thanked District Attorney Larry Krasner and the arts program for giving him the chance to create public art. Mural Arts Philadelphia has produced than 4,000 murals around the city.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Police statistics show the city is on track to have the fewest shootings in recent record this year. The Boston Globe reports shootings in Rhode Island’s capital have been going down year-by-year since 2014. Providence Police Department data shows that as of Nov. 12, there had been 32 people shot, down from 55 victims in 2018. The newspaper says that as of Tuesday, it had been a month since the last person was shot in Providence. But even with the decline in shootings, Providence police report no shortage of guns after seizing more than 100 illegal guns as of last week. Providence Police Chief Hugh T. Clements Jr. attributes the decrease in gun violence to the force remaining “laser focused on gun crimes.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A sheriff and the governor say a group dedicated to protecting children has donated a dog that can detect electronic devices and computer storage. Defenders for Children says Oakley the dog can detect electronics and point them out to handlers, similar to how a drug dog finds narcotics. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott says his deputies will use the new dog to help them find hidden storage devices that can be smaller than a thumbnail while conducting search warrants. Lott said at a news conference that for now the dog will mostly be used in child pornography cases. Gov. Henry McMaster says he hopes the group can place the trained dogs in several places across South Carolina. The group says it costs about $23,000 to train one dog.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Local ad agencies have joined the chorus unhappy with a state anti-meth campaign that included the provocative tagline “Meth: We’re On It.” The South Dakota Advertising Federation is upset that the account went to a Minnesota ad agency. In a statement, the federation says nine in-state agencies bid on the contract. The federation doesn’t directly criticize the campaign, which drew ridicule on social media, but suggests that the in-state agencies “could have delivered a message by South Dakotans that resonates with South Dakota.” The state is paying a Minneapolis agency almost $700,000 for its work. Gov. Kristi Noem has called the ads a success. She says the campaign was intended to be “provocative,” and the Minneapolis agency was chosen because it proposed ads that go beyond typical drug awareness campaigns.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Reversing course, the state’s Department of Education says it aims to ensure its school vouchers won’t be taxable. Department spokeswoman Jennifer Johnson said Wednesday that the law’s intent is that vouchers be considered scholarships not subject to taxation, and the department intends to structure the program accordingly. Officials aim to resolve confusion after Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn said Monday that her understanding was voucher payments were taxable. A lawmaker had asked if the payments need to be reported on parents’ federal income tax filings. On Tuesday, Johnson said Schwinn meant to discuss the program’s possible “filing and issuance of federal information reporting returns.”\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: A family that disagrees with a hospital’s plan to take a 9-month-old girl off life support has been given more time to find a facility to take her. Texas Right to Life, which represents Tinslee Lewis’ family, said a judge on Tuesday extended a temporary restraining order against Cook Children’s Medical Center until Dec. 10. The hospital didn’t immediately comment. Doctors planned to remove Tinslee from life support Nov. 10 after invoking Texas’ “10-day rule,” which can be employed when a family disagrees with doctors on discontinuing life-sustaining treatment. Treatment can be withdrawn if a new provider can’t be found in that time. The hospital has said that since July, Tinslee has been on a ventilator and a machine that replaces the function of the heart and lungs.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The taxpayer cost of mayoral portraits has risen significantly over the past two decades. The Deseret News reports that the portrait of outgoing Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski is expected to cost about $35,000, up from the $30,000 it cost for the portrait of her predecessor, Ralph Becker, and more than double the $15,000 for the portrait of Deedee Corradini, mayor from 1992 to 2000. The city’s chief financial officer, Mary Beth Thompson, says the price of hand-painted portraits has increased due to inflation, materials and artist fees. The city has done mayoral portraits for more than a century dating back to the mid-1800s. They line the walls in a hallway at City Hall.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: The state’s only juvenile detention center is empty for the first time in years. Woodside Juvenile Rehabilitation Center in Colchester has been under scrutiny for years and has faced numerous lawsuits over procedures. Chief Juvenile Defender Marshall Pahl says several factors have led to the decrease in population, including a combination of policy and law changes, individual litigation and advocacy. Vermont Public Radio reports that lawmakers have been considering what to do with the facility. Department of Children and Families Commissioner Ken Schatz said in January that he supports building a 30-bed facility to replace Woodside.\n\nVirginia\n\nManassas: The National Park Service has launched a series of controlled fires at Manassas National Battlefield. The park service says the burns are designed to restore views at the battlefield, maintain wildlife habitat and combat invasive species. Fires are planned on about 75 acres. The park has initiated similar fires two other times since April 2018. Manassas National Battlefield runs along busy Interstate 66 and encompasses land where the First and Second Battles of Bull Run were fought in 1861 and 1862, respectively. The first Bull Run battle was the first major battle of the Civil War.\n\nWashington\n\nBellingham: Fishing in the part of Whatcom Creek that flows through downtown Bellingham will end more than five weeks early this year because chum salmon are returning in low numbers. The Bellingham Herald reports the closure begins Friday, the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife announced. That means fishing won’t be allowed from the mouth of Whatcom Creek to the markers below the footbridge downstream of Dupont Street in Bellingham. The season for fishing along Whatcom Creek usually stays open until Dec. 31, according to the 2019-20 Washington Sport Fishing Rules. The state agency closed fishing in that portion of Whatcom Creek because the return of chum was below the number needed for egg harvesting at the hatchery there, it said in a release Wednesday.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Businesses hoping to break into the state’s fledgling marijuana market will soon be able to apply for permits as growers, processors, dispensaries and laboratories. The state Bureau of Public Health says its Office of Medical Cannabis will open applications Dec. 19. Citing a state news release, news outlets report applications are due by Feb. 18 and will be online only. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the medical marijuana program created in 2017 was meant to launch in July. Delays included the state treasure’s banking vendors refusing to process marijuana funds, per conflicts with federal law. A workaround passed this year allowed credit unions to step in. The cannabis office’s director, Jason Frame, previously said he wanted patients to have access to the drug before the summer of 2021.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A group that promotes student voting has filed a federal lawsuit challenging the state’s student voter identification requirements. The Andrew Goodman Foundation filed the lawsuit in Madison on Tuesday. The foundation alleges that requirements that students present IDs that contain the issuance date, the holder’s signature and an expiration date no later than two years after the issuance date are too onerous and designed to stop young people from voting in violation of the 26th Amendment. The lawsuit names the members of the Wisconsin Elections Commission as defendants. Commission spokesman Reid Magney didn’t immediately respond to an email Wednesday seeking comment. Priorities USA Foundation, which is funding the lawsuit, announced in February that it plans to spend $30 million to finance court challenges to restrictive, Republican-backed voter laws.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Officials have named a university faculty member the new state archaeologist. The Buckrail Daily News reports the Wyoming State Archeologist’s Office hired Tennessee native Spencer Pelton. Officials say the department investigates, records, and preserves prehistoric and historic human activity evidence statewide. Officials say Pelton moved west in 2009 and has lived in California, Nevada and Colorado before moving to Wyoming in 2013. Department officials say Pelton’s research experience is in the early prehistory of hunter-gatherers of the High Plains and the Rocky Mountains. Officials say the university’s Department of Anthropology contributes educational opportunities in prehistory, cultural resource management, archaeological excavation and scientific perspectives. Pelton says he looks forward to fostering curiosity into the state’s history.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/04/13/holy-water-drop-foster-pet-boom-super-spreader-news-around-states/111541518/", "title": "Holy water drop, foster pet boom: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTroy: Troy University has five 3D printers running 24/7 making protective equipment for health care workers, and the college is asking anyone who owns a 3D printer to help with the effort. Usually the college’s 3D printers are used for art and design projects, but faculty, staff and students are printing N95 masks, face shields and other needed equipment to protect from the coronavirus. The protective equipment is being distributed wherever there is a need. Volunteers can make masks from home. The primary print at Troy has been reusable face shield-headbands. They can be quickly sanitized, and the shields can be replaced with readily available items such as copier, printer or overhead transparency sheets. “Any relatively thick, clear plastic that can accept a three hole punch,” said Jeff Herring, producer and director for Troy Broadcast and Digital Network.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: About 70 tribes in the state have implemented travel restrictions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, limiting incoming air, land and water traffic in remote villages scattered across Alaska. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has given communities regulation leeway through their councils and other governmental entities, so travel restrictions vary throughout the state, Indian Country Today reports. Essential workers and their necessary travel are still permitted. “But the less mixing we have going on at this point, the more we slow the virus down,” Dunleavy said. Residents of the Northwest Alaska Inupiat village of Kivalina, population 379, who want to leave must notify the tribal administrator of departure and return dates and the reason for the trip and must self-quarantine for 14 days upon return, community leaders said. Those rules apply to travel by flights and snowmobile, as the village is not connected by road to any other community, leaders said.\n\nArizona\n\nPage: The number of coronavirus cases on the nation’s largest Native American reservation jumped jumped by 17% Saturday as the Navajo Nation prepared to get new rapid-test kits. The Navajo Nation said in a statement that the number of cases on the 27,000-square-mile reservation that sprawls across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah rose to 698 Saturday, up 101 from the day before. So far, a total of 24 people have died from complications of COVID-19. Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez and Vice President Myron Lizer said they have been told that Abbott ID rapid test kits will become available at Navajo Area IHS facilities and tribal health care centers in the next few days. The tests come out with results within several minutes, they said. “Quicker test results will likely result in even higher numbers of positive cases, but it will help to identify those who have the virus and begin to mitigate the cases much quicker. We must do better,” Nez said.\n\nArkansas\n\nGrady: The first state prisoner in Arkansas has been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, a prison spokeswoman said Sunday. A man being held at the Cummins Unit in Grady, about 75 miles south east of Little Rock, was transferred to a hospital Saturday and tested positive for COVID-19, Arkansas Department of Corrections spokeswoman Dina Tyler said in a statement. She declined to provide further information on the man. Other prisoners and staff who were exposed to the man have been tested for the virus, and access to his housing unit has been restricted. Tyler said that 13 corrections employees were quarantined Friday after testing positive. As of Saturday, 1,228 people in Arkansas have tested positive for COVID-19, and 25 with the disease have died, according to figures from the state Department of Health. Almost 350 people have recovered.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state will help skilled nursing facilities wracked by the new virus by providing additional bed space for their patients on a Navy hospital ship and shipping masks and gloves for their workers, the governor said Friday. The state will also help track the virus in more than 1,000 facilities and isolate those who test positive, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. The announcements came as Newsom warned that skilled nursing facilities are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus and that more than 1,200 residents and staff had tested positive. Another 370 people at small, home-based facilities also have the virus, he said. “Skilled nursing facilities continue to be a top priority,” Newsom said in a daily briefing. “This state has a disproportionate number of aging and graying individuals, and we have a unique responsibility to take care of them and take care of their caregivers.”\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: A beef plant in northern Colorado where dozens of employees have tested positive for COVID-19 has been shut down through Tuesday for deep cleaning and to screen additional workers. Andre Nogueira, JBS USA’s CEO, said in a statement released Friday that the company is paying more than $1 million for thousands of testing kits for workers at the Greeley plant. He said 36 employees have tested positive for the disease. Weld County’s health department said concerns at the facility include the proximity of workers to each other and employees working while they are sick. If the plant does not comply with the county’s public health order, it could be closed, but compliance is the “preferred solution,” the statement said. On Tuesday, Nogueira told The Greeley Tribune he was confident workers inside the plant were safe from the virus and strongly disputed claims by employees that people were going to work sick.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Landlords are raising concerns about Gov. Ned Lamont’s latest executive order, which automatically grants tenants a 60-day grace period for rent due in April and the opportunity for a second 60-day grace period to help those struggling to pay for housing during the coronavirus pandemic. Rick Bush, a West Hartford landlord who owns 38 units and manages 165 more, predicted renters will never be able to catch up on those delayed payments, leaving many landlords in a financial predicament. In a good economy, Bush estimated only 10% to 15% of renters typically pay off their back, unpaid rent. He said he’d like the state’s congressional delegation to propose a new federal loan program for renters that would enable landlords to still get paid and cover their own expenses, including mortgages. Numerous landlords on Bush’s Facebook page echoed his concerns Friday, predicting Lamont’s order will put them over the financial edge.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Gov. John Carney on Saturday unveiled a new effort to recruit workers with health care or child care experience amid the coronavirus pandemic. Carney’s office said in a news release that the state has launched an online application portal to recruit workers with those credentials to fill critical jobs. “We need all Delaware citizens, businesses, and nonprofits to support Delaware’s response to COVID-19. If you have experience in health care or child care especially, please sign up … and help us fill critical positions,” he said. Applications will be reviewed by the Delaware Division of Public Health and shared with institutions in need across the state, the news release said. The governor’s office also said anyone licensed or certified to work in child care or education was encouraged to submit their information for potential temporary employment by emergency child care sites.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With new rules in place, fish market vendors at The Wharf once again opened their stands Saturday, ready to sell to buyers lining up around the corner, WUSA-TV reports. Vendors were forced to implement new safety regulations after images of an overcrowded market with no social distancing went viral the prior weekend. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser enacted an emergency closure in response, saying vendors would only be allowed to reopen once they submitted a new safety plan to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs for approval. On Thursday, she implemented a new rule that said farmers’ markets were no longer considered essential businesses, and they would have to obtain a waiver to operate. The National Guard and D.C. police were out manning the lines Saturday, making sure customers were following the new rules.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Members of the Florida National Guard have started on-the-spot testing of residents at nursing homes for the new coronavirus as long-term care facilities in the state have reported scores of cases, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday. Guardsmen have conducted tests of residents and staff at nursing homes in South Florida, and UF Health Shands has done other spot-testing at facilities, DeSantis said. “We want to continue to do that, given that is the most high-risk population,” the governor said. In Clay County, in the Jacksonville area, 49 cases have been reported at long-term care facilities, and 51 cases among residents and staff have been reported at a nursing home in Suwannee County, halfway between Jacksonville and Tallahassee. Statewide, there were almost 840 coronavirus cases in residents and staff at long-term care facilities as of Saturday.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state has now surpassed 12,000, with the death toll at 432. The Georgia Department of Public Health reported an additional 400 cases and seven deaths Saturday. The total number of cases now stands at more than 12,250. Roughly 20% of those patients are hospitalized. Gov. Brian Kemp has issued a statewide stay-at-home order lasting through the end of April, but houses of worship are still allowed to hold services as long as congregants remain 6 feet apart. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state of Hawaii said Friday that it wants travelers to use an online program to provide information about their travel plans to help authorities enforce a 14-day coronavirus quarantine imposed on people arriving in the islands. The program asks travelers to provide a name, phone number, flight information and address where they will be staying. Until now the state has had travelers fill out paper forms with this information. The number of travelers flying to Hawaii has dropped dramatically since Gov. David Ige announced the quarantine order in late March. But hundreds continue to arrive. On Thursday, 663 people arrived, including 107 visitors and 171 residents. Travelers using the online program will be asked to check in daily to attest they are at their quarantine location and to answer questions about their health. The program does not currently have the ability to check a traveler’s location using cellphone GPS.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s congressional delegation wants the U.S. Department of Energy to prepare spent nuclear fuel for trucking out of eastern Idaho ahead of a 2035 deadline. The two Republican senators and two Republican representatives in the letter sent last week said the department could be readying the spent fuel for placement in protective trucking containers. A 1995 agreement following a series of federal lawsuits requires the Energy Department to remove most of the spent fuel and other nuclear waste from the site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory. “We encourage the Department to initiate activities needed to begin loading of spent nuclear fuel into a multi-purpose canister (MPC) at the Idaho National Laboratory using existing facilities,” the lawmakers wrote. However, the U.S. has no long-term storage facility to receive radioactive spent fuel. The creation of such a repository would require action by the Trump administration, Congress and states.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has recently been using his clemency power to commute sentences for some prisoners amid the coronavirus outbreak. Pritzker granted commutations for 17 Illinois inmates since March 11, the Chicago Tribune reports. Basil Powell, who was imprisoned in 1986 for being the lookout in two robberies, was one of those prisoners. A tough-on-crime sentencing law that labeled him a repeat offender led to his life sentence after his conviction. But reform advocates fought for his release due to their concern regarding elderly and sick inmates during the outbreak, and he was released Thursday. “I feel good, like a thousand bricks got up off my shoulders,” Powell said in a telephone interview. Pritzker also commuted the life sentence of Charles Harris, 58, who was convicted of armed robbery and serving a mandatory life term under the habitual criminal law. He had been in prison since 1988 and was released Wednesday.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In record numbers, central Indiana residents have been seeking companionship from dogs as they ride out the COVID-19 pandemic in their homes. Shelters report large increases in the number of four-legged fosters since stay-at-home orders took effect. “There’s nothing better than a cuddly pet at home when you are self-isolating,” said David Horth, chief executive officer of the Humane Society of Indianapolis. He said the short-term adoptions of pandemic pooches are mutually beneficial: They give the animals a respite from hectic and quickly crowding shelters and provide their humans comfort or a distraction in a stressful time. It also helps that the shelters provide food and medication at a time residents are feeling economic hardship. Though shelters have a steady base of repeat foster parents, officials said the majority of temporary adopters now are first-timers.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Health care providers facing a shortage of personal protective equipment must extend the use of their face masks, use washable gowns and shorten hospital stays for some coronavirus patients, the Iowa Department of Public Health said Friday. The agency directed hospitals to take extraordinary steps to conserve limited supplies of critical masks, gowns, shields, goggles and respirators. “We understand the issuance of this order may be unsettling, but due to the global shortage of PPE supply, we have determined that now is the time to take this action,” the department’s deputy director, Sarah Reisetter, said at a news conference. Gov. Kim Reynolds said the state’s requests for equipment from the now-depleted national stockpile have been delayed, and state and local agencies and providers have struggled to procure adequate supplies. Advocates for health care workers said they were alarmed by the shortage, which comes about two or three weeks before Iowa’s COVID-19 caseload is expected to peak.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Authorities are investigating a spike in people impersonating law enforcement officers. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation said in a news release Friday that it has identified about 10 reports of suspected law enforcement impersonations in the past several weeks in multiple counties. There have no reports of injuries or thefts. The KBI says the impersonator often questions whether the driver’s travel is “essential” or asks for workplace documentation. The Kansas stay-at-home order doesn’t require people to carry or a letter, identification card or other paper proving they are allowed to leave their home. The KBI says people who are concerned they are the target of an impersonator should slow down, activate their hazard lights, and call 911 to confirm it is a legitimate law enforcement stop.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The University of Louisville has developed a process for sterilizing N95 respirators and will soon begin cleaning up to 7,000 masks daily for area health care facilities. N95 respirators are essential to protecting the health of nurses, doctors and others who work in direct contact with coronavirus patients, and they’ve become increasingly difficult to find amid the global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the masks not be reused in emergency situations. But Leslie Sherwood, assistant vice president for research services at U of L, said the university has found a way to decontaminate the masks using vaporized hydrogen peroxide, allowing health care professionals to use them again. “Unfortunately, we know that folks working in health care are having higher incidents of being infected because they’re constantly being bombarded with the virus,” Mayor Greg Fischer said Saturday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The archbishop of New Orleans sprinkled holy water from a World War II-era biplane high above the city in an unusual Good Friday blessing for those affected by the coronavirus. The open-air plane carried Archbishop Gregory Aymond, 70, from the Lakefront Airport to Kenner, to Gretna, to the French Quarter over 25 minutes, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reports. Aymond prayed for protection and healing and sprinkled holy water that came from the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized. “When I first did it, the water came back on me,” Aymond said, “but then I got situated.” Aymond recently recovered from the virus himself and said he asked God to offer grace in particular to health care workers, first responders and city leaders. The archdiocese has canceled all Masses indefinitely due to social distancing requirements. Rabbi Lexi Erdheim, 29, of the Congregation Gates of Prayer Synagogue in Metairie, went up in the same plane after Aymond to offer a blessing during Passover. “It was really powerful, seeing everything at once,” she said, “especially after being inside the same four walls for so long.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A traveling salesperson helped spread the coronavirus in Maine and several other states early in the outbreak last month, the leader of the Maine Center for Disease Control said. The salesperson was a so-called super spreader, a single person responsible for a significant number of exposures to the virus, said Dr. Nirav Shah, the center’s director. “This traveling salesperson visited a particular establishment in Maine and had a series of meetings and infected a certain number of individuals, all of whom we traced,” Shah said. The person was linked to infections outside Maine, as well, Shah said. He declined to release details, citing privacy concerns. The discovery highlights how the spread of the coronavirus can often be traced to individuals and gatherings. One of the concerns is that the virus can be easily spread by infected people who are not showing symptoms.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan announced steps Friday to address a huge potential state revenue loss of up to $2.8 billion this fiscal year as a result of the coronavirus and to strongly urge voters to cast ballots by mail in the state’s June 2 primary. Hogan said the projected revenue loss would represent a 50% drop in projected revenues over the next 90 days and up to a 15% reduction in revenues for the fiscal year that ends July 1. As a result, Hogan said the state is immediately instituting a budget freeze across state government agencies, except for COVID-19-related expenses and payroll. The governor said his budget office will be making recommendations for spending reductions, which will be required by all state agencies. “In addition, the state will be tapping into and spending much of – perhaps even all of – the state’s rainy day fund balance,” Hogan said. That fund is estimated at $1.2 billion.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State lawmakers are holding a virtual public hearing Monday on a bill designed to provide short-term economic relief for families in deep poverty, vulnerable children and people with disabilities. The bill would provide a one-time additional benefit to those who receive help through the state’s transitional aid to families with dependent children program. The cost of the one-time infusion of money is pegged at $17 million in the bill. The legislation would also set aside $6 million for an additional one-time benefit under the state’s program for emergency aid to the elderly, disabled and children. The goal is to offer help to the state’s most vulnerable during the coronavirus crisis. The hearing scheduled for Monday at 1:30 p.m. will mark the first time a piece of legislation has received a virtual public hearing. The hearing will be conducted over Zoom.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Hundreds of city workers, including dozens of police officers, have been able to quickly return to work after being quarantined or have avoided quarantine altogether thanks to a speedy new test for the coronavirus. Over the past week or so, more than 1,000 city employees – including officers, firefighters, paramedics and bus drivers – have been given 15-minute nasal swab tests before starting their shifts. Mayor Mike Duggan’s office said 990 of those tested did not have COVID-19, while 140 tested positive. Testing on police officers showed 307 were negative, and 45 were positive. Before the test – developed by suburban Chicago-based Abbott Laboratories – first responders would have been sent home for several days or even weeks until results from slower tests showed whether they had the virus.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRochester: One of the premier medical facilities in the country and the state’s largest private employer on Friday announced a series of cost-cutting measures to deal with a proposed $3 billion loss in 2020. Rochester’s Mayo Clinic is instituting across-the-board pay cuts and furloughs, a result of the financial strain caused by the coronavirus crisis. The moves follow the clinic’s decision last month to halt elective surgeries and procedures to conserve supplies for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients. Mayo Clinic’s chief executive, Gianrico Farrugia, said in a statement that he supports steps being taken by the state to control the spread, including the extension this week of a stay-at-home order. Republican state Sen. Carla Nelson, of Rochester, said she will seek financial relief for the medical center she said has sacrificed to help slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Many churches held online services Sunday to celebrate Easter and to help people maintain distance from one another to try to slow the spread of the new coronavirus as the state’s death toll from COVID-19 approaches 100. The Rev. S.V. Adolph Jr., pastor of First Missionary Baptist Church Handsboro, said on Facebook Live that he misses greeting and embracing congregants at the Gulfport sanctuary, but he is grateful about “leaving the walls of the church” and worshipping online. He also prayed for health care providers, law enforcement officers and others working during the pandemic. “We are really grateful for these heroes, these people who are at risk for our sake,” Adolph said. Figures released by the state Health Department on Sunday showed Mississippi had at least 2,781 confirmed cases and 96 deaths from the virus as of Saturday evening. That was an increase of 139 cases and three deaths from the previous day.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Gov. Mike Parson on Friday signed a supplemental budget bill allocating nearly $6 billion in federal stimulus money to fight the health and economic ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic. The money will be used to purchase additional personal protective equipment for first responders, help develop medical facilities beyond traditional hospitals, and provide aid to hard-hit local governments, Parson said during a news conference. He also announced he was establishing a working group led by state Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick to help decide how the money will be spent. Both Parson and Fitzpatrick are Republicans. Meanwhile, Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft asked some employees to return to the agency’s office in Jefferson City on Monday to help keep up with an increasing workload. Only people with offices will be asked to come to work, excluding those with preexisting health conditions.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The superintendent of the state’s schools told districts Friday to expect to finish out the school year with distance learning amid the coronavirus outbreak. While Gov. Steve Bullock is making coronavirus policy decisions in two-week time frames, Superintendent Elsie Arntzen said she believes school leaders would like more certainty in planning the rest of the academic year. Montana’s school closures and stay-at-home orders currently run through April 24. Even if they are lifted, Arntzen said she expects social distancing guidelines will remain in place, possibly into the summer. “We encourage you to postpone graduation ceremonies until later in the year or come up with alternative plans to honor your graduates, ensuring equity in recognition for all students, including special education students,” Arntzen wrote in a letter to schools.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has barred people from camping overnight at state parks, state recreation areas and wildlife management areas as part of the effort to limit the spread of COVID-19. The ban runs through May 8, with a possible extension. The closure of state park area lodging and cabins will be extended through May 8 as well. State parks and recreation areas will remain open for day use. A limited number of restrooms will be available and will be disinfected regularly, the commission said. Refunds will be given to campers who have prepaid fees.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The sweeping impacts of the coronavirus outbreak across the state now include cancellation of the annual Burning Man festival. Burning Man Project officials on Friday announced cancellation of the annual event that was scheduled to be held Aug. 30 to Sept. 7 in the northern Nevada desert. Organizers of Burning Man, a lifestyle and entertainment gathering that typically attracts 80,000 people, said in a Facebook post the cancellation was “in the interest of the health and well-being of our community.” The organizers said in an online journal post that “we are heartbroken. We know you are too.” Organizers said they were committed to providing refunds for tickets already purchased, but they asked purchasers to consider foregoing refunds because the organization faces layoffs, pay cuts and other belt-tightening measures.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s child welfare agency is offering new resources to help children, parents and other caregivers during the COVID-19 crisis. The state Division for Children, Youth, and Families has published a guide with advice and resources for financial assistance, food, housing and more. It also includes tips on how to check in with families and a list of questions to ask caregivers and children. The division, along with the social service agency Waypoint, also has created the “Family Support Warm Line.” The free, confidential phone line will connect callers with professionals who can offer coping strategies and emotional support. The number is 1-800-640-6486. DCYF Director Joseph Ribsam says new child abuse and neglect referrals have dropped during the pandemic, likely because children are away from school officials who often report suspected cases. He says the focus must remain on prevention.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The governor said Sunday that some models suggest the state’s coronavirus crisis is reaching its peak, but others indicate the worst impact may still be weeks away. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy told CNN health care recovery must occur before economic recovery takes place, and he’s concerned that reopening and relaxing social distancing too early could backfire. “And I fear, if we open up too early, and we have not sufficiently made that health recovery and cracked the back of this virus, that we could be pouring gasoline on the fire, even inadvertently,” Murphy said. The governor said his administration devoted significant attention over the weekend to planning about how to keep people safe once restrictions begin to be lifted. Murphy told CBS he supports a regional approach to reopening and has been having “discussions with our neighboring states on the whole question of testing, contact tracing, what are the rules of the road going to be for things like bars and restaurants.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A philanthropic effort aimed at boosting access to scarce medical and protective equipment supplies on the Navajo Nation is being organized by former Gov. Bill Richardson. Richardson, a former U.N. ambassador, said his enduring sense of gratitude and friendship with the Navajo people prompted him to provide seed money and launch the humanitarian effort in cooperation with Molina Healthcare and the New Mexico Children’s Foundation. “So many Navajo elders are vulnerable to this virus because they don’t have masks; they don’t have protective equipment,” he said. Richardson fears the pandemic could reach a vast scale of suffering reminiscent of the forced removal in the 19th century of Navajos in the “Long Walk.” Thousands endured cold, disease and starvation in the U.S. government’s attempt to relocate them to a desolate tract of land hundreds of miles away in eastern New Mexico. In 1868, they signed a treaty with the federal government to secure a return to their homeland. Richardson credited New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a fellow Democrat, with “getting ahead of this crisis.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The coronavirus crisis is taxing the city’s 911 system like never before. Operators pick up a new call every 15.5 seconds. Panicked voices tell of loved ones in declining health. There are multitudes of cardiac arrests and respiratory failures and others who call needing reassurance that a mere sneeze isn’t a sign they’ve been infected. The system is so overwhelmed that the city has started sending text and tweet alerts urging people only to call 911 “for life-threatening emergencies.” As the city staggered through its deadliest week of the pandemic, its emergency response system and army of operators, dispatchers and ambulance crews is being pushed to the brink. The fire department said it has averaged more than 5,500 ambulance requests each day – about 40% higher than usual, eclipsing the total call volume Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A study by a housing nonprofit found nearly 1 in 4 Charlotte-area tenants have missed rent payments due the first week of April as the economy shut down in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The figures, from a national study by the National Multifamily Housing Council, represent an 8% rise in missed payments from the same time last year. The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group used rental market data from firms including RealPage, which analyzed local figures for The Charlotte Observer. In the Raleigh-Cary area, close to 1 in 5 tenants missed their April rent payments. The national average was nearly 1 in 3, according to the study, which analyzed only market-rate apartments, not subsidized apartments or rental houses. Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Harden told the Observer that this situation should “keep every elected official awake at night.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Some companies in the state have switched gears amid the coronavirus outbreak to make products in short supply, from germ-killing hand cleaner to machines that assist breathing. A Fargo tech company has retooled to make much-needed ventilators, while entrepreneurs and distilleries are racing to make hand sanitizer, which has become hard to find amid the outbreak. Business owners said the shift has helped keep revenue flowing and people employed. And it fills a critical need as the number of people testing positive for the coronavirus continues to climb in North Dakota. “In reality, what we are doing now is the most important thing at this time,” said Joel Kath, owner of Proof Artisan Distillers in Fargo, which has shifted from making whiskey, bourbon, vodka and gin to hand sanitizer. Appareo Systems – which specializes in tech systems for aerospace, agriculture and defense – is aiming to provide 2,000 low-cost ventilators to the state by the end of the month, with employees working around the clock at its Fargo factory, said April Steffan, the company’s marketing director.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As the state fields record unemployment claims, many workers out of a job find themselves scrambling to make ends meet as they wait days or weeks for their claim to be processed and checks to be issued. Nearly 700,000 people filed for unemployment in the past three weeks, the state Department of Job and Family Services said Thursday, almost double the 364,603 claims filed in all of 2019. The 226,007 claims filed for the week ending April 4 marked the second consecutive week that claims topped 200,000. Ohio has paid more than $124 million so far to more than 195,000 people with claims. Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said hundreds have been added to the state call center to handle all the inquires, but he has repeatedly asked people to be patient. People will receive checks for work lost from the day they were laid off, regardless of how long it takes to process the claim, he promised.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The death toll from COVID-19 neared triple digits Saturday as the state takes measures to curb spread of the disease. Six more coronavirus deaths were reported by the Oklahoma State Department of Health, bringing the state death count to 94. About 1,900 people have tested positive for COVID-19, with about 450 needing to go to the hospital. The state has enough available hospital beds, intensive-care unit beds and ventilators to handle even the worst-case predictions for a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations, Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a news conference Friday. The disease has started to break out in state prisons. Stitt approved early release for 450 inmates in an effort reduce crowding after the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed among prison workers and an inmate.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two large health care operations in the state are furloughing employees and cutting costs because of a lack of revenue due to the coronavirus outbreak, furthering cuts to medical facilities in the state. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the Oregon Clinic has furloughed about 820 employees. The Portland Clinic, another physician-owned chain, furloughed 180 employees and cut the pay and hours of 250 others last week. Gov. Kate Brown on March 17 ordered that all elective and non-urgent medical procedures be canceled or rescheduled until at least June 15 to preserve masks and other protective equipment for the state’s COVID-19 response. Richard Jamison, president of The Oregon Clinic, said the company has suffered an 80% decline in revenue. The Portland Clinic’s inpatient revenue has fallen by 90%, said Dick Clark, president of the operation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says the state labor department has started sending out expanded federal unemployment compensation payments provided by the coronavirus relief package approved by Congress. The measure temporarily provides an additional $600 per week and makes self-employed, independent contractors and gig workers eligible for benefits. It also extends unemployment compensation benefits for an additional 13 weeks. The federal benefits are in addition to Pennsylvania’s regular unemployment benefit, which is about half of a person’s full-time weekly income up to $572 per week for 26 weeks. The Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry issued the first $600 payments Friday, and officials said eligible people who filed biweekly claims for the week ending April 4 and who received their regular unemployment compensation payment should expect to see the additional money either Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Sen. Jack Reed is supporting a proposal that would give a salary boost to front-line workers, including nurses, grocery story workers, cleaning staff and letter carriers. The Rhode Island Democrat told WPRI-TV on Saturday that the country should reward those who put their health at risk to help fight COVID-19. The proposal would provide a $25,000 hazard pay increase for those who make less than $200,000 a year. Those who make more than $200,000 would be capped at an additional $5,000. It would also offer a $15,000 essential worker recruitment incentive to help attract and retain workers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Expressing frustration that police officers – charged with enforcing Gov. Henry McMaster’s stay-at-home order during the coronavirus outbreak – are not being told which businesses have been granted permission to stay open, the mayor of the capital city said he was pursuing an open-records request to obtain the information. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin said Friday that he was filing a Freedom of Information Act request for the records, which he said his office has been seeking for several days, so officers know when a business is out of compliance with closure directives. Benjamin said the city receives daily reports from citizens regarding businesses they think are operating outside the confines of the governor’s orders. “Our officers and our fire personnel are dealing with important issues every single day,” Benjamin said. “We can’t run the risk of wasting their time chasing down a complaint that a nonessential business is open, only to show up, and that business presents us with an email from the governor’s office, saying that they’ve been exempted.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Smithfield Foods announced Sunday that it is closing its pork processing plant in Sioux Falls until further notice after hundreds of employees tested positive for the coronavirus – a step the head of the company warned could hurt the nation’s meat supply. The announcement came a day after Gov. Kristi Noem and Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken wrote to Smithfield and urged the company to suspend operations for 14 days so that its workers could self-isolate and the plant could be disinfected. The plant, which employs about 3,700 people in the state’s largest city, has become a hot spot for infections. Health officials said Sunday that 293 of the 730 people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in South Dakota work at the plant. Smithfield announced a three-day closure last week so it could sanitize the plant and install physical barriers to enhance social distancing. But on Sunday, it announced the plant’s indefinite closure.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s top health officials on Friday released some data on confirmed coronavirus cases in the state’s nursing homes but refrained from saying whether patients had died at those facilities. The decision came a few weeks after more than 100 people tested positive for the virus at one nursing home, resulting in more than 10 deaths since. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services completed an investigation at the Gallatin Center for Rehabilitation and Healing last Monday, and the survey results are forthcoming, according to the federal agency. “It is up to the facility, be it the hospital or a long-term care facility, to disclose fatalities among patients or residents,” said Shelley Walker, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, an agency that has been hesitant to release detailed data during the virus outbreak in Tennessee. However, Sumner Regional Medical Center spokesman Kyle Brogdon said Friday that the hospital – which had been treating the Gallatin nursing home residents from the outbreak – would no longer provide information about deaths of patients from the facility because the nursing home had since been reopened.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The state continued to brace over the weekend for a surge in hospital visits driven by the coronavirus pandemic. Officials in Harris County unveiled a temporary overflow hospital that will be able to help take on patients during a heightened onslaught of COVID-19. Medical workers and journalists were taken on a tour of the as-yet-unopened facility on Saturday, the day the U.S. eclipsed Italy for the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the world, surpassing 20,000. Harris County is the state’s most populous with more than 4.2 million residents. “We still haven’t reached the peak,” Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the county’s highest elected official, told reporters Saturday. Hidalgo added the field hospital won’t be used until a sharp increase in coronavirus patients starts taxing existing hospital systems, which she expects to become an issue in the Houston area in two or three weeks. The overflow shelter at Houston’s NRG Park, where the Houston Texans play, will initially have 250 beds with a capacity of 2,000. Officials are setting up a similar overflow unit in Dallas.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State officials started using an emergency alert system Friday to send text messages to drivers entering the state, asking them to report any virus symptoms and a recent travel history. The state declared truck drivers exempt from the system. Hundreds of thousands of truckers enter the state each day carrying essential supplies for grocery stores and medical facilities. Paul Enos, CEO of the Nevada Trucking Association, said the system could interrupt interstate trips and be invasive to drivers who sometimes travel through multiple states a day. Utah officials have said they aren’t punishing people who don’t fill out the online form. “We don’t want to do anything to inhibit commerce … especially right now with our supply-chain issues,” Utah Public Safety Commissioner Jess Anderson said. Truckers were still expected to receive the message, and there were no immediate plans to change the wording on the form to list the exemptions, which also included police, border residents, and airline personnel and passengers.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Farmers’ markets must remain closed under Gov. Phil Scott’s state-of-emergency order. The markets had lobbied to be considered essential businesses like grocery stores, but agriculture secretary Anson Tebbetts said the businesses must stay closed during the state of emergency, which extends through May 15. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Peter Welch is expressing frustration that dairy farmers aren’t getting any immediate relief from the $2 trillion stimulus package. The package, which was approved by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, is meant to help individuals and businesses harmed by the spread of the coronavirus. Welch said farms should be eligible for the $10,000 Small Business Administration emergency loans available to most other businesses, Vermont Public Radio reports. Milk prices have plummeted as the pandemic keeps schools and restaurants closed.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: Nearly 2,000 prisoners with a year or less remaining on their sentences could be eligible for early release under a proposal from Gov. Ralph Northam designed to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Northam announced Friday at a news conference that he is adding an amendment to the state budget that would give the Department of Corrections authority to release inmates with one year or less remaining on their sentences. Northam said only inmates who exhibited good behavior and do not pose a threat to the public would be released. The plan would not go into effect unless the General Assembly approved the amendment at its upcoming April 22 session. In the meantime, Northam said the administration would work on the logistics of such a release, which he said would be a significant undertaking. Inmates scheduled for release are usually placed on reentry plans to ensure details including they have somewhere to go when they are released, he said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Health authorities battling the coronavirus outbreak are trying to figure out how and when social distancing restrictions that have shut down many things across the state can be modified or ended. “That’s what a lot of us are working on now: What’s the end game?” said Dr. Elizabeth Halloran, an infectious-disease specialist and modeler at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who advises the federal government on outbreaks. “What can we do short of keeping everything shut down for 18 months or longer until we have a vaccine?” While an influential University of Washington model suggests deaths and hospitalizations may have peaked in the state, health officials say lifting restrictions too soon could cause cases to surge. The Seattle Times reports the basic approach to controlling COVID-19 is to identify infected people, as well as those who have been exposed, and isolate them. But that would mean a huge scale-up of testing and contact tracing, at a time when even nursing homes still can’t get enough test kits, and public health agencies are swamped.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Nursing homes in the state could run out of masks, gloves and medical gowns in as soon as two weeks amid a nationwide shortage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a trade group leader said Friday. Marty Wright, CEO of the West Virginia Health Care Association, said the supply of personal protective equipment is dwindling as facilities rush to buy gear in a crowded marketplace marred by skyrocketing markups and delayed shipments. “What they’re seeing are shortages nationwide that are creeping into West Virginia,” Wright said. “The supply is not able to meet the demand.” He said he’s heard stories of masks that were less than $1 now going for $5, facilities being supplemented by homemade items, and nursing homes reaching out to overseas vendors as stateside suppliers are swamped.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican legislative leaders announced plans Friday to convene the state Assembly this week for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak began in the state to pass a pandemic relief bill after removing key spending-cut provisions Democratic Gov. Tony Evers opposes. Assembly leaders notified members they they plan to call an extraordinary session beginning Tuesday morning. The session is expected to be conducted virtually, with several members physically present on the floor. It’s unclear when the Senate might convene. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald have been negotiating for days with Evers on a sweeping aid bill. The legislation is designed to supplement a federal stimulus package bringing about $2.3 billion to the state. The bill would eliminate the one-week waiting period for unemployment benefits, delay interest and late fees on property taxes, prohibit health insurers from discriminating against COVID-19 patients, and lift the minimum number of instructional hours for voucher school students, among other things.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Some state residents held a demonstration against government-mandated measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. About 20 people turned out in a park in Casper on Thursday to protest what they believe is government overreach. One demonstrator held a sign demanding Gov. Mark Gordon let the state work. Other signs read “Defend liberty” and “Don’t flatten the economy.” Gordon has ordered schools and a variety of businesses, from bars to movie theaters, to close and has prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people at a time. Police watched the protest but didn’t intervene. Gordon has resisted calls for a statewide stay-at-home order but has urged people to stay at home except for essential work and activities. Cathy Ide with the Natrona County Campaign for Liberty, a libertarian group, told the Casper Star-Tribune the group organized the demonstration because so many businesses were closed. “You drive through Casper, it’s like a ghost town compared to what we usually are,” she said. “You don’t have the usual hustle and bustle, and it’s just sad.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/16/drive-thru-testing-insufficient-gear-school-closures-news-around-states/111428152/", "title": "Drive-thru testing, insufficient gear: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey declared a state of emergency Friday and closed public schools for two-and-a-half weeks as the state reported its first cases of coronavirus. Ivey said all K-12 public schools will close after Wednesday for the break. Some schools were on spring break during part of this time. “Folks, let’s take a common-sense approach and remember calm and steady win the race,” Ivey said in a news conference. “Alabamians should not be fearful but instead use common sense to watch out for ourselves and others.” The Alabama Department of Public Health listed on its website Saturday night that there were a total of 12 known coronavirus cases in the state. The cases were reported in Montgomery, Jefferson, Limestone, Tuscaloosa, Baldwin and Elmore counties. Another case was listed as out of town.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The governor on Friday suspended classes and other activities at public schools, as well as banned visits to a number of correctional facilities, as part of his effort to contain the new coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Mike Dunleavy, working with the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, ordered the suspension of classes and after-school activities from Monday through March 30. He also suspended visits to Department of Corrections facilities, Division of Juvenile Justice facilities, the Alaska Military Youth Academy and the Alaska Psychiatric Institute. And he limited visitation to Alaska Pioneer Homes, which house the elderly. Also on Friday night, organizers of the Iditarod sled dog race said they are moving the 19th checkpoint in the 1,000-mile race out of the community of Shaktoolik to help prevent the transmission of the virus. Meanwhile, lawmakers announced plans to restrict access to the Capitol in Juneau.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A top election official in the state’s most populous county took the unprecedented step Friday of ordering ballots for this week’s Democratic presidential primary mailed to all voters who normally cast ballots at the polls to ensure they can vote with minimal exposure to the new coronavirus. But the move by Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes may not stand and drew some criticism from fellow Democrats, Maricopa County Supervisor Steve Garrado and Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. Republican Mark Brnovich said he was headed to court to ask a judge to block it. Meanwhile, the county board of supervisors said it was closing 78 polling places after churches, nursing homes and others said they no longer felt comfortable welcoming voters to cast ballots, and some poll workers backed out. The county will now have 151 “vote centers” where anyone in the county can vote. The last-minute shuffling injected uncertainty just days before Tuesday’s primary.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Three health care workers are the latest to test positive for the coronavirus in Arkansas, Gov. Asa Hutchinson and state Secretary of Health Dr. Nathaniel Smith said Saturday. The three are connected to the state’s first confirmed case, Smith said. “All three of those were health care workers who came into contact with our first patient in Pine Bluff” and are now quarantined, Smith said. Also Saturday, the Pulaski County jail in Little Rock said visitation has been suspended until further notice, despite no cases at the jail, to help contain the spread of the virus, which causes only mild or moderate symptoms in most people. The number of coronavirus cases in Arkansas is now 12, Hutchinson said, up from nine announced Friday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Californians wanting to escape the new reality of the coronavirus at the movies, casino or amusement park are running into the 6-foot rule. State health officials issued new guidance Saturday urging theaters to keep attendance under 250 people and ask strangers to sit 6 feet apart. The Department of Public Health said ushers should monitor theaters to ensure people are keeping appropriate social distance, while ensuring family members can sit and stand in line together. A similar guideline issued to gambling venues, urging them to limit 250 people per room and clean chips and slot machines more frequently, led the operator of the state’s largest card rooms to shut starting Saturday. Theme parks and attractions were told to thin out crowds by staggering attendance. California has about 250 confirmed cases and recorded its sixth death Friday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State lawmakers paused their legislative session Saturday over fears of the coronavirus outbreak and the disease it causes, COVID-19. The Legislature passed a resolution to take a two-week recess. It comes 67 days into the 120-day legislative session, with the budget and several major bills pending or yet to be introduced. House Speaker KC Becker, a Boulder Democrat, acknowledged the recess could last longer than two weeks. Lawmakers must pass a budget by June 30. Lawmakers are also asking the state Supreme Court for clarity on whether the session must be conducted over 120 consecutive days, or if they can continue the session where they left off. Dozens of people have tested positive for the coronovirus in Colorado, and one person has died, an elderly woman with underlying health conditions in El Paso County, south of Denver.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The first case of the coronavirus in the Hartford area has been identified, officials said Saturday, as the number of cases across the state rose to at least 20. The patient, a woman in her 80s, lives in Rocky Hill and was being treated at Hartford Hospital, city and hospital officials said. Most of cases of COVID-19 in the state have been in communities near the New York state line. Fairfield County had at least 15 known cases as of Saturday evening. The Hartford Courant reported the nursing chief of Yale-New Haven Health and two hospital patients tested positive, citing a memo distributed within the health network Saturday. Efforts to test for the virus around the state are expanding. Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said he assumes there are other cases of the virus in the Hartford area.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A state of emergency took effect in the state Friday because of the new coronavirus as Gov. John Carney also ordered all public schools closed through March 27. The state of emergency prohibits price gouging and encourages the cancellation of “nonessential” public gatherings of 100 people or more, giving state officials authority to cancel them for public health reasons. Businesses and state offices remain open. The emergency declaration also bans out-of-state travel for state employees and allows state agencies to conduct public meetings electronically. Lawmakers had already postponed next week’s legislative session. Meanwhile, state public health officials are providing less information, not more, about the coronavirus situation in Delaware on a Division of Public Health website and failed to list three new cases as being under investigation before announcing Thursday that test results had come back positive.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city is under a state of emergency with 16 cases of coronavirus confirmed, WUSA-TV reports, prompting D.C. schools to be closed until April 1 and the government to operate on a modified schedule to mitigate the spread of the virus. An additional six cases announced Saturday include patients ranging from 28 to 67 years old. As of Saturday, 115 people had tested positive for the coronavirus in D.C. Beginning Monday and running through March 31, the district’s government will operate on a modified schedule to prevent the spread of the coronavirus for the safety of the community. Some government operations will be performed fully remotely, and other services will remain at public buildings under modified operations, Mayor Muriel Bowser said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Saturday banned most visits to nursing homes statewide as he acknowledged the coronavirus has likely spread into the general population. Meanwhile, officials closed world-famous South Beach to prevent college spring breakers from congregating. Hours after DeSantis held a news conference at the state’s emergency management headquarters, health officials confirmed the death of a 77-year-old Lee County man who previously tested positive for COVID-19. Officials said the latest fatality, the third in Florida so far, had not contracted the infection through travel. DeSantis said three infected Broward County residents also initially appeared to have contracted it through community spread. The state’s known infections – which include Miami’s mayor – now exceed 60 after the numbers jumped by a third Saturday.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s March 24 presidential primaries will be postponed to May, election officials announced Saturday as cases of coronavirus in the state jumped and as Gov. Brian Kemp activated the National Guard and signed an emergency declaration unlocking sweeping powers to fight the disease threat. In-person early voting, which began statewide March 2, will be halted and the election moved to May 19, when Georgia’s other 2020 primary elections are being held, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement. Election officials said in addition to the safety of the public, one of the biggest considerations was the risk the virus posed to poll workers, who are often older. Kemp said the number of cases caused by the new coronavirus rose Saturday to 66 from 42 on Friday, and he said it was the largest numerical increase in a 24-hour-period since Georgia detected its first case.\n\nHawaii\n\nLahaina: An adult couple who had previous close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 on the mainland have themselves tested positive for the new coronavirus disease while spending nearly two weeks vacationing in Hawaii, Gov. David Ige said Saturday. The two have shown signs of improvement and are being isolated at a Kauai County-provided unit, Ige said during a news conference. The couple were seen at several urgent care facilities and a hospital. “We are aware that three health care workers who treated them were not wearing appropriate personal protective devices, so we have contacted them,” Ige said. Those workers are now self-isolating. The couple flew on a direct United Airlines flight from the mainland to Maui and spent March 2-8 at hotel in Lahaina, Ige said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Health officials announced the state’s first confirmed coronavirus case Friday and said its second and third cases were identified Saturday. Boise State University will move instruction for more than 30,000 students online to combat the virus’ spread, and the rest of Idaho’s public higher education institutions will follow suit by April 1. The first positive case of coronavirus was a woman in her 50s in southwestern Idaho in highly populated Ada County, which includes Boise. The second case was a Blaine County woman in her 50s, according to the South Central Public Health District. The Idaho Statesman reports the third case an Ada County man in his 50s who had no underlying medical issues, the Central District Health department said Saturday night. The news came several hours after Little declared a state of emergency for at least 30 days.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s number of coronavirus cases rose to 66 from 48 as residents with the illness emerged in central and southern regions of the state, officials said Saturday. The mayor of Chicago, meanwhile, urged political candidates to avoid face-to-face campaigning, while polling places in some communities were changed from senior housing centers ahead of the primary election Tuesday. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the state health department, said the number of Illinois cases should “increase dramatically” as results come in from private labs. “It is vitally important that we implement social distancing measures, such as staying home and canceling large events,” Ezike said. Gov. J.B. Pritzker appeared annoyed with St. Patrick’s Day party crowds in Chicago, calling out the “young and healthy” for not following recommendations. And he said the long lines of travelers standing shoulder-to-shoulder at O’Hare International Airport amid enhanced screening were “unacceptable” and called on the federal government to “solve this.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Three new cases of coronavirus emerged in Indiana, raising the number in the state to 19, officials say. Among the new COVID-19 cases are residents of Hamilton, Marion, LaPorte and Wells counties, the state Department of Health said. The other cases are people in Adams, Boone, Hendricks, Howard, Johnson, Noble and St. Joseph counties. All are adults with one exception. There have been no deaths. Gov. Eric Holcomb has declined to order all schools to close to reduce spread of the virus, unlike governors in other states. He said it should be a local decision. Casinos and racetracks will be closed for at least two weeks, starting Monday, state regulators said. Indianapolis Power & Light, which has more than 500,000 customers, said it’s suspending electricity shutoffs until April 15 for people with unpaid bills. The utility said it “recognizes the impact and stress COVID-19 is causing in people’s daily lives.”\n\nIowa\n\nJohnston: A Dallas County resident who hadn’t traveled out of state has tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the first “community spread” of the virus in Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Saturday night. Speaking at a news conference in the State Emergency Operations Center in Johnston, Reynolds said the 18th person who has tested positive for the COVID-19 was between 61 and 80 years old. While others who tested positive had been infected after being in regions where the disease was more widespread, the latest case indicates the virus was becoming more common in Iowa. Reynolds said people should avoid gatherings of more than 250 people. Despite actions by other governors to cancel school, Reynolds said she wouldn’t support such a move unless more people tested positive. Many colleges have opted to shift to online classes, and Des Moines Public Schools has extended spring break because of the disease.\n\nKansas\n\nOttawa: Health officials on Saturday confirmed the state’s eighth novel coronavirus case in a person from Franklin County in eastern Kansas. The news follows on the heels of the Johnson County Department of Health and Environment announcing Saturday morning the state’s seventh case – a woman in her 50s associated with Johnson County Community College. That case is the county’s first believed to have been contracted locally, the release said. In all four other COVID-19 cases reported in Johnson County, the patients became infected while traveling out of state. Health officials in Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita, banned all public gatherings larger than 250 attendees until further notice, even though the county has no confirmed cases. The ban also applies to large church gatherings, said Dr. Gerald Minns, the county’s health officer. Gov. Laura Kelly has declared a state of emergency, and large gatherings at the Statehouse have been banned.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear preached social distancing during a daily update Saturday and said one newly diagnosed coronavirus patient had resisted a quarantine. Beshear said Kentucky now has 18 cases, and officials are awaiting more than two dozen test results. The newest positives for the novel coronavirus were in Fayette, Montgomery and Nelson counties. The patient in Nelson refused to self-quarantine, Beshear said. The man was being kept at home Saturday with a law enforcement officer nearby. “It’s a step I hoped I never had to take, but we can’t allow one person we know who has this virus to refuse to protect their neighbors,” Beshear said. Beshear also said child care centers in the state should consider temporarily closing within 72 hours. The state’s court system took steps Friday to halt most proceedings in response to the virus, and all public schools are closed for at least two weeks.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Mayor LaToya Cantrell said she was “deeply disappointed” that people ignored a ban on large gatherings issued by Gov. John Bel Edwards to try to stop the spread of coronavirus. St. Patrick’s Day revelers in kilts and green shamrocks packed a city street Saturday, though the city’s official parade had been canceled, The Times-Picayune-New Orleans Advocate reports. New Orleans police later broke up a party at a bar. The gatherings occurred as Louisiana announced its first death from coronavirus – a 58-year-old Orleans Parish resident with underlying health problems. The state reported its second death Sunday, a 53-year-old Orleans Parish resident who had underlying medical conditions and was being treated at Touro Infirmary, according to the governor’s office. Cantrell said in a statement that the person was a friend of hers. Edwards also has postponed the state’s presidential primaries due to fears about the virus.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The third person to test presumptively positive for the new coronavirus in the state is a woman in her 40s from Cumberland County who was in close household contact with another person who received a positive test, health officials said Saturday. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said its “immediate concern is for the care and treatment of the individuals who have presumptively tested positive,” the agency said in a statement. The number of people testing positive in Maine for the coronavirus grew from one to two Friday, the agency said, noting that a man in his 50s was screened at a MaineHealth outpatient clinic in Portland and is in self-isolation at home in Cumberland County. The first positive case the day before involved a woman in her 50s in Androscoggin County.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan has signed an executive order to expand child care access for critical personnel during a state of emergency in response to coronavirus while schools are closed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Hogan says he signed the order Saturday to ensure that child care services are available for providers of health care, emergency medical services and law enforcement. Hogan says it’s part of the state’s commitment to maintaining essential services during a state of emergency, especially for those on the front lines helping to fight the public health threat.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston Marathon on Friday was postponed for five months due to the coronavirus pandemic, sacrificing the customary Patriots Day start in the hopes of preserving the uninterrupted 124-year tradition of the world’s most prestigious long-distance run. In delaying the marathon from April 20 to Sept. 14, the city avoids for now an event that draws more than 30,000 runners from around the world, packs them in buses and starting corrals, and then sends them off on a 26.2-mile trek from Hopkinton to Boston’s Back Bay. An estimated 1 million people line the course as it winds through eight cities and towns, high-fiving, hugging and even kissing the runners along the way. The Boston Marathon has never been canceled since the first edition in 1897; the 2013 race was stopped when two bombs exploded at the finish line, several hours after the winners had finished but while many runners were still on the course.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order Sunday in an effort to curb price-gouging of emergency supplies and food during the coronavirus outbreak. The temporary restrictions, which takes effect Monday, said a person or business can’t resell a good or product at a price that is “grossly in excess of the purchase price of the product.” Also, a business or individuals can’t sell a product in the state at a price that is more than 20% higher than what they were charged unless the price increase is “due to bringing the product to market.” The restrictions are in place through April 13. The total number of confirmed Michigan coronavirus cases is 33, according to officials. Patients include Detroit Pistons player Christian Wood and a person linked to Michigan State University, which has postponed May graduation events.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The number of cases of the new coronavirus in the state has risen to 21 and now includes a rural county, health officials said Saturday. The Minnesota Department of Health reported the number of cases had risen by seven since Friday. Among the new cases is a person in their 30s in Renville County, in southwestern Minnesota. Wright and Washington counties also reported new cases. All but one of Minnesota’s patients are recovering at home, Infectious Disease Division Director Kris Ehresmann said. A patient in Anoka County was in critical condition earlier in the week. On Friday, Gov. Tim Walz declared a peacetime state of emergency to limit the spread of COVID-19 and issued a series of recommendations for Minnesotans to take to limit the spread of the disease, such as canceling or postponing gatherings of 250 people or more.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The governor declared a state of emergency to help fight coronavirus in the state and said he will work from home for two weeks after returning Friday from a family trip to Spain. “I urge all Mississippians to use caution,” Tate Reeves said in a video released Saturday. “This is not a time to panic. We are acting calmly and steadily.” Of 90 people tested throughout the state, 10 came up positive. At least three women older than 65 were in hospitals, the state Health Department said. Reeves has asked schools to close for at least a week and urged state employees to work from home if possible. He said the state would close driver’s license offices to avert possible spread there, and he called on churches not to hold in-person services Sunday.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Health officials say a fifth person has tested positive for coronavirus in the state. The Department of Health and Senior Services said Saturday that the latest case is an individual in Greene County who tested positive for COVID-19 after traveling. Officials said earlier Saturday that the state’s fourth case was a person from western Missouri’s Henry County. The patient was hospitalized at Golden Valley Memorial Hospital in Clinton before to being transferred March 8 to another facility, where the patient remains for treatment. Golden Valley Memorial Hospital has now been placed on diversion for emergency services and been told not to admit new patients, the department said. The state said two positive cases have been reported in St. Louis County and one additional case in Greene County. Residents braved rainy weather Saturday to line up at a drive-thru testing site in suburban St. Louis for the virus.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The lieutenant governor has put himself in quarantine after he attended a meeting in which one of the participants later tested positive for the new coronavirus. Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney was at a Board of Regents meeting March 5 in Dillon when he came in contact with the person from Silver Bow County who had the virus, said Marissa Perry, a spokeswoman for Gov. Steve Bullock. In a statement, she said Cooney “has been asymptomatic.” The Helena Independent Record reported that Montana Commissioner of Higher Education Clayton Christian was at the meeting with Cooney and has the virus. Earlier Saturday, Bullock said there were two more cases of the virus in the state: a woman in her 30s and a man in his 50s in Missoula County. On Friday, Bullock announced Montana had its first four cases. Prior to that, the state was one of only a handful in the nation with no cases.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials have identified the state’s first coronavirus case transmitted through community spread, along with two new travel-related cases. The Douglas County Health Department said Saturday that a woman in her 60s who was previously diagnosed with COVID-19 started having symptoms before she traveled. Community spread of the virus indicates it is becoming more common in Nebraska because the origin of the case can’t be identified. Two additional travel-related cases were confirmed Saturday in Douglas County, a 56-year-old man who traveled to and from Spain and a 31-year-old man who came to th area from Singapore. Nebraska now has 16 cases of COVID-19, including 14 in Douglas County. Gov. Pete Ricketts said gatherings of more than 250 people should be avoided now that the virus is spreading in the community. He said he would wait for a second community spread case in Omaha before ordering schools there to close for six to eight weeks.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Casino companies in the state announced more measures Friday to combat the spread of the new coronavirus, with the biggest resort owner on the Las Vegas Strip immediately closing all nightclubs, day clubs, spas, salons and gyms at its properties. MGM Resorts International announced the moves as President Donald Trump declared a national emergency and less than 24 hours after Gov. Steve Sisolak declared a state of emergency in Nevada while hinting he may consider banning mass gatherings, as other governors have done. Officials at University of Nevada campuses in Reno and Las Vegas responded by canceling on-campus instruction. They’ll go to online-only classes when students return from spring break March 23. In all, authorities report more than 20 positive tests statewide. No deaths have been reported.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The Legislature has suspended all legislative activities until at least Friday to help curtail the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. State officials said late Saturday the State House will be closed to legislative members, staff and visitors. However, it will remain open for governmental operations until further notice, officials said. New Hampshire Senate President Donna Soucy and Speaker of the House Steve Shurtleff, both Democrats, said in a joint statement that the move is about “protecting the health and wellbeing of our members, staff and the public.” The state’s total number of presumptive positive test results of the new coronavirus rose to seven because of a case involving a woman who was at a Division of Motor Vehicles office in Manchester, public health authorities in the state said late Friday. Officials said the state is working to identify people who had close contact with the woman before she went into self-isolation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Officials are considering a statewide curfew to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Phil Murphy said Sunday morning. Hoboken already implemented one – from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. – starting Monday. Murphy was asked about curfews and self-quarantine after Teaneck Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin called for a citywide self-quarantine for the Bergen County town hit hard by COVID-19. “We’re not there at a statewide level on either of those steps, but we could be,” Murphy said on WBLS-FM 107.5. “The curfew is probably, of the two, is probably the more immediate one under consideration.” Murphy on Saturday night announced the second death in the state from coronavirus, a woman in her 50s who was being cared for at CentraState Medical Center in Monmouth County. The total number of cases was 98 as of Sunday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Drive-up COVID-19 testing is now available at a clinic outside the downtown Lovelace Medical Center from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. seven days a week, with nasal swabs taken while patients remain in cars and results available within 48 to 72 hours, the Albuquerque Journal reports. In other virus-related developments, state officials announced Saturday that New Mexico had three additional virus cases, and the state Department of Health ordered nursing homes to limit visitation to prevent spread of the disease. The state is closing K-12 schools for three weeks starting Monday in its effort to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus but will leave most cafeterias and school health care offices open in a state with the second-highest rate of childhood poverty in the nation. Officials also have banned mass gatherings that involve 100 or more people in spaces such as stadiums or auditoriums as a way to limit the spread of the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: As schools across the U.S. shut down in hopes of helping to fight the coronavirus, New York City officials are arguing just the opposite: They’re keeping the nation’s largest school system open to ensure health and emergency workers aren’t tied down with kids at home. But teachers, many parents and some health experts say the city is making a grave mistake by continuing to call more than 1.1 million children to public schools even as it calls for “social distancing” elsewhere to stem the virus’s spread. The state has reported its third death in the pandemic, a 79-year-old woman who officials say died Sunday at an undisclosed hospital in the city. The total number of people in New York diagnosed with the virus has risen to 729, the most in any U.S. state. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he believes thousands of New Yorkers, possibly tens of thousands, already have the disease.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Saturday ordered all public schools in the state to close for at least two weeks. “We know that it will be difficult on many parents and students,” Cooper said at a news conference. “Our lives have been turned upside down by this pandemic. But we’re going to get through this.” The closing of all K-12 public schools will begin Monday and continue for at least two weeks. Cooper said he is also issuing an executive order banning all gatherings of more than 100 people. He had already strongly discouraged large gatherings but said several venues continued their events. The governor’s order makes it mandatory. And courts are delaying criminal and civil proceedings to limit courthouse visits amid other statewide recommendations so as to blunt the intensity of coronavirus, the state’s top judicial official announced Friday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum said Friday that he has declared a state of emergency to combat the new coronavirus pandemic, but he said schools will remain open. Burgum told reporters the declaration gives him the ability to activate the National Guard if necessary. But he said unlike other states, North Dakota will keep K-12 schools open. “We are making decisions based on facts, not on fear,” Burgum said. North Dakota has confirmed only one case of the disease. Ten more tests were completed Friday, but all were negative, Burgum said. Health officials said the Ward County man in his 60s traveled to the East Coast and had contact with a person who also tested positive for the disease. He has isolated himself at home, and his symptoms appear to be mild. In response to the pandemic, Sanford Health has a new visitor policy at its facilities restricting all visitation to immediate family members and allowing only one visitor at a time.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine says it’s possible the state’s schools may be closed for the rest of the academic year. The governor, speaking on CNN’s “State of the Nation” on Sunday morning, cited projections that the virus may not peak until the latter part of April or May and said that “it would not surprise me at all if schools did not open again this year.” DeWine on Thursday ordered every school in Ohio to close for three weeks beginning at day’s end Monday. The state health director also issued an order banning gatherings of over 100 people, although some places such as airports and restaurants are exempted, along with events such as weddings, funerals and religious gatherings. On Saturday, officials said 12 men and 14 women ranging in age from 31 to 86 have tested positive for the coronavirus – twice the number announced Friday. Seven people were hospitalized, and 264 people were being tested for COVID-19. There have been no reported deaths.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The governor faced backlash on social media after tweeting a picture of himself and two of his children at a crowded restaurant Saturday at a time when health officials have been recommending social distancing. In the since-deleted tweet, Gov. Kevin Stitt wrote: “Eating with my kids and all my fellow Oklahomans at the @CollectiveOKC. It’s packed tonight!” Stitt was at a food hall in Oklahoma City. Stitt’s position on the coronavirus outbreak has not changed from instructions he previously gave to Oklahoma residents, Charlie Hannema, a spokesman for the governor, said Sunday. Those include to follow health precautions and to protect elderly and vulnerable populations but also to remain calm, live one’s life and support local businesses. “The governor will continue to take his family out to dinner and to the grocery store without living in fear and encourages Oklahomans to do the same,” Hannema said in an email. By contrast, the mayor of Tulsa on Saturday temporarily banned events that would bring 250 or more people to city-owned facilities by revoking their special event permits.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: As schools close this week, child care regulators are considering whether to let some day care providers take in more children than currently allowed. Oregon now has one death and 35 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. The department said three of the new cases confirmed over the weekend are in Washington County, two in Deschutes County and one in Linn County. Oregon schools will close Monday and remain closed until April 1. Students already have spring break for one of those weeks. Oregon has also banned all gatherings of more than 250 people statewide for four weeks. The Office of Child Care told providers it will process emergency requests to operate outside of licensing limits, in an attempt to address both an increased demand for care and potential staffing shortages, according to The Oregonian/OregonLive.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State health officials have announced more presumptive positive cases of the coronavirus, bringing the statewide total to 63 cases, and the governor urged nonessential businesses in two more Philadelphia-area counties to shut down amid the outbreak. Gov. Tom Wolf extended to Chester and Bucks counties a call for certain businesses to close, echoing a voluntary call made to Montgomery and Delaware counties. He said essential infrastructure such as pharmacies, grocery stores and gas stores will remain open, and officials said travel is not being restricted. State officials said nonessential businesses include community and recreation centers; gyms, including yoga, barre and spin facilities; hair salons, nail salons and spas; casinos; concert venues; theaters; bars; sporting event venues and golf courses; and retail facilities except for pharmacy or other health care facilities within retail operations. Restaurants are urged only to remain open for carry-out and delivery orders.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state has risen from 14 to 20, officials announced Saturday. The new cases are not a surprise, and Rhode Islanders should expect more as the virus spreads, Gov. Gina Raimondo said. Raimondo, a Democrat, encouraged local religious groups to cancel weekend services and called on high school and college students not to use their unexpected break from classes as an opportunity to gather with friends. Officials said Friday that about 200 people have been tested for the coronavirus in the state to date. Because of the virus, the state’s health insurance exchange, HealthSourceRI, will open a special enrollment period to allow Rhode Islanders to enroll for coverage. The enrollment window opens Monday and runs through April 15. Raimondo also announced a series of other changes to insurance regulations intended to ensure people can get care if they become infected. They include a mandate allowing patients to be tested and screened for the virus at no cost to them.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster is announcing temporary closures for schools across the state beginning Monday through the end of the month as more cases of coronavirus continue to emerge, his office says. Schools will be closed for two weeks and food centers set up for students reliant on food provided in schools. On Friday, the governor declared a state of emergency in Kershaw and Lancaster counties, where coronavirus has been the most severe. An executive order also suspended visitation at state and local correctional institutions and directed state health officials to restrict visitation at nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The governor also granted state agencies the ability to allow older or at-risk employees to work from home and asked utility companies not to suspend or disconnect services for nonpayment. On Saturday, state health officials said they were investigating six additional cases of COVID-19, bringing the statewide total to 19.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem ordered a state of emergency Friday and instructed public schools to close in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Officials said another person had tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the state’s total to nine. Noem said the drop-off in positive test results and the absence of signs of community spread were “encouraging” but took the step of ordering the state of emergency as a “proactive” measure. The move marks an intensification of Noem’s response to the virus outbreak. She ordered all public schools to close for a week to clean facilities and prepare for the potential of reopening the following week. She also said the state’s high school athletics association would postpone the state basketball tournament scheduled for this week and next. All nonessential state employees will be working from home as part of the measure, the governor said. Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said the state is expecting a new shipment of tests for the coronavirus in the next few days.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Friday halted all nonessential business travel for state employees, banned visitors and tours from the state Capitol, and heavily discouraged groups of 250 or more from gathering as the coronavirus pandemic ramps up, with 39 confirmed cases Sunday. Lee’s administration has also advised school districts to “exercise discretion” when canceling school for K-12 students but held off from mandating any closures, as some other states have already done. The governor’s office added that school-provided meals will still continue regardless of closures. Along with the Capitol, top lawmakers have also agreed to close the state’s legislative office building to the public beginning Monday, and the state Supreme Court suspended all in-person judicial proceedings until the end of the month. The Supreme Court order applies to state and local courts, including appellate, trial, general session, juvenile and municipal courts.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The city is the latest Texas community to prohibit large gatherings as a way to help stop the spread of the new coronavirus, issuing an order Saturday barring public and private events and other community gatherings of more than 250 people. The order also covers Travis County, where Austin is located. Events that could be part of the ban include weddings, religious gatherings and funerals. The ban will continue until at least May 1. In South Texas, Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevino Jr. on Saturday ordered all county-sponsored events with more than 250 people to be canceled or suspended for at least 14 days. Last week Dallas banned public gatherings of more than 500 people for at least seven days. The governor declared a state of disaster Friday as the pandemic spread to every major city and swept new worries through the 50,000-student campus at the University of Texas, which abruptly canceled classes after the wife of the school president tested positive.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Nine more residents of Salt Lake County have contracted the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the state’s most populated county to 14, health officials said Saturday. All of the new cases are linked to travel or contact with a person who has the virus, the Salt Lake County Health Department said in a statement. The department said it “doesn’t believe any of the cases are a result of local transmission in Salt Lake County.” Eleven of the 14 cases are adults over the age of 18, and three are children, the department said. Two of the infected children attended school while they had the virus. Potentially affected are Hunter High School in West Valley City and Entheos Academy, a charter school with campuses in Magna and Kearns, the department said. The department said it instructed students and staff of both schools to quarantine at home until March 27 and monitor themselves for symptoms.\n\nVermont\n\nStowe: Public health officials said Sunday the state is the site of another three cases of the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the state to eight. Four of the state’s cases have involved Vermonters, and the others have been visitors, the Department of Health said Sunday. The new cases all involve visitors. State health officials are in touch with authorities in Massachusetts and New York while a health department team works to investigate the patients’ travel histories, authorities said. The state had announced three new cases Saturday, which brought the number of cases in Vermont to five at the time. Meanwhile, ski resorts have announced closures designed to help prevent the spread of the virus. Killington Resort and Pico Mountain are both scheduled to be closed through March 22. Stowe Mountain, Stratton Mountain and Sugarbush Resort also announced closures.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam on Sunday banned all public gatherings of more than 100 people statewide and ordered a two-week shutdown of municipal offices in an area of southeast Virginia that has been hit by a cluster of coronavirus cases, including the state’s first death from the virus. Northam made the announcement after meeting with local officials in the Peninsula Health District, where eight people have tested positive for the virus, including one man in his 70s who died of respiratory failure caused by the virus. The peninsula covers Williamsburg, Newport News, Poquoson, James City County and York County. Statewide, 45 people have tested positive for the virus, Northam said. Northam stopped short of ordering a full statewide quarantine but urged residents, particularly people who live in the peninsula district, to avoid crowds. Local officials urged people in the district to avoid gatherings of more than 50 people.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The death toll from the new coronavirus in the state jumped to 40 on Saturday when King County health officials reported three new fatalities – two from the nursing home that’s been the epicenter of the outbreak. The state reported Saturday that almost 650 people across Washington have tested positive in 16 counties. Health officials struggling with containment say they they have not received the equipment they need. The increase in people visiting clinics with respiratory symptoms is straining the state’s supply of personal protective gear worn by health care workers, officials say. The federal government has sent the state tens of thousands of respirators, gowns, gloves and other protective gear for health care providers, but it’s not enough, said Clark Halvorson, Assistant Secretary of Health for Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Schools in the state will remain closed through at least March 27, Gov. Jim Justice announced Saturday in response to the coronavirus pandemic, even though the state doesn’t have a confirmed case. A release from the governor’s office Saturday said no return date has been set for students, but they will be out for at least two weeks. Also on Saturday, two large hospital systems in the state announced restricted visitations. The WVU Health System, which includes a dozen hospitals around the state, said patients would be allowed have only one visitor at a time, and children under 16 were not permitted in the hospitals. WVU encouraged people to make minimum visits. CAMC Health System is also limiting visits to one per patient from noon to 6 p.m. Justice said that with so few tests being done, people could be infected and not know it. He said that “we just haven’t found it yet, but it’s got to be here.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the state jumped to 32 on Sunday, and Milwaukee County shut down its zoo to try to stem the spread of the pandemic. Milwaukee County officials announced they were closing the Milwaukee County Zoo; Milwaukee County Parks facilities, including the Mitchell Park Domes; and the county’s senior centers. On Friday, Gov. Tony Evers ordered all of Wisconsin’s K-12 schools to close by the coming week. The move will affect nearly a million students and their families for at least the next several weeks. Courts in the area will be virtually closed starting Monday for three to six weeks. Milwaukee and Waukesha county circuit courts as well as federal courts have postponed nearly all in-person events and hearings. Some that can be done be phone of video conferencing will proceed as scheduled, but no one need report for jury duty.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon declared an emergency Friday to devote health officials and National Guard troops to a potential surge in cases of the new coronavirus. The state of emergency and public health emergency signed by Gordon also orders the state Department of Homeland Security to respond to the potential health threat as needed. The governor’s moves came as the state announced Friday night that a second resident has been diagnosed with the virus. The Wyoming Department of Health said the patient is an older man from Fremont County who is in a hospital. The other case is of a Sheridan County woman who was diagnosed Wednesday. She had a relatively mild case and was improving, health officials said. It’s possible other cases have gone unidentified in Wyoming, State Epidemiologist Dr. Ali Harrist said at a news conference with Gordon on Friday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/03/ballet-for-seniors-dr-fauci-boblehead-patrots-plane-ferries-95-masks-news-from-around-our-50-states/2938509001/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey is not ready to issue a shelter-in-place order as other governors have, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, arguing the state has taken aggressive action to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Republican governors in Florida, Mississippi and Georgia on Wednesday reversed course and issued stay-home directives after previously resisting such a statewide order. But Ivey’s office said Wednesday that the governor is not ready to follow suit. A spokeswoman for Ivey said the governor has not ruled anything out, but hopes the state will not have to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order. Alabama last week announced the closure of nonessential businesses, such as salons, gyms and many retail stores and a prohibition of gatherings of 10 people or more that are not work-related where people can’t stay at least 6 feet apart. The previous limit had been 25. The state had earlier announced the closure of public and private beaches, on-site restaurant dining and that students would finish the school year by doing distance learning at home. Alabama’s “safer at home” policy urges people to stay home but does not order them to do so.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state accused an Anchorage man of buying respirators and selling them at “unconscionable prices” online to profit off coronavirus concerns. The complaint against Juan Lyle Aune alleged violations of a law barring unfair trade and commerce practices. It seeks financial penalties. Court records did not list an attorney for Aune, and a phone listing tried by the Associated Press didn’t work. The complaint alleged Aune generally bought 20-packs of respirators for between $17 and $23 from local stores. Between Feb. 10 and March 16, he sold respirators on Amazon at an average price of $89.25, the complaint states and alleged he made other sales on eBay. Reselling the respirators for “unconscionable prices during a time of increased necessity and high demand … offends public policy,” violates fairness concepts and and is unethical, the complaint stated. Assistant Attorney General John Haley, by email, said price-gouging involves taking advantage of an emergency. He said factors developed by the Alaska Supreme Court to help determine when an action is unfair under the law include whether it violates generally accepted fairness standards; is immoral, unethical, unscrupulous or oppressive; and whether it hurts people or businesses.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Some shooting ranges in metro Phoenix are closing to the public or restricting hours in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Arizona Game and Fish Department announced that Ben Avery Shooting Facility in north Phoenix, off Interstate 17 and the Carefree Highway, is closed to the public until further notice. The rifle and pistol ranges at Ben Avery are still open to law enforcement officers and user groups, which have mandated insurance and use ranges for firearms training and education. The Ben Avery archery range remains open to the public from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Only cash payments left in the drop box are accepted. Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday issued a statewide stay-at-home order, which will run through April. Although Ducey encouraged Arizonans to stay home to curb the spread of COVID-19, he said it’s important for residents to be able to go outside for recreation, as long as they practice social distancing. Privately operated ranges are still open across the Valley, but many are cutting hours and services. The Usery Mountain Shooting Range, on Ellsworth Road near the Usery Mountain Regional Park in the far East Valley, is limiting services to curb the spread of the virus. The range, which is operated by the Rio Salado Sportsman’s Club on land owned by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, is postponing all competitions, user groups and organized activities through the end of May, the range announced. The main public range, member range and sporting clays course are still open to the public. Indoor ranges, which often rent and sell firearms, are open with limited hours.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Buffalo National River was temporarily closed Thursday because of coronavirus concerns. The National Park Service said the closure takes effect immediately and includes the river, trails, campgrounds and open spaces. “It breaks my heart to have to close this incredible public park,” Buffalo National River superintendent Mark Foust said in a release. “It is, however, the right thing to do to protect the people that work here, live here, visit here, and love this place.” Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Wednesday asked the federal government to close the park and imposed temporary restrictions on state parks, including prohibiting overnight use at them. Hutchinson, legislators and local officials have complained about large numbers of people crowding the Buffalo National River area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A British man accused of smuggling a phony coronavirus cure into the United States was charged with a federal crime, prosecutors said. Frank Richard Ludlow, 59, of West Sussex was charged in Los Angeles federal court with introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce and could face up to three years in federal prison if convicted, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. He was arrested last week on drug charges in the United Kingdom and remains in custody there, authorities said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had an attorney. Prosecutors alleged that Ludlow, who isn’t a doctor, had been selling people in California and Utah via mail a concoction called “Trinity Remedy” that he touted as a “miracle cure” for various ailments, according to a court affidavit. “This cure’ – later rebranded as ‘Trinity Mind, Body & Soul’ – allegedly contained vitamin C, an enzyme mix, potassium thiocyanate, and hydrogen peroxide. Consumers were instructed to add 18 ounces of water, say a prayer, drink half of the solution, take a probiotic along with bee pollen, and then ingest the remainder of the solution,” the U.S. attorney’s office statement said. Authorities said Ludlow sold between 300 and 400 of the treatment kits, but in February or March, as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, he began selling the kits under a new name: “Trinity COVID-19 SARS Antipathogenic Treatment.” The treatments haven’t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any medical use. “Every major health authority has warned that there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and no vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection,” according to the U.S. attorney’s office. “Hucksters who hawk ‘treatments’ for this deadly disease put consumers’ lives at risk by peddling unapproved drugs.”\n\nColorado\n\nColorado: In the past two weeks, Northern Colorado shelters and rescue groups have seen dramatic spikes in adoption and foster applications. As adoptions soar during the coronavirus epidemic, fewer pets are being surrendered to the Larimer Humane Society, said Tylor Starr, marketing and community outreach program manager. Although they have shut down adoptions through April 17 because of the stay-at-home order, the humane society is still providing lost-and-found, urgent owner surrender and end-of-life services to alleviate animal suffering, he said. Between March 18 and March 25, the humane society adopted out 83 animals, a 28% increase, and witnessed a 41% decrease in surrenders compared with the same time last year. The humane society still has 51 animals in foster homes and 53 more foster homes on standby. Starr said he doesn’t anticipate the need for more foster families at the moment. Bounce Animal Rescue in Fort Collins has seen a threefold increase in adoption applications and a flood of families stepping up to foster dogs, said executive director Anneliese Clark. Before the pandemic, Bounce typically received five to 10 adoption applications per dog. Now, it’s seeing 30 applications per animal and getting about 50 foster home applications a day. Weekly adoption events are on hold during the pandemic, but Bounce is still doing virtual appointments with potential adopters, “low-contact” handoffs for adoptions and a one-week trial for all adoptions to make sure the match is a good fit.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two members of the Connecticut National Guard are among the latest state residents to test positive for COVID-19. An airman assigned to the 103rd Airlift Wing in East Granby tested positive March 27, and a soldier assigned to Joint Force Headquarters who works in Middletown tested positive the next day, National Guard officials said. The airman, between 20 and 30 years old, is hospitalized and the soldier, a woman between 40 and 50 years old, is recovering at home, officials said. On Wednesday, the National Guard also was transforming Southern Connecticut State University’s Moore Fieldhouse and Western Connecticut State University’s O’Neill Center into mobile hospitals to help with the anticipated surge of COVID-19 patients. There will be 250 beds at Southern and 200 at Western.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Trout fishing season started Tuesday, instead of the traditional first Saturday in April, “to help minimize crowds and accommodate responsible outdoor recreation during the current coronavirus (COVID-19) period,” the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said in a release. Anglers can read regulations and find information about licenses on DNREC’s website. Coronavirus or not, the fish were biting. And anglers were eager to get out from isolation, return to a bit of normalcy and get one of those fish. Or, better: the daily limit of six. The DNREC encouraged safe social distancing, reminding anglers that a fishing pole can be about the length of the recommended minimum distance of 6 feet, and to choose less-crowded areas to fish. That can be the hard part, with the trout not practicing social distancing but clumping together in favored spots where they could be seen tantalizingly close in the shallow water. Fishing was a welcome change for Trampas Henderson of Stanton. “It is good to get out; recently I’ve been doing nothing but working and going home. The gym has been closed, restaurants and everything have been closed,” Henderson said. “It’s just nice to get out and do something different.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser said a COVID-19 testing site opens Friday at United Medical Center, WUSA-TV reported. The drive-through and walk-up facility is only open to D.C. residents with symptoms who are 65 and older, health care workers, first responders, and D.C. residents with underlying medical conditions. A hotline will be set up in the coming days so residents can call ahead and make an appointment.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: The Brevard Zoo is welcoming a baby giraffe, which was born on Sunday. The calf weighed 125 pounds and was 6-feet tall at birth. Zoo officials said in a statement that it was the sixth consecutive male calf born there. It was the ninth birth for the calf’s mother, Johari, 20. The father, Rafiki, 21, has sired all 14 giraffe born at the zoo, the statement said. The veterinary staff said the calf is in good health and nursing well, according to zoo officials. Masai giraffe are endangered because of habitat loss and poaching, the statement said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: A kitten stuck on a roof in the cold was saved by firefighters. The 6-week-old kitten was nursed back to health Wednesday after her rescue, Cobb County Fire and Emergency Services said in a post on Facebook. The female kitten quickly recovered after she was given milk, cat food, and was warmed in towels, a fire official told the Marietta Daily Journal. “A future fantasy life on the farm is in order for this adorable kitty,” the post added. The department decided to name the kitten “Shingles” after asking followers on social media to help name the feline, a fire official said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A school has distributed laptops to students who need the computers to take part in online education during the coronavirus outbreak. Hawaii News Now reported Wednesday that Pahoa High and Intermediate School distributed about 200 Google Chromebooks during three drive-thru collection events. The public school’s students signed release forms allowing them to borrow the laptops. The school’s online learning program began this week and staff said teachers and students are adapting to the changes. Staff members said it was important to get the laptops to students quickly so they would have the technological capability they need to learn from their homes. The state Department of Education announced public and charter schools will remain closed to students through April 6 in response to the virus pandemic. Pahoa High and Intermediate teachers developed curriculum using Google classroom and other other online platforms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials are using the coronavirus pandemic to force a through long-delayed livestock grazing allotment decision in critical sage grouse habitat for a powerful agribusiness, an environmental group claimed. Wildlands Defense is asking the Bureau of Land Management to delay its March 20 decision approving Idaho-based J.R. Simplot Co.’s permit on about 94 square miles in southwestern Idaho for at least 10,500 cattle until the virus abates. The director for the Idaho bureau, John Ruhs, has refused. It’s not clear when the agency will issue a final decision, which would start a 30-day appeals process. Wildlands defense said the bureau’s appeal process requiring in-person trips to U.S. Postal Service offices to send or acknowledge receipt of certified mail by dozens of people puts communities at risk. The group said the bureau’s requirements also violate Gov. Brad Little’s March 25 stay-at-home order. The grazing allotment is in an area typically referred to as the Owyhees, which includes the Owyhee Mountains, canyons and rolling flats. Bureau spokesman Ken Frederick, in an email to the Associated Press, said the bureau’s “ability to modify grazing appeal procedures, which require certified mail receipts to confirm that interested parties received notice of a grazing decision and signed hard copies of appeals, is limited.” The agency hasn’t made public on its website the proposed decision. A copy obtained by the AP shows the agency is proposing to renew the grazing permit for 10 years. The average number of cattle on the range has been about 3,700 since Simplot acquired the permit in 1995. The proposed permit for 10,500 is roughly the same as 1995, but numbers typically fluctuate below that based on the condition of the range. Sage grouse are chicken-sized birds with an elaborate courtship ritual. Between 200,000 and 500,000 sage grouse remain in 11 Western states, down from a peak population of about 16 million. Experts generally attribute the decline to road construction, development and oil and gas leasing.\n\nIllinois\n\nCarbondale: Southern Illinois University has suspended the Delta Chi fraternity for violating the chancellor’s order banning in-person activities to slow the spread of COVID-19, officials said. The Southern Illinoisan reported Carbondale police over the past weekend responded to a house party hosted by Delta Chi, a violation of an administrative directive issued March 27 by interim Chancellor John Dunn and dean of students Jennifer Johns-Hall. The directive ordered compliance with Illinois Department of Public Health protocols requiring state residents to stay home except for essential trips for groceries or medicine. Gatherings of 10 or more people are also banned. “It was reported by the Carbondale Police Department that a fraternity in our community blatantly disregarded this message,” said Fraternity and Sorority Life assistant director Rachel Dunning said in an email announcing the suspension, adding it will stay in affect indefinitely. Jones-Hall said students found to have been involved in the incident will be referred to the student administration office.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An April Fools’ Day prank making the rounds on social media suggested that Indiana students will have to repeat their current grade because of the coronavirus crisis. The joke, created by prank websites that can be used to generate social media posts that resemble real news stories, used Gov. Eric Holcomb’s image and claimed that he announced the move during a news conference. That did not happen. Holcomb addressed the prank and others like it Wednesday afternoon. Holcomb noted the date, then said he had received calls and texts asking about executive orders it was rumored he had signed Wednesday. “There were none today and get your information from the Department of Health’s website, that coronavirus website,” Holcomb said. “Don’t get it from someone who’s forwarding a forward that’s been forwarded. Get your information from the Department of Health.” Indiana isn’t the only state dealing with the spread of this fake news on social media. Posts mentioning schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and California are also being generated and shared. In Indiana, all schools will remain closed until at least May 1 and all state testing has been canceled. But students won’t be repeating the grade.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Lily Ungs, 17, of Urbandale performed a ballet for residents of the Summit House senior community in Des Moines on Wednesday night. Since the coronavirus epidemic began, Wednesdays are called “Balcony Night” in the community. Instead of gathering at each other’s apartments or various spots around the building, the residents have taken to standing on their balconies and chit-chatting across the gap. But Jon and Elaine Lindgren cajoled Ungs, their granddaughter, into performing a routine in the parking lot. Ungs studied at the prestigious Ballet West Academy in Salt Lake City, until her school year, like so many others, was shortened by the pandemic. Shortly before 6:30 p.m., Ungs warmed up, using the backs of parked cars to run through her routine stretches. She wore a white tutu and a silver tiara. The residents gathered on their balconies and folks from the other side of the building made their way over, doing their best to stay 6 feet away from their neighbors per coronavirus protocols. With scores of eyes upon her, Ungs twirled and tapped across the rough surface. Her performance included “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from “The Nutcracker.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state expects an influx of coronavirus tests in the coming weeks that should help with efforts to bring the pandemic under control, the state’s top health official said. Dr. Lee Norman, the state’s secretary of health and environment, said that he expects to have up to 64,000 test kits that can produce results in 45 minutes, the Lawrence Journal-World reported. “Very clearly we need to do population studies, meaning testing people who are well,” Norman said. “It’s very fundamental work and will push the analysis (of the virus) upstream. But until that time, social distancing is the name of the game.” Gov. Laura Kelly has issued a statewide stay-at-home-order as part of efforts to slow the virus’ spread, but getting everyone to follow it has proved challenging. The Shawnee Mission School District, which is among the state’s largest with more than 27,000 students, announced that it would begin issuing trespassing warnings Thursday for people who violate social distancing rules at its fields and stadiums. Those facilities remain open so people can exercise. But officials said the district and local police departments have received numerous complaints about large groups playing organized sports. People are supposed to stay at least 6 feet from each other and not gather in groups of more than 10.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort:The Kentucky National Guard already has been posted at local hospitals, but they soon will be at food banks amid the coronavirus pandemic.Gov. Greg Beshear announced Wednesday that the National Guard will deploy 70 members to four regional food bank warehouses located in Louisville, Elizabethtown, Wilder and Lexington.”Deployment is going to help feed seniors, families and displaced workers,” Beshear said during his daily news conference. “The National Guard members will assist Kentucky’s food banks by sorting and packing food into bags and boxes and distributing that through no-touch food distributors.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Gov. John Bel Edwards reported a “jarring” uptick in coronavirus cases Thursday, though the state health department’s top COVID-19 expert said the spike is the result of a logjam of test results finally released to the state. The state reported 2,726 new cases Thursday for a total of 9,150 in 61 of the state’s 64 parishes. “This largely reflects people who already knew their test results, but the reporting to the state lagged,” Louisiana Department of Health Dr. Alex Billioux said on a conference call with reporters. “What we want to be clear is ... this isn’t a sudden 24-hour jump in cases that are a run on our health system; rather, it’s a bottleneck of reporting testing results,” Billioux said. Billioux said the backlog is largely from commercial testing, where he said 160,000 national tests results have lagged being reported to state. “There’s been pressure on those companies to get a better flow,” he said. He said the spike from delayed reports makes it harder to determine Louisiana’s infection trajectory. “These are cases newly reported, not necessarily new cases,” Billioux said. “The trajectory is still very concerning ... but the extra element of lagging results makes it harder to (calculate) the trajectory.” Thursday’s number of hospitalizations rose less than than 10% to 1,638.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Unemployment claims in Maine have reached a new high, surpassing a previous record attributed to the coronavirus outbreak. There were about 23,800 initial claims for unemployment compensation during the week that ended March 28, the Maine Department of Labor said. The previous record was about 21,500 claims a week earlier. There had been fewer than 700 claims a week before that in Maine, which had been riding a long streak of low unemployment. The Maine Department of Labor said in a statement that the virus “has caused significant economic hardship for Maine people and job losses across the state, particularly in the food services and lodging, health care and social assistance, retail trade and manufacturing industries.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: In the span of a week, Hardwire went from building armor to help protect soldiers from improvised explosives to trying to protecting health care workers from an enemy invisible to the naked eye. Developing a new type of face shield required long hours, sleepless nights and many cups of coffee, CEO Geroge Tunis said, but in the span of about 10 days Hardwire designed, tested, refined, retested and now manufacturers thousands of shields a day. The shields came at a crucial time for Atlantic General Hospital in Berlin, said Michael Franklin, the hospital’s president and CEO. “We were out of face shields,” Franklin said. “We were using goggles from Lowes and Home Depot. They had provided us with a lot of regular safety goggles and one of the paint stores in town also brought over all their safety goggles.” More than 100 face shields were assembled after the first day of production, Tunis said. Four days later, the company manufactured 12,000, with an additional 7,000 being built in one day alone. “This virus is spreading exponentially so every hour counts. So getting into production in meaningful levels is so important,” Tunis said. “You can’t make 10 of something and think you’re making a meaningful dent in it. The right number is 60,000-100,000 a day. You need to be at that level.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The New England Patriots’ private team plane returned to Boston from China on Thursday on a rainy afternoon carrying most of an order of 1million masks crucial to health care providers fighting to control the spread of the new coronavirus. Standing in front of the plane on the tarmac at Logan International Airport, Gov. Charlie Baker thanked Patriots owner Robert Kraft, officials in China who partnered with the state, and medical workers who need the masks. “This shipment comes at a critical time as we prepare for an anticipated surge in the coming weeks ahead,” Baker said. “What we were able to accomplish with this particular mission will go a long way forward in this fight.” Baker secured the N95 masks from Chinese manufacturers but had no way of getting them to the U.S. Baker said Thursday an earlier order for 3million masks had been confiscated at the Port of New York and this time he wanted a direct humanitarian delivery to the state. In an interview with Patriots.com radio Thursday, Kraft Sports and Entertainment chief operating officer Jim Nolan said the Chinese government didn’t sign off on the trip until March 27. He said the hurdles included legal logistics that were only cleared thanks to cooperation involving multiple state, U.S. and international entities. Nolan said the Patriots received permission to land in China and got a waiver of a 14-day quarantine because the pilots didn’t get off the plane. Baker said some masks will go to New York and Rhode island. The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday urged state lawmakers not to come to the Capitol on Tuesday, as planned, saying it is too dangerous to convene a session during the coronavirus pandemic. But she later clarified her remarks through a spokeswoman, saying lawmakers should convene briefly and in a safe manner to extend her emergency and disaster orders, and then return to their districts. “They should come in, extend (the orders) 70 days, and return to their communities like the rest of us are doing to keep the public safe,” spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said. However, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, and other Republican lawmakers have said the requested 70-day extension is too long, and they plan to approve a shorter extension when they convene Tuesday. Earlier, at a news conference at the Capitol, Whitmer said: “The Legislature’s insistence on coming in next week is something I implored them not to do.” Whitmer’s original emergency declaration is set to expire Tuesday. However, she made a new disaster declaration on Wednesday, meaning she can continue to exercise emergency powers for another 28 days from Wednesday without the need for the Legislature to convene and vote on a resolution to extend the emergency or the disaster. She also has powers under the Emergency Powers of the Governor Act to continue to act unilaterally, even without an extension from lawmakers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz said he will deliver his postponed State of the State address on at 7 p.m. Sunday, and added he’s looking forward to speaking directly to Minnesotans during this uncertain time. The governor said Wednesday that he will deliver the speech alone with a remote camera from the Governor’s Residence, where he was in his 12th day of self-quarantining since a member of his security detail tested positive for COVID-19. “It is appropriate at this time with the character of Minnesota shining so brightly that we address where we’re at, and more importantly, where we’re going,” Walz said in his daily briefing for reporters. Minnesotans can view the address on YouTube Live and participating media outlets. Walz was going to deliver his State of the State address to a joint session of the Legislature on March 23, but had to cancel it amid the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A nonpartisan special election to fill a state House seat is being delayed by two months because of concerns about the new coronavirus. Gov. Tate Reeves announced Thursday that June 23 is the new date for the election in District 88 in parts of Jasper and Jones counties. If a runoff is needed, it will be July 14. The original date was April 21 with a May 12 runoff. Three candidates have qualified for the race, and the qualification period will not reopen. Republican Rep. Ramona Blackledge of Laurel resigned Jan. 31, less than a month after the start of the four-year term. The freshman lawmaker said she had to choose between serving in the House and collecting her state retirement pay. She said she could not afford to relinquish the pension that she earned during 40 years of working for county government. In Mississippi special elections, candidates run without party labels on the ballot but they often tell voters their party affiliation.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Smaller local governments are issuing stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the new coronavirus in Missouri, where the governor hasn’t issued a statewide order. Such orders took effect more than a week ago in the state’s largest cities, including Kansas City and St. Louis, but smaller counties with few or no COVID-19 cases are now telling residents to leave home only for essential reasons, such as to buy groceries or medicine. The order in St. Francois County, in southeastern Missouri, takes effect on Friday, The Kansas City Star reported. The county had 10 cases as of Wednesday morning. Gov. Mike Parson hasn’t ruled out issuing a statewide order, but he has said he was hesitant to impose state control over what he believes is a local issue.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Cascade County commissioners voted 2-1 to conduct an all-mail ballot election for the June 2 primary to reduce the chances of elderly election judges, county employees and voters from getting the new coronavirus. Clerk and Recorder Rina Fontana Moore recommended using only mail ballots out of concern that the coronavirus would be spread during the election at Montana ExpoPark. On March 25, Gov. Steve Bullock issued an order suspending a state law requiring that federal elections be conducted by poll and giving counties the options of all-mail ballot elections. The June 2 primary is a federal election. Commissioner Joe Briggs said he personally favored the mail ballot but voted against the resolution calling for the all-mail ballot election. He’s concerned that the governor doesn’t have the authority to suspend a state statute and that the Montana Association of Counties, which insures the county, won’t pay the county’s legal bills if the all-mail ballot election is challenged in court. Exhibition Hall still will be open on election day June 2 but voting will begin soon after May 8, when about 40,000 ballots will be mailed to residents.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state saw another record-setting surge in unemployment claims last week as the new coronavirus forced more businesses to close and lay off workers, according to new data released Thursday. The state received 24,572 unemployment claims during the week that ended March 29, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. The previous record of 15,700 was set in the prior week as state officials imposed tough new restrictions on businesses and residents hunkered down at home to keep the virus from spreading. Nebraska has now had about 40,000 jobless claims in the last two weeks, which is about as many as it usually gets in a year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More than 20,000 people registered to vote in March, but the rate of people signing up to vote slowed at the end of the month, when state Department of Motor Vehicles offices closed because of the coronavirus epidemic, according to Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske. The DMV closures have an outsized impact on voter registration numbers because of a new state law that automatically registers someone to vote when registering for a license with the DMV or making other transactions with the agency, unless the person opts out. Cegavske’s office said Wednesday night that for the first half of March, the state DMV saw 2,100 transactions daily, but in the second half of the month as the virus spread, it dropped to about 470 transactions a day. Overall Nevada saw the number of active registered voters grow by 1.27% in March. Democrats represent 39% of all registered voters, Republicans make up 33% and unaffiliated voters are 23%.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Some county jail inmates who were convicted or accused of nonviolent crimes have been released to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, state corrections officials said. New Hampshire Public Radio reported the jail in Rockingham County, one of the largert jails in the state, has released about a dozen people. County Corrections Superintendent Stephen Church said the release of a defendant often depends on specific restrictions or requirements, such as daily check-ins, electronic monitoring or participation in programming. The majority of inmates who have been released by county jails have been close to the end of their sentences, or have been on work or weekend releases. Correctional facilities across the state are putting new inmates under quarantine for a minimum of 14 days.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: Gov. Phil Murphy toured a 250-bed field hospital at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus. The facility will open early next week, according to the governor. The hospital is scheduled to field noncoronavirus cases. It’s one of four field hospitals that are supposed to open in New Jersey. There will be two 250-bed facilities in Edison, with the fourth a 250-bed field hospital in Atlantic City.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDoña Ana: Officials with the Doña Ana County Detention Center reported that there are no cases of COVID-19 at the facility, and that they have initiated a quarantine for new detainees. In a news release issued late Wednesday night, county officials stated that all new detainees will be held in a quarantined area of the center for 14 days to mitigate the potential spread of the novel coronavirus within the facility. New detainees will be housed together in order to limit their interaction with other detainees, officials said. This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. This new process will remain in place while the public health emergency is in effect. In addition, the county announced it will more thoroughly and frequently clean and disinfect the facility. Visitors of adult detainees are not allowed inside the detention center. However, they might schedule free calls and video visits from home, using a laptop or desktop computer at www.legacyinmate.com/Prepaid. Additional fee-based connections remain available, as well as texting, via www.gettingout.com. Visitation remains open for the Juvenile Detention Center, with restrictions. To schedule a visit, call (575) 647-7680. Also, juvenile detainees have access to two free 10-minute phone calls per week.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Veterinarians are answering the call to give up their ventilators to help fight the new coronavirus in humans. With city hospitals facing a ventilator shortage as coronavirus cases multiply, Mayor Bill De Blasio on Tuesday urged vets, plastic surgeons and others who might have the potentially life-saving equipment to lend it for the duration of the crisis. The New York Post reported the request is forcing some vets to prioritize human life over the animals for which they care. “There’s usually a distinct line between veterinary medicine and human medicine and there’s no crossover,” Brett Levitzke, the chief medical officer at Veterinary Emergency & Referral Group, told the newspaper. “That’s what makes the time we’re in so unprecedented.” A representative for Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners, which operates animal hospitals in Manhattan and Brooklyn, said the organization donated seven ventilators to New York-Presbyterian Hospital.But Levitzke’s practice has only one ventilator, and the decision to give it up is not one he makes lightly. Still, he said, “it’s just the right thing to do.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nTarboro: A man has been arrested after deputies, who were responding to a call about a shooting, found more than 70 people at a barn, a sheriff’s office said. The Edgecombe County Sheriff’s Office said deputies responded to Bynum Drive in Pinetops last Saturday in reference to shots fired into a residence, news sources reported on Thursday When deputies reached the scene, they saw vehicles leaving the area, and when they went to the back of the residence, they found more than 70 people, which is in violation of Gov. Roy Cooper’s order limiting gatherings. John Fitzgerald Taylor of Pinetops was charged last Saturday for violating the governor’s executive order. Authorities said Taylor was responsible for the gathering. As for the report of gunfire, deputies said the shooting happened on the street and that a stray bullet went into the back kitchen window of a nearby residence nearby. No one was injured and there have been no arrests in that incident.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: One of the state’s largest oil producers filed for bankruptcy Wednesday, citing the coronavirus pandemic on top of plunging oil prices. Gov. Doug Burgum said he expected more might follow and would “create real pressure on state budgets.” Although Whiting Oil was filing for Chapter 11 protection, state leaders were looking at an expected $1.2billion in aid from the federal bailout package – possibly enough with rainy-day money to avert the need to radically rework the state budget. “There are so many unknowns right now but we can absorb a tremendous budget shortfall without a special session,” state budget director Joe Morrissette said. General fund revenue, which is funded largely by state taxes on income, sales and energy, was ahead of projections for the current two-year budget cycle by more than $106million, Morrissette said. The state also has $65million from the prior budget cycle and a record $726million in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund that can be tapped by the governor when tax collections fall short of expectations, though only after agencies endure across-the-board cuts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans are confronted with an additional four weeks in isolation as Gov. Mike DeWine extended the state’s stay-at-home order Thursday to undercut the coming peak of coronavirus cases. The order issued by state health director Dr. Amy Acton will continue stay-at-home precautions until May 1. The initial stay-at-home order bought Ohio time to prepare for the onslaught of predicted cases, DeWine said. The two-week stay-at-home order issued March 23 – restricting many Ohioans to only vital travel for food and medical care and closing workplaces deemed non-essential – had been set to expire Monday night. The governor had signaled for days that the social-distancing order was near-certain to be prolonged with COVID-19 cases not projected to peak until later this month. DeWine said the new order would require retail stores, apparently including groceries, to post a limit of people to be admitted to stores at any one time to help reduce virus risk. The state is not setting a number. Although no limits remain on attendance at weddings and funerals, receptions are limited to no more than 10 people. Campgrounds are also being ordered closed under the new order, but those who live in a recreational vehicle at a campground can remain. State parks are not being closed, but social distancing must be practiced.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt called Thursday for a special session of the Legislature as part of his declaration of a health emergency in all 77 counties. Declaring a health emergency gives the governor broader powers to coordinate the state’s response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, including the ability to waive some statutory or regulatory requirements, said Stitt spokesman Charlie Hannema. State law requires the Legislature to convene within two business days to either concur with or terminate the health emergency, so the Legislature is expected to convene at 8 a.m. Monday. Under Stitt’s order, the state’s Commissioner of Health Gary Cox is authorized as the primary public health authority. On Wednesday, Stitt extended his “Safer At Home” order until April 30 and included all 77 counties, rather than just those with a confirmed case. The order requires nonessential businesses to shut down and the elderly and medically vulnerable to stay indoors. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A doctor at a veterans home in Oregon used a malaria drug to treat eight patients there for the new coronavirus, but said a state rule enacted last month would prevent him from treating any more veterans there. After pushback against the Oregon Board of Pharmacy’s March 25 rule, the board amended it on Wednesday to allow the drug to be used not only in hospitals for confirmed COVID-19 cases, but also long-term care facilities like the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon. Hydroxychloroquine and a similar drug, chloroquine, showed encouraging signs in small, early tests against the new coronavirus but has not proved safe or effective for this in any major scientific studies yet. It’s approved now for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. In the second week of March, the first cases of the coronavirus began emerging at the Oregon Veterans’ Home in Lebanon, when two men in their 80s fell ill with COVID-19. Then more got sick. After hearing that hydroxychloroquine could be effective, Dr. Rob Richardson began treating eight of the veterans with it and an antibiotic called azithromycin, also known as Z-Pak. On March 25, the Oregon Board of Pharmacy adopted a temporary emergency rule prohibiting the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine “for presumptive treatment or prevention of COVID-19 infection.” But late Wednesday, the pharmacy board changed its regulation, allowing “for a seriously ill patient in an institutional setting, such as Correctional Facilities and Long-Term Care Facilities, who would otherwise be hospitalized” to receive the drugs. Of the eight patients that Richardson treated with hydroxychloroquine and Z-Pak, seven recovered and one – a 91-year-old patient – died. Richardson has no conclusive evidence that the treatment led to their recovery but there were no negative side effects.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As expected, demand far exceeded the capacity of Pennsylvania’s system of state-owned liquor stores to process online orders as sales resumed Wednesday. Brick-and-mortar liquor stores are closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but nearly 278,000 people tried to place orders on the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board website during the first day of digital sales. By comparison, the site attracted 32,300 users when the liquor agency recently released several sought-after but limited-availability whiskeys. “As we expected, consumer interest and site traffic far exceeded our ability to accept orders,” a spokeswoman said Thursday. For now, the state is limiting website access to prevent the system from crashing, giving only a limited number of randomly selected consumers access to shop. All others get a screen indicating the online store is closed.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A coalition of labor unions and social justice organizations in Rhode Island is calling on state leaders to pass their own coronavirus relief package to help workers and the newly unemployed. The federal government’s relief package is not enough, the 14 groups said in a letter Wednesday to Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, all Democrats. “Our state response must continue to fill the gaps left by the federal stimulus response packages to support the Rhode Islanders who are losing their jobs and the disproportionately low-wage workers who are heroically keeping us fed and cared for at great risk to themselves,” the group said, according to The Providence Journal. Some of the group’s proposals include double paid sick time from 40 hours per year to 80 hours and raising the minimum wage for some. The Gaspee Business Network also issued a list of recommendations for state leaders to consider during the pandemic, including giving businesses more time to remit sales tax; temporarily cutting the minimum wage; and suspending internet sales tax collections.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Public health officials are creating a statewide database of addresses of known positive COVID-19 cases, a secure tool only made available to first responders who have argued the information could help protect them. Although solely intended for the emergency response community, it’s also a step toward the release of more specific information about the location of infections that officials have come under fire for resisting. The online matrix, according to Nick Davidson, acting director of public health for the Department of Health and Environmental Control, comes in response to local officials’ complaints that first responders were being left potentially vulnerable to the disease and also needed that information to conserve protective gear, which is in short supply. Starting next week, Davidson told the Associated Press, the agency will be live with a “secure, web-based system” that first responders can access to see if a home to which they’re being called has a resident who’s tested positive for the new coronavirus. Responders will be able to query the system, which will have known positive cases listed by the address on a patient’s driver’s license.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nEagle Butte: The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said it is setting up checkpoints on roads going into tribal land on Thursday to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The tribe won’t allow people in noncommercial vehicles with out-of-state licenses unless they can prove tribal membership and that they live on the reservation. The tribe also will restrict people who are not members from hunting on tribal lands. The tribe will be monitoring all other traffic on the main roads going into the reservation. So far, no one living on the reservation has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the latest update from South Dakota health officials.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the state will retrofit the Gateway Shopping Center for a 170-bed hospital to help add capacity to the Memphis metropolitan area’s medical system in the face of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Gov. Bill Lee said the Army Corps will construct a COVID-19 positive center at the shopping center along Jackson Avenue. He said the Corps is scouting other sites in Memphis, as well. Lee said the facility will be used for nonacute care patients. That would potentially save capacity at existing hospitals in Memphis. The portion of the shopping center that is vacant west of the existing Save-A-Lot grocery store would be retrofitted, according to city officials who learned of the announcement shortly before it was made public. According to a sign on the building, there is up to 105,000 square feet available to lease. Across the country, the Army Corps has been relied upon for its expertise to help combat the surge by retrofitting existing facilities. The Memphis and Shelby County joint task-force submitted more than a dozen sites to the Army Corps.\n\nTexas\n\nLaredo: Residents are being required to wear something that covers their nose and mouth when they’re out in public during the coronavirus pandemic – or face a fine of up to $1,000. Starting Thursday, all people in Laredo over the age of 5 will have to wear some kind of covering, such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandanna or handkerchief, when entering a building open to the public. Residents will also have to cover their mouth and nose when using public transportation, taxis, ride shares or when pumping gas. The new rule doesn’t apply to people riding in their own vehicles or if they are outside for exercise and following social distancing guidelines. Laredo’s city council issued the mandate on Tuesday. The South Texas city of more than 261,000 residents along the U.S.-Mexico border is about 155 miles southwest of San Antonio. Residents are being encouraged to use homemade masks and leave medical masks, including N95 masks, for health professionals, said Dr. Hector Gonzalez, director of Laredo’s health department. There are nearly 4,700 cases of coronavirus in Texas and at least 70 related deaths, according to state health officials. Others across the country have also been updating their guidance on whether or not to wear some sort of facial covering.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: As the number of coronavirus cases and deaths grew in Utah, the governor announced a freeze on evictions Wednesday and advocates demanded more inmates be released to prevent the spread in jails and prisons. With businesses closed across the state to prevent the spread of the virus that has caused a global pandemic, Gov. Gary Herbert ordered landlords to allow rent payments from affected workers to be deferred and evictions stopped until May 15. “This is designed to help people who, through no fault of their own, have lost jobs or lost income because of COVID-19,” he said. The ACLU of Utah is going to the Utah Supreme Court to demand more prison and jail inmates be released so the facilities can take steps to prevent the spread of coronavirus, like social distancing and frequent hand washing. Authorities have not yet confirmed any cases among inmates, but attorneys said it could spread quickly in jails and prisons. Corrections officials did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Similar petitions have been filed in other states.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Members of Chittenden County’s largest emergency response agencies have so far remained mostly healthy despite the spread of the new coronavirus in Vermont. But they are preparing for the anticipated surge in COVID-19 cases as they are being told by health officials that the worst is yet to come. Contingency planning should emergency responders need to self-quarantine or be hospitalized in large numbers has been key. It has also helped that many Vermonters are heeding Gov. Phil Scott’s calls to stay home, said Vermont State Police Capt. Garry Scott, the director of Fair and Impartial Policing and Community Affairs. Despite the danger of COVID-19, emergency responders are committed to continuing to respond in person to calls that involve citizens’ physical safety, they said. Burlington police has reported one case of COVID-19 in a member who was not interacting with the community in an official capacity at the time. That employee has been quarantined, said interim Chief Jennifer Morrison in an email. Burlington police and fire departments, South Burlington police, and Vermont State Police have said that other members have self-isolated for various reasons, but no other positive tests have been reported.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A long-term care facility with one of the nation’s worst known coronavirus outbreaks said Thursday that testing conducted on all residents had more than doubled the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 to nearly 100 as the number of fatalities increased to 16. The Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in suburban Richmond tested all its residents and staff earlier this week after the virus began sweeping through the facility in mid-March, a time when limited testing supplies and strict policies on who could be tested meant such a response was not possible. Ninety-two in-house or hospitalized residents tested positive, the statement said, up from a total earlier in the week of 41. Only 35 tested negative, and 15 tests were outstanding, meaning approximately two-thirds of the facility became infected with the virus. Of the residents who tested positive, 53, or about 58%, were “asymptomatic carriers showing no sign of being ill,” the statement said. The facility’s administrator, Jeremiah Davis, said in a statement that the findings were consistent with other mass testing studies. Among the 16 deaths were five over the last 24-hour period, the facility said in a statement. Canterbury has faced a staffing and supply shortage amid the crisis, though officials have said both have improved in recent days. As of Wednesday afternoon, 25 workers had tested positive, according to Davis. The staff-wide test results were not yet available.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Federal authorities have proposed a $611,000 fine for a Seattle-area nursing home connected to at least 40 coronavirus deaths. State regulators and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services conducted an inspection of the Life Care Center of Kirkland on March 16, finding serious infractions that they said placed residents in immediate danger. Authorities said Life Care had at least partially fixed the most serious problems by the time they conducted follow-up inspection in last weekend. In a letter to Life Care on Wednesday, CMS proposed a fine of $611,000, but said that could be adjusted up or down based on how Life Care continues to correct remaining problems. Life Care, which can appeal the fine, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The federal regulators said the most serious problems concerned a failure to rapidly identify and manage sick residents during an outbreak of respiratory illness that began by mid-February; a failure to notify the Washington Department of Health about the increasing rate of respiratory infections among residents; and a failure to have a backup plan in the absence of Life Care’s primary clinician, who fell ill. CMS notified Life Care on March 18 that it had 23 days to remedy violations that placed residents at immediate jeopardy before it would be terminated as a Medicare provider. The agency on Wednesday extended that period, saying Life Care must fix all remaining issues by Sept.16.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s attorney general on Thursday said a ban on elective medical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic will reduce abortions but will be upheld in an eventual legal challenge. The executive order, which went into effect this week, mirrors directives in other Republican-controlled states that have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. West Virginia’s order, which doesn’t explicitly include abortion, said that it applies to all procedures that aren’t “immediately medically necessary to preserve the patient’s life or long-term health” to preserve medical supplies and protective equipment. “We believe that this broad-based prohibition will be upheld because it’s designed to protect the public health and applies to all elective procedures and all elective facilities,” Attorney General Patrick Morrisey told the Associated Press in an interview. Similar orders in Alabama, Texas and Ohio faced legal challenges soon after they were announced from pro-abortion groups who argued the directives violated existing rights to the procedure. Lawsuits were also filed in Iowa and Oklahoma, after governors in those states similarly ordered a stop to non-emergency procedures and specifically included abortion among them. Morrisey said the state’s order applies to abortion facilities despite a section that excludes “procedures that cannot be performed consistent with other law at a later date.” West Virginia bans abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:The United States’ top infectious disease specialist is getting his own bobblehead. The creation from the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum in Milwaukee features Dr. Anthony Fauci wearing a suit as he makes a motion showing how the nation needs to “flatten the curve” in the coronavirus pandemic. The museum picked Fauci because many people see the plain-speaking expert on the coronavirus as a hero right now, said co-founder and CEO Phil Sklar. “He isn’t trying to spin things,” he said. “He isn’t trying to make people happy and tell him what they want to hear. He’s actually telling them, you know, how he sees it as an expert. And I think that’s really what we need him this time.” Fauci’s face also appears on socks. And a Rochester, New York, shop is selling doughnuts with his face, surrounded by white frosting and topped off with red, white and blue sprinkles. Sklar said the bobblehead museum plans to donate $5 from every $25 Fauci bobblehead that’s sold to the American Hospital Association in support of that group’s effort to get masks and other personal protective equipment for health care workers. Fauci, who is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has served as an adviser to every president since Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump has called him a star on his administration’s coronavirus task force.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Wyoming courts are extending measures to discourage spread of the coronavirus by another seven weeks. The series of measures announced by the Wyoming Supreme Court in March apply to all state courts in Wyoming. They include suspending many types of in-person proceedings, rescheduling trials, allowing for remote administration of oaths, conducting proceedings by video conference and making paper document filings optional. Set to expire April 10, the measures will now continue through May, Chief Justice Michael K. Davis said Wednesday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/12/24/liquid-oozes-onto-highway-red-squirrels-rising-floods-oysters-exploding-atm-news-around-states/40882385/", "title": "50 States roundup", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nRogersville: It’s unknown when a popular north Alabama state park that was hit by a tornado on Dec. 14 will be fully reopened. The lodge, marina and some other sections of Joe Wheeler State Park are operating following the strike by what forecasters determined was an EF-1 twister. But the campground and day-use areas were badly damaged, and park officials said clearing away fallen trees and other debris will take time. The park is on the Tennessee River at Rogersville. The weather service said it was struck by a twister with 110 mph maximum winds that left a trail of damage as wide as 500 yards.\n\nAlaska\n\nWillow: At least six homes were evacuated after an ice jam caused a creek to flood in a subdivision north of Anchorage, emergency officials said. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough Department of Emergency Services responded to flooding reports in Willow around 11 p.m. Saturday, The Anchorage Daily News reported.No injuries were reported. Residents near the Willow Creek and Deneki Road areas were evacuated late Saturday and early Sunday. A large chunk of ice jammed at the Deneki bridge and restricted water flow, which caused upstream flooding, a National Weather Service flood advisory said. The American Red Cross opened a temporary shelter at the Willow Community Center, although some residents chose to remain in their homes, officials said. The Willow Fire Department, Alaska State Troopers and Mat-Su Water Rescue Team responded to provide assistance in the community about 70 miles north of Anchorage, the borough said. The water began to recede Sunday, but a layer of ice formed and cars were frozen in place.\n\nArizona\n\nSafford: After a devastating 2017 wildfire nearly wiped the species out, the Mount Graham red squirrel, the nation’s rarest small mammal, continues its slow climb out of the danger zone. The annual survey of the bushy-tailed rodents found at least 78 squirrels living on the upper slopes of Mount Graham in southeastern Arizona, a 4% increase from 2018. The survey was conducted by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, Coronado National Forest, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arizona Center for Nature Conservation at the Phoenix Zoo, and the University of Arizona. Although the species’ growth this year was much smaller than the 91% rise noted in the year after the 2017 Frye Fire, biologists are still encouraged that the half-pound critters are on the comeback. But a report released Nov. 18 suggests that the tiny mammal – which has survived fire, construction, introduced competitors and drought – faces a foe that could finally do it in: climate change. The report in the journal Nature Climate Change found that virtually all the of country’s 459 endangered species, including the red squirrels, have at least some vulnerabilities to long-term alterations like drought, increasingly intense storms and temperature rise.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The Baxter Regional Medical Center officially broke ground Wednesday on the hospital’s outpatient surgery center. The 23,000 square-foot facility, which will be located along Beard Drive southeast of the hospital, is estimated to cost $8.7 million and should be completed in early 2021. The hospital presently performs close to 8,000 surgeries a year, medial center CEO Ron Peterson said, with about 65% percent of those outpatient procedures. The hospital expects the outpatient surgery center to perform about 3,000 procedures in its first year of operation, and it has the capacity to perform about 7,000 a year at full capacity.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: A shark reportedly bit a surfer Saturday afternoon off Southern California in a “truly terrifying situation,” the Coast Guard said. The 37-year-old man had been surfing near Santa Rosa Island, one of the Channel Islands, during the attack, according to a news release. A friend aboard a nearby boat applied a tourniquet to his leg and called the Coast Guard for help, the release stated. A helicopter crew flew the man to the Santa Barbara airport for treatment and he was in stable condition Saturday night. Coast Guard video footage posted on Twitter showed the man, wearing a full-body wetsuit, being hoisted up from the boat into the helicopter. “This was the best possible outcome to a truly terrifying situation,” Coast Guard Lt. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said in the release.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The city’s water utility said it will speed up the removal of lead pipes from homes across the metro area. Denver Water said it expects the program to launch in 2020 and take 15 years at a cost of $500 million, Colorado Public Radio reported. The public agency estimated there are between 64,000 and 84,000 lead service lines in the system. Denver Water said it committed to removing at least 4,500 lines annually under an agreement with the EPA and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Lead exposure can lead to kidney and brain damage, as well as developmental issues for children. Homes built before 1951 are more likely to have lead service lines, Denver Water said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A police officer grabbed onto a driverless SUV that had rolled into traffic and stopped it from potentially hitting a group of children, authorities said. Surveillance video posted online by news outlets showed Bridgeport School Resource Officer Carlos Carmo Jr. running toward the moving vehicle and using his body to slow and stop the car. A group of Harding High School school students was walking on the sidewalk near the path of the SUV. There were two passengers in the car – one in the passenger seat and one in back – but no driver, when it somehow slipped out of park and rolled away, officials said. It had been parked on the street on a downward slope. Carmo was treated at a hospital for minor injuries, authorities said. No other injuries were reported. Mayor Joe Ganim said Carmo will be honored for his actions.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: Two weekend events recently brought a group of Satanists and hundreds of Christian worshippers together in the middle of town. Hundreds of people attended a live nativity Saturday night in Georgetown, while a group of Satanists held a quiet vigil nearby, The News Journal reported. The Satanist organizers said their vigil marked the winter solstice and celebrated religious diversity and equal rights during the holiday season. The group describes itself as a “nontheistic Delaware-based modern Satanic group.” A group called the Good Ole Boy Foundation is sponsoring the nativity scene each night until Christmas. “Everybody has the right to celebrate whatever they celebrate,” Georgetown resident Katie Rohlfing told the newspaper.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Advocates for homeless people marched through the streets of the nation’s capital with an empty coffin as part of an annual vigil to the honor those who have died. City data showed at least 117 homeless people have died in the district this year, The Washington Post reported. Data showed about 52 of the deaths were considered accidents, including 44 that involved intoxication and three that involved the person being hit by a car. Of the remaining deaths, 26 causes were still pending, two were suicides, eight were homicides and 27 were considered natural, including several that involved alcoholism or cardiovascular disease. The seventh annual vigil hosted by the People for Fairness Coalition opened late Thursday with attendees singing hymns in front of the coffin at a local church before carrying it to Freedom Plaza. After the overnight vigil, participants attended a ceremony at another church where the names of those who died were read aloud.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Sheriff’s deputies were searching for a suspect who they believe exploded an ATM in an unsuccessful effort to steal money. In a news release, the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office reported that an ATM exploded early Sunday just after surveillance cameras caught the male suspect spray-painting the exterior cameras black at the Pilot Bank. The Tampa Bay Times reported the suspect was unable to get through the ATM’s internal safe so no money was taken. Authorities said a similar incident took place at another bank in nearby Oldsmar in November.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service plans to place a more storm-resistant roof on a historic building that serves as its staff headquarters at Fort Pulaski on the Georgia coast. The building wasn’t an original part of the Civil War-era fort east of Savannah. It was constructed just before World War I as an attendant’s quarters for a nearby quarantine station. The station was used to treat people with highly contagious diseases between 1889 and 1937. The park service is seeking public comment on its plan to replace the existing asphalt shingle roof with one made of steel, the agency said in a news release. The current roof suffered damaged from Hurricanes Matthew and Irma in 2016 and 2017. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the last surviving building associated with the former quarantine station. The park service said Georgia’s state historic preservation office determined a steel roof would adversely affect the building’s historic character because it would lack the appearance of the original shingle roof. The park service said it plans to minimize the new roof’s impact by applying steel in a diamond shingle pattern that mimics the original design.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: New U.S. Navy contracting terms have resulted in a pullout by a major contractor that is expected to result in the loss of hundreds of jobs at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, officials said. BAE Systems PLC will no longer perform Navy surface ship repair at Pearl Harbor, eliminating about 325 jobs, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The Navy contracts with private shipyards and other firms for maintenance on nonnuclear surface ships. The multinational security, aerospace and ship repair firm was the prime contractor for repair projects through which subcontractor surface ship work was funneled. BAE announced a five-year multiship, multioption contract in 2014 for modernization and maintenance on nine destroyers and cruisers at Pearl Harbor. But multiship, multioption contracts using cost-reimbursement have been replaced nationally by a Navy strategy called “multiple award contract-multi order,” officials said. The new system uses firm-fixed-price contracts that do no allow adjustments for cost overruns, officials said. BAE cannot bid on smaller, $1 million to $2 million contracts under the new Navy format, but can seek major ship projects that can be $50 million to $100 million, officials said.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: A state Supreme Court ruling has upheld a lower-court decision regarding ownership of a launch on Lake Coeur d’Alene. The Dec. 11 ruling said the Eastside Highway District does not own a park boat launch in Coeur d’Alene’s Boothe Park, The Coeur d’Alene Press reported. The highway district had appealed a decision establishing a boundary on the park’s east side. The case has led to a debate over who can access the boat launch and whether the district and the public are allowed lake access at the park, district administrators said. The state Supreme Court affirmed the lower-court decision that Gregory and Ellen Delavan own the launch. The court found that any boundary agreement between the couple and the highway district no longer exists, regardless of whether an agreement existed between the district and previous property owners. The Supreme Court also ruled the summary judgment granted to the Delavans by the district court must be readdressed. The park was established around 1955 when it was conveyed to the Coeur d’Alene Highway District, the precursor to the Eastside Highway District.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: New HIV diagnoses in Chicago continue to go down and have declined for four consecutive years, according to figures released by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the city’s health department. The 734 new diagnoses reported in 2018 among Chicago residents are the lowest number since 1988, health officials said Monday. Chicago Department of Public Health’s 2019 HIV/STI surveillance report showed 23,580 people were living with HIV through the end of 2017, the year for which most current data is available. The health department’s HIV Services Portfolio is awarding more than $40 million annually to more than 60 community-based and health care organizations. Although HIV rates are declining in Chicago, other sexually transmitted infections are rising. More than 30,600 cases of chlamydia, nearly 12,700 cases of gonorrhea and 877 primary and secondary cases of syphilis were reported to the health department in 2018.\n\nIndiana\n\nFishers:A 4-year-old girl who sledded Saturday onto a frozen pond that was rapidly melting was rescued by firefighters as the ice began to crack while they pulled her to safety. The incident happened at 10 a.m. Saturday in the girl’s backyard, according to a post on the fire department’s Facebook page. The sled was parked near the house but the snowy backyard led directly to the retention pond on a downward slope. Firefighters said the child hopped on the sled before the parents could react, and it carried her onto the pond. The ice did not crack and the parents did not try to walk out to the sled, which firefighters said was the right thing to do because the ice was brittle. Instead, they called 911 and waited for the fire department. The rescuers arrived quickly as the child waited on the sled, according to the post. They used equipment to scoot onto the ice and grab the girl. As they did, firefighters heard the cracking but “luck held that the ice could support the weight,” according to the Facebook post. Officials with the fire department could not be reached immediately for comment but they warned on Facebook that ice-covered ponds will continue to melt this week as temperatures remain above average.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Twice within an hour on the afternoon of Dec. 9, police said a Des Moines woman intentionally struck young pedestrians with her SUV, later telling authorities that she targeted a teenage girl because she was Latino. The other victim is a black male. Nicole Marie Poole Franklin, 42, is accused of hitting a 12-year-old boy with her SUV as he walked on a sidewalk within an apartment complex property in the 6000 block of Creston Avenue in Des Moines. Franklin is charged with attempted murder in the incident, which occurred at 3:54 p.m. on Dec. 9, according to a news release from Des Moines police. Witnesses told police the SUV accelerated before striking the boy, who suffered minor injuries. About 30 minutes later, Clive police said Franklin drove off the roadway and struck 14-year-old Natalia Miranda as she walked on a sidewalk along Indian Hills Drive. Franklin faces an attempted murder charge in the hit-and-run. Clive Police Chief Michael Venema said Franklin told police that she targeted Miranda because the girl \"is Mexican.\" Miranda suffered several injuries but returned to school less than a week after the incident. She told KCCI after the crash that she remembers the vehicle coming toward her, but doesn't recall being hit. About an hour after Miranda was hit, West Des Moines police were called to a Conoco gas station where Franklin allegedly stole merchandise and referred to employees and customers by racial and ethnic slurs. West Des Moines police on Sunday said Franklin would face a felony hate crime charge – assault in violation of individual rights – for the Conoco incident, on top of previous charges of theft and public intoxication.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shawnee County has an extra $75 in its coffers because of a former thief with a guilty conscious. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported that someone anonymously sent the money to Shawnee County along with a letter dated Dec. 18. The letter stated that the sender is in a 12-step program and working to make financial amends. It stated that many years ago, the writer stole a receptacle meant for cigarette ashes that was in front of the courthouse. County Commission Chairman Bill Riphahn said the letter was accompanied by three $20 bills, a $10 bill and a $5 bill.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State Police collected more than 236 tons of food for Kentucky families with the 10th annual “Cram the Cruiser” food drive. Post 16 in Owensboro collected the most this year with a total of 60,925 pounds of food. Post commander Capt. Brenton Ford credited Master Trooper Corey King for organizing the drive and also recognized the support of local people and businesses, a state police news release said. State police initiated the program in 2010 to help families in need in local post and region areas. Since then, the agency has contributed nearly 2 million pounds of food to shelters, food banks and churches around the state.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: At least one bald eagle, and possibly a second, might have been killed in northwest Louisiana, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Agents believed it happened in the Lake Claiborne area, though they don’t think it was in the state park there, enforcement division spokesman Adam Einck said in an email Monday to the Associated Press. Einck said he couldn’t provide any details because agents are still investigating. The birds are no longer endangered but remain protected by two federal laws. Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a first offense of killing a bald eagle can bring up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine. The other law is the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The number of bald eagle nests being used for eggs and nestlings fell to at most seven in the early 1970s. A survey in southeast Louisiana, where the birds are most numerous, found 264 active nests in 2018.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine lobstering group has promised to fight the approval of an oyster farm off the state’s southern coast that has become part of a protracted fight over access to the water. The Maine Department of Marine Resources approved a lease of about 35 acres on Maquoit Bay on Dec. 19 for the Mere Point Oyster Company. The state uses a leasing system to allow people raising seafood to use state-owned waters to grow shellfish such as oysters and mussels. Many Maine lobster fishermen opposed the application because they fear it will take away their access to the bay bottom, where they trap lobsters. Some have also said the project is symptomatic of an aquaculture industry they think is growing too fast for the state and will make it difficult to catch Maine’s signature seafood. Opponents of the project are filing an appeal in court to attempt to stop it. Representatives for the Mere Point Oyster Company did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nMaryland\n\nRidge: The state’s first formal stock assessment supported claims by environmentalists that oyster numbers have experienced a sharp decline in the Chesapeake Bay – down 50% since 1999. The study estimated market-size oysters dropped from 600 million in 1999 to about 300 million in the Maryland portion of the bay in 2018. The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science collaborated in the study at the request of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources after the state legislature mandated it. Oysters play an important role in the bay’s ecosystem because of their water-filtering capabilities. They also create reefs for habitat for other bay life. DNR chief Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio said the stock assessment provides “the best available science” to move forward. She also said the state’s oyster management plan has been updated, with the goal of creating a sustainable oyster fishery in eight to 10 years.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A federal judge is hearing arguments in a case challenging how Massachusetts prisons treat inmates with opioid addiction. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts is seeking a temporary restraining order compelling the state Department of Correction to provide three prisoners their prescribed medication for opioid addiction while they serve out their sentences. The ACLU and the law firm Goodwin Procter filed suit Friday alleging that the three inmates had been prescribed addiction treatment medication before being incarcerated but were told by prison officials that they would only receive them for up to 90 days, after which they would be withdrawn. The organizations argue the policy violates the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act’s protections for people suffering from opioid addiction. The organizations said the inmates are effectively being forced to go through painful withdrawal and face an increased risk of relapse, overdose, and death without their medication. The Correction Department has said it doesn’t have a policy restricting the dosage or length of treatment for opioid addiction medications. It said any decisions about maintaining or discontinuing medications are made by the company it contracts for inmate health care service.\n\nMichigan\n\nMadison Heights:The state said there is no immediate health threat as crews continue to clean up a greenish-yellow chemical ooze that ran onto I-696 in Madison Heights on Friday, apparently seeping from a nearby chemical plating plant that was closed three years ago. The underground plume is not impacting air quality or the drinking water, Jill Greenberg, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy said Sunday. The contaminated water is migrating underground and working its way to the freeway, she said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is working with the state, determined the liquid likely was groundwater contaminated with hexavalent chromium. Samples results from the site are expected this week, Greenberg said. The spill has been traced to a nearby, closed electro-plating company in Madison Heights whose owner was convicted of storing dangerous chemicals in leaky containers. Hexavalent chromium is the same chemical Pacific Gas and Electric Company was accused of contaminating the drinking water in a California town in the famous lawsuit brought by activist Erin Brockovich.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMillerville: Authorities said two brothers are dead after being overcome by fumes in a grain silo on a western Minnesota farm. The Star Tribune reported the victims were identified as 47-year-old Curt F. Boesl and 49-year-old Steven T. Boesl. Authorities said an 11-year-old son of Curt Boesl’s, Alex, also fell ill to the fumes late Saturday morning and was taken by air ambulance to a Twin Cities hospital. His condition has not been released. Authorities said Boesl and his son were working in the top of the silo and “were apparently overcome by fumes.” Another son outside the silo saw what happened and called 911. He also called his uncle, Steven, who arrived and went to the top of the silo to try and rescue his brother and nephew. Authorities said Steven Boesl also was apparently overcome by fumes. By the time deputies arrived, all three were unconscious. Emergency responders removed them from the silo. Ambulance personnel declared Steven Boesl dead at the scene. Curt Boesl died Sunday morning.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Average wait times have tripled at Mississippi’s driver’s license stations over the past two years, according to a report by a state legislative watchdog agency. The Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review report released Dec. 18 attributed the spike in waits to reasons including vacancies, malfunctioning kiosks and clients being provided outdated or inaccurate or incomplete information. Other reasons include the adoption of a computer system that the report said increased processing times for routine transactions by 40% to 50%, news outlets reported. The state Department of Public Safety is working to lessen wait times, the report said. Changes include implementing appointment scheduling, filling vacant positions and improving online services, the report and Public Service Commissioner Marshall Fisher said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Clair: Authorities said two boys have died after plunging through a frozen pond near their home in eastern Missouri. The Missouri State Highway Patrol said the 7- and 8-year-old boys were found Sunday afternoon in the private pond in Franklin County. The search began after the boys didn’t return from a bicycle ride. The patrol said a family member found one of them floating in the pond. A diver then located the second child. The report didn’t say how long they had been in the water. They were pronounced dead several hours later. Their names weren’t immediately released.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: US officials transferred 33 disease-free bison from Yellowstone National Park to a Montana Indian Reservation as part of efforts to reduce the slaughter of bison that migrate out of the park. Robert Magnan with the Fort Peck Tribes said a trailer carrying the animals left the park Monday morning. It was expected to arrive at the reservation in northeastern Montana later in the day. The animals were to be released into a pasture on Tuesday. The shipment includes bison and their descendants who were trapped to prevent the spread of the disease brucellosis. They have been tested repeatedly to make sure they are disease-free. Brucellosis can cause pregnant animals to prematurely abort their young. It has been eradicated in the U.S. except for the Yellowstone area, where it persists in herds of elk and bison. Yellowstone has captured thousands of bison and sent them to slaughter for disease control over the past few decades. Monday’s transfer was done under a program that puts some captured animals through a quarantine to make sure they do not carry brucellosis. The quarantine program has been in place for more than a decade, but struggled in its early years in part because of opposition from the livestock industry due to worries about cows becoming infected.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Prison officials have canceled Christmas Eve visits to the Nebraska State Penitentiary to fight a prison system flu outbreak. Nearly four dozen flu cases have been confirmed and a higher number are suspected at five prison facilities, the Department of Correctional Services said in a new release Sunday. The penitentiary in Lincoln has the highest number of confirmed and suspected cases, said prisons director Scott Frakes. The department is taking several steps to help stop the outbreak, including providing face masks for staffers and inmates and encouraging inmates to get flu shots.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:State water officials want to pause the approval of groundwater for new developments in Cold Spring Valley north of Reno, which has seen thousands of new homes in recent decades. They want to know more about the sustainability of the valley’s groundwater supply before signing off on new projects. On Friday, state engineer Tim Wilson, Nevada's highest-ranking water official, signed an order declaring a moratorium on approving new subdivision maps if the development would rely on groundwater pumped from the Cold Spring Valley. The order makes exceptions for developments that would import water via pipeline, such as the proposed 5,000-unit Stonegate development. Pumping to support existing homes in the valley isn't affected by the order. Wilson and his boss, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Director Bradley Crowell, are concerned the amount of water rights approved exceed the rate at which nature replenishes the underground aquifer.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State lawmakers will be considering two bills to crack down on vaping this session. Last session, the Legislature added vaping to state’s tobacco laws and raised the minimum age for cigarettes and vaping products to 19. Next year, lawmakers will consider a bill to go even further and raise the minimum age for vaping to 21. Lawmakers also will take up a bill that would ban all flavored vaping products except for menthol. Democratic Rep. Jerry Knirk told New Hampshire Public Radio that he believes it’s a public health issue and that lawmakers should be doing everything they can to stop teens from vaping. But Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said he would not support banning sales of any vaping products.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold Township:About 200 people rallied Saturday for Stephanie Parze, a 25-year-old missing Freehold Township woman, an effort by her family to keep a light burning for her. The group stood outlined in yellow police tape shaped into a heart as a tower ladder from the East Freehold Fire Company hoisted photographers over the crowd. Parze was last heard from on Oct. 30 after a night out with family. Her on-again, off-again boyfriend, John D. Ozbilgen, 29, was named by police as a person of interest. He took his own life on Nov. 22, hanging himself in the garage of his parents’ Freehold Township home. That was two days after he was released from Monmouth County Jail, where he was held for 11 days on a child pornography charge that resulted from a review of his cellphone in connection with Parze’s disappearance. Suspicion hung over Ozbligen up to his death. He was accused of choking and beating other women and posting Facebook messages and sending texts that alluded to abuse, violence and homicide. Parze’s father, Ed, said the outpouring of support has been surprising. One woman delivered 21 baskets of gifts worth thousands of dollars that she collected from neighbors to be auctioned off at a fundraiser. The family is continuing to schedule searches and fundraising events. A search will be staged at 9 a.m. Sunday at 333 Route 522 in Manalapan.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: President Donald Trump signed legislation Friday that extends federal grant programs aimed at preserving indigenous languages and expands eligibility so more tribes can participate. The legislation was named after Esther Martinez, a traditional storyteller and Tewa language advocate from northern New Mexico’s Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo who died in 2006. Her family, tribal leaders and members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation said reauthorization of the programs through 2024 marks a commitment by the federal government to keeping Alaska Native and American Indian languages alive. Dozens of tribes from Alaska to Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and Massachusetts have benefited from the programs over the years. There are more than 40 active grants totaling more than $11 million that are being used for language preservation and immersion efforts.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: The most popular baby names in New York City last year were Liam and Emma, according to data released by city health officials Monday. Of the babies born in New York City in 2018, there were 779 Liams and 501 Emmas, according to the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s birth certificate records. The number of births in the city decreased from 117,013 in 2017 to 114,296 in 2018, according to the city’s data. Liam has been the top name for boys since 2016, and Emma has been the top name for girls since 2017. Some New Yorkers opted for rarer names: There were a handful of girls named Aminah, Ida and Zadie and boys called Bentley, Lucian and Warren. Nine of the top 10 boy names from 2017 remained on the list in 2018. Jayden was dropped from the 2018 list while Alexander was added as the 10th-most popular name. Eight of the top girl names stayed on the top 10 list for 2018. Amelia and Chloe joined the list as the ninth- and 10th-most popular names in 2018 respectively.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWaynesville: Authorities said a man impersonating a police officer pulled a woman over and told her to get out of her car at gunpoint. The man is still at large. The Haywood County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that the incident happened Sunday. The sheriff’s office said the man was driving a silver Dodge Charger with dark-tinted windows and white strobe lights. The woman thought it was a police vehicle and pulled over. The sheriff’s office said the man wore a black button up collared shirt, cargo pants and silver badge. He also had a gun on his belt. Authorities said the man pulled out his gun and told the woman to “get out of the car.” The woman drove off only for the man to briefly chase her in his car.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A landslide closed a road in the Bismarck area, but authorities said no one was injured. A driver called authorities Sunday afternoon about the impassable River Road. It wasn’t immediately known what caused the landslide that blocked both lanes of traffic. Burleigh County highway department engineers were assessing the situation and how best to reopen the road.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: Aerospace fans who have trouble fitting a museum visit into daytime hours will have the opportunity next year to make evening visits to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. The extended schedule once a month will give busy families and other people with time crunches more options to see and experience the museum’s exhibits, museum officials said. The museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but will remain open until 8 p.m. on the first Thursday of each month beginning next year. Visitors on select evenings will get up-close looks at different vintage aircraft in the museum’s collection with volunteer experts on hand to discuss and answer questions. The museum near Dayton plays host to some 800,000 visitors a year who can see more than 350 aerospace vehicles and thousands of artifacts. It also shows movies and offers simulators and other attractions. Admissions and parking are free.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: An iconic building in downtown Tulsa that was once the world headquarters for televangelist Oral Roberts’ ministries is losing its distinctive diamond-shaped facade for safety reasons. The Tulsa World reported workers are removing the diamond-shaped slabs of granite that cover the Abundant Life Building, The building was originally constructed in 1958 but has been vacant since the 1980s. Its ownership has changed hands several times over the years. It’s now owned by Sharp Development. Brian Elliott, with Sharp Development, on Friday said several of the diamonds have fallen on their own. Preservation Oklahoma chose the windowless structure as one of 2016’s most endangered historic places. Preservationists said the building exemplifies at-risk midcentury architecture and is woven into the fabric of Tulsa’s past. The building had been subject to several nuisance violations between 2004 and 2014. A trespasser died in 2013 after falling down an elevator shaft.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:A group of homeless people followed up on a plan to set up tents on the state Capitol grounds Monday after being displaced from downtown under a camping ban passed by the City Council earlier this month. About 25 people with about a dozen tents occupied the park before State Police and Parks and Recreation Department officials arrived. State officials and Salem Housing Authority staff told the homeless they had two hours to leave the Oregon Capitol State Park. At least one camper was arrested on an outstanding warrant. City officials briefly revisited an idea to allow sanctioned tent camping Friday, but they have backed away from that proposal. Instead, they are redoubling efforts to find a space to operate a 90-day warming shelter after Salem First Presbyterian Church decided not to participate.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGladwyne: Joseph Segel, a “quintessential entrepreneur” who founded the home-shopping network QVC, has died, the company that owns the channel announced. He was 88. Segel died Saturday in Gladwyne because of congestive heart failure, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. He was remembered as an innovator for creating QVC, short for “Quality Value Convenience.” It launched in 1986 and was played by nearly 60 cable stations. It now reaches 380 million homes throughout the world, according to a press release from Qurate Retail Group. In 1993, Segel retired as chairman of QVC. He stayed on as a company adviser until 2013. Segel’s entrepreneurial streak wasn’t just limited to QVC. He also founded the Franklin Mint, a private mint company that produces commemorative coins and other collectibles. It is now owned by Sequential Brands Group.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBurrillville: State environmental officials have cited two people and are looking for four others they said were deer hunting out of season over the weekend. Environmental officers responded to Burrillville on Sunday after getting reports of out-of-season hunters, according to Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management posts on social media. The first officer on the scene made contact with two people they described as poachers, but four others fled into the woods. A department dog was brought to the scene and found three shotguns hidden under the snow and leaves. One was still loaded. A fourth hidden shotgun was located by officers searching another area of the woods. No names were released.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: Nearly 1,200 city employees are getting early Christmas presents in the form of January pay raises. The Spartanburg Herald-Journal reported that the County Council recently adopted the county’s first pay restructuring in more than a decade, which includes $5.3 million in annual pay increases and benefits for jobs in 27 pay grades ranging from $23,500 to $167,710. The increases will affect 1,183 employees. The Council had budgeted for 4% increases. Some will get more, and others will get less. County Administrator Cole Alverson said tax revenue is greater than expected, and all the raises can be paid for without a tax increase. The raises take effect Jan. 3, and will be seen in the Jan. 23 paychecks, he said. Designed to attract and retain employees, council members said they hope the raises make up for several lean budget years of no or little pay increases.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Two South Dakota companies have paid off all lunch debt in the Pierre School District. Karber Construction and American Trust Insurance have eliminated a negative balance of about $2,300 in students’ meal accounts. Mandy Karber said that as a small business, they were looking for a way to give back. She said it’s typical of the community where there are a lot of people willing to help out, according to the Argus Leader. American Trust Insurance said it raised about $1,000 with an employee-giving campaign. District business manager Darla Mayer said school officials are grateful for the generous individuals and businesses.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:Two American originals, Elvis Presley and David Lynch, will converge when Graceland plays host to a fan convention celebrating the 30th anniversary of “Twin Peaks.” The gathering – officially known as “Twin Peaks 30: Official Fan Celebration” – is set for April 3-5, with most events at the Elvis Presley’s Memphis entertainment complex across the street from the mansion. According to Graceland, the convention will include “‘Twin Peaks’-themed parties; exhibits of props and costumes; screenings of fan-favorite episodes; and autograph and meet-and-greet sessions “accompanied by cherry pie and ‘damn good coffee,’” according to a press release citing the culinary preferences of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, the series hero played by Kyle MacLachlan. Celebrity guests who are scheduled to attend include Sherilyn Fenn, Mädchen Amick, Dana Ashbrook, Chrysta Bell, Michael Horse, James Marshall, Kimmy Robertson and Sheryl Lee. Lynch, the celebrated director who created the cult series with writer Mark Frost, is not scheduled to attend. Ticket packages for the “Twin Peaks 30: Official Fan Celebration” go on sale at 2 p.m. Thursday at www.graceland.com/TwinPeaks. Tickets initially will be offered in expensive “packages,” ranging from $399 to $999; one-day tickets and other types of admission are expected to be made available at a later date.\n\nTexas\n\nKaty: A dispute over a child’s haircut ended with gunfire Saturday at a barbershop, according to authorities. Deputies are looking for a man who shot an employee of a barbershop in the Houston suburb of Katy during an argument, the Harris County Sheriff’s office said in a tweet Saturday. Witnesses said the argument was over a haircut given to the man’s son. The alleged shooter left the barbershop in a grey, four-door sedan, according to the sheriff’s office. The employee was shot three times and was in stable condition at an area hospital, KPRC-TV reported Saturday. The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to requests for information Sunday.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Federal officials are considering whether to allow a highway to be built through protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, a plan that has drawn criticism from conservationists. The proposed four-lane highway would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area north of St. George to connect traffic from Washington City to St. George, the Spectrum newspaper reported. The Bureau of Land Management is taking public comments through Jan. 6 ahead of a draft environmental impact statement that’s expected to come out late spring or early summer. Elected officials in southern Utah have been pushing for the road to address current and future traffic concerns in one of the most rapidly growing parts of the country. Conservationists argue that officials should consider alternatives to a highway that could put the threatened tortoise and other sensitive species at risk.\n\nVermont\n\nBarre: Three school districts will soon be using electric buses to carry some of their students to and from school. The Barre Unified School District, Champlain Valley School District and Franklin West Supervisory District will each replace a regular bus as part of an electric bus pilot program. The districts were chosen from a long list of applicants to participate in the program funded by Vermont’s legal settlement with Volkswagen for violations of the Clean Air Act, MyChamplainValley.com reported. Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Emily Boedecker said it’s an opportunity to check the benefits of electric transport on a small scale. The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources and the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation are working together on the program. Over the next few months the districts will be working with the sponsors to purchase the buses, build charging infrastructure, and look at any other facility upgrades that might be needed.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said Friday that he hired Melissa Baker to oversee 38 state parks and more than 270 employees. She will be the first woman to run the department in the park system’s 83-year history when she starts in January. Baker previously worked as the director of North Dakota Parks and Recreation Department and previously worked as chief of operations for Montana State Parks. She previously taught at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and the University of Maine.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Health officials are warning people to stay away from area beaches and bodies of water as the region’s record-breaking rainstorms have caused sewage spills. Medina Park Beach along Lake Washington, Saltwater State Park in Des Moines and Port Washington Narrows in Kitsap County were hit by sewage overflows caused by a 48-hour storm system that soaked the region. The heavy rainstorm began Thursday, dropping more than 6 inches of rain before easing up Saturday. Friday was the wettest day in Seattle in 10 years, and the most rain for Dec. 20 since record-keeping at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport began in 1945. The National Weather Service said the airport recorded 3.25 inches of rain Friday, making it also the fifth-rainiest day in city history. Seattle also broke a daily rainfall record on Thursday with 2.91 inches, making it the 11th-wettest day recorded at the airport. King County said the Medina Pump Station was fully functioning when it overflowed on Friday for about four hours. Advisory signs have been posted. Officials said coming into contact with fecal contaminated waters can cause gastroenteritis, skin rashes, upper respiratory infections, and other waterborne illnesses.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Residents who want to recycle their Christmas trees after the holidays will be able to donate them to be used for fish habitats. The recycling event is from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Jan. 4 at Charleston’s Capitol Market. There’s no limit to the number of trees each person can donate and no size limit. Trees must be real. All decorations must be removed, and branches must be attached to the tree. The trees will be repurposed as fish habitats in lakes across West Virginia, including Cheat, Tygart, Stonewall Jackson, Stonecoal, Burnsville, Sutton, Summersville, Big Ditch, Sherwood, R.D. Baily, Beech Fork and East Lynn lakes, and the Apple Grove Hatchery in Mason County. The program is sponsored by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection’s Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan in conjunction with West Virginia State Parks and the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources. Staff will be at the donation site to help unload trees. Those who donate can register for prizes, and each person who donates will receive a gift from the Rehabilitation Environmental Action Plan.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau: For decades, those who have participated in snowball fights in Wausau have risked getting in trouble with the law. But that might be about to change. A 1962 ban on throwing projectiles in Wausau lumps snowballs into the same category as rocks and other items that can cause serious harm. City Council President Lisa Rasmussen said that recent negative national attention over the rarely used ordinance has raised questions about whether it could be time to take snowballs off the naughty list. Wausau police and the mayor even made a video showing officers having a snowball fight. The City Council will consider decriminalizing snowball fights at a meeting next month.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: The city plans to continue using police sharpshooters to reduce its deer population. A Wyoming Game and Fish Department permit allows the city to cull as many as 50 deer per year. A recent count showed 180 deer in the city limits, down from 192 in 2018 and nearly 300 in 2015, the Cody Enterprise reported. A task force in 2015 recommended reducing the deer population to 150. Police sharpshooters have killed 151 deer since the local program began. Allowing the herd to grow would cause the deer to have insufficient food and become unhealthy, Police Chief Chuck Baker said. The Police Department provides the deer to people willing to process and eat the meat.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/12/rock-hall-hard-rock-resort-full-service-gas-news-around-states/111951272/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Attendants are coming out to gas up cars, clean windshields and even deliver food and drinks from inside at a dozen MAPCO stations nationwide, including one in Montgomery. The station near Publix at Vaughn and Taylor roads is now full-service from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day. Customers can pay from their car using a touchless credit card system. It offers online ordering and curbside service through https://www.mapcorewards.com/fullserviceplus. The company said the limited rollout is part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In-store occupancy is now limited to 10 people or less, in-store seating is closed, plexiglass shields have been installed at all registers and the company said employees have been provided masks and are allowed to wear gloves. The only other Alabama locations that have rolled out the service are in Huntsville. The chain has more than 340 locations nationwide.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: Two animal rights groups arranged for a second shipment of dog food to remote Alaska Native villages they said were in dire need of the supplies. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Humane Society of the United States worked together to deliver 8,000 pounds of dog food to Bethel. The need stemmed from the coronavirus pandemic. Supplies were running low after the two groups provided the same amount of dog food in an April shipment. Five pallets of dog food were delivered to the western Alaska hub community. From there, Bethel Friends of Canines will distribute the dog food to rural villages in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. Officials said in a release that delivery of dog food to rural Alaska has been challenging during the pandemic because of limited supplies and transportation options.\n\nArizona\n\nWindow Rock: Census workers will resume dropping off questionnaires at homes on the Navajo Nation this week. The tribe’s legislative branch said the work to deliver paper packets to more than 70,000 homes began Thursday. The operation that started in mid-March quickly was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. People who receive the packets can fill out the census using the paper forms, by phone or online. The U.S. Census Bureau said its staff has received training in social distancing and workers have protective equipment to do their jobs. The packets are left at homes in areas where most people do not receive mail at a physical address. Navajo Nation Council Speaker Seth Damon urged tribal members to complete the form to ensure an accurate count and to list “Navajo” as the individual tribal affiliation. Census data is collected every 10 years and is used to allocate federal funds that support education, infrastructure and human service expenditures. So far, less than 1% of Navajos have responded on their own, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state will further ease its coronavirus restrictions on businesses next week, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday, despite recent dramatic increases in the state’s active cases and hospitalizations. Hutchinson said the state will move into “Phase 2” of reopening on Monday, allowing restaurants, bars and other businesses that are limited to one-third capacity to expand to two thirds. Arkansas last month began allowing businesses that had closed because of the pandemic to reopen but with capacity limits and other restrictions meant to prevent the virus’ spread. The Republican governor decided to further reopen businesses even with the state in the midst of what he has called a second peak of the outbreak. The number of active cases, meaning ones that don’t include people who have recovered or died, has increased by more than 85% since Memorial Day. Hospitalizations have increased by more than 82% in that same period. “We’re not out of the woods,” Hutchinson said. “We’re still in the heart of the woods when it comes to this health care emergency.” Hutchinson and state health officials said there isn’t any evidence connecting the spike in cases to the decision to reopen businesses. The increase has been driven by a rise in cases in northwest Arkansas, especially in the Latino community. The governor has also said the increase is partly due to increased testing in the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state Assembly narrowly passed a proposal on Wednesday that would allow legislators to vote remotely during emergencies, as lawmakers widely regretted not being able to act during a weeks-long recess amid the coronavirus pandemic. The measure comes after other states and cities have relaxed rules to vote remotely during the public health emergency. In California, the Legislature stopped work for the first time in 158 years in the middle of March, before resuming committee meetings in early May. Lawmakers said they need to continue serving and passing budgets during events like major earthquakes and pandemics. The state Senate has until June 25 to approve the proposed constitutional amendment for remote voting by two-thirds vote in order to place it on the November ballot, where voters would have the final say. The measure passed with 54 votes, just enough for a two-thirds majority, and bipartisan backing. But some Republicans who opposed the bill said it should be narrowly tailored to only allow lawmakers to cast a vote remotely, not permit them to use someone else as a proxy vote in the event they cannot attend a session during an emergency.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad has announced plans to reopen with limited service trips by the end of the month after shutting down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis eased regulations in the past few weeks, allowing scenic trains to resume operations at 50% capacity, the Durango Herald reported. It is one of the region’s main economic drivers, accounting for about $250 million with more than 200 peak season employees and 100 year-round employees, according to the Durango Chamber of Commerce. It is also a tourist attraction that brings up to 200,000 riders annually from around the world on the 45-mile trek from Durango to Silverton. The company originally said it would only be profitable at 75% capacity, but said it reworked its operations to make 50% financially feasible because it was unlikely it would be allowed to run at a higher capacity. The railroad could start running limited service trips by the last week of June if given approval, which could include shorter trips out of Silverton and reopening the museum and gift shop in Durango. Railroad officials have said they will have to reduce the number of people on each train because of COVID-19 and implement safety measures, such as requiring face masks.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Attorneys representing patients at two state psychiatric hospitals in Connecticut are asking a judge to require Connecticut Valley Hospital and Whiting Forensic Hospital to take additional steps to stop the spread of the new coronavirus to better protect patients, including reducing the patient populations. They’re also calling for improvements in hygiene and decontamination practices; steps that ensure staff consistently wear masks and patients are encouraged to wear masks; and requiring both hospitals to conform their testing protocols to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards. This week, the Connecticut Legal Rights Project and the Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and Center for Public Representation filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in a class-action lawsuit against the state. They note there have been outbreaks at both hospitals and five patients at Connecticut Valley Hospital have died from COVID-19, while the state has confirmed 73 cases among patients and 64 among staff at both facilities. A spokeswoman for the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Service said the agency was not able to comment on pending litigation.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Now that outdoor gatherings of up to 250 people are allowed by the state, schools are starting to rethink in-person graduation ceremonies. School districts are creatively coming up with plans to celebrate seniors and prevent the spread of COVID-19. In the Christina School District, high schools opted for an outdoor event, giving students the opportunity to walk across a stage. Dressed in graduation garb in their decorated cars, Capital High School graduates took a victory lap around Dover International Speedway, receiving their diplomas through the car window. For students at Sussex Tech, groups of teachers paraded through the county to drop off items like senior T-shirts, graduation caps and gowns and yard signs. And in communities across Delaware, neighbors have organized their own graduation parades to give students an in-person event as several districts hold virtual ceremonies. Other school districts continue to roll out graduation plans for the coming weeks. In most cases, students are split into staggered groups to accommodate the 250-person rule.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After more than a month of decline in deaths, the District has been on a slight upward trend for the past three days. The daily numbers remain far below where they were in early and mid-May, however. On Wednesday, DC Health reported 63 new cases and four new deaths, bringing the city’s totals to 9,537 and 499, respectively.\n\nFlorida\n\nHollywood: The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino said it will open its doors later this week for the first time since March, when coronavirus concerns forced it to close. The casino resort will open Friday with requirements that visitors wear face masks and get temperature checks upon entering. Some table games are being retrofitted with plexiglass shields and gaming chips will be sprayed with a sanitizing solution. Capacity will be limited to 50% and guests and workers are expected to maintain social distancing, according to new guidelines. The resort said all of its properties have been equipped with air purification and disinfecting systems. Meanwhile, Disney officials outlined new hotel protocols as they prepare to reopen Walt Disney World resorts next month. The company said it would devote extra cleaning to high-traffic areas like elevators, escalators, handrails, benches and restrooms. Restaurants and fitness centers will have limits on the number of people allowed in, and cashless options will be emphasized at shops and restaurants, the company said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A Georgia man is accused of falsely claiming that an air purifier he was selling would kill the coronavirus, federal prosecutors said Thursday. Stephen Matthew “Matt” Shumaker of Marietta had postcards sent to thousands of Georgia residents claiming that the Beyond Guardian Air air purifier kills “every known major viral and bacterial infection,” including the coronavirus and COVID-19, according to a sworn statement from a postal inspector filed in federal court in Atlanta. The postcards, which were mailed in March and include a photo of the air purifier, feature a red box with white type that says: “KILL COVID-19, CORONAVIRUS IN YOUR HOME!!” according to a copy included in the postal inspector’s statement. Shumaker, 43, is charged with mail fraud and knowingly distributing and selling a misbranded pesticidal device. Federal prosecutors said Shumaker has been arrested. Online court records did not list an attorney who could comment on the charges. The postal inspector opened the investigation in April after a resident reported receiving a suspicious postcard in the mail. The postal inspector found that the phone number on the card was registered to Pure Life Water Corp, which is run by Shumaker.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Hawaii County has canceled all sponsored Independence Day festivities because of concerns about spreading the new coronavirus among thousands of attendees, officials said. Mayor Harry Kim said the county’s annual Fourth of July events cannot be safely conducted without risking an additional outbreak of of COVID-19, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Wednesday. County-sponsored events include the Hilo Bay Blast, which provides a day of activities around Hilo Bayfront culminating in a public fireworks display. The cancellation was the “necessary thing to do,” Kim said. “Nobody wanted to have to do this,” Kim said. “But literally thousands of people go to the Bayfront for these events. There’s no way we can ensure that everything will be safe by next month.” Other canceled Big Island holiday events include the Kailua-Kona Fourth of July parade and fireworks and the Parker Ranch Fourth of July rodeo and horse races in Waimea. Kim said he hopes some of the events can be rescheduled for later in the year when concerns about the spread of the virus have eased.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little said Idaho can move to the fourth and final stage of his plan to return to regular activity during the coronavirus pandemic despite a bump in infections, including among health care workers. The Republican governor said restrictions will be lifted Saturday that will allow gatherings of more than 50 people as long as precautions are taken. Employers can resume unrestricted staffing but should protect workers with physical distancing and other measures. Visits to senior living facilities can resume, but physical distancing and good hygiene should be practiced. The wearing of face coverings should continue when people go out in public. Little’s plan for moving through the four stages is based on infection rates and testing. The readiness of the health care system is another factor, including available ventilators and beds in intensive care units. Little said Thursday that all those factors allowing moving to stage 4 are being met, though it was close on several. Idaho has 3,260 confirmed cases of the virus that have caused 85 deaths, according to a total by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday. Stage 4 is scheduled to end on June 26.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Surgeons have given a new set of lungs to a young woman with severe lung damage from the new coronavirus. Only a few other COVID-19 survivors, in China and Europe, have received lung transplants. The patient, who is her 20s, was on a ventilator and heart-lung machine for almost two months before her operation June 5 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. The 10-hour procedure was challenging because the virus had left her lungs full of holes and almost fused to the chest wall, Dr. Ankit Bharat, who performed the operation, said Wednesday. Doctors have kept her on both machines while her body heals but said her chances for a normal life are good. “We are anticipating that she will have a full recovery,” said Dr. Rade Tomic, medical director of the hospital’s lung transplant program. The patient was not identified but Bharat said she had recently moved to Chicago from North Carolina to be with her boyfriend. She was otherwise pretty healthy but her condition rapidly deteriorated after she was hospitalized in late April. Doctors waited six weeks for her body to clear the virus before considering a transplant. Lungs accounted for just 7% of the nearly 40,000 U.S. organ transplants last year. They are typically hard to find and patients often wait weeks on the transplant list. The Chicago patient was in bad shape, with signs that her heart, kidneys and liver were beginning to fail, so she quickly moved up in line, Bharat said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Movie theaters, bars, museums and amusement parks across the state will be allowed to reopen Friday for the first time in nearly three months, as Gov. Eric Holcomb said he was moving up by two days the next stage of easing the state’s coronavirus restrictions. A new state order will allow social gatherings of up to 250 people and retail stores and malls to operate at full capacity, Holcomb said. Gatherings have been limited to 100 people and stores to 75% capacity for the past three weeks as such limits have been gradually lifted since early May. Restaurants will be allowed 75% capacity in their dining rooms, while bars, nightclubs, movie theaters, bowling alleys, museums and amusement parks can open at half-capacity. Casinos can resume operations starting Monday under safety plans submitted to the Indiana Gaming Commission. Public playgrounds can reopen Friday, but festivals and parades ares still prohibited. This reopening stage had been scheduled for Sunday. Officials said the earlier action was possible because of continuing declines in the number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 and the availability of intensive care unit beds to treat those who are most seriously ill.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Hold the pork chop on a stick and get a butter cow rain check. Thie Iowa State Fair was canceled because of coronavirus concerns, marking the first time since World War II that the annual gathering won’t be held in Des Moines. Without comment, the state fair board voted 11-2 to cancel the fair, which typically caps an Iowa summer with an 11-day run in mid-August. The fair is the biggest attraction in Iowa, typically drawing more than 1 million visitors who check out the butter cow, buy pork chops or countless other food typically skewered with a stick and stroll through 445 acres of barns, carnival attractions and even a campground. Officials in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Indiana also have canceled their fairs, though state fairs are going ahead in some states, including Nebraska, South Dakota and Kansas.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A Catholic church in Wichita has temporarily closed after a priest tested positive for COVID-19. Matt Davied of the Church of the Magdalen said in a Facebook post on the church’s account that he underwent testing after waking up feeling ill on Wednesday. He said he is now in isolation. Because the priests live together in the rectory, a second priest is in quarantine. All Masses at the church have been suspended and live streams will be temporarily discontinued, The Wichita Eagle reported.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Education and health officials plan to meet Friday to discuss how to safely reopen schools during the coronavirus pandemic. The Kentucky Department for Public Health is working on protocols and will meet with the leaders at the Kentucky Department of Education to “hone the guidance,” Interim Education Commissioner Kevin C. Brown said in a statement. A timeline for the release of the guidance will be established at the meeting, officials said. The Department for Public Health has implemented Healthy at Work guidance and officials said schools should follow similar guidelines that include wearing face masks and social distancing. Brown said he thinks districts can begin looking at an August start date for classes, but should be prepared to switch to nontraditional instruction if circumstances call for it.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana State University scientists will be testing sewage for genetic traces of the novel coronavirus in Baton Rouge. The technique is being used in many places. Although most sewage systems use gravity to bring sewage to a central plant, flat cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge must use pumping stations. Because Baton Rouge has more than 500 pumping stations, “we can get precise with our sampling,” environmental engineering professor John Pardue said in a news release Tuesday from LSU. Tulane University said a $1 million donation from Colorado cookbook author Elana Amsterdam and her husband, Vail Resorts CEO Rob Katz, will let it more than triple its ability to test for COVID-19. Equipment bought with the money will enable 1,000 tests a day, up from 300, a news release said Monday. Tulane said its lab ran about 3,000 tests from April 1 until mid-May. Those included almost 1,400 from Orleans Parish Prison, 300 from a clinic set up in the Morial Convention Center and 600 from patients of state mental health facilities. Amsterdam and Katz are parents of a student at Tulane, university spokesman Keith Brannon said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State Senate President Troy Jackson said “we’re getting close” to the point where state lawmakers can reconvene, three months after they adjourned and gave Democratic Gov. Janet Mills broad emergency powers to address the coronavirus pandemic. Although Mills has come under criticism, state lawmakers have remained on the sidelines and tensions flared last week when the labor commissioner skipped an oversight hearing. But that might be changing. “I certainly feel like we are getting close to the point where we may reconvene and, at that time, her emergency powers either won’t be the same, or they won’t be there at all,” Jackson told the Portland Press Herald. Neither Jackson nor House Speaker Sara Gideon, both Democrats, would provide a specific timetable because details have yet to be worked out about how best to safely reconvene amid an ongoing public crisis. Mills could call the Legislature back into special session at any time. She told lawmakers in March that they should reconvene “when it is safe to do so.” On Thursday, members of the much-larger state House of Representatives reconvened at an indoor arena on the University of New Hampshire campus to ensure social distancing guidelines.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Federal agents have seized thousands of COVID-19 treatment capsules and dozens of testing kits, saying the items were all imported from China and are fake. A Baltimore-based team of agents from Homeland Security Investigations found the COVID-19 treatment capsules at the Port of Baltimore, hidden in boxes under packets of Chinese tea, WJZ reported. John Eisert, HSI Baltimore special agent in charge, said his team is concerned about what’s inside the capsules, which were touted as being able to relieve coronoavirus patients of their symptoms. Eisert said prior seizures of pharmaceuticals have revealed ingredients such as sheet rock, pesticides and lead. HSI launched a nationwide operation, Operation Stolen Promise, to seize COVID contraband. Agents also are trying to take down websites where these products are available to be purchased and shipped to the U.S.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Even as ridership remains low, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is preparing to ramp up service across all of modes of transit, including subways, buses, ferries and commuter rail. Beginning June 21, regular weekday subway service will operate on the Blue Line and increased weekday service will operate on the Red, Orange, Green, and Mattapan lines. Service will also be increased for nearly 60 high-demand bus routes in the metropolitan Boston area. On June 22, commuter rail service will be increased and ferry service will resume on weekdays. The changes come as the state begins to reopen after months of a stay-at-home advisory meant to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus that led to plummeting ridership on the public transit system. MBTA officials said that although passenger volume continues to be just a fraction of prepandemic levels, they will continue to closely monitor ridership and undesirable crowding and make adjustments as needed. Riders are required to wear masks and try to maintain social distance when possible.\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Huron:An annual sailboat race along Lake Huron will be held next month, despite cancellations of other events because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Bayview Port Huron race is planned for July 11, the Times Herald reported. This year’s race will have one route instead of two. Participation is down about 40% so far, which Bayview Mackinac race chairman Chris Clark credited to circumstances related to the pandemic. “The mantra this year is ‘Patience and Flexibility,’ ” Clark wrote in an email. “We are working hard with all those involved in hosting the race to make sure everyone has a safe fun race!.” The Chicago Yacht Club posted a statement last week announcing the cancellation of the 2020 Chicago to Mackinac Island sailboat race. Race Chairman Martin Sandoval said the Chicago race’s committee had taken a “patient and pragmatic” approach to following limitations and guidelines. The race was scheduled for July 17. Clark noted that the Chicago race does not affect the Bayview race. “The CYC race to Mackinac is a great race and it is sad to see any Great Lakes race needing to be canceled. Chicago is facing their own unique issues that are not the same as ours.” Other summer events in Port Huron, including the Blue Water Fest and the 100th annual International Day Parade, have been canceled.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul:Another 13 Minnesotans died from COVID-19 and 453 more people have tested positive for the disease, according to Thursday’s report from the Minnesota Department of Health. Stearns County reported seven more cases Thursday, Sherburne County reported one and Benton County had no new cases, according to the report. Stearns County now has reported 2,088 cases and 17 deaths, Sherburne County has reported 261 cases and two deaths and Benton County has reported 190 cases and three deaths. Statewide, the number of people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus reached 29,316 on Thursday and 1,249 people have died, according to the report. Of those cases, 24,870 patients no longer need isolation. As of Thursday, 411 people remain hospitalized with the virus, and 196 of them remain in intensive care. In total, 3,522 cases have required hospitalization.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: Efforts to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus have further delayed the return of cruises along the Mississippi River. American Cruise Lines announced this week that it would resume operations on the river July 11, The Vicksburg Post reported. It was previously expected to resume in late June. Vicksburg Convention and Visitors Bureau Executive Director Laura Beth Strickland told the newspaper that the American Harmony cruise liner was now set to arrive in Vicksburg on July 13. The American Queen Steamboat Company also delayed its return to the river because of the virus. Its cruise is now expected to return to Vicksburg on July 17. Before the pandemic, the Vicksburg Convention and Visitors Bureau had projected a record year for riverboat traffic.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: With St. Louis County scheduled to completely reopen Monday, a gym business and the county have agreed to drop a lawsuit filed after two gyms a opened despite a county stay-at-home order. The county will permit gyms, theaters, fitness centers and pools to reopen Monday. Attorneys for the county and the House of Pain agreed to drop the case, according to a court filing on Wednesday, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. House of Pain gyms in Maryland Heights and Chesterfield reopened in defiance of the county restrictions, sparking county and federal lawsuits. House of Pain attorney W. Christopher McDonough argued the county regulations conflicted with state and federal laws.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: New applications for unemployment benefits in Montana have declined, but the number of new applications submitted last week was more than twice as high as it was during in the same week last year, officials said Thursday. The number of new applications for job assistance submitted in Montana last week fell to 2,892, according to the U.S. Employment and Training Administration. That’s a decrease of 5% from the number of applications submitted the previous week, but an increase of 256.2% compared to the same week last year. As of May 30, 44,929 people in Montana were receiving unemployment benefits. That represents 9.9% of all eligible employees in the state. The state has processed 111,644 claims for unemployment since March 14, representing 24.5% of Montana’s workforce that is eligible for the unemployment insurance program.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state potentially faces nearly $3.7 billion in agricultural losses from the coronavirus pandemic if economic conditions do not improve, the Nebraska Farm Bureau said. Its estimate projects revenue losses for this year’s commodities, including corn, soybeans, wheat, beef cattle and pork production, as well as dairy and ethanol products, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. It does not account for any financial assistance farmers and ranchers receive from COVID-19 relief programs. Jay Rempe, the Nebraska Farm Bureau’s senior economist, said the analysis “clearly demonstrates the magnitude of the financial challenges currently facing farm and ranch families,” adding that impact could be felt across the broader rural economy. The analysis pegs potential estimated losses in the beef cattle sector at nearly $1 billion in 2020. Potential corn and soybean losses were estimated at $1.17 billion. Losses in the ethanol sector could reach $1.3 billion, assuming that ethanol plants are unable to operate at more than 75% of capacity for the remainder of the year. “Farmers and ranchers are really struggling,” Nebraska Farm Bureau President Steve Nelson said.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Less than a week after Nevada reopened doors to its casinos, Gov. Steve Sisolak announced students could return for summer school coursework. Sisolak signed a directive Tuesday to allow school districts, charter schools and private schools operating in Nevada to reopen immediately. “This directive will allow schools to return to a sense of normalcy while keeping the health and safety of students and staff at the forefront,” Sisolak said in a statement. The directive gives schools broad decision-making power over whether to hold in-person classes, remote learning or a combination as they conduct summer school courses. It arrives almost two months after Sisolak ordered Nevada schools closed March 15 to curb the spread of new coronavirus and less than two weeks after Nevada begun transitioning to Phase 2 of his “Roadmap to Recovery” plan. The directive also requires schools to develop reopening plans in accordance with a Department of Education-devised framework at least 20 days before the start of the 2020-2021 school year. The framework outlines key considerations for schools to consider, including hygiene, social distancing, face coverings and communicating with students and parents. Nevada Superintendent of Public Instruction Jhone Ebert said the directive offered school districts “flexibility” to determine reopening protocols based on local circumstances.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A boat that cruises around Lake Winnipesaukee will be back in business soon, with fewer outings and passengers. The M/S Mount Washington will start offering lunch cruises on June 20 and dinner cruises on June 27. One lunch cruise will be offered every day from Weirs Beach, including a first-time Father’s Day cruise on June 21. In the past, the holiday conflicted with Laconia Bike Week, which has been postponed. Dinner cruises will be offered on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. This will allow time to do additional cleaning between cruises. The number of passengers on board has been reduced by more than 50%. Buffet service will be replaced by table service on all cruises.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: This Jersey shore city often associated with Bruce Springsteen is defying Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order and will allow limited indoor dining at its restaurants. The City Council on Wednesday approved a resolution permitting its restaurants to host diners inside at 25% of the building’s capacity or 50 people, whichever is less, beginning June 15. The governor on Tuesday set similar restrictions for indoor gatherings when he announced only outdoor dining for bars and restaurants could resume on June 15. The Democrat has yet to say when they can reopen for indoor seating. According to the Asbury Park Press, Deputy Mayor Amy Quinn said the city took the action because restrictions implemented to control the coronavirus pandemic were taking a toll on the city’s restaurants. A popular eatery announced last week it would close permanently. Allowing diners inside still carries risks. “While the city of Asbury Park is not going to levy any fines against you, the state of New Jersey could,” Quinn said. Murphy’s office has not commented.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The Las Cruces Economic Recovery Board convened for the first time this week to address local economic needs as businesses reopen. The board selected leadership and discussed what health steps board members had seen taken in their respective industries. They discussed building a campaign to instill public confidence it will be safe to patronize businesses under a “new normal.” The city formed the ad hoc board on local economic recovery last month after some city council members were concerned the city and Doña Ana County weren’t well-represented on the state’s Economic Recovery Council. The state’s Economic Recovery Council worked with state health officials to formulate industry-specific COVID-safe practices business owners and employees should follow to mitigate spread of the virus as New Mexico’s economy continues to reopen. The board, which will meet weekly, said it will work in alignment with the state’s Economic Recovery Council and develop Las Cruces-specific recommendations and practices.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Some businesses have jumped ahead on what’s supposed to be a slow and methodical emergence from the coronavirus lockdown. Stores in parts of New York City have started to allow customers inside to shop, even though the phased reopening that began Monday only allows retailers to sell merchandise via curbside pickup for now. At least a dozen customers perused racks of women’s clothing inside Mini-Max in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood on Wednesday. Shoppers mostly self-policed for social distancing, which wasn’t difficult given the store’s size, but the only restriction applied by owner Albert Abeal was that customers must wear masks. “We just opened. Everybody’s hungry for merchandise,” said Abeal, who has owned the store for about 20 years. He said business this week had essentially returned to normal, although he didn’t expect that to last. “They didn’t buy clothes for so long. It’s going to slow down in a week.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The administration of Gov. Roy Cooper has ordered the closure of a small stock-car track that has allowed large crowds to gather repeatedly for weekend races, declaring it an “imminent hazard” for the spread of COVID-19. The order signed by Cooper’s health secretary said Ace Speedway in Alamance County, 65 miles northwest of Raleigh, is violating the governor’s executive order limiting outside mass assemblies to 25 people. Media outlets have reported crowds at the speedway exceeding 2,000 people, including a gathering on June 6 even after the Democratic governor’s office wrote a letter stating the speedway’s actions were in “open defiance” of the health restrictions. Media reports indicated many attendees at three weekend races since late May sat and stood near each other, and few wore masks. The action came after Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson said Monday he wouldn’t issue a misdemeanor citation to the speedway. He questioned the legality of Cooper’s restrictions and said local tracks elsewhere weren’t being punished for opening. Cooper had said he would act if Alamance County officials wouldn’t. “North Carolinians are making huge sacrifices to protect their families and neighbors. This virus is highly contagious and very dangerous,” Health and Human Services Secretary Mandy Cohen said in a news release. “Bad actors who flagrantly violate public health orders put all of our families and loved ones at risk.” The next regularly scheduled race at the quarter-mile track is June 19.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Mass testing for the new coronavirus returned to Fargo on Thursday, about a month after targeted screenings were started to help lower the number of cases in North Dakota’s most populous metropolitan area. The surveillance testing, meant to identify people who might have COVID-19 but aren’t showing symptoms, is being held at the Fargodome for the next two days. State officials said they are well-stocked with testing kits and are looking to expand mass testing to Grand Forks, Bismarck and Minot. Meanwhile, members of a task force tackling the state’s hot spot are focusing on contact tracing of positive tests from concentrating on vulnerable populations, Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said. Cass County is likely to top 2,000 COVID-19 cases in the next day. The mass testing, Mahoney said, should help the metropolitan area go further in reducing restrictions on businesses.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is reopening, but fans will need to practice social distancing by staying at least “two Stratocasters apart” and bring their credit cards, officials said Thursday. Rock’s shrine will reopen on June 15 after closing on March 14 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Visitors must practice social distancing of 6 feet, or at least the distance of two Stratocaster guitars. Temperatures will be checked at the door and fans must wear masks. There will be continuous cleaning inside and hand sanitizers. There also will be advance online ticketing, limited capacity with timed ticketing and no cash will be accepted. Officials said nearly 600,000 people visit the museum annually. Live music is scheduled to resume on the plaza in July. The Hall will offer free admission to health care workers and their families on June 14.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Revenue collections in Oklahoma continue to fall below projections as the state starts to reopen businesses that were stalled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The state Office of Management and Enterprise Services reported revenue collections in May of $490.1 million – $65.5 million, or 11.8%, below estimates and $83.8 million, or 14.6%, below May 2019 collections. “May’s revenue collections shortfall was expected, as continual losses suffered by the oil and gas industry negatively impact the state,” OMES Director Steve Harpe said in a statement Tuesday. Businesses began reopening in late April under a plan by Gov. Kevin Stitt. Gross production taxes, which include taxes on natural gas and oil, were $28.2 million for the month, $55.7 million, or 66.4%, below the estimate. Sales tax collections of $164.1 million were $29.1 million, or 15%, below estimates. Total revenue collections during the first 11 months of fiscal year that ends June 30 were $552.3 million, or 8.8%, below the estimate, according to OMES.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State public health officials said a coronavirus outbreak at a North Bend prison has been resolved. The minimum-security prison at one point had 25 infected inmates and three infected employees, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. It is one of four state prisons with confirmed cases of the virus. A spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority said in an email that an outbreak is considered over 28 days after the date of the last onset of symptoms for people with the virus. At the Oregon State Penitentiary, the state’s maximum-security prison in Salem, cases have slowed, said Christopher DiGiulio, the chief of medicine for the Oregon Department of Corrections. The prison has reported one new case of coronavirus in the past several days, he said. Previously, the state was reporting as many as 20 new cases a day there, he said. As of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed cases among Oregon inmates stood at 167. Another 47 employees also have tested positive. The outbreak at the Oregon State Penitentiary remains the largest in the state with a total of 168 cases among inmates and workers combined. Among inmates, 93 are considered recovered, DiGiulio said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city’s health commissioner said there is concern that protests following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota will lead to a spike in virus infections in the city, but so far, “there’s no evidence of transmission yet.” Dr. Thomas Farley said at an online news conference Thursday that many of the protesters in Philadelphia were wearing masks and that “in many cases they were keeping a distance from other people.” On Saturday, thousands jammed the city’s grand Benjamin Franklin Parkway to demonstrate against police treatment of black people and racial injustice. “It’s still early. We’re going to have to watch this for at least another week, but so far, so good,” Farley said. Officials have urged demonstrators to get tested.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: A park is being turned into a temporary drive-in theater by a local nonprofit known for bringing powerful documentaries to the public. NewportFILM hasn’t been able to hold its full range of programs recently because of the coronavirus pandemic, but on June 25, it will screen the film “Public Trust” at Glen Park, The Newport Daily News reported. The 96-minute film follows journalist Hal Herring as he explores protecting the nation’s public lands, said Becca Bertrand, executive director of the nonprofit. The Portsmouth Town Council earlier this week gave approval for the project. The event will be limited to 100 cars, which will be spaced 6 feet apart in rows separated by 20 feet. Preregistration will be required.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell, the top South Carolina health official overseeing efforts to fight the coronavirus outbreak, said she’s worried a lack of social distancing and adherence to other preventative measures are hampering efforts to fight the pandemic as infection numbers continue to rise. “Today I am more concerned about COVID-19 in South Carolina than I have ever been before,” Bell said during a news conference. “We are all eager to return to our normal lives … but it will take us that much longer to get there if we don’t stop the virus today.” In the past two weeks, Bell said that South Carolina had posted its highest new daily case counts since the beginning of the pandemic. On Wednesday, Bell noted more than 500 new positive tests had been posted, for a total of more than 15,700 in the state. Thus far, she said, 575 people in the state have died. Among her concerns, Bell noted a widespread lack of mask-wearing and social distancing, as some South Carolinians relax their attitudes toward restrictions surrounding the outbreak. She also cited a lack of self-isolation in new hot spot areas like Greenville, where some infected people have spread the virus to other members of their households. Nearly a third of cases in that area, Bell said, were among Greenville’s Latino population, a circumstance that had prompted state health officials to step up Spanish-language materials about the virus and prevention efforts.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Despite canceled events in surrounding states, the Sioux Empire Fair and the South Dakota State Fair are planned to run as scheduled, officials said. As for the Sturgis Rally, the state’s most popular event, officials and business owners appear at odds about whether it will happen. The Iowa and Minnesota state fairs announced that they would be canceled for the first time in decades. The Minnesota State Fair was canceled May 22. The Iowa State Fair was canceled Wednesday. For the South Dakota fairs, they just might look a little different, said Courtney Drenth, director of marketing and public relations for the Sioux Empire Fair. “We want to give people something to look forward to with the fair,” Drenth said. “As a state, a lot of people are looking forward to end of summer events, like the Sturgis Rally and fairs. This is giving people something to celebrate.” The Sioux Empire Fair at the W.H. Lyons Fairgrounds is the second-largest event in the state with about 300,000 people attending over the nine-day event. The Sturgis Rally is far and away the largest, with 490,000 in attendance in 2019, according to the Sturgis Rally website. The Sioux Empire Fair is planned from July 31 to Aug. 8. As of now, all concerts – including headlining country band Old Dominion – are planned as scheduled, with seating and standing area planned as normal. The fair will also have several vendors and a carnival. The fair usually holds about 50 food vendors and up to 40 carnival rides. Although officials haven’t completed what changes there will be this year, the South Dakota State Fair will likely “be scaled to ensure Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines are being implemented,” according to an announcement from the state Department of Agriculture. The fair is planned for Sept. 3 through Sept. 7\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:The Stax Museum of American Soul Music said it plans to reopen to the public after closing for three months because of the coronavirus pandemic. The museum said it will start welcoming visitors on June 18. It closed March 18 as officials in Memphis issued coronavirus-related safety orders that shuttered tourist destinations like Stax and Graceland. Located in Memphis’ Soulsville neighborhood, Stax produced records by some of the top soul artists of the 1960s and 1970s, including Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Sam & Dave, Carla and Rufus Thomas, The Staple Singers, Booker T. and the MG’s, and others. The museum features self-guided tours of exhibits about the recording studio’s history and memorabilia connected to Stax artists, such as Hayes’ flashy Cadillac car. The reopening includes a new exhibit featuring Stax album cover photographs. Stax said admission and merchandise transactions will now be cashless.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:The tide of coronavirus-induced layoffs in Texas appears to be slowly receding, with weekly claims for first-time unemployment benefits in the state down for the seventh week in a row and slipping below 100,000 for the first time since mid-March. But the number of newly out-of-work Texans who have been filing for benefits remains huge by prepandemic standards. The roughly 90,000 who did so last week is about seven times more than the weekly average in February, before the virus shuttered large swaths of the state and national economies, according to U.S. Labor Department data. In addition, some economists said the new claims over the past few weeks likely signal that the financial hit from the virus has been spreading because fresh job losses probably aren’t the result of layoffs at restaurants, retail stores and other consumer-facing businesses that felt the impact immediately and took action during the early days of the pandemic. “Who are the almost 90,000 people who lost their jobs last week as we continue to open up the Texas economy?” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics in Austin. Although the data doesn’t make that clear, Schenker said those jobs “may take a while to get back” because they appear to be tied more to the broad economic downturn triggered by the virus than to the stay-at-home orders and mandatory business closures that now are being lifted. But Schenker and others called the decline in first-time claims for unemployment benefits a positive development, at least in terms of indicating that the deluge of layoffs has been tapering and fewer people overall are losing their jobs.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah’s rate of positive COVID-19 tests has skyrocketed in recent weeks, leading at least one prominent doctor to suggest the state might need to take a step back after a month of reopenings. That happened this week in the northern Utah city of Logan, where city officials closed the library and the recreation center again for the foreseeable future. Dr. Samuel Brown, a critical care researcher at Intermountain Healthcare, said he’s concerned that Utah might have to shut down again if people don’t seriously practice mask-wearing and social distancing in the rush to reopen businesses and get the economy jump-started. “I understand why people are eager to be on the move again – I really do,” Brown said “It’s also true that if we’re not really careful, people will die.” Utah is among a large number of states in the U.S. with rising cases, according to an Associated Press analysis. State epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn last week urged Utah residents to continue social distancing and wearing masks about a month after much of the state has been allowed to reopen.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is on the verge of allowing mail-in voting for this fall’s presidential election, a step seen as preparatory in case a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic makes in-person balloting too dangerous. The House is scheduled to give final approval to the proposal Friday after it passed the Senate. It would then be sent to Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who has said he supports preparations to vote by mail but wanted to wait to see if it would be necessary. Voters would receive ballots in the mail and could mail them back, take them to their local clerk or take them to their polling place on Election Day.\n\nVirginia\n\nBristol: The Birthplace of Country Music Museum reopened Thursday and offered free passes to health care workers. The offer is a thank you for health care workers’ “bravery and compassion in the wake of COVID-19,” according to a news release from the museum. The passes are for a health care worker and a guest. The offer will run through the end of August. The museum near the Virginia-Tennessee line said it plans to resume normal hours of operation. The museum intends to cap the number of people in the building at any time at 100. That includes visitors, staff and volunteers. All three groups will be required to wear face masks while inside the facility. Visitors who don’t bring their own will be provided one at the front desk.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Chris Reykdal, the state’s superintendent of public instruction, said he expects school districts to reopen buildings and return to in-person learning this fall as long as public health guidelines amid the coronavirus pandemic allow it. Reykdal and a work group of more than 120 educators, parents, students and community organizations released a 47-page document with new guidance that shows what face-to-face instruction could look like. How and whether schools reopen depends, at least in part, on what phase their county is in as part of Gov. Jay Inslee’s reopening plan, The Seattle Times reported. But education officials said schools should plan to resume class in-person. The guidance leaves most decisions up to school districts. Districts that can’t open right away, or bring all students back because of public health concerns, are encouraged to use a combination of distance learning and staggered scheduling. The education department is asking districts to make contingency plans that would allow them to move quickly from in-person instruction to remote learning should cases of the virus surge. Districts should add days to their school calendar in case of emergency short-term building closures, officials said as an example. Districts should also make plans to conduct learning remotely if schools are forced to close again for an extended period, officials wrote.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClifftop: This summer’s Appalachian String Band Music Festival has been canceled in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History said. The annual five-day camping event included music contests, dancing, arts and crafts and games. It had been set for July 29 to Aug. 2 at Camp Washington-Carver in Clifftop in Fayette County. The decision to cancel was made to lessen the effect of the new coronavirus, the agency said in a news release. The festival usually draws thousands of string band musicians and fans for concerts, dancing, workshops and contests. It will be rescheduled for next year, the department said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:With the new coronavirus continuing to spread, Milwaukee County will now require all employees and members of the public who use county facilities to wear a face covering. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley issued a \"universal face mask policy\" on Tuesday. The policy requires that employees, contractors, vendors, volunteers, service users and members of the public wear face masks when entering county facilities and grounds that have a \"controlled entry point.\" Masks are recommended but not required at the airport, on buses and in outdoor park spaces including the beer gardens, according to a statement from his office. Face coverings help to mitigate the transmission of virus, which spreads through respiratory droplets. Acceptable face masks can be made of cloth or paper and can be a scarf or bandanna, he said. The county will provide masks for many of the people required to wear one, Crowley said. Children between the ages of 3 and 12 should only wear masks if parents or guardians are monitoring them to make sure they’re worn safely, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon announced plans to allow schools to reopen and people to gather in larger numbers indoors despite a surge in coronavirus cases in one county. Meanwhile, University of Wyoming trustees approved plans to resume in-person classes this fall if the school gets $25 million in state funding to offset the cost of guarding against the virus. “Wyoming has made outstanding progress to date,” Gordon said in a statement. “Folks need to remember that it is important to remain vigilant, but because we have been so successful, I am confident we can continue lifting the very few remaining public health restrictions.” Under new public health orders to take effect Monday, up to 250 people will be allowed to gather indoors if they practice social distancing – keeping at least 6 feet apart – and sanitation measures. Up to 50 people will be permitted to gather indoors without such measures. Class-size restrictions will be lifted for childcare facilities. Personal care services will no longer have to be appointment-only.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/12"}]}

It will offer lunch and dinner daily.\n\nChef Antimo DiMeo's menu is still in development, but casual Italian is the current inspiration and direction.\n\nDE.CO Food Hall, with its eight food stalls, opened in April 2019. Pizzeria Bardea was one of the original operators. In February 2022, the Bardea team opened their Taqueria el Chingon. It took over the site of the former Phubs, a Vietnamese stall Phubs.\n\nTaqueria el Chingon was a departure from the Italian-themed foods available at Bardea Food & Drink and Pizzeria Bardea. It highlights riffs on Mexican foods. The theme came from foods that staff members have cooked and eaten as a part of the \"family meal\" which employees enjoy before regular service begins at Bardea Food & Drink on Market Street.\n\nThe new Italian trattoria coming this fall will be designed by Philadelphia-based Stokes Architecture + Design, whose recent work in Wilmington includes two other Buccini Pollin Group-affiliated businesses, Bardea Steak and The Quoin Hotel. (The Quoin is not run by Bardea.)\n\nPino DiMeo, father of chef Antimo DiMeo, oversees day-to-day operations for the two DE.CO Food Hall stalls. He said the Bardea partners decided to open a new restaurant because they noticed DE.CO customers wanted \"a more complete dining experience.\"\n\nThe DuPont Building's other full-service restaurant is Le Cavalier at the Green Room, a French brasserie inside the Hotel du Pont.\n\nThe Hotel du Pont Grille, a more casual, cafeteria-style dining experience in the hotel's lower level, below the Green Room, closed in 2018. For a brief time, a space at the hotel called the Café, previously the Lobby Lounge, had a daily service of breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is no longer operating.\n\nBardea became a major player in Delaware's hospitality scene when the James Beard Foundation Award in 2019 named it one of the country's best new restaurants. President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden have dined at the restaurant. In 2022, Chef DiMeo was a James Beard Award semifinalist for best chef in the Mid-Atlantic region award.\n\nChris Buccini, a founder of Buccini Pollin Group, said the new Bardea restaurant will offer a more elevated experience for DE.CO Food Hall customers.\n\n“When we opened DE.CO five years ago, we knew it was ambitious as the first food hall in Delaware. As we continue to invest in DE.CO and allow its offerings to evolve, we are excited to continue to do so with our friends at Bardea,\" he said.\n\nThe Buccini Pollin Group paid $32 million in April 2017 for downtown Wilmington's DuPont Building, which included the Hotel du Pont, the attached 13-story office building, and the Playhouse theater.\n\nDE.CO has had a variety of vendors since 2019.

We size up Wilmington's ...", "text": "Four years after owning the downtown Wilmington food hall world, DE.CO in the DuPont Building has competition three blocks away from the new $5 million Chancery Market tucked away in the former Hercules Plaza building.\n\nThe 12,000-square-foot Chancery Market (North Market and West 13th streets) first opened its doors three months ago, hoping for downtown to bounce back after being battered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA quick walk through Chancery and it's easy to see where the local inspiration came from, whether they would admit it or not. It's nearly a carbon copy of the $3.5 million DE.CO (Orange and West 10th streets) \"foodie haven\" that first opened in the spring of 2019.\n\nBoth have eight restaurant stalls featuring grab-and-go food vendors, full bars, weekly trivia events and hands-on games to play in between drinks and bites.\n\nChancery even tapped Wilmington-based Challenge Program Furniture and Chester, Pennsylvania-based American Wood Design, who did DE.CO's tables and unique wood grids behind the bar that work their way to the wooden ceiling ribs. (Chancery used the companies for their tables, wood veneer ceiling ribs, quartz countertops and more.)\n\nAs the city's downtown activity has slowly ramped up since zipping shut in March 2020, food court customers have returned. Each spot has its busy times and down hours. A bustling lunch crowd could be there mid-day and a few hours later for the dinner hour, you may see a tumbleweed roll past your table.\n\nAfter a few recent visits to both the 13,000-square-foot DE.CO and Chancery Market, we decided to break down the two spots, comparing and contrasting what each has to offer:\n\nVibe\n\nDE.CO: The 4-year-old food court is in the heart of downtown and with its large windows, it's easy to be drawn in from the sidewalk, especially when the weather warms and they crank the windows open. During a recent lunch, nearly every table was full with the music turned up, giving the space a shot of midday excitement as \"Jump Around\" by House of Pain was pumped in. However, once the workers who have come back to their downtown offices leave after 5 p.m., the nights were underwhelming compared with the bustling lunch crowds, sometimes with only a handful of people there.\n\nFLASHBACK TO 2019Wilmington food hall brings sushi, pho, chicken and waffles to city\n\nChancery: Tucked away in the 12-story building at 1313 N. Market St., Chancery is only a 5-minute walk from DE.CO, but it feels like another world. While the area around DE.CO is always almost busy with activity, the block around Hercules Plaza can feel like a set from \"The Last of Us\": sometimes not a soul in sight. During our lunch there, about a dozen tables had people eating. And unless you were directly under a speaker, the room seemed nearly silent until the faint sounds of \"I'm Good (Blue)\" by David Guetta and Bebe Rexha pierced the library atmosphere of the room. But at night, especially for Wednesday's popular Quizzo trivia, larger crowds breathed life into the spacious room, which features plenty of neat furniture. Chancery also has something up its sleeve for this spring: a 10,000-square-foot outdoor dining space will open in May in a garden plaza with seating for 150 people, an indoor/outdoor bar, fireplace and large-screen TV. The landscaping has been designed by the Delaware Center for Horticulture.\n\nFood\n\nWe paired food stalls with their closest match from the competing food hall for a quick look at what they're serving up.\n\nPizzeria Bardea (DE.CO) & Toscana Pizza e Panini (Chancery)\n\nPizzeria Bardea, a spinoff of the popular Bardea Food & Drink from co-owners Scott Stein and Antimo DiMeo, is the most popular vendor at DE.CO with crowds of people usually surrounding the corner counter. While they sell personal pizzas and salads, it's their hearty Detroit-style square slices ($6-$6.75) that really make you salivate. Varieties include old standbys like cheese and pepperoni, but the real fun comes with the hot honey, meat lovers, macaroni and cheese and eggplant slices.\n\nOver at Toscana Pizza e Panini from Dan Butler, chef/owner of Wilmington's Piccolina Toscana, they skip slices altogether and only sell personal Neapolitan pizzas from their custom hearth oven. (Note: It's many of the same varieties you can get at Trolley Square's Toscana To Go, albeit with a bit of a price hike on each pie at Chancery if you compare.) The bestsellers at the food hall include margherita with fresh mozzarella and basil ($14) and cheese ($12). They also feature seven different paninis, including short rib ($15) and a few salads.\n\nConnie's (DE.CO) & Fuku (Chancery)\n\nBaltimore-based Connie's, named after the mother of brothers Khari and Shawn Parker, is an original DE.CO vendor. They keep people coming back for their hand-battered fried chicken, which comes with waffles ($13) or in baskets with french fries. They also have fried shrimp to top your waffle ($16).\n\nAt Fuku, from celebrity chef, author and TV star David Chang known for founding the Momofuku restaurant group, you get something a bit different. Their fried chicken sandwiches all have some spice with crispy chicken thighs brined in habanero and served on a Martin’s potato roll ($9-$11). Philadelphia Eagles fans may remember Fuku's fried chicken sandwiches, which were once part of the concessions program at Lincoln Financial Field. If you really want to go for it, try their loaded fries ($9.50): crispy golden waffle fries doused with a spicy cheese sauce, bacon, ranch and scallions.\n\nAl Chu's Sushi (DE.CO) & Katiroll Wala (Chancery)\n\nChu, the longtime sushi chef at nearby Mikimotos in Wilmington who has struck out on his own with Al Chu's Shushi, has some hardcore followers for his sushi rolls. Especially popular: his $14 \"Al’s Signature Roll\" with fried shrimp, avocado, spicy mayo, crab stick and eel sauce. Poke bowls, sashimi and sushi are also on the menu.\n\nKati Roll Wala, a franchise with other locations in Texas and Maryland, focuses on kati rolls, selling a dozen varieties of the Indian street-food dish of meat in paratha bread. Their bestseller? The marinated chicken tikka kati roll, which is $7.99 for a single and $15.50 for a double. Other goodies include samosa bites ($3.49) and masala fries ($5.99).\n\nEat Clean (DE.CO) & Juice Joint 2.0 (Chancery)\n\nEat Clean, which opened its DE.CO location in September, is from restauranteur Kamil Bass-Walker, whose original shop is at 225 N. Market St. in Wilmington. The vegetarian/vegan full-service juice bar serves bottles of cold-pressed juices, smoothies, smoothie bowls, wraps and salads. The green juices, Drink Greens and Drink Veggies ($7.50), are the ones that usually sell out first. And in terms of a lunch item, try their avocado toast ($6) or vegan chili ($6.50).\n\nJuice Joint 2.0 is another hometown spinoff. It's from Lanice Wilson, who opened the original Juice Joint four months after the pandemic struck in 2020 at the city's Riverfront on Justison Street. Sure, they have smoothie bowls, cold-pressed juices and even elderberry and chokeberry-infused waffles, but their creative BPB+J smoothie ($9.36) may be their biggest hit: banana, peanut butter, PB powdered peanut butter, Himalayan sea salt and strawberry jam.\n\nSpark*d (DE.CO) & Espresso (Chancery)\n\nSpark*d opened as a spinoff pastry shop from the Hotel du Pont, now Le Cavalier, with executive pastry chef Leah Steinberger Ferrara at the head. Like Pizzeria Bardea, it's a chance to get the grub without all the extravagance of their sit-down dining rooms. They have plenty to drink ― La Colombe coffees, iced coffees, espressos and chai lattes ― to help you get through your morning. But be sure to grab a sweet (cookies, dessert bars, danishes) for the full experience, especially the caramel-apple danish ($5).\n\nEspresso has a similar selection of coffee drinks, offering just about anything you could want. In terms of food, they have something really hard to find around the city: crêpes. They have an eye-popping 15 varieties. How to choose? Try these first: the sweet \"Temptation Nutella\" crêpe ($8.90) with banana, strawberries, Nutella and whipped cream or the savory \"Peasant Chicken\" crêpe ($10.90) loaded with grilled chicken, mushrooms and cheese.\n\nTaqueria el Chingon (DE.CO) & Oath 84 (Chancery)\n\nTaqueria el Chingon is also from the owners of Bardea with spins on Mexican foods created by their restaurant staff. Like Bardea's pizza, their tacos are worth waiting for, especially the griddled birria taco ($6.50) made of Creekstone Farms beef, Oaxaca cheese and consommé in a hand-pressed tortilla. They also make burritos, nachos, sope, tortas, quesadillas and bowls.\n\nWhile there are no taquerias in Chancery, Oath '84 has their own fair share of unique flavors and adventurous bites. The stall is occupied by the same restaurateurs who operate in the Renaissance building at 405 N. King St. across from the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center with everything from fried calamari and lamb meatballs to eggplant parmesan and grilled shrimp. Standouts are jerk chicken egg rolls ($13), crab hushpuppies ($14) and chicken wings herbed with herbs de Provence, haldi and chimichurri ($13).\n\nStu & Sammy's (DE.CO) & Market Street Burger & Dog (Chancery)\n\nStu & Sammy's is another busy spot with a kitchen filled with staff making grilled cheese, cheesesteaks, cold sandwiches and hoagies. But their hamburgers ($12-$16) are enough to make a trip to the food hall alone. (See below for more on their burgers from our taste test.) And be sure to try their smoked pastrami Reuben ($15) if you're into that sort of thing: house-smoked pastrami, cabbage slaw, thousand island dressing and Swiss cheese on marble rye bread.\n\nMarket Street Burger & Dog has a slimmed-down menu of hamburgers and hot dogs, along with curly fries, onion rings, tater puffs and a salad. More on their burger below in our taste test, but if you're looking for the best bang for your buck at either hall, they may have it with their $6 \"Texan\" (two chili dogs with cheddar cheese and a pile of pickled jalapenos) or \"Jersey Guy\" (twin hot dogs with peppers, onions and fried potatoes).\n\nDelectablez (DE.CO) & Rooted AF (Chancery)\n\nA plant-based, organic shop from owner and Wilmington native Tamara Earl, Delectablez serves breakfast all day along with lunch service. Among the sandwiches most-ordered: \"The Boss Burger\" ($13) with a plant-based patty, kale, onion, tomato, onion rings, cheddar \"cheese\" and a special sauce or \"The Essential\" hot pocket ($14) with \"beef,\" red peppers, onions, rice, cheddar kale and sauce.\n\nRooted AF, a quick-service vegan counter, is Chancery's go-to for non-meat-eaters with their empanadas ($6.50) selling the fastest: golden brown pastry shells Spanish traditional style \"beef\" and \"cheese\" or curry \"chicken.\" And if you're in the mood for a sandwich, the Pinky Cole ($16.50) is the most popular: a jerk cheesesteak, sautéed onions, peppers and kale in a cheese sauce on a warm roll made with either \"chicken\" or \"steak tips.” They also have an array of healthy drinks and smoothies along with a built-in herbal market.\n\nBurger Battle\n\nWe tried a hamburger from each site because we told our editors that it was, um, integral to our research. (We think they bought it!)\n\nAt DE.CO, we straight-up inhaled The Sandy ($10) from Stu & Sammy's: perfectly cooked (not very thick) twin patties with a tinge of pink inside, American cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato, raw onion and a ketchup-and-mustard sauce on a Hawaiian bun. Bonus: It came with a small bag of kettle-cooked potato chips. It was so delicious and fresh that it brought In-N-Out Burger's famous Double Double to mind. 4 stars.\n\nAfter letting it settle, we headed to Chancery Market a few hours later for Market Street Burger & Dog's MBD Burger ($13): a smashed thin griddled beef patty with aged cheddar cheese, bacon, special sauce and topped with an onion ring, leaf of Romaine lettuce and tomato on a roll. The bacon and onion ring added plenty of grease to this one, but overall it was a bit underwhelming, especially for the price. It also did not come with any chips or french fries. We'll try our luck with the \"The Texan\" next time instead. 2.5 stars\n\nBar\n\nDE.CO: Their nine-drink cocktail list ($12-$16) is in the process of being updated and will feature an all-new line-up by early next month. Their 10-tap draft system at the 25-foot bar rotates regularly with eight different brews also available in bottles along with canned seltzers, all ranging from $5-$9. During a recent visit, they had a pair of Middletown-based First State Brewing Co. varieties, Allagash White and Peroni among the drafts and bottles included Heineken, Corona and Stella Artois. A dozen wines can be purchased by the glass ($9-$12) or bottle ($40-$48). Fun fact: The bar's top is made with white marble repurposed from hallways in the upper floors of the building.\n\nFLASHBACK TO DECEMBER OPENINGChancery Market, new 'upscale' food hall in downtown Wilmington, opens Thursday\n\nChancery: Also with a nine-cocktail list ($12 each, but \"market prices\" for their martini and Manhattan), they sling everything from Orange Crushes and Lavender Lemon Drops to margaritas and New York sours at their 30-foot bar. Draft beers included Lewes' Big Oyster Brewery stout, Philadelphia's Evil Genius #Adulting Guava with Miller Lite and and others ($7-$9). They also have 17 different bottles and cans of beers, seltzers and vodka soda drinks ($5-$8), 15 different wine selections by the glass ($12-$18) with 10 available by the bottle ($75-$150).\n\nFun & Games\n\nDE.CO: The seven-round \"Geeks Who Drink\" national pub quiz series has started up recently on Tuesdays at 6:30 p.m. and has joined an entertainment lineup anchored by live acoustic music by local and regional acts each Thursday at 6 p.m. On Saturdays, they also host the weekly DE.CO Local Artisan Market with local craft vendors matched with brunch specials and a Bloody Mary bar. And if you want to do something other than eat or drink when those events are running, there's also a foosball table and Jenga games to play.\n\nChancery: Like DE.CO, there's a trivia night at the newer food hall. It kicks off at 6 p.m. on Wednesdays with Lew Indellini as your host. (You may recognize him as a local musician who performs with Special Delivery or sometimes as part of a duo.) On Thursdays, music bingo takes over their small stage at 6 p.m. with DJ Taven as the MC. In the past, they have also hosted a \"Family Day\" with face painting and balloon animals, along with yoga and karaoke. A full-size shuffleboard table in the back of the room adds another opportunity for fun, along with a giant Connect Four game.\n\nParking\n\nDE.CO: With plenty of street parking surrounding the 13-story DuPont Building, it's usually not too hard to find a spot even at the busiest of times since downtown is still not as busy as it once was before the pandemic. We found a spot a block away twice, and it cost 95 cents for 30 minutes, plenty of time to grab lunch and get going. On nights and weekends, you can park at the garage at West 12th and North Orange streets for free with validation from DE.CO, but metered spots (free after 6 p.m. on weekdays and all day Sunday) are even easier to find unless there's a major show or event going on.\n\nChancery: On-street parking at the meters can sometimes be a bit tougher to find at Chancery with two hotels (Residence Inn and Staybridge Suites) directly across the street. There are also a handful of free pickup/dropoff spots on West 13th Street that can be used if you're just running in to grab an order already placed online. (This is a cool feature: They have heated and refrigerated lockers for customers who ordered ahead for even quicker pickup.) Your best bet is using the underground garage on North Market Street. If you're there just for lunch, you're going to pay what feels like a lot: $3 for 30 minutes or $6 for the first hour. But if you arrive after 5:30 p.m. on weekdays or during the weekend, it's always free. A quick elevator ride up one floor gets you into the cavernous (and eerily quiet) building lobby for a short walk to the food hall.\n\nOwners & Management\n\nDE.CO: Owned by Wilmington-based real estate behemoth Buccini/Pollin Group, who initially partnered for the food hall with Seawall Development, the company that developed Baltimore’s food hall, R. House.\n\nChancery Market: Owned by TSG Hospitality LLC, led by Scott Johnson of Wilmington-based Johnson Commercial Real Estate. He previously founded Wilmington's SolarDeck, a solar energy equipment supplier, in 2004. Chancery Market is operated by HQ Hospitality, a Brooklyn-based culinary consulting and food hall management firm led by chef, restaurateur, cookbook author and co-founder Akhtar Nawab.\n\nHave a story idea?

House. The site, under construction for more than a year, cost about $4 million.\n\nThe name DECO is an abbreviated version of “Delaware Collective.\" Guests will be able to visit chef-led kitchens and order directly from each one. Costs for food will range from about $8 to $12.\n\nThe space, featuring a modern-deco design, will have a variety of tables and an atrium bar serving cocktails, wine and beer. It will be open daily.\n\nPeter DiPrinzio, DECO project manager from Seawall Development Corp., said while there were early rumors about celebrity chefs running some of the stalls – Philadelphia restaurateur Jose Garces and Boston chef Todd English were names that were tossed around early in the project – \"that was never the plan.\"\n\n\"We set out to find chefs that wanted to expand or do their first brick-and-mortar,\" he said. \"We got tons and tons of responses.\"\n\nDiPrinzio said the chosen chefs, who have signed 2- and 5-year leases, represent both culinary and geographical diversity. He said developers selected a mix of operators from Baltimore, Philadelphia and Wilmington.\n\nSome chefs chosen had already been involved in previous pop-up, or short-term, operations at the R. House in Baltimore, DiPrinzio said.\n\nWho are the chefs?\n\n• Al Chu’s Sushi marks the return of the longtime Wilmington sushi chef who made his mark at Mikimotos on nearby Washington Street.\n\nIn recent years, Chef Chu has been working at The Wellwood in Charlestown, Maryland. Al Chu’s Sushi will feature a nine-seat sushi bar. Selections will include sushi rolls, sashimi and Chu's take on Hawaiian poke bowls.\n\n• Spark’d, a pastry shop from the Hotel du Pont will be led by Executive Pastry Chef Leah Steinberger. It will specialize in baked goods, coffee and special-occasion cakes and serve La Colombe coffees.\n\n• Connie’s Chicken & Waffles. This Baltimore favorite was founded by brothers Khari and Shawn Parker, who named the business after their mother. It started as a pop-up at R. House.\n\nThey will offer a signature chicken sandwich, shrimp and waffles and The Baltimore Chicken Box, fried chicken and seasoned fries. Waffle flavors range from classic buttermilk to red velvet to Oreo cookie to Crunchberry.\n\n• Pizzeria Bardea is a spin-off of the Bardea Food & Drink restaurant at the corner of Seventh and Market streets. The restaurant, owned by Scott Stein and Antimo DiMeo, was a semifinalist this year for a James Beard Award for the country's Best New Restaurant.\n\nThe pizzeria will offer a variety of salads and Neapolitan-inspired pies, including the salsiccia pizza made with fresh mozzarella, Berkshire sausage, English peas, red onion and gouda.\n\n• Phubs will specialize in Southeastern Asian delights such as made-to-order Vietnamese pho and banh-mi. Owners Paul and Chuong Nguyen also are planning to serve rice bowls, spring rolls and bubble tea. Phubs started as a popular pop-up site at the Baltimore food hall.\n\n• The Verandah, run by Amit and Radhika Sule, is an Indian street food outpost for samosas, kabab wraps, chaats, parathas and tikka masala Amit Sule started a food stand in a Baltimore farmers market 10 years ago with his wife, Radhika, who wanted to recreate the foods and flavors that she grew up eating in India.\n\n• Stripp’d, from Philadelphia, will offer smoothies, cold-pressed juices, acai bowls, salads, sandwiches and oatmeal.\n\n• The Pop-Up, or Test Kitchen, will serve as a home to a rotating roster of chef-tenants. The chefs will change biweekly to monthly throughout the year. The first tenant will be Wilmington chef/restaurateur Dan Sheridan who runs Locale BBQ Post on Lincoln Street and Stitch House Brewery on Market Street. Sheridan plans to focus on barbecue sandwiches and sides.\n\n\"It's something we launched in Baltimore, it's certainly a lot of work\", said DiPrinzio, who added, \"it's also a really great way to get chefs that don't have $1 million to open their own restaurant.\"\n\nHe said developers have already lined up more chefs to run the pop-up at DECO. \"The first couple months of the pop-up are already full,\" DiPrinzio said.\n\nDECO Bar\n\nWhen you first enter DECO, the first thing you see is the bar facing Orange Street.\n\nAt 25 feet, the impressive structure certainly catches the eye.\n\nThe second floor of the 96-year-old DuPont Building surrounding the bar was removed, creating a soaring atrium.\n\nThe wow factor came with a hefty price tag.\n\nDiPrinzio of Seawall Development Corp. estimates the cost alone of removing the second floor was about $500,000.\n\nThe bar's top is made with white marble re-purposed from hallways in the upper floors of the building, DiPrinzio said.\n\nAbove the bar is an expansive decorative wooden structure made by Chester, Pennsylvania-based American Wood Design that stretches from the bar to the second-floor ceiling.\n\nIf you're a regular at Wilmington Riverfront’s Constitution Yards Beer Garden, expect to see many of the same bartenders at DECO Bar, since DECO is managed by the same company: Connecticut-based Imian Partners.\n\nThere will be 10 beers on tap with an assortment of liquor and wine also available, DiPrinzio said.\n\n\"Since we're called DECO for Delaware Collective, it's collaborative, so we want the bar to collaborate with the [restaurants] to create drinks built to be paired with their food,\" he said.\n\nLive music, too\n\nSince DECO will be open day and night, expect to see live music, especially in the evening.\n\nIn its first week, musical acts booked by Wilmington's Gable Music Ventures will fill the hall with the sounds of local Delaware acts.\n\nDon't expect to see rock bands rattling the ground floor, especially during the dinner hour. Instead, there will be acoustic and smaller, stripped-down acts such as trios with the volume perhaps increasing in the late-night hours.\n\nAccording to DiPrinzio, it has not been determined who will book music at DECO permanently.\n\n\"We will have an entire calendar of events,\" he said, hinting that more interactive entertainment options such as trivia or video game nights.\n\nThose sounds should waft out several large mechanical windows that were being installed along 10th Street earlier this week.\n\n(Think mini versions of the garage doors that open onto Delaware Avenue at Trolley Tap House in Wilmington's Trolley Square.)\n\nThere will be outdoor seating along 10th street just below the windows and the right lane of 10th Street, which has been closed to traffic for the past year due to construction. It will remain closed, expanding the sidewalk in the space and allowing for more diners, DiPrinzio adds.\n\nThere will be free validated parking after 5 p.m. at the Colonial parking garage at 12th and Orange streets.\n\nWhen will it open?\n\nThe food hall, bar and event space will open at 5 p.m. Thursday, April 18, with celebratory events and \"surprises\" until midnight April 19.\n\nThe grand opening party will feature live music, giveaways, entertainment for kids and families, a photo booth and food and drink available for purchase from all eight DECO vendors.\n\nRegular hours\n\nDECO will be open for breakfast, lunch, dinner and bar service, weekdays starting at 7 a.m. and closing at 11 p.m., with extended hours on weekends.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

The hall will be open daily and will serve weekend brunches. The atrium bar will be open evenings.\n\nThe $3.5 million project is a collaboration between Wilmington's The Buccini/Pollin Group and Seawall Development, a company that developed Baltimore’s food hall, R. House.\n\nThe 10 stalls there offer everything from arepas to shwarma to fried chicken sandwiches.\n\nDevelopers hope that DE.CO, an abbreviated version of “Delaware Collective\" that is pronounced \"deck-oh,\" will become a place where chefs can launch new restaurant ideas.\n\nThe names of the eight participating chefs have not been released.\n\nBuccini/Pollin said the chef tenants and their menus will be announced closer to the project's opening date. The exact date of the opening is not yet known, but developers say it will be late 2018.\n\nRumors have been floating for months about some chefs and companies interested in being a part of the Wilmington food hall.\n\nThey have included Philadelphia celebrity chef/restaurateur Jose Garces, a James Beard Award winner who also is an \"Iron Chef\" on the Food Network; Todd English, a Boston chef, cookbook author and TV personality; and SoDel Concepts, the Sussex County-based restaurant group that runs such eateries as Blue Coast in Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach and Fish On Seafood Bar & Grill in Lewes.\n\nEnglish runs the Todd English Food Hall, a European-inspired specialty food hall at The Plaza in New York City. Garces is supposed to open a Latin American-themed food hall this year in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhen reached by phone Thursday, Scott Kammerer, president of SoDel Concepts, said, \"We are considering many options in New Castle County.\"\n\nChris Buccini, co-president of The Buccini/Pollin Group, confirmed Thursday that there has been contact with those potential chefs and restaurateurs: \"We've had conversations with all of those people.\"\n\nBuccini said no decisions have been made.\n\n\"We are actively looking. We have a lot of people who are very excited to be a part of this. We want Wilmington people there, too. The goal is to have an exciting mix.\"\n\nBuccini said he likes the idea of having young and aspiring entrepreneurs, such as a food truck chef or someone who wants to develop a new concept.\n\nSeawall’s Peter DiPrinzio said Wilmington's location in the \"heart of the dynamic mid-Atlantic [region] makes it a magnet for culinary talent that will draw locals and visitors alike downtown.\"\n\nMore:$175M transformation planned for DuPont Building\n\nMore:Cozy up to these hearth-warming restaurant fireplaces\n\nCustomers visiting the chef-driven food hall will be able to choose from a selection of cuisines from the Mid-Atlantic region and around the world. The chefs will have their own kitchens in the food hall. Diners can visit one stall or order from some of the operations.\n\nFood halls, long popular in Europe, are similar to food courts but feature food made by local, independent chefs instead of chain restaurants.\n\nThe sprawling markets have been a hot trend in urban dining due to the success of such concepts like Eataly in New York and other cities.\n\nOver the past few years, U.S. food halls have sprung up in major downtown markets such as Los Angeles, New York, Detroit and Pittsburgh. And more are coming.\n\nAccording to the commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield, there are now more than 100 food halls in the U.S. The figure is expected to grow to 200 by 2019.\n\nBut some ambitious markets have hit a snag. Food personality/CNN star Anthony Bourdain has canceled plans for his much-awaited food hall at New York City's Pier 57 due to a number of challenges, including not being able to secure a lease.\n\nDevelopers Buccini/Pollin see Wilmington as a ripe market for a food hall.\n\n“This is our way of trying to stimulate the food culture in downtown Wilmington,\" Chris Buccini said. \"Everyone loves a food hall.\"\n\nHe believes it will become the \"heartbeat of a young, vibrant city.”\n\nThe ground room of the 1908 DuPont building is undergoing a $150 million renovation with the DE.CO food hall as the anchor along with retail shops and artisan boutiques. It will be located in the area of the building that overlooks the Nemours building.\n\n\"It's going to completely energize that section,\" Buccini said. \"I think it's going to have a big impact on the city.\"\n\nThe new food hall will feature a modern deco aesthetic that echoes the design of the Hotel du Pont, opened in 1912, but with contemporary features.\n\nHowever, Buccini said it has \"absolutely nothing to do with the Hotel.\" The Buccini/Pollin Group acquired the Hotel du Pont in January 2017. The company is currently not making any major changes to the Hotel du Pont and its legendary Green Room.\n\nBuccini said the company wanted to \"digest the history of the hotel\" and \"just understand its DNA\" before doing any alterations or adjustments.\n\nHe said the food hall is \"meant to be an amenity to the Hotel.\"\n\nThe DE.CO food hall will have tables throughout the space as well as seats at the atrium bar, which will serve cocktails, wine, and beer.\n\nA second-level private event space is planned that will overlook the main bar. The space can be used for meetings and gatherings.\n\nApplications are now being accepted from new restaurateurs or chefs who want to develop a new concept.

The partners are still waiting for furniture to be delivered and there have been some supply chain issues, he said.\n\nDECO Food Hall, with its eight food stalls, opened in April 2019. Just as it was nearing its one-year anniversary, it was forced to temporarily close March 2020 through September 2020 as part of a state mandate halting indoor dining at the state's eating establishments due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe food hall bounced back and has been operating even though many city workers haven't yet returned full-time to downtown office buildings. The hall has had two vacant slots in recent months including the spot that had formerly been occupied by a Vietnamese stall called Phubs.\n\nStalls still operating include the Bardea pizzeria, Connie's Chicken & Waffles, Al Chu's Sushi, Spark*d pastry and coffee, Stu & Sammy's delicatessen, and Green Box Kitchen smoothies and bowls.\n\nTaqueria el Chingon has taken over the Phubs site, Stein said and began serving customers on Wednesday.\n\nThe fusion taco and burrito menu (items are between $5 to $10) include varieties such as beef cheek with barbacoa, mole verde and mango mostarda; pork al pastor with pineapple, togarashi, lime and peppadew remoulade; chorizo with chipotle, corn salsa and queso fresco; and mushroom asada with pumpkin seed chimchurri, aji amarillo crema, and cotija cheese.\n\nStein said while executive chef DiMeo usually concentrates on Italian-style dishes, Taqueria el Chingon will be highlighting spins on Mexican foods.

SCHWARZ\n\nCorrespondent\n\nTravel is not only movement from place to place but from time to time, and this summer we explored the landscape history of the American West. Under the tutelage of my Californian wife, Marcia Jacobson, one of my current travel goals is getting to know more about the West with a focus on the National Parks.\n\nWe decided to take a tour that included Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Teton National Park, as well as several other sites. Our 1,300-mile trip began in Rapid City, South Dakota, and ended in Salt Lake City, although we continued on our own to Sun Valley, Idaho, where I gave a few talks while enjoying that venue.\n\nBecause I was reluctant to drive and miss the scenery — my wife usually leaves highway driving to me — we bought a tour from Caravan, with whom we have traveled on two prior occasions, once to Costa Rica and one on a previous park trip last summer to the Grand Canyon, Bryce and Zion (about which I wrote for this publication). In the past, we found Caravan tours were good, low-priced values. This ttrip was no exception, but there we more bumps than on our prior trips, in part because we didn't mesh well with the tour director.\n\nRapid City and Mount Rushmore\n\nWe spent more than eight hours flying three short flights to Rapid City, South Dakota: Ithaca-Detroit, Detroit-Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minneapolis/St. Paul -Rapid City.\n\nThe second largest city in South Dakota after Sioux Falls, Rapid City is a pleasant tourist town, deservedly celebrated for its street-corner statues of every president in a characteristic pose. We especially enjoyed being there on a Thursday night when the city celebrated its summer festival with bands, food stands and family amusements.\n\nOn our first full day, we visited Mount Rushmore with its huge, impressive depictions of Washington, Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt, and Lincoln (in that order. As we learned from the helpful 14-minute introductory film, much of the sculptural work derives from precision dynamiting of the mountain, although of course polishing is necessary in the final phases. Marcia and I did some walking to get various views and then found and enjoyed an unmarked nature trail.\n\nOur next stop that day was the Crazy Horse Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Following the method of using dynamite to shape rocks into images that was developed in the Mount Rushmore project, the Crazy Horse monument has been 50 years in the making. Privately funded, it claims to be largest sculpture of one face in world and may take 60 years more to complete, although the depiction of the face part of the sculpture is finished. Longer than the Rushmore film, the Crazy Horse film offers a great deal of information about not only the sculpture but also about both Korczak Ziolkowski, who originally conceived the project, and his family which is still carrying on the project. On also on the Crazy Horse site are the Indian Museum of North America, and the Native American Cultural Center.\n\nThe highlight of the second full day when we drove from Rapid City to Billings was our visit to the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, the site of Custer's Last Stand. As we walked around the well-marked site, we learned a good deal of history about both the motives of American Indians and Custer's troops. Our visit was preceded by a film shown on the tour bus about General Custer that was narrated by historian David McCullough. At the monument, we heard a flamboyant but effective talk abut the battle and its historical context by a ranger.\n\nYellowstone National Park\n\nOn our third full day, we drove from Billings to Yellowstone, the nation's first National Park; the park is larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined. Almost 3,500 square miles in size, most of Yellowstone Park is in Wyoming, with parts in Idaho and Montana. Driving along the Yellowstone River through the mountains, we saw gorgeous scenery. Before moving to higher areas, we passed ranches of 20,000 acres and more where Black Angus cattle are raised.\n\nAfter arriving at Gardiner, the North entrance to Yellowstone, we went to Mammouth, in part to visit the hot springs. This is one of the park's highlights, and the climb to the area's overlook is a great walk. Another wonderful highlight is the Old Faithful Geyser, which erupts every 80 minutes or so and is not only spectacular but also different each time. Staying two nights at the Old Faithful Inn within proximity of the Old Faithful Geyser enabled us to see Old Faithful several times and to walk on a path that took us to the smaller geysers and hot spots in the area of Old Faithful. A bear's taking refuge is a tree adjacent to Old Faithful brought out the park rangers and created excitement for those staying at the inn.\n\nWe visited many of the major sites within the park — the second day with a guide. Because Yellowstone is over 7500 feet high, it is necessary to be aware of dehydration and other health problems associated with heights.\n\nDriving around the park as we did on our tour bus, we saw one magnificent natural view after another and marveled at the sudden changes in topography. Interspersed with lakes, rivers, and geysers, much of Yellowstone Park is mountainous with a great deal of pine forest. Perhaps the most stunning Yellowstone sight is its majestic Grand Canyon, featuring an incredible viewing spot called Artist Point where you can see the waterfalls of two rivers simultaneously.\n\nThe Lower Geyser Basin has another must-see venue called Fountain Paint. Pot that has various kinds of hydrothermal features — hot springs, mudpots (acidic hot springs), geysers and fumaroles — caused by volcanism.\n\nAnimal watching was not the major activity of the trip until we reached Yellowstone National Park. There we not only saw bears, buffalo, elk and pronghorns as well as many other animals and birds, but also wolves — which were reintroduced into the park in 1995 — chasing baby bears.\n\nThe Grand Tetons, Snake River, and Salt Lake City\n\nWith sharply pointed peaks and hardly any foothills, the magnificent Grand Tetons, a sub-range of the Rocky Mountains, rise abruptly at their highest points to be topped off by small glaciers. Within Grand Teton National Park we enjoyed a memorable 10-mile, 2-hour boat ride on the Snake River; we were on a 10-passenger rubber raft with oars manned by a professional and had splendid sightings of eagles and a river otter.\n\nOn our sixth and final full day during a long drive from Jackson to Salt Lake City we stopped at Montpelier, Utah, to enjoy a little theatrical presentation about the Oregon Trail at the National Oregon Trail Center. Leaving behind the Tetons, we drove by the almost as impressive Wasatch Mountains in Utah. The trip ended with a brief tour of Salt Lake City and the major Mormon sites before a final night in Salt Lake.\n\nDaniel R.

To keep the price down, the company has eliminated almost all previously included meals besides breakfast, and its choice of hotels is basically budget ones with rather grim included breakfasts, except for the final night in Salt Lake City. That Caravan gets rooms for two nights within Yellowstone is a major plus because at high season rooms need be reserved many months in advance.\n\nCaravan provides family-friendly bargain tours that people of relatively modest means can afford. This is a destination that people of all age will enjoy. If you wish, you could come yourself and camp, as many people do. Or you can drive on your own. I simply didn't want to drive and miss the scenery, although the scenery on the first days prior to Yellowstone is not spectacular. Yet the large vistas on the plains are impressive, and I learned what the Great Plains really are.\n\nTour Director\n\nThe trip stretched my patience because of the amount of bus time, and that was exacerbated by a tour director who treated us as if were in the second grade. Her incessant chatter was for my wife and me a major detriment. We would, and so would many of our fellow travellers, have enjoyed this trip more with a different tour director, one who understood the need for quiet time and for digesting and enjoying what we were seeing.\n\nCaravan might offer a version of its trips that take more than six travel days — we did nothing on the first and last days but arrive and leave — and allow more free time and less travel per day. Because of the need to cover 1,300 miles and because of the length of bathroom breaks (which often were shopping breaks) — 30 to 40 minutes — the trip too often felt like a bus drive. Our zealous guide had us on the bus every day before the time listed on the tour itinerary and sometimes included unnecessary stops at marginal sites such as tiny museum at 5:30 p.m. in Billings.\n\nTipping\n\nIn its pricing, Caravan needs to include tipping of the bus driver and tour director; if this means raising the price, so be it. Caravan's tipping recommendations are outrageous ($5 to $10 per person for the tour director, $4 to $7 per person for the bus driver).\n\nIn any other country, tour members would laugh out loud when reading the aforementioned numbers; if followed, these tips would have the guests paying most of the salary of the tour director and bus driver, alleviating the company of that responsibility. On this tour, tipping became a fixation for our tour director, who reminded us many times of our monetary obligation to her.\n\nWhen my wife and I have our own guide and driver, tipping standards are, of course, different. But experienced travelers resent the way gratuities have become stipulations, particularly when you are with 44 people and have no personal relationship with the tour director. I know several people who give less than they would have or nothing in the face of such unreasonable and exorbitant requests. Caravan is far from alone in sustaining this tipping foolishness, but it is past time to stop it.\n\nHotels\n\nRapid City, S.D.: Adoba Eco is a remodeled former Radisson; it is noisy and the rooms had neither enough lighting for reading nor decent internet service. It provided a basic breakfast without amenities for Caravan customers who were consigned to their own section of the breakfast room.\n\nBillings, Mont.: Hilton Garden Inn, 2465 Grant Rd, located in a mall on the outskirts of Billings. With a decent breakfast and working internet, it is s nicely appointed hotel at the lower end of the Hilton chain; the only drawback is its location where restaurant choices were mostly fast food. Probably downtown would have been better for the one Billings night.\n\nYellowstone Park: The Old Faithful Inn. It is nice to stay in an historic inn the within the park and close to the Old Faithful geyser, although there are fancier hotels in the park. Be advised that the Inn there has no internet, no TV, no air conditioning and very basic rooms.\n\nJackson, Wyo.: The Virginian is a lackluster old motel with an especially meager breakfast.\n\nSalt Lake City, Utah: Living up to International hotel standards. the Hilton is a fine property. It served the only decent breakfast on the trip and presented a polished final dinner.\n\nRestaurants\n\nRapid City: Talley's serves interesting, eclectic cuisine. Because of the large portions, we split one entree and one desert. Two nights in a row the bathrooms needed servicing and that is a major negative.\n\nBillings: Tau is an unexciting Asian mall restaurant trying to do the nearly impossible, that is, serving in one venue all of the following: Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Indonesian cuisines. Our Thai green curry shrimp dish was gelatinous and not comparable to a really good Thai restaurant, and the vegetables in the sauce could have been more varied.\n\nYellowstone: For dinner at the Old Faithful Inn's Main Dining Room, we found decent food at reasonable prices. But beware of erratic and even rude service, in particular at breakfast, which was a disappointing experience.\n\nThe Snow Lodge (another hotel within the park): In its dining room we had an adequate and nicely served meal at a moderate price.\n\nJackson: Unless you are a vegetarian, do not miss The Gun Barrel Steak and Game House, specializing in beef and game and quite good.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/10/08/farmer-astronaut-jose-hernandezs-inspiring-story/91757092/", "title": "From farmer to astronaut: Jose Hernandez's inspiring story", "text": "SUSANA VÁZQUEZ\n\nJose Hernandez didn’t receive one, or two, or three, but 11 rejection letters from NASA before becoming an astronaut.\n\nOn his 12th attempt, he was finally accepted into the space training program.\n\n“[It felt] like winning the lottery because it is something very difficult to accomplish. There are more than 18,000 people that have the minimum qualifications and from that …12 to 15 are selected,” Hernandez said. “That is why it took me 12 years to accomplish it.”\n\nOf the approximately 7.4 billion people who live on Earth, fewer than 550 have gone to space.

The family spent the other three months in Mexico, and that meant that Hernandez and his siblings were constantly switching schools.\n\nFor Hernandez, though, this lifestyle was normal.\n\n“I was very young and for me it was an adventure [to go] from place to place, but thinking about it [in retrospect], it was a very difficult lifestyle,” he said.\n\n“Honestly, life was hard because we would go to school Monday through Friday, but on Saturdays and Sundays we were working in the fields with our parents, and while our friends loved summer vacations, we hated them because that meant seven days of the week [working] in the fields.”\n\nBut finally in second grade, a teacher convinced his parents to “stay in one place and shorten our trip to Mexico from three months to three weeks, and that is when we started calling Stockton our home.”\n\nEven though inconsistency at school affected his English proficiency, Hernandez found stability in other subjects.\n\n“I became interested in engineering from a young age,” he said. “Aside from learning English, we would learn other subjects and math was one of them, and that was my shelter because two plus three is five in any language. Naturally, that is the reason why I focused on math and science … by the time I was in middle school, I already knew I wanted to become an engineer.”\n\nBut that was only the beginning of a dream.\n\nInspiring success through music\n\nIn December 1972, at 10 years of age, Hernandez witnessed the last man to walk on the moon.\n\nHe remembers watching Apollo 17 live on his black-and-white TV, holding the antenna to not lose reception. When he heard the commander Eugene Cernan talk with mission control and walk on the moon’s surface, that’s when he knew he wanted to become an astronaut.\n\n“That is when my dream to become an astronaut was born because I would hear him, watch him, then go outside and look at the full moon. I would go back inside and listen Gene Cernan and for that reason I told myself that would be me, I want to become an astronaut,” Hernandez said.\n\nEven though his dream to become an astronaut sounded difficult, even unachievable, his parents never discouraged him or motivated him to pursue other goals.\n\n“My parents [didn’t] have economic resources. We come from a humble farm worker family, but they gave me something more valuable … they gave me the belief that I could accomplish my goal of being an astronaut,” said Hernandez.\n\n“They … would sit in the kitchen table with me to make sure that I would do my homework. They were there giving us their time.”\n\nAnd with his family’s support, Hernandez got to work.\n\nHe graduated from University of the Pacific in 1984 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and earned a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UC Santa Barbara.\n\nHis educational career met some of the requirements to become an astronaut because it was in the science fields, and after five years of experience in the engineering realm, Hernandez submitted his first application to NASA.\n\nAnd that is where his odyssey began.\n\nHe started receiving one rejection letter after the other.\n\n“In that process, I learned that I needed to better prepare myself. I started to look at the skills that the selected astronauts had and that I didn’t. I realized that despite having the same education, they had things I didn’t have.”\n\nAnd with that spirited determination, Hernandez decided to analyze the merits that made the selected astronauts more qualified and emulate them in order to have a better opportunity at being selected.\n\nOne year he saw that all astronauts were pilots, and because he wasn’t a pilot, he decided to learn how to fly. Another year, he found that all were divers, so he learned how to dive.\n\nHis strategy and work finally paid off when in 2004, Hernandez was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate.\n\nAfter a few years of training, on August 28, 2009, Hernandez’s dream to go to space became a reality when he flew Space Shuttle Discovery to complete Mission STS-128.\n\nHis journey to go to space might have been a lengthy and difficult one, but Hernandez said he enjoyed every step of the process.\n\n“I didn’t get frustrated [receiving rejection letter] … because I was enjoying what I was doing and the road to becoming an astronaut,” said Hernandez.\n\n“If I made it, great. If not, it was not going to be the end of the world because I loved what I was doing.”\n\nThinking about it, Hernandez acknowledges that all the hard work as a farm worker helped him overcome the challenges he faced on the road.\n\n“It gave me the work ethic, the determination and to not be afraid to work hard. That helped me a lot during the challenges I faced as an astronaut.”\n\nHernandez left NASA in 2011. He is now committed to promoting the importance of education and reminding children and parents that there are no obstacles to accomplishing their dreams.\n\n“Everything is possible in life when you are willing to work hard, plan, and not give up,” he said.\n\n“It’s worth dreaming big when you are willing to put in the work that is needed to accomplish the goal you have. Obviously,the more difficult the goal, the more you will have to work…but everything is possible, and you should dare to dream big.”\n\nMotivating others\n\nOn Tuesday, Hernandez will be in Watsonville to share his story.\n\nHis visit is part of the efforts by the Pajaro Valley Unified School District (PVUSD) to educate and inform parents about the next generation science standards and the STEM programs, said Ruby Vasquez, Parent Education Trainer at PVUSD.\n\nAnd it was Vasquez who initiated the move to bring the astronaut to Watsonville.\n\nEverything started last year when Vasquez came across a video on Facebook. She said that Hernandez’s story had such an impact on her that she cried.\n\n“It did make me emotional because it was his father and his mother who motivated him,” said Vasquez.\n\n“I think we as parents sometimes forget that we have that ability, that power in our kids’ lives. They look up to up to us, and sometimes we don’t think they look up to us because we work in the fields or because we work in the empaque (packing company) or … hatever our job is, but our kids do look up to us.”\n\n“I came in [to work] and I shared it with my colleagues here, and I shared it with our director and said we really, really need to bring him because not only will he motivate our students to pursue their education and careers in that area of STEM, but his story just mirrors perfectly many of our families and our families experiences,” added Vasquez.\n\nVasquez and the department of education services in the district started to work in collaboration with other agencies in the area to fund the visit.\n\nWe just really want the students, the Spanish speaking students in particular, to realize that they can pursue these careers in the sciences and math and technology and engineering because ... sometimes the content of those areas seems a little scary to our students, a little out of their reach,” she said.\n\n“I think he will show like a perfect example of how things may not be easy, but if you persevere and you follow that goal and you set a plan, you can accomplish what you set out to do.”\n\nShe added that it is important to inform and educate parents about issues affecting the community such as gang activity and drugs, but it is also important to highlight the positives to have a balance.\n\n“I think presenting stories like Mr. Hernandez’s almost balances things out a little bit because it’s not about preventing anybody from getting into a gang or taking drugs or becoming pregnant at an early age, it’s more about looking at the positives, that these accomplishes are possible.”\n\nIt is not new for Hernandez to offer these community talks. He has become an example for the Latino community and an advocate for education.\n\nHe believes these presentations are important to motivate young people.\n\n“Watsonville is a similar to the city where I grew up in Stockton,” Hernandez said.\n\n“I think it’s very important to come to these cities because there are a lot of young people that are in a similar situation that I had and I think it’s important for them to have role models. I want them to look at me and say, ‘Hey, he’s not that different from me’ and leave them with the idea that if he could, why can’t I?”\n\nPresentation by Astronaut Jose Hernandez\n\nWhen: Tuesday, October 11.\n\nWhere: The Henry Mello Center, 250 E. Beach St., Watsonville.\n\nTime: 6 p.m. – 8 p.m.\n\nThe presentation will be in conducted in Spanish with translation to English and Mixteco.

Ross and her husband spent the afternoon checking on neighbors and attempting to keep nearby culverts clear of debris. The Cathedral City Fire Department also came to the park this afternoon to help evacuate several people out of their homes who couldn’t get past the rushing water in the road.\n\n“It’s a senior citizen mobile home park, many of our people are in their 80s. They just don’t deserve to be in such a vulnerable situation, that’s for sure,” said Ross.\n\n—Erin Rode\n\nThousands of IID customers without power\n\nOver 7,000 Imperial Irrigation District customers are currently without power, with storm-related power outages reported across the district’s eastern Coachella Valley and Imperial County service area.

Larson Foundation Trauma Center. In one photo, an abandoned golf cart sits submerged in water.\n\nBut Lee Rice, the medical center’s public information officer, said that none of it has affected any patient care areas of the hospital.\n\n“Fortunately, it hasn’t had any impact on our patient care areas,” Rice said. “So, it’s business as usual for us.”\n\nOnline videos showed the inside of Eisenhower with a small amount of water in the back hallways, with towels on the floor to absorb the moisture.\n\nRice said that some of the flooding has merely forced Eisenhower to divert ambulances to another section of the hospital that has not experienced the effects of the ongoing rainfall that has come with Tropical Storm Hilary.\n\nEisenhower is in its slower time of year, which is typical during the summer months, Rice said. She added that it has helped Eisenhower avoid any serious challenges during the storm.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Eisenhower closed urgent care facilities in Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and La Quinta but left Emergency Department services open and available to the community as needed.\n\n—Andrew John\n\nCenter of storm nears Coachella Valley\n\nAt 5 p.m., the National Hurricane Center reported the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was located 25 miles south-southwest of Palm Springs and moving north at 23 mph.\n\nAs Hilary moved closer to the Coachella Valley, strong winds have picked up. Palm Desert reported a peak wind gust of 46 mph at 4:20 p.m.\n\nPalm Springs International Airport had a top wind gust of 40 mph at 3:40 p.m.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nDesert Sands, Palm Springs Unified schools closed Monday\n\nAll schools will be closed Monday in two of the Coachella Valley's three districts, Desert Sands Unified and Palm Springs Unified.\n\nIn Coachella Valley Unified School District, the first day of the school year will be Thursday.\n\nXavier College Preparatory High School also said it will be closed Monday, although staff will try to come to campus to assess any damage caused by the storm. The school said it is anticipating some minor damage caused by flooding and leaks.\n\nCollege of the Desert will also be closed on Monday, although classes for the new semester are not set to begin until next week. College of the Desert \"currently has a lot of water and debris on site,\" and the Palm Desert campus has also \"experienced some water intrusion in key areas.\"\n\nSchool officials are asking everyone to remain off campus, and \"no business will be conducted at any location, with the exception of COD’s Maintenance Team and Campus Safety Team, who will help assess the damage and determine any challenges to student or work spaces.\" Regular business is expected to resume on Tuesday.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio and Erin Rode\n\nStorm shelter at Desert Mirage High School\n\nDesert Mirage High School in Thermal is being used as a temporary storm shelter, according to the Coachella Valley Unified School District.\n\nThe shelter is open to the public and includes a dedicated reception area and a cooling zone.

Closures were being announced frequently; below is only a partial list:\n\nPalm Springs: Police announced the closure of two more roads in Palm Springs. Farrell Drive was closed between Ramon Road and Mesquite Road.\n\nEl Cielo Road was also closed at Mesquite Avenue, while the Dinah Shore Bridge is closed from Palm Springs to Cathedral City. Golf Club Drive is also closed at the Whitewater Wash.\n\nIndian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino were already closed at the washes.\n\nCathedral City: Cathedral Canyon Drive and Dinah Shore Drive were also closed by Cathedral City Police. Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive was already closed.\n\nEast valley: 66th Street was closed between Van Buren Street and Jackson Street. Box Canyon Road from Interstate 10 to the All American Canal was closed in the Mecca area.\n\nEven in areas where roads weren't fully closed, conditions were treacherous. Just after 4 p.m., two of the three eastbound lanes of Highway 111 were closed due to rocks in the road at the Cathedral City-Rancho Mirage border.\n\nPalm Springs Police Lt. Gustavo Araiza advised residents to avoid travel in the city unless absolutely necessary and to drive with extreme caution if they must.\n\n“We don’t need collisions tying up resources,” he said.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio, Jay Calderon\n\nNewsom, Palm Springs officials discuss storm preparedness, bridge request in Sunday visit\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom stopped in Palm Springs on Sunday as Tropical Storm Hilary wrecked havoc on the Coachella Valley. He met with Palm Springs city councilmembers and staff in the city’s emergency operations center.\n\nNewsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California on Saturday to support the Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nThe city posted photos of the visit on its Facebook page Sunday, explaining that city staff updated the governor on the city’s storm preparations while Newsom offered “whatever assistance he could provide to the city.” The post noted that Newsom had been “instrumental in bringing Oakland Urban Search and Rescue and Swift Water California OES Task Force teams to Palm Springs,\" where they were going to be used to assist with rescues during the storm.\n\nThey also discussed the city's request for an elevated bridge on North Indian Canyon Drive over the Whitewater Wash. The Coachella Valley Association of Governments has been trying to secure funding for such a bridge, which would reduce the need for rain and wind-related closures.\n\nPhotos show Newsom adding his name to the Emergency Operations Center sign-in sheet during his visit. Palm Springs Mayor Grace Garner, City Councilmember Lisa Middleton, City Manager Scott Stiles, Police Chief Andrew Mills and Fire Chief Paul Alvarado are pictured meeting with Newsom during the visit.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nUpdated rain totals: Palm Desert sees 1.18 inches by 2 p.m.\n\nHeavy rain has moved through the Coachella Valley and brought soaking rains that have flooded many streets and intersections. Here are the latest rain totals from the National Weather Service as of 2 p.m., with rain still falling.\n\nPalm Desert 1.18 inches\n\nCathedral Canyon 1 inch\n\nThermal airport 0.91 inches\n\nPalm Springs Airport 0.89 inches\n\nLower Tahquitz Creek 0.86 inches\n\nFlash flood, severe thunderstorm warning issued for some Coachella Valley cities\n\nThe National Weather Service in San Diego has issued Flash Flood Warnings for most of the Coachella Valley until 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nSome locations that will experience flash flooding include Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, Indio, Coachella, Thermal, La Quinta, Mecca and the Santa Rosa Mountain.\n\nAt 1:51 p.m., doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated heavy rain falling across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 to 1 inch in 1 hour. Hourly rainfall rates in Palm Desert have exceeded 0.75 inches per hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\n\nAt 1:40 p.m., doppler radar indicated heavy rain across the warned area. Rainfall rates of three-quarters of an inch per hour are occurring.\n\nFlash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly. The weather service warns life threatening flash flooding is possible from heavy rain, particularly of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.\n\nMotorists should turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary: Heavier rain, winds forecast for Palm Springs area Sunday\n\nThe Coachella Valley remains under a tropical storm warning on Sunday morning, and a flood watch is in effect until 5 p.m. on Monday. Light rain is falling at Palm Springs International — as of 8 a.m., 0.32 inches had fallen since midnight — and the temperature is a cool 78 degrees with 88% humidity and 6-mph winds out of the southwest, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBut more rain, and heavier wind, is on the way. Thunderstorms are in the forecast throughout the day, with an additional two to four inches of rain expected in the valley, along with wind gusts of up to 40 to 50 mph. Temps are expected to top out at 86 degrees.\n\nNWS Meteorologist Adam Roser said the biggest threat in the Coachella Valley is \"definitely flash flooding.\"\n\n\"Many of the mountain roads going into the valley are very vulnerable,\" he said. \"As are any of those that go over those washes and things like that.'\n\nRoser said most of the rain will fall in heavy bands that could potentially produce 2 inches of rain an hour in the afternoon. There also remains a small chance of tornadoes in the valley, he said.\n\n\"WIth tropical storm systems, any tornadoes are usually weak and brief, but the storm prediction center does have around a 5% chance of a tornado occurring in the area,\" he said.\n\nThe rain and wind will likely be finished by the time most people are waking up on Monday morning, Roser said.\n\n— Kate Franco, Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nHow much rain has fallen so far?\n\nSo far, Tropical Storm Hilary has brought a light but steady rainfall to the Coachella Valley, but weather forecasts advise the rain should become heavier on Sunday afternoon and evening.\n\nAs of noon, official National Weather Service rain totals included 0.40 at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.46 in Thermal at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport, 0.46 in Thousand Palms and 0.36 in Palm Desert.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHilary makes landfall over Baja California\n\nThe now-downgraded Tropical Storm Hilary made landfall along Mexico's Baja California coast Sunday as concerns mounted over the storm causing what could be deadly flash flooding in the border city of Tijuana, Southern California and places as far north as Idaho that rarely get such heavy rain.\n\nHilary hit the coast in a sparsely populated area about 150 miles south of Ensenada.\n\nThe storm has already caused flooding in places across Mexico’s arid peninsula and threatens to unleash torrential rains on mudslide-prone Tijuana, where many improvised houses cling to steep hillsides just south of the U.S. border.\n\nForecasters warned the storm could cause extreme flooding, mudslides and even tornadoes. Parts of the U.S. Southwest could be hit with once-in-a-century rains and there is a good chance Hilary could break all-time records as the wettest known tropical cyclone to douse Nevada, Oregon and Idaho.\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Pacific time, Hilary was located about 215 miles south-southeast of San Diego, the National Hurricane Center reported. Hilary had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and was moving northwest at 25 mph.\n\nThe Mexican cities of Ensenada and Tijuana, directly in the storm’s path, closed all beaches and opened a half-dozen shelters at sports complexes and government offices.\n\n—The Associated Press\n\nEvacuation order near Banning\n\nRiverside County has issued an evacuation order north of Banning and near the Morongo Reservation as the worst of Tropical Storm Hilary's impacts approach.\n\nThe county's emergency management department announced the order late Sunday morning for the Mias zone in the Apple/ElDorado burn scar.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSplash House says it will carry on amid storm\n\nOrganizers of Splash House said the Palm Springs pool party and music festival will go on Sunday despite Tropical Storm Hilary's expected inundation of the Coachella Valley and the rest of Southern California.\n\nEarlier in the weekend, the festival had been moved inside at the three hotels where it's held, which are miles apart.\n\n\"We're gonna keep it real with you — we're not big fans of today's projected weather,\" organizers wrote in an Instagram post about 10 a.m. Sunday. \"But we are big fans of keeping this party going safely. Let's take things inside and close out this weekend in unprecedented style!\"\n\nEvents will be at the Renaissance, Margaritaville Resort and Saguaro Palm Springs hotels between about 1 p.m. and 9 p.m., according to an online schedule.\n\n\"Shuttles with run as planned between hotels,\" the Instagram post said, without addressing the possible heavy rain — predicted to be as much as two inches an hour at times Sunday afternoon.\n\nLocal and national officials, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have advised people to stay indoors and off the roads during the storm.\n\nLater, organizers seemingly acknowledged the storm could make it hard for festival attendees from out of town to drive or fly out as scheduled. They posted a list of hotels that were offering late checkout and discounted rates for extending stays.\n\n—Eric Hartley\n\nMost flights canceled out of Palm Springs on Sunday\n\nAhead of the anticipated impacts from now Tropical Storm Hilary, a majority of airlines have canceled flights in and out of Palm Springs International Airport on Sunday.\n\nAs of 9 a.m., only five of 15 flight arrivals through 6 p.m were still scheduled. United, American and WestJet all canceled flights into the airport. Southwest Airlines canceled its entire Sunday schedule at the airport a day earlier.\n\nDelta’s flight from Salt Lake City to Palm Springs that arrives at 12:18 p.m. Sunday was one of the few still scheduled.\n\nEight of 10 evening flight arrivals into Palm Springs were still scheduled, as were several evening departures, but airport officials cautioned anyone flying to check ahead with their airline before arriving at the airport.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary within striking distance of Baja early Sunday\n\nThe National Weather Center in Miami said in the most recent advisory at 2 a.m. that Hurricane Hilary was about 30 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 385 miles from San Diego, California. The maximum sustained wind speed remained unchanged at 85 mph while spreading “heavy rains” northward over the peninsula.\n\nMeteorologists warned that despite weakening, the storm remained treacherous. Forecasters said the storm was still expected to enter the history books as the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, bringing flash floods, mudslides, isolated tornadoes, high winds and power outages.\n\nElizabeth Adams, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service San Diego office, said rain could fall up to 3 inches an hour across the desert and mountains surrounding the Coachella Valley and beyond from late Sunday morning into the afternoon. The intense rainfall during those hours could cause widespread and life-threatening flash floods.\n\nOne person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalia, on the peninsula’s eastern coast, when a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream. Rescue workers managed to save four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege township.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether officials considered the fatality related to the hurricane, but video posted by local officials showed torrents of water coursing through the town’s streets.\n\nThe forecast prompted authorities to issue an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, urging residents and beachgoers to leave the tourist destination 23 miles off the coast.\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nHurricane Hilary: Storm drops 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Sunday\n\nAs of 7 a.m. Sunday, rainfall totals since midnight were 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.41 inches at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in Thermal and 0.29 inches in Thousand Palms, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nRain totals so far Sunday in Palm Springs area\n\nPreliminary precipitation data from the National Weather Service's San Diego station shows 24-hour rain totals as of 5 a.m. Sunday in the Coachella Valley vary from 0.86 inches in Thermal to 0.04 inches in Indio Hills. Palm Springs International Airport reported 0.18 inches of rain so far.\n\nThermal: 0.86 inches\n\nMorongo Valley: 0.39 inches\n\nDesert Hot Springs: 0.31 inches\n\nPalm Springs International Airport: 0.18 inches\n\nPalm Desert: 0.16 inches\n\nIndio Hills: 0.04 inches\n\n— Kate Franco\n\nRoad closures in Palm Springs, Cathedral City\n\nPalm Springs: Indian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino will be closed at the washes until further notice in preparation of potential flooding due to Hurricane Hilary, the Palm Springs Police Department announced late Saturday.\n\nCathedral City: Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive has been closed, city officials said Saturday.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declares State of Emergency\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California Saturday to support the Hurricane Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nHeavy rainfall and high winds were expected to last through Monday. At the governor's direction, there were currently more than 7,500 boots on the ground deployed to help local communities protect Californians from the impacts of Hilary.\n\nThe governor also signed an emergency proclamation in San Diego while visiting with California National Guard troops. He met with first responders and local officials, including San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. He was also in touch with federal officials, including the White House.\n\nThe Emergency Medical Services Authority has assets on standby, including California Medical Assistance Teams to augment local capacity, aid in evacuations and support medical needs in communities impacted by flooding. The EMSA was ready to assist with Ambulance Strike Teams as necessary to support local communities. The Flood Operations Center is activated and has prepositioned flood-fight materials should they be needed.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSandbag availability low, exhausted in some valley cities\n\nSand and sandbags are no longer available at local fire stations in Palm Desert as of Saturday afternoon. Instead, residents can find these resources at the Palm Desert Civic Center, 43-900 San Pablo Ave., Palm Desert.\n\nRancho Mirage ran out of sand at its distribution site at the Rancho Mirage Library & Observatory parking lot, so many people took their empty bags to a nearby empty lot to fill them with sand straight from the ground. Empty sandbags are still available for Rancho Mirage residents at Fire Station 69 at 71-751 Gerald Ford Drive. Proof of Rancho Mirage address is required.\n\nIndian Wells announced mid-afternoon on Saturday that sandbags are no longer available from that city, and residents are encouraged to seek supplies from local home improvement stores, instead.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nHurricane Hilary: How experts say you should prepare\n\nTwo Palm Springs emergency officials have some advice for valley residents on how they can prepare their homes and themselves for the storm. The officials are Capt. Nathan Gunkel of the city fire department and Daniel DeSelms, Palm Springs’ emergency management coordinator.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nThey said residents should make sure they have enough food and water to make it through a few days, including food that can be eaten if the power goes out.\n\nThey also recommended preparing for the power outages by charging their cellphones and making sure they have flashlights and batteries on hand. DeSelms said he generally recommends using flashlights rather than candles because of the fire risks that come with candles.\n\nIn general, they said residents should be prepared to remain at home for multiple days as it will likely be unsafe to go out during the storm and roads could potentially remained closed or impassable even after it passes.\n\nGunkel recommended that residents make sure they know how to get out of their neighborhoods in the event the city does need to evacuate, keeping in mind that roads like Indian Canyon Drive and Gene Autry Road will likely be impassable. However, he said people should remember it is impossible to anticipate which other roads may be closed.\n\nTo protect your home:\n\nBoth DeSelms and Gunkel recommend residents make use of the free sandbags Palm Springs and other cities and agencies are providing, particularly if their homes have ever experienced flooding in the past. It often makes sense to place sand bags in front of the front door or other places where water might pool, Gunkel said.\n\nDeSelms also said those with leaky roofs can put a tarp over them. However, he cautioned that it is important to try to make sure the tarp will be secured enough to withstand the strong expected winds.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/living-well/ragbrai/2023/01/28/what-to-know-about-ragbrais-50th-anniversary-ride-july-23-29/69840434007/", "title": "RAGBRAI 2023 route, towns, and what to know about the 50th year ...", "text": "The Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa will celebrate 50 years with what is expected to be record registration and quite a few nods to the history of the ride.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the week-long cycling extravaganza.\n\nWhat is RAGBRAI?\n\nIt may be hyperbole, but Iowans like to boast that RAGBRAI is the world's largest annual mobile party. Each summer, cyclists set out from a point on or near the Missouri River in western Iowa and ride seven day-long routes to their destination on the Mississippi River. The route changes from year to year, so almost all of Iowa has participated at one point or another.\n\nMore:He's been on every single RAGBRAI – and probably fixed your bike tires, too\n\nWhat does RAGBRAI stand for?\n\nRAGBRAI stands for the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa.\n\nHow did RAGBRAI begin?\n\nJohn Karras, a copy editor and features writer for the Des Moines Register, and Donald Kaul, the paper’s Washington columnist, hatched the plan for a cross-state bicycle ride and invited their readers along. When they set out from Sioux City on Aug. 26, 1973, for the first day's ride to Storm Lake, a few hundred people joined them. They rode again in 1974 with a growing entourage, and in January 1975, Kaul announced in a short item in the Register that the ride had gained an official name for its planned third edition: the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa.\n\nToday, RAGBRAI is its own organization within Gannett Co., the Register's owner. A dedicated year-round staff organizes the event, which typically draws tens of thousands of participants from across the nation and around the world, though this year, organizers are saying the number of riders could break all records.\n\nMore:Brush up on your RAGBRAI history as the ride across Iowa marks its 50th year\n\nWhat is the RAGBRAI 2023 route for RAGBRAI in 2023?\n\nThis year’s scenic tour of Iowa pays homage to the original bike ride in 1973. Here are the much-anticipated dates and starting, ending and overnight towns for this year’s route:\n\nSunday, July 23 ― Sioux City to Storm Lake.\n\nMonday, July 24 ― Storm Lake to Carroll.\n\nTuesday, July 25 ― Carroll to Ames.\n\nWednesday, July 26 ― Ames to Des Moines.\n\nThursday, July 27 ― Des Moines to Tama-Toledo.\n\nFriday, July 28 ― Tama-Toledo to Coralville.\n\nSaturday, July 29 ― Coralville to Davenport.\n\nMore:What to know about the RAGBRAI L starting, ending and overnight towns\n\nHow are the towns chosen?\n\nThe organizers choose towns from eager applicants across the state. Representatives of the chosen towns celebrated during a route announcement party Jan. 28.\n\nDuring the ride, each town vies to outdo the others with nightly parties, replete with bands, food vendors and, of course, beer.\n\nRiders can bed down for the night at campgrounds and parks. Many rent space in residents' home or yards, with indoor bathroom privileges. Some stay in motor homes driven by supportive friends or relatives. And, of course, any hotel rooms are sold out months in advance.\n\nWhat are meeting or meet-up towns?\n\nThey are selected towns about midway on each day's route where those separated from companions while riding can regroup; those who are too tired to continue can catch a ride on a RAGBRAI support-and-gear “SAG wagon”; and members of teams or others with support drivers can meet them. All can enjoy the offerings of vendors and local restaurants, as well as entertainment.\n\nWhat are pass-through towns?\n\nTowns, some with just a handful of inhabitants, that the ride passes through. The residents often gather to cheer on the riders, and the enterprising among them sell snacks and beverages — or just offer a drink from a garden hose. Pass-through and meeting towns will be announced at a later date.\n\nWhat is the longest day’s ride this year?\n\nWhile this year’s route does not include a mandatory 100-plus mile century ride, riders should still expect quite a few days of heavy bicycling. The longest ride this year will be 83 miles from Carroll to Ames, though there will be two additional days exceeding the 80-mile mark. There will be an optional century loop on Day 3 for those who want to log a 100-mile day.\n\nMore:RAGBRAI 50th anniversary edition hews closely to original route, including stop in Des Moines\n\nWhat is the shortest day's ride this year?\n\nThe shortest ride will be just 50 miles on July 26 from Ames to Des Moines.\n\nWhich day will have the most elevation gain?\n\nKeep your derailleur on low July 27, when riders will gain 3,652 feet of elevation over the course of the day. But don’t think you’re off the hook the rest of the week ― Sunday’s ride will require riders to climb 3,504 feet, and on Friday riders will gain 3,276 feet.\n\nWhat are some major highlights on the RAGBRAI route?\n\nFor the 50th anniversary ride, they’re too numerous to list. But expect more of everything, from church lady pie, grilled pork chops and craft beer to big-name bands, spontaneous dancing, goat yoga and just plain fun.\n\nMore:Northwest Iowa farmer invites RAGBRAI riders to stop by, and they keep coming, and coming, and coming\n\nWill RAGBRAI break a Guinness World Record?\n\nThis year’s organizers will not use the golden anniversary as an opportunity to break the Guinness World Record for the largest single-day “parade of bicycles.” The record ride would have run from Ames to Des Moines on July 26.\n\nThe last time RAGBRAI came to the capital city, in 2013, an estimated 32,000 people rode from Perry to Des Moines, and the last time it came to the Des Moines metro, in 2019, there were 40,000 riders on the road from Winterset to Indianola. RAGBRAI Director Matt Phippen estimates 100,000 people could ride this year’s Day 4 route from Ames to Des Moines, shattering the June 11, 2000, record set when 48,615 people rode an 18.2-mile circuit around the city of Udine, Italy.\n\nHow do I register for RAGBRAI 2023?\n\nRiders can register online on the RAGBRAI website, ragbrai.com. Choose \"RAGBRAI L registration\" under the header titled \"The Ride.”\n\nWhat does registration cover?\n\nGenerally, registration covers the costs of putting together the route and holding the event. Registered riders also can depend on ambulance and paramedic services in case of accidents, as well as SAG wagon rides, and they get discounts and free commemorative patches.\n\nWho can register?\n\nLast year, RAGBRAI ended its long-held registration lottery, which limited weeklong passes to about 12,000 riders. Registration is still capped but now is on a first-come, first-served basis. Phippen would not disclose the cap, but said RAGBRAI works with the Iowa State Patrol and Iowa Department of Transportation to ensure all roads on the route can handle the number of riders expected.\n\nMore:'Shift: The RAGBRAI Documentary' releases trailer; premiere coming in May\n\nHow much does it cost to ride RAGBRAI?\n\nPrices increase as the ride draws nearer, with a May 15 final deadline.

Though some of the best riders may engage in friendly competition, and Lance Armstrong has been known to make an appearance, RAGBRAI is all about riding at whatever pace makes sense to you through the cities, towns and countryside of Iowa, meeting people along the way and, above all, having the time of your life.\n\nStaff writers Philip Joens and Sarah LeBlanc contributed to this article.

Why back-to-school ...", "text": "It’s almost time for back to school – or is it? For some students, like those in Indiana, school has already started as of the first week in August. For others in states like New York, where class is back in session after Labor Day, students have several weeks of summer vacation left.\n\nDepending on where you live, August may sound way too early and September might sound surprisingly late. In reality, the time to return to class for most public school students varies pretty widely between states, a practice that can be traced back to the historical needs of different regional communities and an American emphasizes on states’ rights to govern themselves.\n\nIn general terms, schools in the South and Southwest tend to adhere to the earliest start times, whereas later starts are more common in the Northwest and along the East Coast, according to 2019 research by Pew Research Center.\n\nIn an analysis of more than 13,000 public school districts, Pew found that:\n\nBy mid-August, nearly all public school students in the region covering Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee were back.\n\nNot a single district, however, in the New England and Middle Atlantic states went back until late August.\n\nSome districts that operate on so-called modified year-round calendars begin in late July.\n\nSome students in New Jersey were not going back until the second week of September.\n\nWhile there have been shifts in how and when school is done since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, these findings illustrate just how wide the range can be.\n\nNike back to school deals:Nike has up to 60% off shoes and more during this slam dunk back-to-school sale\n\nHow did schools originally choose start dates?\n\nAccording to Julie Gorlewski, Senior Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Teacher Education at University at Buffalo, the disharmonious nature of school schedules ties back in part to the state-level government.\n\n“State political leaders determine features such as curricular requirements, teacher certification regulations, graduation requirements, and the number of school days in an academic year,” Gorlewski told USA TODAY. “Guidelines are further narrowed by local school districts and their governing boards, which can set calendars that fall within state regulations.”\n\nIt is a common belief that some regions starting school earlier as a relic of an agrarian calendar that once centered life around the cycle of crop growth and harvest. Theoretically, the dependence on the agricultural industry that persisted in the South after the North had begun to industrialize more heavily meant that southern children were needed on the farm during the most labor-intensive times of the season. This meant they left school earlier and went back earlier.\n\nWhile this theory may be rooted in some truth, it is more likely that children would be needed on the farm in the spring during planting and the fall during harvest, not in the hot summer months. Instead, school schedules were often tailored to the specific needs of the surrounding community.\n\n“Agrarian cycles are generally cited as the reason for summer breaks, which supposedly allowed for young people to assist with responsibilities on family farms,” said Gorlewski. “However, prior to efforts toward standardization in the late 19th century, school calendars reflected the needs of their communities. Reformers sought to create more uniformity across urban and rural regions; and this resulted in the longer summer break that persists today.”\n\nWeather was also an element in these decisions, as temperature control during sweltering summers, especially in big cities and urban areas, was difficult to achieve before the invention and wide-spread use of air-conditioning. As such, some urban families chose to flee to the less crowded countryside in the summer, meaning kids were not around to sit in the suffocating classrooms, according to a report by PBS.\n\n“Contemporary decisions around school calendars are also affected by national holidays, weather (for example, to avoid times when it is particularly costly to heat or cool a building), and collective bargaining agreements,” said Gorlewski.\n\nClergy in schools:Chaplains in public schools? Ohio Republicans propose letting clergy counsel students\n\nWhat are some other considerations?\n\nThe needs to keep cool or help on the farm were not and still are not the only considerations in choosing back to school dates, however.\n\nMichael Capuana, District Superintendent of Erie 1 BOCES in Buffalo, New York told USA TODAY that districts in Western New York tend to fall on the later side of things, with most starting around September 5 and 6 this year.\n\n“It’s honestly surprising to me that the school calendar remains generally untouched. This school calendar has been in place for decades in New York,” he said. “In many ways, it seems as though the rationale boils down to 'we've always done it this way,' despite the fact that our educators and schools are serving more students, families and communities well beyond the typical boundaries of the traditional school day and year.”\n\nCapuana said the New York State Department of Education plays a major role, with limitations on when schools can be in session. In New York, the school year can begin no earlier than September 1 and can extend no later than June 30. If public school districts want any state aid or funding, they have to adhere to these guidelines.\n\n“There are many different factors that need to be considered when determining a school start date,” he said. “For example, New York State regulations require that districts must have a minimum of 180 days of instruction per school year... Local collective bargaining agreements are also a factor here.”\n\nWhile these limitations leave little room to adjust for things like cancellations due to inclement weather, they do provide one thing: consistency. The lack of change over the years has allowed students and families to adjust to a schedule and know what to expect, said Capuana.\n\nWhen keeping in mind state regulations, national holidays, tentpole events like state testing and the availability of summer activities, there are various ways different summer schedules can impact the average student.\n\nThe Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Board of Education, for example, recently approved a state date of August 21 this year, a solid few weeks before starting times in New York.\n\n“Our 2023-24 school year calendar builds on the success of our current academic calendar by continuing to provide consistency and ensure fewer student learning interruptions,” said CPS CEO Pedro Martinez in a media statement. According to the district, an earlier start offers a number of benefits to students, including aligning more closely with local colleges and universities, allowing more students to participate in summer camps, job and recreational opportunities that start earlier in the summer and giving students more time to prepare for important exams, such as the SAT.\n\nUltimately, the decision was never as simple as “let the kids help on the farm,” nor is the determination made based on only one or two factors today.\n\n“In short, decisions around school calendars reflect the kind of tension between central and local governance that characterizes and sustains a democratic republic,” Gorlewski said. “Conversations around public schooling have always been contested, and will continue to require dialogue that takes into consideration the needs and desires of a range of stakeholders, including taxpayers, political leaders, community members, educators, and – most importantly – students.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/05/solar-eclipse-2024-maps-timing-duration-max-coverage/73193099007/", "title": "Solar eclipse path: Interactive maps of timing, duration of totality", "text": "Come Monday, millions of Americans from Texas to Maine will stop what they're doing to step outside and spend a few minutes gazing skyward.\n\nFew celestial events have the power to capture our collective attention the way this upcoming total solar eclipse has managed to do.

Redfin estimates the home is now worth $1,654, 478.\n\nMore:Fact check: Biden leveraged $1B in aid to Ukraine to oust corrupt prosecutor, not to help his son\n\nGreenville main residence\n\nAfter selling The Station, Biden, then married to Jill Biden, bought 4 acres of land in suburban Wilmington for $350,000. He built a home on the secluded lakefront property in Greenville, an affluent neighborhood.\n\nZillow estimates the Biden’s nearly 7,000-square-foot home may be worth nearly $2.9 million.\n\nMcLean rental\n\nAfter leaving office, Biden began renting a large Georgian-style home in McLean, Virginia, not far from D.C. The Washington Post reports former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who served under President Ronald Reagan, once owned the home in the upscale neighborhood.\n\nZillow estimates renting the five-bedroom, nine-bathroom, 11,943-square-foot home costs $19,795 per month.

The other two homes pictured in the viral meme were previously sold or rented by Biden.

The winter also makes Jack Frost a permanent resident. It won’t be long before the thermometer in your neck of the woods dances around 32°F and sharp, piercing gusts penetrate the umpteen layers you carefully put on before leaving the house. Between December and February, it’s not so much a cold snap as a long, extended freeze with a solid chance of precipitation. Why should you grin and bear it while the wind is chilling you to the bone and you’ve lost feeling in all extremities? Don’t you deserve a reprieve from arctic temperatures and icy roads? We think so!\n\nReady to fly the frozen coop? Pack your bags for these sun-drenched spots across the globe.\n\n1. Sri Lanka\n\nJetsetters looking for something off the beaten tourist path should consider Sri Lanka. An overlooked gem, this exotic island in the Indian Ocean seduces everyone who steps foot with its stunning unspoiled wilderness, colorful history, and flavorful cuisine. Due to the proximity and a lack of crowds, it’s possible to pack a lot into a trip to Sri Lanka. Kick things off by climbing the steep staircase to the top of Sigiriya. Other highlights include the Golden Temple of Dambulla and biking through the tea plantations.\n\n2. Galápagos Islands\n\nFor wildlife enthusiasts and adventure seekers, nothing even comes close to the Galápagos Islands. Winter is truly a special time, marked by warm temperatures, plentiful sunshine and calm waters. It’s also breeding season for many animals – thus increasing your chances of encountering giant tortoise eggs hatching and flamingos nesting. Fancy a snorkeling excursion? The tides around Gardner Bay brim with parrotfish, whitetip sharks, and stingrays. Following an action-packed day spent discovering the Galápagos Islands, recharge your batteries at Pikaia Lodge.\n\n3. Dubai, United Arab Emirates\n\nOver the past three decades, Dubai has exploded into an international hub of business and tourism. It’s no accident that glitterati from across the globe journey to this opulent, desert paradise. Known for its jaw-dropping modern landmarks – most famously the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building – and ultra-glamorous scene, the “City of Gold” certainly lives up to its extravagant nickname. Add to that, award-winning restaurants, glitzy mega-malls as well as luxurious resorts ( the Burj Al Arab Jumeirah) and high-end business-oriented hotels like The Oberoi Dubai.\n\n4. Hanoi, Vietnam\n\nAncient architecture, rich culture and proximity to Ha Long Bay (it’s a 60-minute seaplane ride from Vietnam’s capital) are just a few of the reasons Hanoi is a strong contender for where to go this winter. Upping the appeal? Hoàn Kiếm Lake and street food! Head to Lý Văn Phức to sample phở and com binh dan (“commoner’s rice”). Wallet-friendly prices certainly don't hurt either. That’s right: a trip Hanoi won't drain your bank account, but it will yield photos and memories to last a lifetime.\n\n5. Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nAn irresistible blend of European and Latin influences, Argentina's cosmopolitan capital is one of the most sizzling cities on the planet. When the thermometer spikes and the humidity rises in the winter, it gets even hotter. Expect generous cuts of steak, endless red wine, sultry late-night groove sessions at the milongas (tango halls) and an influx of tourists. You’ll also find a variety of enticing events. December heralds in festive fun, fireworks illuminate the sky on New Year’s Eve and Carnaval Porteño kicks off in February.\n\n6. Saint Lucia\n\nThe winter woes simply don’t exist in Saint Lucia – not with sunny skies, blue waters, volcanic beaches, and stiff rum cocktails. Volcanic beaches, posh spas, and hot springs beckon relaxation seekers, while adrenaline-pumping ziplines and dive sites attract more active types. Pack your hiking boots because the UNESCO-listed Pitons, shown here, are not to be missed. As you’ve probably gathered, Saint Lucia is pretty darn romantic. Looking to turn up the heat? Reserve a room at Marigot Bay or Jade Mountain Resort.\n\n7. Ko Samui, Thailand\n\nIn the realm of tried-and-true vacation destinations, few compare to Ko Samui. Thailand's second-largest island and reigning holiday hotspot serves up an intoxicating mix of sandy stretches, coconut groves, dense jungle, mesmerizing temples, and welcoming locals. There are fantastic places to stay – namely the Four Seasons Resort Koh Samui – along with pampering spas, hip bars to watch the sunset, and wonderful restaurants. Speaking of food, we’d be foolish not to spotlight the flavorful fare. True to its fishing roots, dishes run the gamut from Thai-style crab curry to tom yum goong (hot-and-sour seafood soup).\n\n8. Lima, Peru\n\nWorld-class museums, UNESCO sites, vibrant nightlife, and a top-notch culinary scene make Lima an alluring city break. First up, we need to talk about the food. The gastronomical capital of Latin America boasts a bevy of fine dining restaurants, plus no-frills cevicherias and bustling markets. In between meals, check out pre-Columbian ceramics at Museo Larco. Be sure to hit up a few of the independent galleries and contemporary art venues, too. It’s worth noting that you can do all this while wearing a T-shirt in December, January, and February.\n\n9. St. Kitts\n\nGuaranteed excellent weather and a wealth of outdoor pursuits await in St. Kitts. The Caribbean nation enjoys a balmy climate with average temperatures hovering around 82°F. Translation: perfect conditions for rainforest treks, 4x4 expeditions and touring old sugar cane plantations. Even better, a winter jaunt to St. Kitts doesn’t have to break the bank thanks to a slew of affordable beach bars, restaurants and hotels. On the flip side, if you're in a position to splurge, we recommend shacking up at the Park Hyatt St. Kitts.\n\n10. Ambergris Caye, Belize\n\nIf value, weather and underwater exploration factor heavily into your vacation decisions, let us introduce you to Ambergris Caye. Beloved by beach bums and retirees on a budget, this Belizean island also has a lively side with nightlife centered around San Pedro and enough aquatic activities to banish any thoughts of boredom. On that note, you can’t talk about Ambergris Caye without mentioning the Belize Barrier Reef. Off the eastern coast lies unparalleled dive sites – most famously the Blue Hole.\n\n11. Bali, Indonesia\n\nMost people venture to Bali from April to October. Budget-conscious wanderers who don’t mind rain and humidity will score major deals during the wet season. We’ll admit the downpours are certainly a drawback, but it's a tradeoff for reduced rates and less foot traffic at popular sites. In addition to experiencing crowd-free temples and terraced rice paddies, treat yourself to traditional Balinese dishes. During those precious moments of reprieve from precipitation, travelers can chill out on the shores of Seminyak or go surfing in Canggu.\n\n12. Trancoso, Brazil\n\nCare to venture a guess as to which Brazilian locale landed on our latest must-visit list? If you assumed Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo, think again. This year, we've got our Hopper alerts set for Trancoso (well, technically Porto Seguro International Airport). Located in the state of Bahia, this former fishing village tempts vacationers with its golden shores, swaying coconut palms, and bohemian vibe. It’s the place Brazilian celebrities go to sip caipirinhas and snooze in soulful casitas at Uxua Casa Hotel.\n\n13. Puerto Vallarta, Mexico\n\nSay “goodbye” to the polar vortex and “hello” to the warm, dry weather in Puerto Vallarta. Anticipate temperatures in the high 70s and little chance of precipitation. No surprise this in-demand resort town buzzes with sun-seekers all winter long. December ushers in prime whale-watching season and festive holiday traditions, including Feast of the Virgen de Guadalupe (Dec. 12). The tourism spike extends well into February, so prepare for increase rates. Softening the blow of budget-busting prices? The Historic Center Art Walk, legendary nightlife, El Malecón, and Playa Los Muertos.\n\n14. Key West, Florida\n\nCraving a bikini-clad getaway that doesn’t involve leaving the country? One of the steamiest places in the continental U.S., poised 103 miles north of Cuba, Key West consistently reaches temps in the 70s – yes, even in the winter. It also delivers abundant sunshine and temperate waters. That means ample opportunities to snorkel with colorful reef fish, snap photos of the famous pastel-hued houses, and lounge on some of the most beautiful beaches in all of South Florida. Three final words: no passport required.\n\n15. Siem Reap, Cambodia\n\nBest known as the gateway to Angkor Wat, Siem Reap is a pilgrimage-worthy destination in its own right. From contemporary art galleries to the Cambodian circus, the list of drawcards doesn’t start and end with awe-inspiring ancient temples. Thinking about visiting this winter? December to February represents the peak travel period. Even with the uptick in tourists, prices remain quite reasonable. So snagging a reservation at a fabulous hotel such as Le Méridien Angkor shouldn’t be a problem (provided you book in advance).\n\n16. Auckland, New Zealand\n\nA dynamic capital with a pleasant climate, Auckland does a stellar job at providing an urban escape that feels like a true vacation. It's loaded with cool sites, notably the emblematic Sky Tower and Waitematā Harbour. Savor the glorious weather with a trip to Auckland Domain, a historic 200-acre park or hop on a ferry to Waiheke Island. Need a caffeine pick-me-up? Get your java fix courtesy of a creamy flat white at one of Auckland’s top-ranked coffee shops.\n\n17. Santiago, Chile\n\nCurious what Santiago is like when it’s slushy and snowy in the vast majority of the U.S.? From December to February, temperatures often rise into the 80s. Because many Santiaguinos flee the city (remember, it’s summer for them), travelers can reap the benefits of less traffic and congestion. On the itinerary? Play a game of chess in Plaza de Armas, shop till you drop along the fashionable Avenida Alonso de Córdova, and soak in the panoramas from Cerro San Cristobal.\n\n18. Stellenbosch, South Africa\n\nSituated 31 miles east of Cape Town, Stellenbosch is the second oldest and (arguably) most well-known town in South Africa. Nestled in the heart of wine country, it’s full of sprawling vineyards, tasting rooms, and photogenic estates. Beyond world-class vino, folks flock to Stellenbosch to eat incredible field-to-fork dishes, walking the tree-lined streets and admire the Cape Dutch architecture. Another reason to stay over in the Stellenbosch area? Babylonstoren, a charming hotel on an 8-acre farm dating back to 1692.\n\n19. Sydney, Australia\n\nThere’s no bad month to visit Sydney. That said, if you want to take advantage of the opposite seasons, why not jet off in December, January or February? Summer in the capital of New South Wales is distinguished by warm weather, farmers' markets, and a range of exciting live performances. Average daytime temperatures in the 70s encourage locals and visitors alike to relish the many outdoor attractions – whether that’s climbing the iconic Harbour Bridge, shown here, or meandering through the Royal Botanic Garden.\n\n20. Jamaica\n\nJamaica is a popular destination for families, honeymooners and college students. That’s because the third-largest Caribbean island really has something for everyone. A playground of adventure, it’s blessed with spectacular scenery – lush rainforests, banana groves, volcanic cliffs, gorgeous beaches, and the Blue Mountains. Besides its natural attributes, Jamaica oozes authentic culture. The birthplace of reggae and Bob Marley, native rhythms echo in the balmy breeze. Couple that with a carefree attitude and bold, Caribbean flavors. You must try jerk chicken! To wash it down?
