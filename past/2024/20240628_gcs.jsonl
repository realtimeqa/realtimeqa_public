This unexpectedly drastic move is part of a larger effort to rein in soaring housing costs and make the city liveable for residents.\n\nThe city's leftist mayor, Jaume Collboni, said that by November 2028, Barcelona would scrap the licenses of the 10,101 apartments currently approved as short-term rentals.\n\n\"We are confronting what we believe is Barcelona's largest problem,\" Collboni told a city government event.\n\nThe boom in short-term rentals in Barcelona, Spain's most visited city by foreign tourists, means some residents cannot afford an apartment after rents rose 68% in the past 10 years and the cost of buying a house rose by 38%, Collboni said. Access to housing has become a driver of inequality, particularly for young people, he added.\n\nAirbnb vs. Vrbo:Which vacation rental platform is right for you?\n\nNational governments relish the economic benefits of tourism – Spain ranks among the top three most visited countries in the world – but with local residents priced out in some places, gentrification and owner preference for lucrative tourist rentals are increasingly a hot topic across Europe.\n\nLocal governments have announced restrictions on short-term rentals in places such as Spain's Canary Islands, Lisbon and Berlin in the past decade.\n\nSpain's Socialist housing minister, Isabel Rodriguez, said she supported Barcelona's decision.\n\n\"It's about making all the necessary efforts to guarantee access to affordable housing,\" she posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAirbnb, which hosts a significant number of Barcelona listings, did not provide a comment to USA TODAY.\n\n\"Collboni is making a mistake that will lead to (higher) poverty and unemployment,\" Barcelona's tourist apartments association APARTUR said in a statement, adding the ban would trigger a rise in illegal tourist apartments.\n\nHotels stand to benefit from the move. The opening of new hotels in the city's most popular areas was banned by a far-left party governing Barcelona between 2015 and 2023, but Collboni has signaled he could relax the restriction.\n\nBarcelona's hotel association declined to comment on Friday's announcement.\n\n\"Those 10,000 apartments will be used by the city's residents or will go on the market for rent or sale,\" Collboni said of the measure.\n\nBarcelona's local government said in a statement it would maintain its \"strong\" inspection regime to detect potential illegal tourist apartments once the ban comes into force.\n\nNo new tourist apartments have been allowed in the city in recent years. The local government has ordered the shutting of 9,700 illegal tourist apartments since 2016 and close to 3,500 apartments have been recovered to be used as primary housing for local residents, it said.\n\nContributing: Corina Pons and David Latona, Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/24"}]}

Pope Francis ordered McCarrick to a \"life of prayer and penance\" while he awaits a canonical trial to examine the allegations.\n\nThen there was the explosive report from a grand jury in Pennsylvania that detailed rampant sexual abuse by 300 priests over decades, with more than 1,000 children as their victims. And, as the grand jury found, there was a rampant cover-up in Pennsylvania, as Catholic bishops frequently shuttled abusive priests from parish to parish, instead of calling the cops.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, an Italian archbishop, Carlo Maria Viganò, recently accused Pope Francis of knowing about McCarrick's alleged sexual misconduct but doing nothing about it until people came forward with accounts of being abused by McCarrick in interviews with The New York Times.\n\nLast week, the New York State attorney general issued subpoenas to eight dioceses as part of an investigation into whether allegations of sexual abuse of children had been covered up. And New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced on Thursday that his office would begin its own investigation by establishing a toll-free hotline for victims to come forward and having a task force to examine the claims. The number is 855-363-6548.\n\n“The report revealed that sexual assaults on children — and efforts to cover up such assaults — were far more widespread in Pennsylvania than we ever thought possible,\" Grewal said in a statement. \"We owe it to the people of New Jersey to find out whether the same thing happened here.\"\n\nAlso last week, the Diocese of Metuchen suspended the Rev. Alfonso Condorson, the pastor of St. Joseph's Church in Bound Brook, pending a review of allegations that he attempted to seduce a 24-year-old male parishioner while on vacation in Cancun, Mexico, in 1997. Condorson, who previously went by the name Alfonso de Condorpusa, was a priest at Holy Trinity Church in Hackensack at the time. The Newark Archdiocese investigated the allegations then, but no action was taken.\n\nMore:Diocese of Metuchen suspends priest amid reexamination of misconduct allegations\n\nMore:New Jersey attorney general to investigate sex-abuse allegations among Catholic clergy\n\nMike Kelly:The secret life of Catholic Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and reports of sex abuse\n\nFor Catholics, this latest round of sex abuse and cover-up allegations has become a real test of faith. It has done more than just dredge up the dark times of the early 2000s, when The Boston Globe exposed rampant sexual abuse by priests in its Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Spotlight\" series.\n\nIn New Jersey, as has happened elsewhere, the scandal has the potential to go much deeper, rooting out priests who were quietly removed from their parishes but never prosecuted. And it could reach inside the Vatican, where there have been calls for Pope Francis, once seen as a reformer, to resign.\n\nA sampling of North Jersey Catholics as they attended Mass last week suggests that the pope still has their support. But given the seriousness of the crisis, that support is anything but ironclad, and there appears to be mounting pressure for the Vatican to enact real reforms — and quickly.\n\n“I don’t think Pope Francis should resign. He has a right to defend himself,” Susan Cox said as she and her husband, Bill, arrived for the 10 a.m. Mass at St. Philip’s R.C. Church in Clifton last Sunday. “But if it’s proven that he is guilty of a cover-up, then maybe he should.”\n\n\"They need better psychological testing for these priests,\" her husband added. \"They need to vet them better.\"\n\nAsked whether they supported the recent call by state Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex, for a grand jury investigation in New Jersey, which has since been set into motion by Grewal, they answered in unison: \"Absolutely.\"\n\nStory continues below gallery.\n\nMary Ann Hilt, a longtime parishioner at Sacred Heart Church in Clifton who attends the Latin Mass, said she hasn't seen any proof that the pope knew of the sexual allegations against McCarrick. Catholics, she said, should give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\"I feel a lot it is hearsay,\" said Hilt, who called the pope a great leader for his stance on supporting the poor. \"I feel more investigations need to be done. It's too soon.\"\n\nThere's been talk of a civil war brewing in the church since Viganò aired his allegations against the pope in a 7,000-page letter last month, with conservatives on one side and more liberal Catholics siding with Pope Francis on the other. Many had high hopes for reform when Francis took over from his conservative predecessor, Benedict XVI. Francis has been moving the church in a more progressive direction, softening its traditional stance against homosexuality while embracing diversity.\n\n“I don’t think there is a war,\" said Paul DeVita of Clifton. “When Richard Nixon resigned from office, people really gave Gerald Ford a hard time when he pardoned him. What he said was we need to move on; we need to band together and move on. I think if they ended up kicking out Pope Francis, the same result would happen. They would put somebody in office who was part of what is happening now.”\n\nAmid the calls for unity, the latest scandal has revived the debate over whether priests should be allowed to marry. Many see the demand for a celibate life — considered an act of holiness — as asking for the impossible in the modern world.\n\n“I think they might have to have married priests,” Sharon Rubacky said as she left the Church of St. Anne in Fair Lawn. “You’re asking someone who goes into the seminary to be single their whole life. I think that’s asking a lot.”\n\nBut Nelida Rivera, another St. Anne parishioner, had a different opinion. \"I don't think it's a good idea to let priests marry,\" she said. \"That would take away from their priestly duties. When you're a priest, you're a priest around the clock, seven days a week.\"\n\nStill, Rivera conceded that, as a mother, she is troubled by the current scandal. \"The trust is gone,\" she said.\n\nCalls for patience, signs of impatience\n\nIn 2002, the country's Catholic bishops gathered in Dallas to adopt reforms that were intended to protect children from sexual abuse by priests. Stephen Schneck, a former director of the Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies at the Catholic University of America, said the recent sex abuse allegations have shown that those changes weren't enough.\n\n\"The laity in general feel betrayed by our church,\" he said. \"I think for those who follow these things, we had hoped the 2002 Dallas reforms would be sufficient to address this issue, and it seems clear that additional measures are needed. I think among those measures needed are greater scrutiny by American law enforcement.\"\n\nSchneck said Francis has been \"more diligent\" than his predecessors in addressing the abuse crisis, asking a number of high-ranking prelates to resign over cover-up issues in Australia, Chile, Ireland and other places.\n\n\"That said, Pope Francis has only been in office for a few years, and most of these abuse allegations go back decades, so it will take ... years to clear this all up,'' he said. \"I think we have to continue to ask Pope Francis to step up his leadership in this regard.\n\n\"In so many ways he has been a breath of fresh air for our church in these times, but this abuse crisis needs to be at the very very top of his list of priorities,'' he added.\n\nBut Bob Hoatson of West Orange, the founder of a nonprofit organization that works with victims of clergy sex abuse, said the pope has disappointed him.\n\n\"When he was elected, Pope Francis said all the right things,'' he said. \"And he also established the pontifical commission for the protection of children and youth, and that was a good step. But the only thing we have gotten from Francis since he became the pope is very, very nice words and platitudes; we haven’t gotten any action steps from him.\"\n\nHoatson said he is inclined to believe the letter by an archbishop published last month that claimed Francis, along with other church leaders, had been aware of the sexual misconduct allegations against McCarrick. If that is proved, he said, the pope should resign.\n\n“End the cover-up of sexual abuse that has gone on for decades and centuries,’’ Hoatson said, describing what he thinks the pope should do to address the issue. “Then I may have second thoughts, but right now my suspicion is that Pope Francis is hiding something, and it doesn’t look good for his future at all.”\n\nOf the 300 priests accused of sexual crimes by the Pennsylvania grand jury, four had ties to New Jersey. One of them, the Rev. Augustine Giella, served in a number of parishes in Bergen County before moving to Pennsylvania, including Holy Trinity in Hackensack, St. Catherine's in Glen Rock and the Church of the Epiphany in Cliffside Park. (He also served at Our Lady of Sorrows in Jersey City.) He died in 1992 while awaiting trial on charges of possessing child pornography.\n\nThe others named in the Pennsylvania grand jury report with New Jersey ties are the Rev. James Hopkins, the Rev. John P. Connor and the Rev. A. Gregory Uhrig. Hopkins was sentenced to 10 years in prison for molesting an altar boy in Camden County. Connor, who served in parishes in Vineland, Gloucester, and Haddon Heights, was charged in 1984 with molesting a 14-year-old boy. He avoided prison by accepting a plea deal that allowed him to enter the Pretrial Intervention program for first-time offenders.\n\nUhrig, now a weekend assistant at Our Lady of Lourdes in Readington, is alleged to have groped a 13-year-old at a church in Easton, Pennsylvania, in the 1970s. He was later found not guilty by a canonical review board, and by the time the charges were reported to law enforcement, the statute of limitations had expired, the report said.\n\nLeaning on faith\n\nFor many lay Catholics in North Jersey, their trust in the church has been shaken but their faith remains strong. The Church of St. Anne was packed last Sunday morning for the 11:30 Mass. Father Joe Doyle spoke of forgiveness in his homily, and though he didn't mention the current scandal, one could draw the implication.\n\n\"Forgiveness is a first step,\" he told the parishioners.\n\nSin and the gift of forgiveness, which leads to redemption, are seen as the pillars of the faith. Rather than judge and condemn, Catholics see themselves as following Jesus when they forgive.\n\n“I don’t know the Pope. I don’t judge him,” Daniel Belonia said as he arrived at St. Philip’s in Clifton with his wife, Charissa. “Corruption is everywhere. I just try and focus on God.”\n\n“We believe in God, not the pope,” Charissa added.\n\n“It’s a belief we have in God, not the man,’’ said a Clifton man who attended Mass at Sacred Heart in Clifton and gave only his first name, Dan. “We understand the priests are ordained and they are the servants of God, and they are just like us and they are fallible.”\n\nDan described himself as a “traditionalist” and said he has never liked Pope Francis because of what he said are the “radical changes” that the pontiff is implementing. He cited the pope’s suggestion to change some of the words of the Lord's Prayer.\n\n“It's been that way for over 2,000 years. How could you change something like that, and that’s the tipping point?’’ he said. “There are a lot of changes going on in the world, and I don’t agree with it. God created us, how he created us to be, man and woman, and we should follow that, and God doesn’t make mistakes.”\n\nAt St. Nicholas Roman Catholic Church in Passaic, some who attended the afternoon Spanish Mass said priests who are found to have sexually abused minors or others should be punished. But they acknowledged that the passage of time often makes that difficult.\n\nUnder current New Jersey law, victims have until they turn 20, or two years from the moment they connect the abuse with the trauma it has caused, to bring a claim in civil court. But priests and other abusers can't be criminally prosecuted for cases that predate 1996, when the state removed the statute of limitations for sex abuse.\n\n\"The church is led by men, but it is also led by the spirit, and the men are men who are not perfect,'' said Maritza Penagos of Garfield, answering a question from a reporter in Spanish. \"There is always going to be scandals against the church. I pray for Pope Francis to help him know what to do and what decisions he must make.”\n\nEmail: cowenr@northjersey.com and alvarado@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/09"}]}

Assange is set to be released to Australia, his country of citizenship, after a Tuesday court proceeding is over, according to federal records.\n\nAssange agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate classified information relating to the national defense of the United States, according to a letter accompanying charging documents filed in U.S. District Court in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory in the Pacific.\n\nThe court hearing federal court in Saipan was arranged because of Assange's opposition to visiting the continental U.S.\n\nAssange is scheduled to plead guilty and be sentenced at the same hearing on Tuesday at 7 p.m. EDT, according to a letter from U.S. Attorney Shawn Anderson.

WikiLeaks released more than 90,000 documents related to Afghanistan and later published more than 400,000 documents from the war in Iraq. The documents included information about civilian deaths, the hunt for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and Iran's backing of militants in Iraq.\n\nFormer U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning served years in prison for leaking the documents to WikiLeaks. Former President Barack Obama commuted her sentence after she served seven of 35 years.\n\nBut Assange’s case proved difficult to prosecute both politically and geographically. He argued that he was a journalist and that Wikileaks published secret documents as major American newspapers routinely do.\n\nThe Justice Department under Obama didn’t charge him. But during former President Donald Trump’s administration, the department secured an indictment in 2019 on 17 charges of espionage and one charge of computer misuse.\n\nAssange's critics argued he wasn’t a journalist because he didn’t write stories or interview anyone or provide sufficient explanatory context to explain the raw classified documents and data that he released.\n\n\"WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service,\" then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo, said in April 2017 in his first public speech as head of the spy agency. \"Assange and his ilk,\" Pompeo said, seek \"personal self-aggrandizement through the destruction of Western values.\"\n\nJournalism advocates lamented the plea agreement.\n\nJameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the agreement ratified Assange spending five years in prison for activities journalists engage in every day.\n\n“It will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world,” Jaffer said.\n\nDavid Greene, civil liberties director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group for free speech and digital privacy, called the plea agreement “a conviction for basic journalistic acts.”\n\n“This sets a dangerous precedent, and all those who value a free press should work to make sure that it never happens again,” Green said.\n\nAssange’s lawyers argued the charges were politically motivated. He fought extradition, initially taking refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid charges in Sweden, which have since been dropped, because he feared Sweden would extradite him to the U.S.\n\nAssange has been jailed for years in Belmarsh Prison, first for jumping bail on the Swedish charge and later because he was considered a flight risk during his extradition fight.\n\nThe United Kingdom High Court ruled in May that he would have another chance to fight his extradition in the yearslong court battle.\n\nThe Justice Department reached the plea agreement because of uncertainty about the case after recent court rulings.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/04/27/corrections-clarifications-2019/3031465001/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications 2019", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWe recognize that mistakes may happen – or that new information can emerge after a story is published – and we pledge to address all concerns quickly, fairly and transparently.

Public health campaigns have provided a playbook for addressing the uniquely American problem of gun violence that kills nearly 50,000 people a year, he said.\n\n“I want people to know this is a profound public health crisis, but it is a solvable public health crisis,” he told USA TODAY. “As a nation, we are not powerless. We can do something about it.”\n\nGun violence:America’s largest mass shooting is the one happening every day. But we know how to stop it\n\nMurthy's approach involves a range of responses, including warning labels on firearms, as with other consumer products, reinstating the ban on assault weapons and laws on safe gun storage to reduce the risk of homicides and suicides. He also emphasized the increased need for mental health resources for victims of gun violence, including trauma-informed health care and school-based services.\n\nIn a statement posted to social media Tuesday morning, a National Rifle Association official called Murthy’s advisory “an extension of the Biden Administration’s war on law-abiding gun owners.”\n\n“The reluctance to prosecute and punish criminals on the part of President Biden and many of his allies is the primary cause of that,” said Randy Kozuch, executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, the organization’s lobbying arm.\n\nThe U.S. has already seen 235 mass shootings in 2024, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks incidents involving four or more victims. Homicides and suicides, which don't get as much coverage, drive the country’s death toll.\n\nMurthy’s call for an immediate public health response comes after similar calls for intervention from the American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association, which have long identified gun violence as a public health scourge. But Murthy's role as the nation’s top physician during two presidential administrations gives the declaration added weight.\n\nDoes it matter if we frame gun violence as a public health issue?\n\nMurthy has issued previous advisories for public health crises, including alerts about the dangers of social media and an epidemic of loneliness. During the Obama administration, Murthy issued a crisis alert about e-cigarettes. Historically, surgeons general have issued warnings about pressing health concerns. Murthy said he believes this advisory can drive broader public awareness about the toll of gun violence in America.\n\n“A public health approach is really fundamentally about ensuring that we are defining clearly a problem and its impact on health,” he said, adding it requires using data to understand the extent of the problem and who is most affected.\n\nWhat difference does an official warning make?\n\nMurthy’s advisory draws from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s response to violence prevention, which begins with monitoring through data and research, looking at risks and requiring widespread adoption.\n\nThe advisory highlights interventions in communities and schools and mental health support, as well as safe and secure gun storage, background checks and effective gun removal policies. The advisory also explicitly calls for banning assault weapons and large-capacity magazines for civilian use, along with restrictions on carrying loaded firearms in public spaces, concealed and open carry, and rules about using firearms in public.\n\nThe advisory calls for treating gun regulations like the U.S. does other consumer products, as it does motor vehicle standards, pesticide regulations and Food and Drug Administration approvals. Firearms do not have the same safety testing or safety features, including warning labels, as other products do.\n\nDeath rates for young people far surpass other countries\n\nGun violence has steadily risen in recent years. In 2022, more than 48,000 people died by gun violence, according to the advisory. That’s 16,000 more deaths than in 2010. Firearm-related suicides have increased by 20%, including a “staggering increase” in such deaths among young people, the advisory noted.\n\nHaving guns increases the risk for all household members of dying by homicide and suicide, the advisory said. And keeping firearms unlocked also increases the risk of young people dying by suicide and accidents or suffering unintentional injuries.\n\nIn 2020, gun violence overtook car accidents as the leading cause of death among children. Firearm deaths among children and adolescents in the U.S. are six times as prevalent in the U.S. than in Canada and happen at more than 10 times the rate in Switzerland. In the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the death rate by firearms is nearly 50 times lower than in the U.S.\n\nGun ownership:Supreme Court upholds law banning domestic abusers from owning guns\n\n“Gun violence has now become a kids' issue,” Murthy said. “In my mind, that elevates the urgency and importance of us addressing this public health crisis.”\n\nPeople of color are disparately affected by gun violence because they disproportionately live in poverty and in marginalized communities where they face an increased risk of shootings.\n\nThe spillover effects of gun violence are sweeping, and not just for the victims. People who witness a shooting or lose loved ones to gun violence are more likely to experience depression or anxiety, according to the advisory. Victims' family members also face increased mental health struggles. Children whose parents die by homicide or suicide are likelier to experience depression, heart disease or cancer, and these experiences are shown to impact them through life, at school and work, the advisory said.\n\nMass shootings, which make up a small percentage of U.S. gun deaths, have outsized mental health consequences, causing people to worry about the risks of going to public places and events, the advisory said.\n\nHow can public health help solve the problem?\n\nMurthy said he hopes the advisory will increase awareness and prompt health care systems and legislators to prioritize solutions.\n\nIn 1964, Luther Terry, the surgeon general for President Lyndon B. Johnson, issued an advisory that tobacco use was hazardous and caused cancer. At that time, Murthy said, cigarette smoking was “deeply embedded in the fabric of America.”\n\nA year later, Congress enacted a law to create a warning label on cigarette products, according to the Association of Centers for the Study of Congress at the University of Delaware. Tobacco use dropped precipitously afterward, with declines in lung cancer and youth smoking, as a federal report showed.\n\nIdentifying the public health risks of smoking helped change the culture and make Americans safer. The same can be done with gun violence, Murthy said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/06/25/gun-violence-statistics-surgeon-general-warning/74202585007/", "title": "Why the surgeon general declared gun violence public health crisis.", "text": "The U.S. surgeon general declared gun violence in America a public health crisis today and called for a series of initiatives similar to those used against smoking and motor vehicle crashes to stop it.\n\nAn estimated 50,000 people are killed every year in gun violence, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said, and the impact spreads far beyond those deaths.\n\nMurthy issued a 39-page advisory, the first of its kind related to firearm deaths.

Shatterproof hosted the conference call announcement with executives from Cigna and Horizon.\n\nShatterproof convened a national task force earlier this year that included experts and insurance executives.\n\nThe core principles the group endorsed were derived from the U.S. Surgeon General's 2016 report on alcohol, drugs and health. They include routine screening for substance-use disorders in primary care practices, rapid access to addiction treatment, long-term out-patient care and monitoring and coordination of substance-abuse care with other health needs.\n\n\"Today, we have evidence-based treatments that save lives, but tragically they are still not widely available,\" said Vivek Murthy, former Surgeon General and author of that report. \"Research has proven that addiction is not a character flaw, but a chronic disease of the brain.\"\n\nREAD MORE:From rescue to recovery: OD patients get help they need\n\nREAD MORE:U.S. attorney warns of growing opioid epidemic\n\nOnly one in 10 of the 21 million people across the country who suffer substance-use disorders is in treatment, said Thomas McClellan, former deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nAnd a majority of treatment centers fail to provide the personalized diagnosis, care, and monitoring needed to sustain recovery, he said, \"even though science has proven that substance use disorder is a chronic brain disease that can be managed with medical treatment.\"\n\nFamilies who have sought treatment for a loved one say that it can be impossible to find a place in a detox facility in a crisis, and that obtaining appropriate follow-up care and coverage is often a struggle. Treatment options are few and the coverage is limited.\n\nHorizon, with 3.8 million members in New Jersey, came under pressure from Gov. Chris Christie earlier this year to donate surplus funds for the governor's addiction-treatment initiatives. Their refusal during budget negotiations led to a state government shutdown.\n\nOpioid addiction is \"a public health crisis,\" said Mary Ann Christopher, Horizon's vice president of clinical operations and transformation. The insurer is \"trying to get a lot of things on the ground quickly as this crisis escalates,\" she said, and adopting a \"flexible approach.\"\n\nThe insurer is making a push to be sure that quality treatment is available in New Jersey, and that patients don't need to leave the state, she said. \"This is a chronic illness and ultimately you have to make that recovery in the place where you live.\"\n\nAmong the practices the insurer is funding, based on proven success, are peer recovery counselors who visit patients in hospital emergency departments after an overdose reversal and help to get them into treatment.

It can’t be treated using traditional therapies even though it has debilitating and even deadly consequences.\n\nThe problem seeping in at the corners of our communities is loneliness and U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy is hoping to generate awareness and offer remedies before it claims more lives.\n\n“Most of us probably think of loneliness as just a bad feeling,” he told USA TODAY. “It turns out that loneliness has far greater implications for our health when we struggle with a sense of social disconnection, being lonely or isolated.”\n\nLoneliness is detrimental to mental and physical health, experts say, leading to an increased risk of heart disease, dementia, stroke and premature death. As researchers track record levels of self-reported loneliness, public health leaders are banding together to develop a public health framework to address the epidemic.\n\n“The world is becoming lonelier and there’s some very, very worrisome consequences,” said Dr. Jeremy Nobel, founder of The Foundation for Art and Healing, a nonprofit that addresses public health concerns through creative expression, which launched an initiative called Project Unlonely.\n\n“It won’t just make you miserable, but loneliness will kill you,\" he said. \"And that’s why it’s a crisis.\"\n\nWhat is loneliness?\n\nLoneliness occurs when the connections a person needs in life are greater than the connections they have, Murthy said.\n\nBecause it’s so subjective, not everyone feels loneliness the same way or for the same reason.\n\nNobel argues in his book, “Project Unlonely: Healing our Crisis of Disconnection,” there are three types of loneliness: psychological, social and existential.\n\nSome may experience psychological loneliness when they don’t feel like they have anyone to confide in or trust. Societal loneliness is feeling systemically excluded because of a characteristic, including gender, race, or disability. Existential, or spiritual, loneliness comes from feeling disconnected from oneself.\n\n“People can have all of these loneliness types at the same time,” said Nobel, who is on the faculty at Harvard Medical School and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nLoneliness is experienced throughout a person's lifespan, he said, and it can spiral as a result of trauma, illness and the effects of aging. It can also be exacerbated by technology taking the place of human interaction, which helps explain why young people report the highest rates of loneliness.\n\nA Harvard survey conducted in 2020 found that 61% of adults from 18 to 25 reported feeling serious loneliness, compared to 39% across the general population.\n\nOther populations that report a high prevalence of loneliness and isolation include people with poor physical and mental health, disabilities, financial insecurity, those who live alone, single parents and older populations.\n\n“This is why it’s so complicated when you try to address loneliness as a population health topic because it’s so varied based on the circumstances individuals have to navigate,” Nobel said.\n\nAmericans are lonely\n\nLoneliness is by no means new to the human experience. But experts say it has worsened in recent years.\n\nAs the American population becomes older and sicker with chronic diseases, the loneliness numbers have increased, Nobel said. Modern conveniences have also caused loneliness to expand dramatically across the population, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nData from the University of Michigan's National Poll on Healthy Aging showed loneliness among 50- to 80-year-olds had increased from 27% in October 2018 to 56% in June 2020, at the height of pandemic-era restrictions.\n\nSelf-reported feelings of loneliness decreased to 34% in January 2023, and although the problem is not “as severe as it was during the pandemic, it remains elevated compared to before the pandemic,” said Lindsay Kobayashi, John G. Searle assistant professor of epidemiology and global public health at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.\n\nCOVID-19 prompted a boom in delivery services and Zoom meetings, Murthy said which sustained society, schools and workplaces after restrictions on social distancing lifted. As a result, there are fewer opportunities for Americans to interact in person and build social connections.\n\n“We have to be intentional about building social connections in our life,” he said. People are also more likely to change jobs or move around the country due to the rise in remote work, which can disrupt meaningful connections.\n\nSocial media has accelerated loneliness as research shows feeling lonely is more common among heavy users of these sites. Although \"likes\" and \"followers\" may make a person feel good at the moment, they don't foster genuine connectedness with other people, Murthy said.\n\nThe Harvard study found that 43% of young adults reported increases in loneliness since the outbreak of the pandemic. About half reported that no one in the past few weeks had “taken more than just a few minutes” to ask how they were doing in a way that made them feel like the person “genuinely cared.”\n\n“You can be surrounded by lots of people and you can have lots of followers or connections on social media, but not necessarily feel like you’ve got somebody who knows you or shows up for you in a crisis,” he said.\n\nHow loneliness can impact health\n\nThere's another reason experts are honing in on loneliness as a growing problem: it can harm a person's mental and physical health, making it a lethal combination.\n\nTackling this massive problem would mean addressing the greatest preventable risk factor for mental health challenges like depression, anxiety, addiction, suicidality and self-harm, Nobel said. He noted that all of these mental health conditions can be triggered by and also exacerbate feelings of loneliness.\n\n“There’s a bidirectional relationship and that’s what causes spiraling,” he said. Spiraling is a downward cascade of negative thoughts that feed into loneliness, making the condition worse and eroding a person's self-esteem.\n\nThe U.S. Surgeon General's advisory report found that loneliness increases the risk of premature death by 26% and isolation by 29%. Murthy said in terms of your lifespan, continuing to live in loneliness is equivalent to smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day.\n\nFeeling lonely also increases a person’s risk of heart disease by 29% and the risk of stroke by 32%, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nWhat's remarkable, the surgeon general said, is how pervasive loneliness is.\n\nOne in 2 adults in the U.S. are living with measurable levels of loneliness – it's a broader swath of the population than the number of people with diabetes, Murthy said. “Building social connections in our life has to be a vital priority.”\n\nResearchers are still learning why loneliness causes negative health outcomes, but they have a few working hypotheses.\n\nLoneliness could trigger stress hormones, Kobayashi said, which causes inflammation and dysregulates bodily functions. Feeling lonely could also cause people to adopt unhealthy lifestyle behaviors like poor diet, smoking and substance use.\n\nLonely people may also be less motivated to seek preventive care, adhere to medication and practice self-care, Nobel said.\n\nThe solution: Social connectedness\n\nIf you’re feeling lonely, you’re not alone. Experts say recognition and awareness are important first steps to escaping loneliness.\n\n“There are a lot of people struggling with loneliness and it doesn’t mean that you’re broken or something is fundamentally wrong with you,” Murthy said.\n\nOn an individual level, there are things that people can practice that could prevent them from feeling lonely. He suggests taking 15 minutes a day to reach out to someone you care about, look for ways to serve others and make the time count by giving other people your full attention and putting devices away.\n\nInstitutions, including schools, employers and health care systems, should also proactively adopt public health strategies to head off loneliness at the pass.\n\nProviders can practice “social prescribing,” Nobel said, a concept that’s already embraced by the U.K. Doctors screen for loneliness, as they would for depression and anxiety, and guide patients to community-based organizations that have partnered with health care facilities to address it.\n\nBeyond the health sector, the U.S. Surgeon General said public health leaders can also take a critical look at the infrastructure in local communities and digital environments to spread awareness and help build cultures of connection.\n\nTackling the nation's loneliness epidemic will require that all sectors of society work together with a common goal, Murthy said.\n\n“We can’t take on a lot of these challenges alone. We need to be together. We need to be connected,\" he said. \"That’s what strengthening the social fabric in our lives and communities is all about.\"\n\nSend tips to Adrianna Rodriguez: adrodriguez@usatoday.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/08/25/trump-opioid-emergency-now-what-mr-president-joshua-sharfstein-column/594657001/", "title": "The opioid emergency: Now what, Mr. President?", "text": "Joshua Sharfstein\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThe opioid epidemic has become a crisis in every corner of the country. In many communities, more people are losing their lives from overdoses than from homicides, suicides and traffic fatalities — combined. In my own city of Baltimore, where violence dominates front page news, more than twice as many people died from overdoses last year than from shootings.\n\nPresident Trump recognized the situation as a crisis — one that has been growing rapidly over several years — when he said this month: “The opioid crisis is an emergency, and I’m saying officially, right now, it is an emergency.” A presidential declaration sends a strong signal of urgency and resolve, but then what?\n\nI’ve spent years working on the front lines in public health, including serving as health secretary in Maryland and as city health commissioner in Baltimore, where we took action that reduced overdose rates. I know firsthand that emergency declarations are meaningless if they’re not backed up by action. The administration must quickly move on a series of steps to make meaningful progress on the opioid epidemic.\n\nFirst, the federal government should mobilize emergency resources to rapidly stand up a monitoring program that provides data every week on addiction and overdose in communities across the country. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relies on months- or years-old data from death certificates, which are often inaccurate.\n\nA far better approach would be to work directly with medical examiners and coroners to apply standard protocols and report information immediately. The federal government should fund programs to track non-fatal overdoses and urine toxicology results. Such data will not only help characterize the challenge in communities, but will also allow them understand whether different strategies are producing results.\n\nMore:Opinion: Alabama's doctors stepping up in opioid crisis\n\nMore:Health plan a disaster for opioid crisis | Vivek Murthy\n\nSecond, the Department of Health and Human Services should use the resources and authority available during an emergency to rapidly expand access to effective treatment. According to the U.S. surgeon general, only about one in 10 Americans with a substance use disorder receive treatment, even though opioid use disorder is one of the most treatable addictions.\n\nRecently, Massachusetts found that individuals who survived an overdose and then received effective treatment with medications had less than half the likelihood of dying later from an overdose than those who did not.\n\nSecretary Tom Price should deploy physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners in the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service to hard-hit communities to set up treatment programs. As recommended by the presidential commission led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the Health Services and Resources Administration should require health professionals in federally funded clinics to receive necessary training and provide medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.\n\nThird, the White House should direct emergency resources to innovative local efforts that are based on evidence. Local and state budgets have borne a huge burden from opioid overdose. There are enormous costs in emergency medical services, law enforcement, child welfare and multiple other systems. Strategic investments can help local police divert people who use drugs into needed services, help local jails establish and refer to effective treatment programs, and help local health care systems come together to adopt standards for prescribing for pain and treating addiction.\n\nHospital standards set by Rhode Island are an excellent starting point.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nMore:GOP health bill is a disaster for opioid crisis\n\nThese emergency funds should support local programs that directly tackle the unique threat posed by the highly potent opioid fentanyl, which is now responsible for a majority of overdose deaths in many states. For example, the federal government should make resources and legal flexibility available to communities that wish to set up promising alternative models of treatment, such as mobile treatment with methadone or buprenorphine.\n\nThere should also be space for more aggressive efforts. Communities that are ready to establish supervised consumption spaces, associated with reductions in overdoses in Canada, should receive both needed resources and the assurance that the Justice Department will not prosecute those who participate. The federal government can and should require such programs to be evaluated as a condition of funding and law enforcement discretion.\n\nFourth, the emergency declaration should alter the White House approach to health policy. It is not the right time, in the middle of a national emergency such as this, to drastically cut the Medicaid program that supports access to lifesaving treatment. Many of the presidential commission’s recommendations, including those for emergency action, depend on the Medicaid expansion for single adults. Similarly, the emergency should stimulate White House action on drug prices and open for consideration a national program to make the reversal drug naloxone more widely available.\n\nIf the president’s declaration leads to these and other strong public health actions, the Trump administration could help the nation turn the corner on this lethal epidemic.\n\nOn the other hand, if the administration instead pursues ineffective and draconian law enforcement strategies, or just enjoys a transient public relations benefit of talking tough, the declaration could make matters worse.\n\nMany lives depend on the answer to the question: “Then, what?”\n\nJoshua Sharfstein is the Associate Dean for Public Health Practice and Training, and Inaugural Director of the Bloomberg American Health Initiative.

Few people knew my name and my “Miss USA story.\" Later that year, millions knew my name because of my real story, the story I didn’t want shared. I became famous as “Mess USA” when my boss — now the president of the United States — tossed me into rehab after I tested positive for cocaine. Rather than strip me of my crown or add to the negative press with a humiliation campaign, Donald Trump surprised me, and shocked the world, when he held a news conference and declared: “Tara is going to be given a second chance.”\n\nIt was 10 years ago that I got out of treatment, and I thank him for my 10 years of recovery. I will always be profoundly grateful. He saved my life and, essentially, made me great again. As part of my journey, I have become a vocal advocate for recovery, and today I speak out for the millions who do not have a voice.\n\nThere are 22 million Americans who suffer with a substance use disorder. Only one in 10 of them has the opportunity to receive treatment for addiction. My boss set an example for employers to help folks who, like me, would not have been able to otherwise afford treatment or even know how and where to look for help.\n\nUntreated addiction costs the U.S. economy $442 billion a year — twice what is spent on diabetes. Sadly, we lose 350 American lives each day to this domestic crisis, which now steals more youth from us than car accidents or guns. Last November, then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy released a landmark report, Facing Addiction in America, on alcohol, drugs and health. “How we respond to this crisis is a moral test for America,” he said.\n\nTrump is the real teleprompter president: Mastio & Lawrence\n\nReform more than criminal justice to end opioid epidemic: Column\n\nMy life was the perfect storm for addiction. My uncle molested me when I was 3. When I was 14, my parents’ rocky relationship ended in divorce and my grandfather, my protector who gave me unconditional love when no one else would, died.\n\nThat same year, on a cheerleading trip to Gatlinburg, Tenn., I was offered vodka from a gallon jug that the girls got from older boys, and I jumped at the chance to fit in. I so desperately needed to feel like I belonged somewhere! I swore off alcohol the next day, but addiction had its claws in me and by later that year, I was addicted to morphine. From that point on, my life became a series of alcohol and drug-induced incidents followed by me trying to cover my tracks and maintain appearances.\n\nLike mine, 90% of all substance use disorders begin before age 18. Our president understands firsthand the life-long damage of addiction and how substance use at a young age creates a destructive cycle into an adulthood of suffering and isolation. He has often courageously spoken publicly about how his brother Freddy lost his battle with alcoholism and died in 1981.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nLocal fixes key to criminal justice reform: Column\n\nThe president vowed in his speech to Congress that “we will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth — and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.” I am confident he will keep his promises. As is the case with one in every three American households, substance use disorders impacted his own family, and he now has the power to help millions.\n\nThousands of people have signed Facing Addiction’s letter asking Trump to address the crisis primarily as a public health issue — not to turn back the clock to the failed “drug war” policies of the 1980s. As a businessman first, the facts should guide his strategies to curb this epidemic. And the facts are that every dollar spent on treatment saves $4 in health care costs and $7 in criminal justice, and expanding evidence-based prevention programs in schools has a return on investment of $58 for every $1 spent.\n\nAs the president nominates people for vital roles in federal government agencies, including the first ever assistant secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, he should think about who is at the decision-making tables on the most urgent health crisis of our time. If the president wants to make America great again, he should hear the voices of the 23.5 million adults in long-term recovery — my brothers and sisters — and maybe even hire some of them. He should also heed the call for expanding public health services for the 22 million Americans and their families facing addiction.\n\nThe president should also know that I am committed to supporting him in any way that I can. It is the least I can do considering what he did for me.\n\nTara Conner, Miss USA 2006, is a recovery advocate.

Murthy also said platforms should redesign their algorithms to avoid amplifying false content.\n\nBiden stirred controversy on Friday when he made the initial comments, which came in response to a reporter's question about what message he had for social media companies like Facebook on vaccine misinformation.\n\n\"They're killing people – I mean they're really, look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated,\" Biden told reporters.\n\nFacebook quickly responded, saying on Friday that the president's accusation was not \"supported by the facts\" and touting its efforts to share accurate information about COVID-19.\n\n\"The fact is that more than 2 billion people have viewed authoritative information about COVID-19 and vaccines on Facebook, which is more than any other place on the internet,\" spokesperson Kevin McAlister told USA TODAY. \"More than 3.3 million Americans have also used our vaccine finder tool to find out where and how to get a vaccine.

As of Friday, 66% of Americans age 65 and older are fully vaccinated, Walensky, the CDC director, said. \"We are well on our way to have one of our most vulnerable populations fully protected against this deadly virus, and that is a reason to celebrate,\" she said.\n\nHowever, there are \"some unsettling gaps in our coverage,\" Walensky said. \"While we have many reasons to celebrate, we also have the potential, indeed the need to do more to protect people now.\"\n\nAs part of its vaccine public education initiative, the White House announced a \"We Can Do This: Live\" campaign to connect people on social media to trusted information by pairing influencers with health professionals.\n\nSurgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said actresses Eva Longoria and Olivia Holt; personalities Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest; Barbara Corcoran and Mark Cuban of Shark Tank; Walter Kim, president of the National Association of Evangelicals; NASCAR; the NBA and the WNBA have signed on to the campaign.\n\n\"To truly turn this pandemic around requires more than government action. It’s going to require each of us to take action as well,\" Murthy said. \"We have to decide who we are as a country. Are we 300 million people who happen to live in the same place? Or are we fellow Americans who recognize we are stronger when we care for and protect one another?\"\n\nIndia tries to meet need for oxygen supplies amid record new cases, deaths\n\nWith hospitals in India pleading with the government on social media to replenish their oxygen supplies and threatening to stop fresh admissions of patients, the government put oxygen tankers on special express trains to save COVID-19 patients who are struggling to breathe.\n\n\"We have ramped up the production as oxygen consumption is rising through the roof,\" said Saket Tiku, president of the All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association. \"But we have limitations and the biggest challenge right now is transporting it to where it's urgently needed.\"\n\nIndia is seeing the world’s worst coronavirus surge, setting a grim record for daily infections for a second straight day with 332,730. India has confirmed 16 million cases so far and recorded 2,263 deaths in the past 24 hours. Adding to the deaths, a fire in Mumbai, India, killed 13 COVID-19 patients early Friday when an air conditioning unit exploded in a hospital's ICU.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top epidemiologist, called the situation in India \"dire\" in a White House task force briefing Friday. \"We’re trying to help in any way we can,\" Fauci said, adding, \"I think what this is telling us, in Africa and in India, that when you have a global pandemic it is a global pandemic, and there are no countries that are really safe from it.\"\n\nAs rich countries buy excess vaccine doses, poor countries struggle to vaccinate, study shows\n\nThe world’s richest countries have collectively bought 1 billion more doses than their citizens need, according to a study by the global advocacy group ONE. The rest of the world has only been able to secure 2.5 billion doses — not enough to vaccinate their populations.\n\nSome are calling on the U.S. to share doses with other countries, like India, which reported a global one-day record of more than 332,700 new infections Friday as a coronavirus surge in the world’s second-most populous country overwhelms a fragile health care system critically short of hospital beds and oxygen.\n\nThe Biden administration has said it will share surplus coronavirus vaccine doses with Canada and Mexico. Asked Friday about sharing vaccine with India, Zients, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, said: \"We are committed to sharing vaccine supply as our confidence around our supply increases.\"\n\n\"This is a global pandemic, and India demonstrates the risk of what can happen if we don’t get the pandemic under control everywhere,\" Zients said.\n\nCDC investigating woman’s death after J&J vaccine\n\nOregon health officials said Thursday that federal officials are investigating the death of a woman in her 50s who developed a rare blood clot and low platelets within two weeks of receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine against COVID-19.\n\nFederal officials already were examining six reports of the unusual clots, including a death, out of more 8 million Americans given the one-dose vaccination so far.\n\nThe woman developed a “rare but serious blood clot in combination with very low platelets,” the Oregon Health Authority said in a statement.\n\nTexas health officials also say the U.S. government has reported that a Texas woman is hospitalized with possible blood clots associated with Johnson and Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe announcement by Texas quotes the FDA and CDC as saying the adult woman has “symptoms that appear to be consistent with those few other reported cases” of a rare blood clotting disorder developed after receiving the J&J vaccine.

The government said it would set out to find the killers, kidnappers and other violent criminals it reported escaped from the prison.\n\n“The police were ordered to use all legal means at their disposal to enforce the curfew and apprehend all offenders,” said a statement from Finance Minister Patrick Boivert, acting prime minister.\n\nHaiti spinning out of control:on every metric from gangs to kidnappings, migration to murder\n\nPrime Minister Ariel Henry traveled abroad last week to try to salvage support for bringing in a United Nations-backed security force to stabilize the country in its conflict with increasingly powerful crime groups.\n\nThousands of inmates fled during jailbreak\n\nThe decree capped a deadly weekend that marked a new low in Haiti’s spiral of violence. At least nine people had been killed since Thursday − four of them police officers − as gangs stepped up coordinated attacks on state institutions in Port-au-Prince. Targets included police stations, the country’s international airport, and even the national soccer stadium.\n\nBut the siege Saturday night of the National Penitentiary came as a shock even to Haitians accustomed to living under the constant threat of violence. Almost all of the estimated 4,000 inmates fled in the jailbreak, leaving the usually overcrowded facility eerily empty Sunday with no guards in sight and plastic sandals, clothing and furniture strewn across the concrete patio. Three bodies with gunshot wounds lay at the prison entrance.\n\nIn another neighborhood, the bloodied bodies of two men with their hands tied behind their backs lay face down as residents walked past roadblocks set up with burning tires.\n\n'Glimmer of hope':U.N. approves foreign force to combat Haiti's gangs\n\nColombian soldiers remain in Haiti prison\n\nAmong the few dozen who chose to stay in the prison are 18 former Colombian soldiers accused of working as mercenaries in the July 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse. Amid the clashes Saturday night, several of the Colombians shared a video pleading for their lives.\n\n“Please, please help us,” one of the men, Francisco Uribe, said in the message widely shared on social media. “They are massacring people indiscriminately inside the cells.”\n\nUribe told journalists Sunday who walked breezily into the usually highly guarded facility, “I didn’t flee because I’m innocent.”\n\nColombia’s foreign ministry called on Haiti to provide “special protection” for the men.\n\nIn the absence of official information, inmates’ family members rushed to the prison to check on loved ones.\n\n“I don’t know whether my son is alive or not,” Alexandre Jean said as she roamed around the cells looking for any sign of him. “I don’t know what to do.”\n\nThe violence Saturday night appeared to be widespread, with several neighborhoods reporting gunfire.\n\nSecond Port-au-Prince prison overtaken by gangs\n\nA second Port-au-Prince prison containing about 1,400 inmates was also overrun. Gang gunmen also occupied and vandalized the nation’s top soccer stadium, taking one employee hostage for hours, Haiti’s soccer federation said in a statement. Internet service for many residents was down as Haiti’s top mobile network said a fiber-optic cable connection was slashed during the rampage.\n\nIn the space of less than two weeks, several state institutions have been attacked by the gangs, which are increasingly coordinating their actions and choosing once unthinkable targets like the Central Bank. As part of coordinated attacks by gangs, four police officers were killed Thursday.\n\nUS Embassy in Haiti halts travel to country\n\nAfter gangs opened fire at Haiti’s international airport last week, the U.S. Embassy said it was halting all official travel to the country and urged Sunday night that all American citizens leave as soon as possible. The embassy also said it would cancel all consular appointments until Thursday.\n\nThe Biden administration, which has steadfastly refused to commit troops to any multinational force while offering instead money and logistical support, said it was monitoring the rapidly deteriorating security situation.\n\nA National Security Council official said violence serves only to delay a democratic transition while destroying the lives of thousands. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reiterated U.S. support for elections, inclusive governance and the restoration of democracy.\n\nThe epicenter of the violence Saturday night was Haiti’s National Penitentiary, which was holding several gang leaders. Amid the exchange of gunfire, police appealed for aid.\n\n“They need help,” a union representing police said in a message on social media bearing an “SOS” emoji repeated eight times. “Let’s mobilize the army and the police to prevent the bandits from breaking into the prison.”\n\nThe clashes follow violent protests that turned deadlier in recent days as the prime minister went to Kenya seeking to move ahead on a proposed U.N.-backed security mission in Haiti to be led by that East African country.\n\nHenry took over as prime minister after Moise’s assassination and has repeatedly postponed plans to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, which haven’t happened in almost a decade.\n\nHaiti’s National Police has roughly 9,000 officers to provide security for more than 11 million people, according to the U.N. They are routinely overwhelmed and outgunned by gangs, which are estimated to control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince.\n\nJimmy Chérizier, a former elite police officer known as Barbecue who now runs a gang federation, has claimed responsibility for the surge in attacks. He said the goal was to capture Haiti’s police chief and government ministers and prevent Henry’s return.\n\nThe prime minister, a neurosurgeon, has shrugged off calls for his resignation and didn’t comment when asked whether he believed it was safe to come home.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/03/23/jacksonville-couple-worry-haiti-unrest-and-the-orphanage-they-founded/72941890007/", "title": "Jacksonville couple worry Haiti unrest and the orphanage they ...", "text": "At All Things New, a Haitian orphanage founded by Jacksonville missionaries, 22 children and teenagers go about their daily lives with meals, tutoring and recreation.\n\nThey try not to think about the danger, worsening by the day, that lurks nearby.\n\nThe orphanage is near the city of Gressier, about 20 miles from the nation's capital of Port Au Prince, where years of civil unrest recently exploded with gang violence, murders, sexual brutality, kidnappings and a mass prison escape.\n\nFounders Matt and Jessica Bush are safe in Jacksonville with their three children, one adopted from Haiti. Matt Bush is a pastor at Glendale Community Church and his wife is a long-term substitute teacher at Covenant School. They now run All Things New from the U.S., with the help of about 30 on-site staff.\n\nSo far, the chaos has not reached the orphanage. But as the unrest escalates — the government has declared a state of emergency and the embattled president recently resigned — the Bushes live with constant fear and worry about \"our kids\" and staff in Haiti.\n\n\"Watching from afar is one of the worst experiences we can remember,\" Matt Bush said. \"You become numb after a while, but then a picture or a news story jogs your memory and makes you realize that the people that you love are in danger or are in a very difficult position and there is nothing you can do to help.\"\n\nPlans to live in Haiti abandoned\n\nWhen the Bushes moved to rural Haiti in 2014, they envisioned making the Caribbean nation their home and taking occasional trips to Florida to see family and fundraise for the orphanage. But by 2021, Haiti had become so unstable — including the assassination of the president that July and a major earthquake in August — they decided to make Jacksonville their home base.\n\nMatt was last in Haiti in 2021, wife Jessica and their children not since 2019.\n\n\"We made the decision when things got bad that we did not want to put Haitians in danger by making them drive into the airport to pick us up or to be seen with us and for others to think that they have resources and money,\" Matt Bush said. \"We also did not want to take resources, such as food and water, from Haitians when things are already so difficult to find.\"\n\nRecently the situation has declined further, with heavily armed gangs taking over most of the capital and the country's infrastructure, including its international airport.\n\n\"Thousands and thousands of people have been displaced in Port Au Prince and thousands of people have had to evacuate their homes,\" Bush said.\n\nJessica Bush's father, Phil Atter of Jacksonville, said current conditions in Haiti are \"far worse\" than any time in the orphanage's history. He's glad the family is safe in Florida but said \"there is considerable concern that the gangs, if not contained, could encroach in our area.\"\n\n\"The gangs need to be eradicated and Haiti must find a way to hold open elections and install leadership that truly cares about the people and survival of Haiti, not another corrupt leader in a nation that keeps recycling corrupt leaders,\" Atter said.\n\nIn Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he would send additional law enforcement and state and National Guard resources to the Keys because of an expected influx of illegal immigrants from Haiti. The Coalition of the Haitian Community in Jacksonville asked DeSantis to reconsider. At a recent rally, they called on stated and federal leaders to provide Haitians \"refuge and humanitarian help,\" according to First Coast News, the Times-Union's media partner.\n\n\"We are a nation like all other nations,\" coalition leader Pierre Paul said at the rally. \"Like Ukraine nations, like tourists. They’re coming not for opportunity, but to save their lives.\"\n\nThe state Division of Emergency Management also has launched a portal — floridadisaster.org/Haiti — to collect information from Floridians and other Americans who may be trapped in Haiti. The \"rapidly escalating instability\" put them at risk, according to the agency.\n\nConcerns abroad as danger escalates\n\nNo Americans are currently at All Things New. But the Bushes worry its U.S. ties could cause trouble.\n\n\"I wonder if people find out that our kids and employees have Americans that are helping them and providing for them if they will be in more danger,\" Matt Bush said. \"Right now, the resources that we are able to help provide for them have allowed them to ride out the storm without the added fear of not having food to eat or clothes to wear. The food situation in Haiti is as dire as it has ever been and the cost of living there and the inflation rate has made starvation and malnourishment an even greater threat to most of the Haitian population.\"\n\nThe Bushes pray that the worst of the chaos, currently mainly in and north of Port Au Prince, does not spread south of the capital to the rural area that is home to orphanage. But there are clear danger signs.\n\n\"There have been some threats of gang activity, the schools in the community are closed and there is definitely fear amongst the population where our kids are,\" Matt Bush said.\n\nIn their enclave, 22 youth live on site and nine more from the neighboring community come there daily to receive tutoring and get meals.\n\nThe couple's initial goal for All Things New included preparing the youth to live on their own and helping provide jobs when they graduate. They planned to launch a job-creation training program in computer coding, working with U.S. churches and small nonprofits to maintain their social media and websites.\n\nThe unrest has forced a pause. \"We still hope to do it, but it will just be after things calm down,\" Bush said.\n\nHow can the public, the U.S. government help?\n\nBrad Henry, owner of Bradford Real Estate Network in Jacksonville, is a longtime donor who has made multiple visits to the orphanage. He is an All Things New board member and was title sponsor of the Bushes' recent banquet fundraiser at Deerwood Country Club.\n\n\"The Bushes have maintained their dedication to the kids and employees under circumstances where other missionaries may have discontinued support,\" he said. \"They have a strong group of employees that they trust to handle the day-to-day activities, so it is not critical that they be there in person. It is unfortunate that the conditions in Haiti have made it unsafe for them to travel to Haiti as I know they miss the kids dearly. \"\n\nMission trips and in-person contact with the children and staff can be inspiring for potential donors and sponsors, he said. Recruiting them now from the U.S. is \"more challenging,\" so the recent fundraiser was \"critical to maintain their work,\" Henry said.\n\nThe U.S. government has urged American citizens to depart Haiti as soon as possible: The State Department has maintained a \"level four: do not travel\" warning because the current situation \"is unpredictable and dangerous.\" The U.S. military has airlifted some American \"non-essential\" staff out of the country's embassy and airlifted some locals into the embassy to boost security.\n\nThe Joe Biden administration committed funding for a Kenyan-led multinational security force, but according to an Associated Press report has so far refused to send U.S. troops to Haiti.\n\n\"There are numerous political issues that have prevented the U.S. from getting more involved, and the historical relationship between the two countries is very complicated,\" Bush said. \"At some point a foreign actor will have to get involved to help.\"\n\nHe asked the public to stay informed — \"However bad you think things are right now, they’re much worse\" — and not be afraid to support any nonprofit organization that is trying to help the Haitian people.\n\n\"If you know of someone who runs a ministry in Haiti that is trying to care for people, feed people or otherwise help them and you trust that person, do not be afraid to send money,\" Bush said. \"Many people see what is going on and hesitate to give because the country is not getting better. The majority of people there cannot afford basic survival goods.\"\n\nDespite the unrest, chaos and uncertainty, the Bushes remain committed to the children.\n\n\"We have not changed our long-term idea of always being there for them,\" he said. \"Whether it be through All Things New for as long as that lasts or whether it be just our family being there for them, they are our kids and we will do whatever we can for them always.\"\n\nbcravey@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4109", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/24/missouri-missionaries-killed-haiti/73836177007/", "title": "Missionaries killed in Haiti include Missouri rep Ben Baker's daughter", "text": "A Missouri State representative early Friday morning reported his daughter and son-in-law, both missionaries in Haiti, were reportedly killed in gang violence in the country.\n\n\"My heart is broken in a thousand pieces.

But he and his neighbors said their freshly painted Haut Damier village was built too far from this capital city to work there, and the promised jobs nearby never materialized.\n\n\"A lot of people are professionals here — teachers, lawyers, construction workers,\" said Lacrète, 32, a mechanic who had to quit his job at a Port-au-Prince garage when he moved to the new development. \"Part of the idea of living here was to take these people and get them jobs in the area. That part has not happened yet.\"\n\nAs Haiti prepares to mark the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake, Lacrète's problem underscores how this long-impoverished country is still struggling to better the lives of its citizens.\n\nHis problem also shows how other nations and aid groups haven't been able to figure out the best way help Haiti recover despite massive financial support and the best of intentions.\n\nInternational aid organizations, foreign governments and Haiti's leaders have combined to make great strides since the magnitude 7.0 earthquake tore through Port-au-Prince, killing more than 230,000 people.\n\nWith $14 billion in aid pledged by foreign entities, those groups helped lower the number of people living in tents from 1.5 million to 85,000. They built thousands of new houses, brought a cholera outbreak under control and helped rebuild the Haitian police, schools and hospitals.\n\n\"I think Haiti's made about as much progress as one could reasonably expect given the enormous challenges there,\" said Thomas Adams, the U.S. State Department's special coordinator in Haiti. \"Obviously, we and the Haitian people would like for things to move faster, but the reality is, there are a lot of obstacles, and Haiti's got a lot of challenges.\"\n\nBut some fault aid groups for not being transparent about how they spent their money so it could be monitored.\n\n\"It would be incredibly useful to know where all this money was spent, what it was spent on, what lessons can be learned from this disaster to use that money better in the future,\" said Vijaya Ramachandran, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development.\n\nShe said fully opening the books on Haiti aid would be the best way to see what's worked and what's gone wrong.\n\nHaitians still struggle to explain the scene after the earthquake.\n\nHouses collapsed or slid down the steep mountain slopes that surround Port-au-Prince. Roads opened up. People were trapped under piles of concrete. Mass graves were dug in a hurry. And dozens of government buildings crumbled, including the presidential palace.\n\nThose who question the international response in those early days don't understand the magnitude of what happened, said Peter McNichol, the Haiti director for Concern Worldwide, an Irish humanitarian group.\n\n\"You take the number of people left homeless and the number killed, and that's the whole population of Dublin. That's one in three in New York,\" McNichol explained. \"If that scale of problem hit Dublin or New York, I'm sure there would be a lack of coordination, at least initially.\"\n\nRichard Lugar, a former Republican senator from Indiana who has focused on Haiti, said, \"A good amount of money has been spent, but much of it has had disappointing results.\"\n\nHe said many houses were poorly built after the earthquake and fell apart. \"Many of the villages and locations have really severe deficiencies,\" he said. \"The amount of poor construction and the lack of urban planning is evident.\"\n\nThe Haitian government created the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC) to be a clearinghouse for international projects. Former president Bill Clinton co-chaired the commission with Haiti's then prime minister, Jean-Max Bellerive.\n\nHaitians were a majority of the 29-member commission, but it ended up being dominated by the international members because they held the purse strings, said Marie Rosy Auguste Ducena, program manager at the National Human Rights Defense Council in Port-au-Prince.\n\nHaiti's slow recovery also reflected a lack of faith in the nation's government, which already had a long history of corruption and mismanagement, by the international community. Haiti was further hampered when the earthquake killed 16,000 government workers and destroyed much of its infrastructure.\n\nJohn Groarke, USAID's mission director for Haiti, said it made sense to work directly with foreign companies and aid groups after the quake since they were experienced and capable of doing the needed reconstruction. But he said it's now time to put more faith and aid into the Haitian government.\n\n\"In the near future you'll see more resources going to Haitian organizations and the Haitian government,\" Groarke said.\n\nHaiti's current political climate doesn't bode well for that possibility.\n\nHaitian President Michel Martelly and the parliament have not agreed on how to hold local elections, which have been delayed since 2011. The terms of 10 senators expire in mid-January. Without a resolution, parliament will be dissolved, meaning Martelly would rule by decree. Street protests have become so intense that Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe resigned Dec. 14.\n\n\"This political gridlock could scare off foreign investors,\" the State Department's Adams said. \"That's why it's so important that they get out of this.\"\n\nSome people said it's time for Haiti to solve its own problems.\n\nMarie Marthe Balin Paul, 78, saw the school that she and her husband built 40 years ago crumble in a matter of seconds after the quake. More than 100 people were killed, mostly adults learning to become teachers.\n\nBalin Paul was traumatized but quickly recovered. She opened a makeshift school on some land by her sister's house. She then moved into basic, wooden structures on the site of her school and used an $80,000 loan to recently open a new building.\n\n\"We are a people of workers, of fighters, but now they have cut off our hands with all this aid,\" she said, extending her arms with palms up. \"We should not teach children to receive things. Even if you are poor, you can fight.\"\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of Haitians still languish in tent cities.\n\nOlivier Junior, 29, lost his home and source of income, his moto-taxi, in the earthquake.

Hundreds of thousands were sickened and thousands died after drinking poisonous bootleg alcohol.\n\nIn a macabre twist on that history, one of the unintended consequences of marijuana legalization might be the new epidemic of lung illness associated with vaping bootleg cannabis oil. Six deaths have been linked to vaping, and hundreds of people have been sickened. Most have been teens and young adults. Most were vaping illegal THC oil.\n\nI have been covering the story of contaminated THC for The Marijuana Times since spring. The trail began in April with a $5 million cache of illegal cannabis vape cartridges seized by the sheriff of Mendocino County, California, in a region where the lion’s share of theblack market cannabis consumed by Americans is grown and processed.\n\nWeed toxic enough to kill\n\nSheriff Thomas Allman decided on a hunch to have the oil tested. The lab reported it was contaminated with a stew of pesticides and a particular fungicide that, when heated to more than 400 degrees, breaks down to release deadly hydrogen cyanide. For that reason, it is banned for use on tobacco in the United States and — in Canada, Washington, Oregon and Colorado — on marijuana. According to the lab, the concentration of that fungicide — myclobutanil — in the batch Allman had tested was 7,300 times the limit set by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation.\n\nThat was just one shipment. I wondered at the time how many black market batches had escaped interception, and whether the oil in those cartridges was as dangerous as it sounded. The answer could be upon us, and David Kurzfeld may have a key piece of evidence.\n\nContaminated cannabis is Kurzfeld’s bread and butter. He is one of four partners who own a highly specialized business in Willits, California. Modular Processing Systems cleans contaminated oil for licensed producers. Kurzfeld says some of the oil they have processed arrived so filthy with pesticides, fungicides and other toxins that “I wouldn’t dare get it on my skin, let alone vape it.”\n\nResearch lagging:Doctors and patients are flying blind as medical marijuana use rises\n\nKurzfeld, a fourth-generation Mendocino rancher and farmer, told me, “It’s common knowledge out here that if a legit grower has weed that won’t pass the state test for contaminants, they just sell it into the black market.”\n\nThese growers might be callous, but even if they were mindful they’d run into a paradox — you can’t have your illegal marijuana tested in a state licensed lab if you don’t have a state license to grow or handle marijuana.\n\nAs for the state inspectors responsible for monitoring such things on the ground, Kurzfeld says there are too few to even take reports about contamination, let alone investigate them: “For some reason they don’t last long. They either quit or get fired.”\n\nAmerica's pot experiment is failing\n\nWhile public health officials try to pinpoint the chemistry or mechanism causing vaping-associated pulmonary illness, it seems an appropriate moment to call out an inconvenient truth about marijuana legalization: America’s noble pot experiment is failing miserably.\n\nAs the largest producer of cannabis in the country, California ought to be setting the standard for oversight. Instead, cheap black market cannabis is so abundant, and scofflaws so bold, that a Los Angeles Times investigation in June found that more than half of that city’s 400 or so dispensaries were unlicensed pop-up shops, and that they proliferate faster than the police can shut them down. Less visible are the hundreds, if not thousands, of private delivery services and individual dealers of outlaw cannabis.\n\nVaping dangers:Unregulated vaping spawns new teenage nicotine addicts. And now adult vapers are dying.\n\nLegitimate growers, processors and retailers — with layers of regulatory and other expenses that make it impossible to compete on price — fume about lost sales. State officials in California and elsewhere who based their budgets on rosy predictions of marijuana tax revenue are scrambling to deal with shortfalls in the hundreds of millions. One study found that a dollar generated in cannabis taxes is far outweighed by health and other costs.\n\nMeanwhile, the black market is booming. New Frontier Data, which tracks cannabis sales and trends, estimated this spring that as much as 80% of the marijuana sold in California comes from the black market. In major urban markets like New York, the figure is certainly at least as high.\n\nRegulatory chaos breeds illegal market\n\nIn its 2018 annual report, the California Cannabis Advisory Committee cited “fragmented and uncoordinated” enforcement, which it said “is creating a thriving environment for the unregulated 'underground market.' ”\n\nMultiply all that by 50. Because marijuana is still illegal by federal law, each state has had to legislate and build its own regulatory scheme, with all the idiosyncrasies involved with local politics. Now build a wall around each state, because transportation of THC across state lines is a federal crime. Finally, give each municipality in each state the right to just say no to having a dispensary within its borders. It is a regulatory nightmare — “a s--t show,” in the words of Miriam Carrero, director of the lab at Modular Processing Systems.\n\nHarris Damashek, until recently chief branding officer for one of the largest legitimate cannabis marketers — Acreage Holdings — described the challenge thus: “Imagine if, to create a bottle of Coke, in each state you had to grow the sugar cane and you couldn’t use it in any other state; you had to process it within each state; you had to package it to meet each state’s regulations; and so on. ... It’s at least as complicated as the pharmaceutical industry.”\n\nWhatever the outcome of efforts to pinpoint the cause of this outbreak, it seems likely that the national embrace of cannabis-as-medicine, which seemed so inevitable just two months ago, may have to wait until consumers feel confident that the only thing in their weed is weed.\n\nFoster Winans is the senior editor of The Marijuana Times.

It was a typical scene at an all-inclusive five-star resort where foreigners from both sides of the equator flock to escape their cold winters.\n\nBut as he watched, the attorney noticed something disturbing.\n\n“They serve alcoholic drinks with alcohol of bad quality and in great amounts, mixing different types of drinks,” he wrote in his native Spanish.\n\nThat single paragraph, buried near the end of a four-page report summarizing how 20-year-old Conner drowned within a couple hours of arriving at the Iberostar Hotel & Resorts' Paraiso del Mar, offers a possible lead in the investigation into her death.\n\nAnd it could shed light on the circumstances surrounding numerous reports from others who have told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel they experienced sickness, blackouts and injuries after drinking at Iberostar and other resorts around Cancun and Playa del Carmen in recent months.\n\nRELATED: A Mexican vacation, a mysterious death, and now endless questions for Wisconsin family\n\nRELATED:U.S. State Department warns tourists about tainted alcohol at Mexico resorts after blackouts reported\n\nThey told the Journal Sentinel they believe they were drugged or the alcohol may have been tainted. They questioned how they could fall into a stupor so quickly. And whether they had been targeted.\n\nWas it robbery? In one case, two teenage brothers from Minnesota on vacation with their parents woke up covered in mud, with no shirts or shoes and their wallets and cellphones missing. They had gotten separated during the night. One had a severe rash all over his legs. Neither could remember what happened.\n\nSexual assault? One Wisconsin woman interviewed by the Journal Sentinel said she was assaulted while both she and her husband were unconscious — something supported by an exam done by her OB-GYN when she returned to Neenah. Her husband woke up with a broken hand — a “boxer’s break” that his doctor said likely resulted from hitting someone — but also no memory of what had happened.\n\nExtortion? In at least three cases, travelers reported that local hospitals, part of the Hospiten chain, appeared to be gouging them, demanding large sums of cash. One man was told to take a cab to an ATM. The vacationers suspected Iberostar might be in cahoots with the medical company. The resort contracts with Hospiten and refers sick and injured guests to Hospiten's facilities. Abbey Conner's family paid about $17,000 to a small medical clinic south of Playa del Carmen and within several hours paid tens of thousands more to a hospital in Cancun, north of the resort, where Abbey and her brother were transferred.\n\nOthers can find no motive for their suspected drugging.\n\nCould it be what the attorney for the Conner family alluded to in his report: All-inclusive resorts using cheap, bootleg booze to cut costs?\n\nA 2015 report from Mexico’s Tax Administration Service found that 43% of all the alcohol consumed in the nation is illegal, produced under unregulated circumstances resulting in potentially dangerous concoctions.\n\nThe national health authority in Mexico has seized more than 1.4 million gallons of adulterated alcohol since 2010 — not just from small local establishments, but from hotels and other entertainment areas, according to a 2017 report by the country's Federal Commission for Protection against Health Risks.\n\nPDF:English translation of 2017 report by Mexico's national health authority\n\nThe bootleg liquor could be infused with grain alcohol or dangerous concentrations of methanol, cheaper alternatives to producing ethanol, government reports warn.\n\nAnd the mixtures are capable of making people extremely sick.\n\nThe blackouts have happened to men and women, young and old, to singles and to couples, according to interviews with nearly a dozen travelers and family members whose loved ones died or were injured at the resorts, as well as hospital records, ambulance receipts, hotel correspondence and other documents.\n\nThey have happened at Iberostar’s property in Cancun and at the company's cluster of resorts 30 miles to the south in Playa del Carmen. And they've happened to guests at other all-inclusive resorts in the region, such as Secrets and the Grand Oasis.\n\nOften the vacationers report that they drank tequila, but in other cases it was rum, beer or another alcohol.\n\nSome said they had only a drink or two before losing consciousness and waking up hours later — with no recollection of how they got back to their rooms or to the hospital, or how they were injured.\n\nThose interviewed said the feeling of being drugged is far different than that of being drunk. They felt certain that whatever happened to them was caused by more than drinking too heavily.\n\nTerrifying is a word many used to describe it.\n\nNearly all reported that it happened within the first two days of their stay, with several opting to leave the resorts and head home before their planned departure — without receiving refunds.\n\nA spokeswoman for Spain-based Iberostar told the Journal Sentinel the company takes the health and safety of its guests seriously. A statement from Iberostar said the company's Mexican resorts book about 500,000 guests a year and that the company adheres to strict regulatory standards.\n\n\"We work with a host of providers not unique to IBEROSTAR who service other hotel chains and renowned brands,\" the statement says. \"Similarly, we only purchase sealed bottles that satisfy all standards required by the designated regulatory authorities.\"\n\n* * *\n\nIt is impossible to know the scope of the problem, since many of the incidents go uninvestigated. In several cases, travelers told the Journal Sentinel that staffers at Iberostar resorts would not call the police and said the guests should take a cab to the police department if they wanted to file a report.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State tallies deaths of U.S. citizens in foreign countries, but doesn’t always have many details. The agency doesn’t track how often people are drugged or otherwise injured.\n\nA search of the agency's data shows nearly 300 U.S. citizens have drowned in Mexico in the last decade, 39 last year alone. The database doesn't provide surrounding circumstances.\n\nDepartment officials would not comment on Conner’s death other than to say they “are aware of this case,” and to extend condolences to the family.\n\nAbbey Conner was on a family vacation with her mother, stepfather and brother in January and was found face down in the pool unconscious shortly after they arrived. She was brain dead, and a few days later was flown to Florida, where she was taken off life support.\n\nHer older brother, Austin, nearly drowned in the pool next to her. He suffered an injury to his forehead and a severe concussion. He doesn’t remember what happened.\n\nThe last thing he recalls is that he and his sister had four or five shots of tequila, then another shot with a group of people. When he regained consciousness, he was in an ambulance. Abbey was on life support.\n\nAbbey was later found to have a broken collar bone. It’s unclear what caused it. Experts say it’s possible it was cracked during CPR when hotel staff and a contracted doctor on site tried to resuscitate her, though such a fracture would be uncommon.\n\nAbbey's mother and stepfather, Ginny and John McGowan of Pewaukee, and her father, Bill Conner, who lives just south of Madison, have gotten few answers about what happened and little to no cooperation from the resort, police in Mexico or authorities in the U.S.\n\nIn Mexico, they took a cab to the police station, but were discouraged from filing a report.\n\nThey said the Iberostar resort has been nothing but an obstructionist. The resort has refused to allow the bartender and other employees or guests to be interviewed.\n\nAnd the U.S. State Department suggested there was nothing it could do to help.\n\nThe State Department’s latest notice on travel to Mexico, posted in December 2016, makes no mention of any concern for vacationers at all-inclusive resorts. Indeed it suggests they are relatively safe.\n\n“Resort areas and tourist destinations in Mexico generally do not see the level of drug-related violence and crime that are reported in the border region or in areas along major trafficking routes,” the notice says.\n\nTrusted websites such as TripAdvisor, Expedia and others have strict policies limiting what is allowed to be included in online customer reviews.\n\nSo while readers might learn that a resort's seafood isn’t fresh and the beds are too hard, they won’t typically hear that guests were assaulted on the property or that they believed a bartender slipped something in their drinks.\n\nWhen guests interviewed by the Journal Sentinel tried to describe what happened on those sites, they said their comments were rejected.\n\nThere is no central clearinghouse for that type of information.\n\nIt’s easy for those researching upcoming vacations to get a false sense of security, said Maureen Webster, who launched the site Mexicovacationawareness.com nearly 10 years ago, after her 22-year-old son, Nolan, drowned in the pool at a Mexican resort.\n\n“Every time, every single time, something bad happens, they (Mexican resorts and authorities) blame the victim,” Webster said. “They say ‘They were drunk, they were drunk, they were drunk, they were drunk.’ Every single time.\n\n“Shame on the (U.S.) government for not making this an issue,” she said. “It’s a big problem.”\n\nIn her son's case, Webster gathered statements from more than a dozen witnesses who were around the pool at the Grand Oasis in Cancun who said her son was not drunk. A Canadian nurse who was at the pool and came to his aid signed a statement saying resort officials forbid him from performing CPR on her son. Nolan was breathing at the time and hotel staff did nothing but watch him die, the nurse wrote.\n\nWebster, who lives outside Boston, sued the resort and later reached a settlement.\n\nKaren Smith, a long-time resident of New Jersey who now lives in Florida, has known Maureen Webster since 2013. That was the year Smith’s adult son, Brian Manucci, drowned in the same Grand Oasis pool where Nolan Webster died.\n\n“There’s no accountability,” said Smith. “Even if it’s overserving, they promote this risky behavior, but have no means to handle it when it occurs.\n\n“It’s just so mind boggling that something like this could occur, and it’s just like, ‘Oh well.’”\n\n***\n\nKathy and Jeff Daley and their neighbors in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, took their teenage children to the Iberostar Cancun in March 2016 for a little spring getaway. They were all in the pool around the swim-up bar.\n\nThe group had a round of tequila shots, the first drink of the day for Kathy.\n\nShe had been careful to stick with water throughout the day to stay hydrated. She didn’t care much for the shot, so when everyone else had another, she declined. The bartender offered her something else. Something special, he said. It was a mixed drink of some kind — she wasn’t sure what. She took a few sips.\n\nShe lost consciousness. The next thing she remembers is being in a hospital. Vomiting and disoriented.\n\nDoctors declared Kathy, 53, to be very intoxicated and dehydrated.\n\nHospital workers told Jeff they needed to collect $2,000 cash for her visit. When he said he didn’t carry that kind of money, they said they would take a taxi with him to an ATM.\n\nIt was around 8 or 9 p.m. and Jeff refused to go out with a stranger at night to get cash. He insisted they accept his credit card if they wanted immediate payment.\n\nJeff, an advanced emergency medical technician, said the way the resort and hospital handled his wife's care could have killed her. He said the hotel doctor resisted calling an ambulance and charged them $139 before he would let them leave in the ambulance. The defibrillator in the ambulance had no battery and nobody seemed to know how to get oxygen hooked up.\n\nMedical records from Hospiten Cancun show Kathy’s blood alcohol level was 0.02, well below the 0.08 considered by many states in the U.S. to be legally impaired.\n\nHospital workers later reported to the Daleys' travel insurance company that aside from being inebriated, they found drugs in her system — though the records they provided to the Daleys show drug tests were “in progress” and don’t include any results.\n\nKathy Daley said she takes two low-dose prescription medications that she’s taken for years and has never had a reaction from having a drink or two. Those would be the only drugs that should be in her system, she told them.\n\nCredit card receipts show the hospital charged the Daleys $1,256. That didn’t include the ambulance.\n\nWhen Kathy tried to post a review on TripAdvisor warning travelers about what happened, a TripAdvisor representative told her in an email that it didn't meet the guidelines. Daley's review did not contain profanity. It included a couple sentences that recounted what a bartender said to her daughter as well as what her husband and friends did when they saw her struggling.\n\nTripAdvisor labeled it hearsay.\n\n\"If you'd be willing to edit and resubmit your review, we'd really appreciate it,\" the email from TripAdvisor stated.\n\nTara Lieberman, a TripAdvisor spokeswoman, told the Journal Sentinel the company has guidelines stating that \"every review must be unbiased, family friendly, based on a first-hand experience, and relevant to other travelers.\"\n\nShe said about 390 million travelers consult the website and mobile app every month when scoping out travel plans.\n\n***\n\nIn February, Nancy Mahowald Nelson and her family traveled from Bayport, Minn., to the Iberostar Cozumel resort, on an island east of Playa del Carmen.\n\nIt was Super Bowl Sunday and Nelson, 57, and her husband were watching their young grandchildren by the pool that morning. Her son and daughter-in-law took over and Nancy and her husband went to the swim-up bar. It was just after lunch. Two drinks. That was it.\n\nShe woke a few hours later to see blood on her bed sheets and her husband standing nearby. When she asked what had happened, he told her she had been very drunk and had fallen and scraped her knee. He and another man had to help walk her back to the room.\n\n\"I really thought 'Gosh, I’ve got a problem,'\" she said. \"I internalized it. I thought, 'Wow, what is wrong with me?' I was just more embarrassed, hoping my son and daughter-in-law didn't see me in that condition. I'm there looking after the kids. What the heck?\n\n\"It was really weird.\"\n\n***\n\nRick and Diana Neuenschwander spent their Fourth of July at Secrets Akumal resort just south of Playa del Carmen a few weeks ago. The Cincinnati couple, both in their mid-50s, were happy to have some quiet time, since both were gearing up for new jobs.\n\nThey put some floaties in the pool and spent the afternoon sipping margaritas. Around 4 p.m. or so, Rick ordered another round. He remembers how he and Diana commented that each of the drinks were different colors. They both tasted each one.\n\nFour hours later, they woke up in their room and found hotel staff in the room with them. No recollection of how they got there. No idea what went on during that time.\n\nThe Neuenschwanders didn’t think they were robbed or assaulted — though they weren’t certain about the latter.\n\nRick had some scrapes on his head and nose that he didn’t know where they came from. Diana had faint bruises on her shoulders and felt like at some point she had been held down, he said.\n\nThey left the resort the next day.\n\n“Yes, we had been drinking at the pool, but the fact that we both blacked out at the same time and woke up at about the same time, that’s pretty crazy,\" Neuenschwander said. \"You don’t do that, that doesn’t happen.”\n\nHe feels certain they were drugged.\n\n“Can you go to Las Vegas and experience this same thing?\" he said. \"Yes, but it seems to me it’s a big cover-up; it’s swept under the rug.”\n\nRepresentatives of Secrets could not be reached for comment.\n\n* * *\n\nJamie Valeri remembers trying to scream. But no sound came out of her mouth — as far as she knows.\n\nValeri and her husband of 13 years were not conscious. They were in their hotel room at Iberostar's Paraiso Maya, in the same array of resorts where Abbey and Austin Conner would wind up in a pool two years later.\n\nIt was 2015 and the Valeris were there to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Over the course of a couple hours, they had a few drinks on the beach — three each, to be exact.\n\nThen they blacked out.\n\nJamie Valeri recalls vomiting and being on a cold tile floor. And she remembers being sexually assaulted. She couldn't see or hear anything. But she could feel what was happening. She was in pain and wanted to fight, but her body was paralyzed.\n\n\"I thought I was dying,\" she said. \"I couldn't get out of whatever state of mind I was in ... I remember thinking, 'How are my six kids going to find out and what's going to happen to them?'\"\n\nRick doesn't recall anything. All he knows for certain is that his hand was broken when he woke up. Not from a fall, but from hitting something, or more likely — according to his doctor — someone.\n\nWhen the Wisconsin couple reported to resort officials they believed they had been drugged, they were told they would have to go to the police department themselves if they wanted to file a complaint.\n\nHotel staffers encouraged them to go the hospital and to take cash.\n\nJamie was afraid to do either. They stayed in their room until it was time to leave two days later.\n\n“If that could happen to us inside a resort that we paid to be at, I could only imagine what could have happened to us outside,” Jamie said. “I was terrified.”\n\nBoth were seen by doctors when they returned to Neenah. Medical and other records support their story.\n\n“Never in my wildest dreams did I think that in my 30s, and my husband in his 40s — he’s 6-3, 220 pounds — we would be sitting at a five-star resort, that there was ever a possibility not only that we could be drugged, but that any harm could come to me.\n\n\"How could that happen?”\n\nJohn Diedrich of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report.\n\nRaquel Rutledge is an investigative reporter.

Colorful pills drive new warnings about ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new wave of concern has spread across the United States over multi-colored “rainbow fentanyl” pills, powders and blocks – that look similar to candy or sidewalk chalk – being sold and used in several states, and potentially posing a threat to young people.\n\nBut parents of young children should not overly panic, and the emergence of this new product is one small part of the larger ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nRainbow fentanyl comes in bright colors and can be used in the form of pills or powder that contain illicit fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, making them extremely addictive and potentially deadly if someone overdoses while trying to achieve a high off of the drugs.\n\nThis multi-colored fentanyl may appeal to young people or fool them into thinking it’s safe, but experts say illicit fentanyl has been hiding in what appears to be other products for a long time, and fentanyl is fentanyl – it’s all dangerous, rainbow or not.\n\n“Colored fentanyl pills have been around for a few years. Typically, they’ve been blue pills labeled ‘M30’ to counterfeit oxycodone, which is a much weaker opioid,” Joseph Palamar, an associate professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone Health, who has studied trends in illicit fentanyl, said in an email to CNN.\n\n“I think the big difference people are concerned about is with regard to accidental ingestion. People are worried that their kids will take one of these pills thinking they’re another drug or even thinking they’re some sort of candy,” Palamar said. “I don’t think the color of the pills greatly increases danger to people who don’t use fentanyl, but there is always a possibility of someone who uses fentanyl leaving their pills around in the reach of children.”\n\nHe added, “We need to keep in mind that these pills cost money so people aren’t going to be throwing them on the ground for kids to find. I don’t think people will be giving these pills out as Halloween candy.”\n\nWhere rainbow fentanyl warning originated\n\nThe US Drug Enforcement Administration released a warning in August advising the public of this “alarming emerging trend” of “colorful fentanyl available across the United States.”\n\nAt the time, the agency said that it and its law enforcement partners seized the brightly colored fentanyl and fentanyl pills across 18 states. Fentanyl remains the deadliest drug threat facing the nation, according to the DEA.\n\nBut the DEA did not specify in its announcement whether rainbow fentanyl had led to overdoses or deaths among young people.\n\n“Rainbow fentanyl – fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes, and sizes – is a deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults,” DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in the August announcement.\n\nSince then, some colleges and universities are cautioning students about the presence and dangers of rainbow fentanyl, and the California Department of Public Health has alerted K-12 school administrators in the state about rainbow fentanyl being “a new trend.”\n\nAt Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, physicians have been seeing more fentanyl exposures among both young children and adolescents, Dr. Sam Wang, the hospital’s pediatric toxicologist, told CNN on Friday. While he and his colleagues are aware of rainbow fentanyl warnings, he hasn’t heard any patients or parents mention it.\n\nAfter all, the bottom line, he said, is that fentanyl is fentanyl, whether it comes in the form of rainbow-colored pills or simply a white powder.\n\n“It’s just coming out in a different form to potentially be more attractive, more quote unquote ‘fun’ to use because it looks potentially fun to take,” said Wang, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nAnd when young people use illicit drugs, they sometimes don’t know what they really contain, or how dangerous those substances might be.\n\nWhen it comes to rainbow fentanyl, “the fentanyl itself is going to be the same issue as the counterfeit pharmaceutical fentanyl. We don’t know how much is in it – it can vary. We don’t know the type of fentanyl,” Wang said. “And so those concerns transmit, still, over to this product. It’s just now this looks like it has a potential danger for young children and then also, it’s going to be more attractive for people to use and have consequences from that.”\n\nThe rise of fentanyl\n\nThe United States has been facing an opioid overdose epidemic – and waves of opioid overdose deaths – for decades, starting with a rise in prescription opioid overdose deaths in the early 2000s, followed by a rise in heroin overdose deaths beginning in 2010 and, most recently, a rise in synthetic opioid overdose deaths that started in 2013, fueled by potent fentanyl.\n\nPharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid intended to help patients, such as those with cancer, manage severe pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and typically prescribed in the form of skin patches or lozenges. But most recent cases of fentanyl-related harm, overdose, and death in the United States are linked to illegally made fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe latest data suggest that annual drug overdose deaths have jumped 44% from before the Covid-19 pandemic. There were about 76,000 deaths reported in the 12-month period ending March 2020. The CDC’s latest provisional data show that more than 109,000 people in the United States died of a drug overdose in the 12-month period ending March 2022.\n\nSynthetic opioids, including fentanyl, were involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths in the year ending March 2022. Deaths involving synthetic opioids increased by a staggering 80% over the past two years, CDC data shows.\n\nRainbow fentanyl has been receiving attention due to the bright colors of the products, but the illicit fentanyl that the products contain represents a continuation of the ongoing opioid epidemic. The only difference between rainbow fentanyl and the fentanyl products of the past appears to be the coloring.\n\n“The reason it’s colored is just to differentiate products. If we had a regulated market, they would be differentiated in different ways – we do not. It has nothing to do with marketing to kids at all, period, whatsoever,” said Maya Doe Simkins, co-founder of the Opioid Safety and Naloxone Network and co-director of Remedy Alliance, a collection of harm reduction groups that work to make naloxone more accessible.\n\nSimkins likened the different colors of rainbow fentanyl to how people used food coloring in heroin in the past, and she said the colors are sometimes used to differentiate batches.\n\n“It’s just a differentiation between your product, my product or this batch and the next batch,” she said.\n\nIncreasing fentanyl seizures\n\nIllicit fentanyl has long been hiding in drugs, and its presence appears to be on the rise.\n\nA study, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence in May, found that the number of fentanyl-containing powder and pills seized by law enforcement in the United States rose between 2018 and 2021.\n\nThe weight of powder fentanyl seizures increased from 298.2 kilograms in 2018 to 2,416 kilograms in 2021, and the number of pills seized increased from 42,202 in 2018 to 2,089,186 in 2021, according to the study, of which Palamar was the lead author.\n\n“We found that not only has fentanyl seizures been increasing, but the proportion of pills seized to overall fentanyl seizures has been increasing. The proportion of pill seizures increased from 14% in early 2018 to 29% in late 2021,” Palamar wrote in his email to CNN.\n\n“We don’t have information regarding what these seized pills were purported to be, but we think many were disguised as oxycodone or even Xanax,” he wrote. “Seizures of these counterfeit pills have been increasing at a rapid rate, suggesting increasing availability, and availability is going to continue to increase.”\n\nWith this increase, counterfeit pills have been more difficult to identify, but Palamar said that people can use test strips to detect traces of illicit fentanyl if they have concerns.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“People can purchase fentanyl test strips for as little as a dollar. Most of these strips are meant for urine testing but they can detect the presence of fentanyl if used correctly,” Palamar wrote.\n\n“I highly recommend that anyone who plans to use an illegally purchased pill or an illegal powder like cocaine test the drug before using,” he added. “There are also hundreds of newer fentanyl analogs and other opioids that can be very dangerous that test strips can’t detect. I do worry that test strips will give some people a false sense of security, but they’re something.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/health/ultraprocessed-foods-cancer-early-death-wellness/index.html", "title": "Ultraprocessed foods linked to cancer and early death, studies find ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nEating a lot of ultraprocessed foods significantly increases men’s risk of colorectal cancer and can lead to heart disease and early death in both men and women, according to two new, large-scale studies of people in the United States and Italy published Wednesday in British medical journal The BMJ.\n\nUltraprocessed foods include prepackaged soups, sauces, frozen pizza, ready-to-eat meals and pleasure foods such as hot dogs, sausages, french fries, sodas, store-bought cookies, cakes, candies, doughnuts, ice cream and many more.\n\n“Literally hundreds of studies link ultra-processed foods to obesity, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and overall mortality,” said Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University and author of numerous books on food politics and marketing, including 2015’s “Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning).”\n\n“These two studies continue the consistency: Ultraprocessed foods are unambiguously associated with an increased risk for chronic disease,” said Nestle, who was not involved in either study.\n\nA link to cancer\n\nThe US-based study examined the diets of over 200,000 men and women for up to 28 years and found a link between ultraprocessed foods and colorectal cancer – the third most diagnosed cancer in the US – in men, but not women.\n\nProcessed and ultraprocessed meats, such as ham, bacon, salami, hotdogs, beef jerkey and corned beef, have long been associated with a higher risk of bowel cancer in both men and women, according to the World Health Organization, American Cancer Society and the American Institute for Cancer Research.\n\nThe new study, however, found that all types of ultraprocessed foods played a role to some degree.\n\n“We found that men in the highest quintile of ultraprocessed food consumption, compared those in the lowest quintile, had a 29% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer,” said co-senior author Fang Fang Zhang, a cancer epidemiologist and chair of the division of nutrition epidemiology and data science at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University in Boston.\n\nThat association remained even after researchers took into account a person’s body mass index or dietary quality.\n\nWhy didn’t the new study find the same risk for colorectal cancer in women?\n\n“Reasons for such a sex difference are still unknown, but may involve the different roles that obesity, sex hormones, and metabolic hormones play in men versus women,” Zhang said.\n\n“Alternatively, women may have chosen ‘healthier’ ultraprocessed foods,” said Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study did find that eating a “higher consumption of ultraprocessed dairy foods – such as yogurt – was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in women,” Zhang said. “Some ultraprocessed foods are healthier, such as whole-grain foods that contain little or no added sugars, and yogurt and dairy foods.”\n\nWomen did have a higher risk for colorectal cancer if they consumed more ready-to-eat-or-heat dishes such as pizza, she said. However, men were more likely to have a higher risk of bowel cancer if they ate a lot of meat, poultry, or seafood-based ready-to-eat products and sugar-sweetened beverages, Zhang said.\n\n“Americans consume a large percentage of their daily calories from ultraprocessed foods – 58% in adults and 67% in children,” she added. “We should consider substituting the ultraprocessed foods with unprocessed or minimally processed foods in our diet for cancer prevention and prevention of obesity and cardiovascular diseases.”\n\nA link to early death\n\nThe second study followed more than 22,000 people for a dozen years in the Molise region of Italy. The study, which began in March 2005, was designed to assess risk factors for cancer as well as heart and brain disease.\n\nAnalysis published in The BMJ compared the role of nutrient-poor foods – such as foods high in sugar and saturated or trans-fats – versus ultraprocessed foods in the development of chronic disease and early death. Researchers found that both types of foods independently increased the risk of an early death, especially from cardiovascular diseases.\n\nHowever, when researchers compared the two types of food to see which contributed the most, they discovered that ultra-processed foods were “paramount to define the risk of mortality,” said first author Marialaura Bonaccio, an epidemiologist at the department of epidemiology and prevention at the IRCCS Neurologico Mediterraneo Neuromed of Pozzilli, Italy.\n\nIn fact, over 80% of the foods classified by the guidelines followed in the study as nutritionally unhealthy were also ultraprocessed, said Bonaccio in a statement.\n\n“This suggests that the increased risk of mortality is not due directly (or exclusively) to the poor nutritional quality of some products, but rather to the fact that these foods are mostly ultraprocessed,” Bonaccio added.\n\nNot real foods\n\nWhy are ultraprocessed foods so bad for us? For one, they are “ready-to-eat-or-heat industrial formulations that are made with ingredients extracted from foods or synthesized in laboratories, with little or no whole foods,” Zhang told CNN.\n\nThese overly processed foods are often high in added sugars and salt, low in dietary fiber, and full of chemical additives, such as artificial colors, flavors or stabilizers.\n\n“While some ultraprocessed foods may be considered healthier than others, in general, we would recommend staying away from ultra-processed foods completely and focus on healthy unprocessed foods – fruits, vegetables, legumes,” Mendelsohn said.\n\nIn 2019, the National Institute of Health (NIH) published the results of a controlled clinical trial comparing a processed and unprocessed diet. Researchers found those on the ultraprocessed diet ate at a faster rate – and ate an additional 500 calories more per day than people who were eating unprocessed foods.\n\n“On average, participants gained 0.9 kilograms, or 2 pounds while they were on the ultraprocessed diet and lost an equivalent amount on the unprocessed diet,” the NIH noted.\n\n“There is clearly something about ultraprocessed foods that makes people eat more of them without necessarily wanting to or realizing.” said Nestle.\n\n“The effects of ultraprocessed foods are quite clear. The reasons for the effects are not yet known,” Nestle continued. “It would be nice to know why, but until we find out, it’s best to advise eating ultraprocessed foods in as small amounts as possible.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/alcohol-by-age-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Global study finds surprising results for alcohol consumption", "text": "Editor’s Note: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\n\nCNN —\n\nNo amount of alcohol is healthy if you are younger than 40, mostly due to alcohol-related deaths by auto accidents, injury and homicide, according to a new global study.\n\nIf you are 40 or older without underlying health conditions, however, the new research found small amounts of alcohol might reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and diabetes.\n\n“Those diseases just happen to be major causes of death in a good chunk of the world,” said senior author Emmanuela Gakidou, professor of health metrics sciences at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine.\n\n“So when you look at the cumulative health impact, particularly among older adults, it shows that a small amount is actually better for you than no drinking. For all other causes, it’s harmful at all levels of consumption.”\n\nIndeed, the study found no protective effect for diseases such as tuberculosis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, liver disease, epilepsy, pancreatitis and many cancers.\n\n“Alcohol guidelines, both global ones and national ones, have typically emphasized the difference between consumption level for men compared to women,” Gakidou said. “What our work suggests is that global guidelines, national guidelines and local guidelines would be more effective if they emphasize age as opposed to sex.”\n\nThe findings underscore “the importance of alcohol recommendations that are tailored to specific regions and populations,” Amanda Berger, vice president of science and health for the trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, told CNN in an email.\n\n“Importantly, no one should drink alcohol to obtain potential health benefits, and some individuals should not drink at all.”\n\nYounger than 40 found at highest risk\n\nThe report, released Thursday in the journal Lancet, is the first to report alcohol risk by global geographical region, age, sex and year, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which prepared the study.\n\nThe analysis looked at 30 years of data on people ages 15 to 95 from 204 countries and territories gathered by the institute’s Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, which tracks premature death and disability from over 300 diseases.\n\nThe analysis estimated that 1.34 billion people around the world consumed harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020. More than 59% of the people who drank unsafe amounts of alcohol were between 15 and 39. Over two-thirds were men.\n\nIn every geographic region, the study found drinking alcohol does not provide any health benefits to people under age 40 but does raise the risk of injury, such as motor vehicle accidents, suicides and homicides.\n\nThe study defined a standard drink as 10 grams of pure alcohol, which might be a small 3.4-fluid ounce (100 milliliters) glass of red wine, a 12-fluid ounce (355 milliliters) standard can or bottle of beer (3.5% alcohol) or a 1-fluid ounce shot of spirits (30 milliliters) that is 40% alcohol by volume.\n\nConclusions criticized\n\nWhile praising the analysis as well-conducted, some experts not involved with the research expressed concern about the study’s conclusions.\n\nStatistics show there are “over 14 times as many alcohol-attributable deaths in the UK among 70-74 year-olds than 20-24 year olds,” said Colin Angus, a senior research fellow at the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the UK’s University of Sheffield, in a statement. The data “contradicts the assertion in this new study that we should focus on the drinking of younger age groups,” Angus said.\n\n“The elephant in the room with this study is the interpretation of risk based on outcomes for cardiovascular disease – particularly in older people,” said Dr. Tony Rao, visiting clinical research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London.\n\n“We know that any purported health benefits from alcohol on the heart and circulation are balanced out by the increased risk from other conditions such as cancer, liver disease and mental disorders such as depression and dementia,” Rao said in a statement.\n\nA study published in March found just one pint of beer or glass of wine a day can shrink the overall volume of the brain, with the damage increasing as the number of daily drinks rises. On average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank half of a beer.\n\nResearch in the US has shown drinking among adults rose during pandemic, particularly among women, with “a 41% increase in heavy drinking days,” said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, medical director of the Substance Use Disorders Initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nA study published in June found many moderate drinkers over age 30 binge on the weekend – defined as five or more drinks in a row or within a short period of time. Drinking an average of more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men – or five or more drinks on the same occasion – was linked to alcohol problems nine years later.\n\nWomen are especially sensitive to the effects of alcohol, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or NIAA. Alcohol-related problems appear sooner and at lower drinking levels than in men, it said.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to alcohol-related brain damage and heart disease than men, and studies show women who have one drink a day increase their risk of breast cancer by 5% to 9% compared with those who abstain.\n\n“The recommendation that those under 40 should not drink at all is totally unrealistic,” Matt Lambert, CEO of the Portman Group, an industry-funded group that regulates alcohol marketing in the UK, said in an email.\n\nGakidou, the study’s senior author, admitted that “it’s not realistic to think young adults will stop drinking. Still, we think it’s important to communicate the latest evidence so that everyone can make informed decisions about their health.”\n\nFor those over age 65, any increase in drinking is worrisome because many older adults “use medications that can interact with alcohol, have health conditions that can be exacerbated by alcohol, and may be more susceptible to alcohol-related falls and other accidental injuries,” the NIAA said.\n\n“There is a high threshold for being able to say that alcohol is an effective prevention therapy, and the studies so far do not reach that threshold. If they did, then you can be sure that the drinks industry would be applying to the FDA for a license,” said Dr. Nick Sheron, a professor in the hepatology department at the UK’s University of Southampton.\n\n‘A more detailed and nuanced analysis’\n\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation last published a report on alcohol four years ago when it analyzed 2016 Global Burden of Disease data on people 15 to 49, finding no amount of liquor, wine or beer was safe for overall health.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“What we have done in this new study is a more detailed and nuanced analysis of 21 different world regions,” Gakidou said. “What we’ve been able to do now is break it down: Who is alcohol harmful for? Who is alcohol beneficial to? That’s why the message is coming across as different, but it is actually consistent with what we said before.\n\n“If you ask me, ‘Will the message be different in 10 years?’ Maybe. It is likely new evidence will come out,” she said. “That may change our thinking.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}]}

Doug Ducey of Arizona on Wednesday signed two bills into law targeting transgender youth in the state, including one that restricts access to gender-affirming health care for minors.\n\nDucey’s approval of the health care ban, as well as a law prohibiting transgender athletes from competing on women’s and girls’ sports teams at some schools in the state, comes as GOP-led states are pushing laws that opponents say further marginalize members of the transgender community. Oklahoma’s Republican governor approved a similar sports ban earlier Wednesday.\n\n“A physician may not provide irreversible gender reassignment surgery to any individual who is under eighteen years of age,” reads the text of SB 1138, the health care ban. The bill makes some exceptions, including in the case of someone born intersex.\n\nArizona is the latest state to enact such a measure. Last year, Republican lawmakers in Arkansas overrode a veto from their governor to put their own health care ban on the books, and Tennessee has passed a similar ban.\n\n“SB 1138 delays any irreversible gender reassignment surgery until the age of 18,” the governor wrote in a letter announcing his decision to sign the legislation. “The reason is simple, and common sense – this is a decision that will dramatically affect the rest of an individual’s life, including the ability of that individual to become a biological parent later in life.”\n\nThe two measures are part of a larger movement by conservative lawmakers to impose restrictions on the lives of transgender youth in the US. LGBTQ advocates have strongly opposed such bans, arguing they further marginalize a vulnerable community and could cause serious harm to a group that suffers from uniquely high rates of suicide.\n\nAdvocates tore into Ducey for signing the pair of bills into law, noting in their criticism that his signatures came a day before the observance of International Transgender Day of Visibility. The day aims to celebrate the achievements of transgender rights activists and to increase awareness of ongoing challenges transgender and gender-nonconforming people ​face.\n\n“Today alone, on the eve of Transgender Day of Visibility, three anti-trans bills were signed into law across the country,” said Sam Ames, director of advocacy and government affairs at the Trevor Project, a nonprofit that works to prevent suicide among LGBTQ youth.\n\n“This onslaught is not an accident; it is overwhelming by design and in direct response to progress in the fight for trans rights. But the Trevor Project will continue supporting our young people while we continue the fight against these policies,” Ames added in a statement.\n\nAdvocates have already vowed to challenge Arizona’s health care ban in court, with the American Civil Liberties Union saying in a tweet: “The government can’t violate our rights without a fight. We … will see you in court.”\n\nThe group sued Arkansas over its ban last year, and in July, a federal judge temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the law.\n\nFifth sports ban this year\n\nThe sports ban in Arizona, meanwhile, applies to teams “sponsored by a public school or a private school whose students or teams compete against a public school.” The law says that athletic teams or sports “designated for ‘females,’ ‘women’ or ‘girls’ may not be open to students of the male sex” across the state.\n\n“Every young Arizona athlete should have the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities that give them a sense of belonging and allow them to grow and thrive,” Ducey said in his letter Wednesday, adding that the bill would ensure “that the girls and young women who have dedicated themselves to their sport do not miss out on hard-earned opportunities including their titles, standings and scholarships due to unfair competition.”\n\nThe law makes Arizona the fifth state to enact an anti-transgender sports ban this year. The debate over the inclusion of transgender athletes, particularly women and girls, has become a political flashpoint, especially among conservatives.\n\nAdvocates of such measures have argued that transgender women and girls have physical advantages ​over cisgender women and girls in sports. But a 2017 report in the journal Sports Medicine that reviewed several related studies found “no direct or consistent research” that suggests transgender people have an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers, and critics say such legislation adds to the discrimination that transgender people face, particularly transgender youth.\n\nWhile the Arizona law mentions “biological sex,” it doesn’t define what that means. Similar bills in other states have stipulated that “biological sex” is defined as the sex marked on a student’s original birth certificate.\n\nWhile sex is a category that refers broadly to physiology, a person’s gender is an innate sense of identity. The factors that go into determining the sex listed on a birth certificate may include anatomy, genetics and hormones, and there is broad natural variation in each of these categories. For this reason, critics have said the language of “biological sex,” as used in the sports ban legislation, is overly simplistic and misleading.\n\nSo far this year, GOP governors in Oklahoma, Iowa and South Dakota have enacted similar sports bans. Last week, Republican governors in Indiana and Utah vetoed transgender sports bans in their states, saying the measures were unnecessary. Lawmakers in Utah, however, later overrode their governor’s veto to enact the measure. In 2021, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia enacted similar sports bans.\n\nOpponents of such bans have had limited legal success in fighting the measures. Last year, a federal judge temporarily blocked West Virginia’s enforcement of its ban after advocates for the athletes sued the state, with the judge saying he had “been provided with scant evidence that this law addresses any problem at all, let alone an important problem.” And in 2020, a federal judge blocked Idaho’s enforcement of its sports ban.", "authors": ["Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/13/us/texas-supreme-court-overturns-transgender-investigations/index.html", "title": "Texas can continue investigating families seeking gender-affirming ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter a pause on investigations of families seeking gender-affirming care for their transgender children, the Texas Supreme Court said the state’s child protective services investigations can continue while an appeals process plays out on the merits of the case.\n\nThe opinion released Friday still restricts the state from investigating the so-called “Doe” family, which brought forward a lawsuit against the state in March after the family was investigated by the Department of Family and Protective Services for seeking care for their trans teen.\n\nAnd significantly, the opinion also denied that Gov. Greg Abbott had any legal authority or power to order DFPS to investigate these families in the first place.\n\nA legal battle began when state Attorney General Ken Paxton, in late February, declared gender-affirming surgical procedures for children and prescribing drugs that affect puberty to be considered child abuse. In response to Paxton’s legal opinion, Abbott directed the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) “to conduct a prompt and thorough investigation of any reported instances of these abusive procedures in the State of Texas.”\n\nGender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that uses a multidisciplinary approach to help a person transition from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender – the gender by which one wants to be known.\n\nIn March, a district court judge in Austin blocked the state from enforcing Abbott’s directive by issuing a temporary injunction. The judge said Abbott’s order was “beyond the scope of his authority and unconstitutional,” and a trial was set for July.\n\nThe state immediately challenged the statewide freeze on investigations but lost at Texas’ Third District Court of Appeals. While the appeals process continues to play out on the merits of the case, the question of whether the state could continue investigations during the legal battle made its way to the high court, prompting Friday’s opinion.\n\nNine alleged abuse investigations of minors receiving gender-affirming health care were opened by state, Patrick Crimmins, a Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) spokesman, confirmed to CNN in March.\n\n“Just secured a win for families against the gender ideology of doctors, big pharma, clinics trying to ‘trans’ confused, innocent children. SCOTX green-lighted investigations that lower Dem courts froze,” Paxton tweeted Friday. “‘Transing’ kids through surgery/drugs is abuse & I’ll do all I can to stop it.”\n\nIn the new ruling, the Texas Supreme Court also argued that Abbott’s directive to DFPS “cites no legal authority” and doesn’t legally bind DFPS to follow his directive, unlike some of his other executive orders. The court, in its opinion, also affirmed that Paxton’s opinion does not alter pre-existing law or legal obligations of DFPS.\n\n“The State does not contend in this Court that the Governor’s letter formally changed the legal obligations of DFPS, of parents in Texas, or of medical professionals in Texas. Nor does it contend that the Attorney General’s opinion did so,” the opinion states.\n\nIf DFPS decides to resume investigations of families other than the Doe family, then “it’s still our position to do so would be unlawful,” Paul Castillo, senior counsel at Lambda Legal who represents the Doe family, told CNN on Friday.\n\nThe parties in the Doe lawsuit are set to make their arguments before the appellate court this month and in June, according to Castillo.\n\nDFPS is reviewing the ruling and has “no immediate comment beyond that,” said spokeswoman Marissa Gonzales.\n\nMore than 58,000 transgender youth 13 and older across the US are facing restricted access or proposals, and could soon lose access to gender-affirming care, according to UCLA’s Williams Institute, which conducts independent research on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy.\n\nRepublican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed two bills into law targeting transgender youth in the state, including one that restricts access to gender-affirming health care for minors.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health advised against any gender-affirming care for children and adolescents in guidelines released in April.\n\nLast year, Republican lawmakers in Arkansas overrode a veto from their governor to put their own health care ban on the books, and Tennessee has passed a similar ban.", "authors": ["Alisha Ebrahimji Ashley Killough Raja Razek", "Alisha Ebrahimji", "Ashley Killough", "Raja Razek"], "publish_date": "2022/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/politics/red-states-abortion-lgbtq-critical-race-theory/index.html", "title": "Abortion, LGBTQ rights and more: A roundup of controversial red ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRepublican-led states around the country have enacted a flurry of new restrictions on abortion, LGBTQ and transgender youth rights, and discussion of critical race theory.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the legislation that has passed this session, what’s next for the bills and what else is under consideration. The wave of activity on the state level comes ahead of a highly anticipated ruling by the US Supreme Court expected later this year that could have major implications for abortion.\n\nNew abortion restrictions\n\nFlorida – Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a measure into law on April 14 that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy without exemptions for rape, incest or human trafficking. The bill allows exemptions in cases where pregnancy poses “serious” health risks or fatal fetal abnormalities are detected if two physicians confirm the diagnoses in writing. What’s next: The American Civil Liberties Union is promising to “take swift legal action” to challenge the law before it goes into effect on July 1.\n\nKentucky – The GOP-controlled state legislature overrode Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto of a sweeping abortion bill on April 13 that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, restricts access to medication abortion and makes it more difficult for a minor to obtain an abortion in the state. The legislation does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest. What’s next: The ACLU and Planned Parenthood have filed lawsuits in federal court, arguing the law violates the Constitution.\n\nOklahoma – Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a near-total ban on abortion into law on April 12, making exceptions only in the case of medical emergencies. It would make performing an abortion or attempting to perform the procedure a felony punishable by up to 10 years in state prison or a $100,000 fine, or both. The legislation would not provide exceptions in cases of rape and incest. What’s next: The law takes effect 90 days after the state legislature adjourns in May.\n\nTennessee – The Republican-led state House passed a bill on Thursday that would allow only physicians to provide drugs used in medication abortions and bar the drugs from being sent via mail. The legislation, House Bill 2416, would establish criminal penalties and civil liability for offenders that would not apply to the patient who was provided the abortion drugs. It would also require physicians to examine patients in person before providing the abortion drugs and to schedule follow-up visits for the patients. What’s next: The bill now heads to the state Senate, where Republican lawmakers also have a majority.\n\nWest Virginia – The GOP-controlled state House passed a bill on February 15 banning abortion after 15 weeks, except in a medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality. It provides no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Republican Gov. Jim Justice also signed a bill on March 21 that would ban abortion if a pregnant person is seeking the procedure because the fetus has been diagnosed with or presumed to have a disability. The bill goes into effect in June and provides exceptions in medical emergencies or if the fetus is “nonmedically viable.” What’s next: The 15-week abortion ban bill is now with the state Senate, where its passage would send it to Justice’s desk.\n\nIdaho – Republican Gov. Brad Little signed a bill modeled after the Texas law that bans abortions after embryonic or fetal cardiac activity has been detected, making Idaho the first state to follow the controversial Texas statute that allows private citizens to enforce the restrictions with lawsuits. What’s next: The Idaho Supreme Court on April 8 temporarily blocked the law ahead of its April 22 implementation.\n\nArizona – Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed into law legislation that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, except in some cases of medical emergency – becoming the first state this year to enact a ban after 15 weeks, following a similar law Mississippi passed in 2018 that the US Supreme Court seems poised to uphold this year. The bill offers no exceptions for cases of rape and incest.\n\nSouth Dakota – Republican Gov. Kristi Noem on March 23 signed a law that will further restrict access to medication abortions in the state. The law makes South Dakota one of hardest places in the country to get abortion drugs, requiring pregnant women to make at least three trips to a clinic to obtain abortion medication. The measure, however, will not take effect immediately due to litigation. What’s next: The law will not go into effect unless the judge’s injunction is lifted, which Noem’s administration is seeking through an appeal.\n\nNew anti-LGBTQ and trans youth restrictions\n\nAlabama – Republican Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law the state’s own version of Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law on April 8 after the legislature passed a surprise amendment to a transgender bathroom bill. The law will stop K-5 elementary teachers from “instruction” on sexuality and gender. In addition to instructional limits, the bill requires students to use school bathrooms and locker rooms that match the sex on their birth certificate. Ivey also signed SB 184 into law, which states medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care to minors could face up to 10 years in prison. What’s next: The ACLU, on behalf of two families, has filed a lawsuit in federal court, asking it to strike down SB 184, banning gender-affirming care.\n\nKentucky – The GOP-controlled state legislature has overridden Beshear after he vetoed a bill on April 6 that would prohibit transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at public and private schools in the state. The bill, dubbed the “Fairness in Women’s Sports Act” reads: “An athletic activity or sport designated as ‘girls’ for students in grades six through twelve shall not be open to members of the male sex.”\n\nPennsylvania – The Pennsylvania House of Representatives voted 115-84 on April 12 to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender. House Bill 972, known as the “Fairness in Women’s Sports Act,” states that sports or teams sponsored by a public school entity or institution must be designated as male, female or coed and that “athletic or teams or sports designated for females, women or girls…may not be open to students of the male sex.” What’s next: The bill heads to the state Senate, but Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has vowed to veto the legislation.\n\nUtah – The GOP-controlled legislature on March 25 voted to override Republican Gov. Spencer Cox’ veto of a bill that bans young transgender athletes from competing on women’s and girls’ sports teams. What’s next: The ACLU has threatened to sue over the law, saying, “Litigation to stop H.B. 11 from taking effect is now both necessary and inevitable.”\n\nFlorida – DeSantis on March 28 signed legislation banning certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom, approving a controversial measure that opponents have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” law. HB 1557, titled the Parental Rights in Education bill, was given final passage by Florida’s GOP-controlled Legislature last month. What’s next: Two LGBTQ rights advocacy groups, as well as students, parents and a teacher in Florida, filed a federal lawsuit in late March challenging the new law and seeking to block its implementation and enforcement. The law is set to take effect in July.\n\nOhio – Two Republican state representatives introduced a bill in the state legislature on Monday that would ban the teaching or providing of “any curriculum or instructional materials on sexual orientation or gender identity” to students in kindergarten through third grade, using similar language to the Florida law critics have named “Don’t Say Gay.” If passed, the measure would also forbid Ohio public school educators in grades four through 12 from teaching or using “instructional materials on sexual orientation or gender identity in any manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.” What’s next: Awaiting votes in the state House.\n\nTexas – The state began investigating families seeking gender-affirming care for their transgender minor children after Republican state Attorney General Ken Paxton declared such treatment to be “child abuse.” Republican Gov. Greg Abbott directed the Department of Family and Protective Services to begin the investigations. The ACLU sued on behalf of the parents of a transgender girl and an appeals court has upheld a temporary injunction blocking the action. What’s next: Paxton has asked the state Supreme Court to intervene to allow the child abuse investigations.\n\nArizona – Ducey last month signed two bills into law targeting transgender youth in the state, prohibiting trans girls and women from competing on women’s and girls’ sports teams and restricting youth access to gender-affirming care. What’s next: The ACLU has vowed to sue to block the law restricting gender-affirming care.\n\nOklahoma – Stitt signed legislation banning transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at public schools, public charter schools and public colleges in the state.\n\nIowa – Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed legislation banning transgender women and girls from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender at accredited schools and colleges.\n\nSouth Dakota – Noem signed a law banning transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at accredited schools and colleges.\n\nNew anti-critical race theory actions\n\nFlorida – The GOP-controlled state legislature has voted to ban public schools and private businesses from teaching people to “feel guilt” for historical events committed by people of their race. The “Stop WOKE Act” would also prohibit instruction that says certain races or sexes are privileged or oppressed. The bill comes after Florida banned the teaching of critical race theory last year in public schools. What’s next: The bill heads to DeSantis, who is expected to sign it.\n\nKentucky – The Republican-controlled legislature overrode a veto from Beshear that restricts classroom instruction about race. The law says in part that public schools shall provide instructions that align with certain concepts including: “An individual, by virtue of the individual’s race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed by other members of the same race or sex” and that “defining racial disparities solely on the legacy” of slavery “is destructive to the unification of our nation.”\n\nGeorgia – The state legislature approved a bill that would limit discussions about race in classrooms and prohibit schools from advocating “divisive concepts,” including discussion that people “should feel anguish, guilt, or any other form of psychological distress” about their race and that “the United States of America is fundamentally racist.” The bill would also allow the Georgia High School Association to ban transgender students from participating in girls’ sports in public high schools. What’s next: The bill now heads to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp for signing.\n\nSouth Dakota – Republican Gov. Kristi Noem signed an executive order last month restricting the teaching of critical race theory in K-12 schools after the state Senate Education Committee killed a bill that would have accomplished a similar goal. Noem has also signed a law this session blocking mandatory critical race theory trainings and orientations at colleges in the state.\n\nOhio – A bill introduced earlier this month mirroring the Florida law critics have dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” would also ban curriculum for all grades that teaches, promotes or endorses what it calls “divisive or inherently racist concepts.” It would outlaw any textbook, instructional material or academic curriculum that “promotes” concepts such as critical race theory; intersectional theory; The 1619 Project; inherited racial guilt; diversity, equity and inclusion learning outcomes; inherited racial guilt; or “any other concept that the state board of education defines as divisive or inherently racist.” What’s next: The bill awaits a vote in the state House.\n\nNew ‘election police’ forces\n\nFlorida – The Republican-controlled Florida House passed a voting overhaul bill that would create a security office to investigate election crimes and increase penalties for violating the state’s election laws. The legislation would establish a scaled-back version of an elections police force first proposed last year by DeSantis. What’s next: The bill will be sent to DeSantis’ desk for a signature.\n\nGeorgia – State lawmakers passed a bill on their final day of the session earlier this month that would give new election policing powers to the state’s bureau of investigation. Georgia becomes the second state after Florida to pass an election police force bill this year as Republicans continue to falsely claim the 2020 election was rife with voter fraud. What’s next: The bill awaits Kemp’s signature. He has 40 days to sign the legislation or veto it.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Jon Passantino"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/30/florida-gov-ron-desantis-laws-keep-getting-blocked-a-partial-list/70367966007/", "title": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' laws keep getting blocked. A partial list.", "text": "Gov. Ron DeSantis has built a powerful lawmaking machine. With a GOP supermajority in the Florida Legislature, DeSantis has been able to easily muscle through a staggering array of legislation designed to turn Florida into a conservative paradise and a potential blueprint for America.\n\nHowever, the courts don't always agree.\n\nMany of the most controversial laws from the governor and would-be presidential candidate have been criticized as being unconstitutional, discriminatory and cruel, and sometimes his ambitious aims run into multiple lawsuits and legal roadblocks. Bryan Griffin, a spokesman for DeSantis' presidential campaign, called the lawsuits “the tactics of activists who seek to impose their will on people by judicial fiat.”\n\n\"I think this woke thing is really a mind virus,\" DeSantis told the crowd during a rally in Spartanburg, South Carolina in April. \"It infects these different institutions. Woke represents a war on truth. We will never surrender to the woke mob.\n\n\"Florida,\" the governor said, repeating what has become a campaign slogan, \"is where woke goes to die.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMost recently the U.S. Department of Justice urged a federal judge to block a new Florida law that restricts people from China and six other countries from owning property in the state.\n\nHere are some of the most notable court rulings on DeSantis's primary policies.\n\nJuly 3, 2023: Judge blocks parts of Florida elections law\n\nChief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued a preliminary injunction against parts of a new elections law in Florida that targeted voter-registration groups, saying the case “arises from Florida’s latest assault on the right to vote.”\n\nIn a 58-page decision, Walker pointed out the parts of SB 7050 which prevented non-U.S. citizens from “collecting or handling” voter-registration applications (\"The Free State of Florida is simply not free to exceed the bounds of the United States Constitution,” he wrote) and made it a felony for voter-registration group workers to keep personal information of voters (too vague, it \"leaves open a broad universe of what could be considered ‘personal’ information”).\n\nJune 23, 2023: Florida's drag show law blocked\n\nSB 1438: Protection of Children never uses the words \"drag show,\" but many saw the law barring children from attending \"adult live performances\" as targeting the LGBTQ community. Multiple Pride events have been canceled in Florida for fear of the 2023 law and a drag show venue, Hamburger Mary's in Orlando, challenged it. A federal court blocked it for being overly vague and unconstitutional.\n\nJune 21, 2023: Court strikes down Medicaid ban on gender care\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle declared that Florida's 2022 rule and statute that prohibit Medicaid payment for transition care for transgender people such as puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries violates the federal Medicaid statute, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Affordable Care Act’s prohibition of sex discrimination. Hinkle had previously upheld the ban last year against a previous version of the lawsuit.\n\n\"The elephant in the room that should be noted at the outset. Gender identity is real. The record makes this clear,\" Hinkle wrote in the order.\n\nJune 6, 2023: Florida's ban on gender-affirming care blocked\n\nIn a narrow ruling, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle blocked enforcement of the state's ban on transgender affirming care, calling the rule \"an exercise in politics, not in good medicine.\"\n\nThe district judge granted a preliminary injunction against Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, the Florida Board of Medicine, the Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine and other state leaders, and will allow the parents who challenged the state to access medical care for their transgender children as the ban's constitutionality is debated in court.\n\nJuly 5, 2022: Florida's 15-week abortion ban temporarily stopped\n\nLeon County Circuit Judge John Cooper ruled the state's new ban on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy unconstitutional the day before it was set to go effect, and released a temporary injunction a few days later to stop it. Cooper said the law was a likely violation of the state constitution’s right to privacy.\n\nThe move was immediately appealed by the state and the law went back into effect as the matter advances in court. The Florida Supreme Court has agreed to review the law, but not quickly. Meanwhile, the Florida Legislature passed an even stricter 6-week ban in 2023 on most abortions which will go into effect if the court decides the previous 15-week ban is constitutional.\n\nNov. 17, 2022: 'Stop WOKE Act's' ban on addressing race- or gender-related issues in universities blocked\n\nChief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker blocked another key provision of the state's 'Stop WOKE Act,' officially called the “Individual Freedom Act” but nicknamed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill by critics, calling “positively dystopian” its limits on the discussion of race, gender and other topics in university classrooms.\n\n“In this case, the State of Florida lays the cornerstone of its own Ministry of Truth under the guise of the Individual Freedom Act, declaring which viewpoints shall be orthodox and which shall be verboten in its university classrooms,” Walker wrote in his 139-page ruling. Walker ruled the provision unconstitutional, saying it violated the First and 14th Amendments and the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nIn March 2023, a three-judge panel with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the state's request for a stay of Walker's injunction.\n\nWhat does it mean to be 'woke'?And why does Florida Governor Ron DeSantis want to stop it?\n\nAug. 18, 2022: 'Stop WOKE Act' ban on discussions in addressing race-related issues in workplace training blocked\n\nCalling part of the law a “naked viewpoint-based regulation on speech,” Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker blocked restrictions that Gov. Ron DeSantis and Republican lawmakers placed on addressing race-related issues in workplace training. Walker agreed with three businesses and a consultant that restrictions in the law violate the First Amendment.\n\nWalker had previously rejected a challenge to the law, saying that four of the plaintiffs lacked legal standing.\n\nMay 11, 2022: DeSantis' redistricting map blocked\n\nThe 2022 election season was in chaos over a restricting map battle. In April, DeSantis vetoed a new GOP-drawn map, calling it unconstitutional and racially gerrymandered. Instead, he offered a new map, which provided more districts likely to elect Republicans to Congress from Florida and reduced four districts represented by Black Democrats down to just two. The plan was so aggressive that the Republican-controlled Legislature fought against it for months before it passed in a special legislative session.\n\nIn May, Leon County Judge J. Layne Smith blocked the map from use in the 2022 election, saying, “I do find persuasive the arguments that were made about the diminishment of African-American votes ... to the other districts where they’re now spreading.”\n\nSmith's decision was reversed in an appeals court later that month. The Florida Supreme Court, in a 4-1 divided ruling in which two of the justices recused themselves, declined to hear the case, leaving the appeals court decision in place for the election. Republicans added four seats from Florida, helping the GOP win control of the U.S. House.\n\nThe trial is due to come up in August. Both sides are optimistic: DeSantis won a key victory in the beginning of June when a judge ruled that lawmakers can argue in the upcoming trial that the state's Fair District standards violate the U.S. Constitution. The Fair District requirements, approved by voters in 2010, prohibit districts that diminish the ability of minorities to elect representatives of their choice, a policy DeSantis has derided.\n\nMeanwhile, advocates against the new map saw new hope in two recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions: that an Alabama congressional map likely violated the federal Voting Rights Act, and that legislatures did not have unchecked authority to enact federal voting rules and create congressional redistricting maps guided by partisan gerrymandering.\n\nFrom packing heat to drone delivery:A list of new 2023 Florida laws signed by DeSantis\n\nSept. 9, 2021: Judge blocks DeSantis' 'anti-riot' law\n\nChief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker agreed with arguments from civil rights organizations that Florida's \"Combating Public Disorder\" law, dubbed the \"anti-riot\" law, and called it a threat to the constitutional rights of Americans. The legislation toughened penalties for crimes that occur during protests that become violent and created new crimes including “mob intimidation,” “inciting a riot” and “defacing, damaging or destroying a monument,” largely aimed at protecting Confederate monuments across Florida.\n\n“Though plaintiffs claim that they and their members fear that it (the law) will be used against them based on the color of their skin or the messages that they express,\" Walker wrote, \"its vagueness permits those in power to weaponize its enforcement against any group who wishes to express any message that the government disapproves of.”\n\nAn Atlanta-based appeals court heard arguments last March for the state's appeal but in January deferred th case until the Florida Supreme Court can decide on the definition of \"riot.\"\n\nJune 30, 2021: Judge blocks Florida's first-in-the-nation social media law\n\nAfter former president Donald Trump was suspended from Twitter and other social media platforms in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection, DeSantis demanded a new law, and got it. The Stop Social Media Censorship Act (SB 7072) cracked down on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook by requiring them to disclose specific, detailed standards for censorship or blocks and fining them as much as $250,000 a day for de-platforming a Florida candidate.\n\nAfter opponents representing the tech industry sued, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle declared the new law undermined constitutional free speech protections, said it was \"viewpoint-driven\" without a compelling state interest, and issued an injunction against it.\n\n“I won’t put you on the spot and ask you if you’ve ever dealt with a statute that was more poorly drafted,” Hinkle asked the state's lawyers during the initial hearing.\n\nThe Atlanta-based Eleventh Circuit partially agreed with the injunction in May 2022, leaving the moderation disclosure as valid but otherwise leaving the injunction in place. \"Put simply, with minor exceptions, the government can't tell a private person or entity what to say or how to say it,\" said Circuit Judge Kevin Newsom.\n\nIn October, the state petitioned the Supreme Court to reinstate the law. The defendants filed their own review, asking to have the lone restriction approved by the appeals court struck down. Instead of granting or denying either petition, SCOTUS asked the Biden administration for its views on this law and a similar one in Texas. According to the SCOTUSBlog, if the court does decide to hear the case a decision would not be likely until 2024.\n\nContributors: Ana Goñi-Lessan, Tallahassee Democrat, John Kennedy, USA TODAY NETWORK FLORIDA Capital Bureau", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/06/supreme-court-transgender-girls-sports/11509293002/", "title": "WV transgender sports ban: Supreme Court sides with transgender girl", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court on Thursday sided with a 12-year-old transgender girl who is challenging a West Virginia ban on transgender athletes joining girls sports teams, temporarily blocking the state from enforcing the prohibition.\n\nWest Virginia officials approved the prohibition in 2021. The law requires public schools to create sports teams based on sex assigned at birth. A middle school student who competes on girls' cross-country and track-and-field teams and her family sued in federal court, asserting that the state's ban violates the Constitution and federal law.\n\nThe Supreme Court denied the state's request to temporarily revive the ban while the underlying litigation continues without explanation, as it often does in emergency cases. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented from that decision.\n\n\"Among other things, enforcement of the law at issue should not be forbidden by the federal courts without any explanation,\" Alito wrote, referencing a lower court's decision to halt enforcement of the law, which was also done without explanation.\n\nOfficials in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee and other states have enacted similar laws. Here's a look at what's next for the transgender sports case at the Supreme Court.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhat to know about the WV Supreme Court transgender sports case\n\nWest Virginia passed a law in 2021 barring transgender girls from playing on school girls' sports teams from middle school through college. Becky Pepper-Jackson, a 12-year-old transgender girl who currently competes on her school's cross-country and track-and-field teams sued, alleging the prohibition violates the Constitution.\n\nA federal district court sided with the state in February, ruling that officials appeared to be \"permitted to use biology as the sole criterion in separating school athletic teams.\" But the Richmond-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit essentially put the lower court's ruling on hold in late February, allowing Pepper-Jackson to try out for the teams. The state appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.\n\nWest Virginia officials asked that the Supreme Court allow it to continue to enforce the ban while the underlying case works its way through the lower courts.\n\nWhat they're saying about the Supreme Court transgender case\n\nWest Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey described the ruling Thursday as a \"procedural setback\" and said the state is confident it will prevail on the merits.\n\n\"We maintain our stance that this is a common sense law – we have a very strong case,\" said Morrisey, a Republican who announced recently he is running for governor. \"It’s just basic fairness and common sense to not have biological males play in women’s sports.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal said they are grateful the Supreme Court acknowledged that there wasn't a need for emergency legal intervention.\n\n\"We are grateful that the Supreme Court today acknowledged...that Becky should be allowed to continue to participate with her teammates on her middle school track team, which she has been doing without incident for three going on four seasons,\" the group said in a joint statement. \"This was a baseless and cruel effort to keep Becky from where she belongs–playing alongside her peers as a teammate and as a friend.\"\n\nWhy Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito dissented in West Virginia transgender ruling\n\nIn a brief, two-page dissent, Justice Samuel Alito said he would have granted the state's request to revive the ban temporarily. Justice Clarence Thomas joined that opinion.\n\nAlito wrote that the case dealt with \"an important issue that this court is likely to be required to address in the near future.\" Alito focused on the fact that the federal appeals court, which halted enforcement of the ban in February did so without explanation.\n\nBallfields to bathrooms: Many transgender cases pending in court\n\nPepper-Jackson's case, West Virginia v. B.P.J, is one of several dealing with school sports bans for transgender students.\n\nA federal appeals court in New York is set to rehear a closely watched challenge to a policy in Connecticut that allows transgender girls to compete on girls' sports teams. The plaintiffs say the policy \"actively harms female athletes.\" A three-judge panel of the court in December sided with the state's high schools on narrow grounds. The full appeals court will hear arguments in the case in June.\n\nThomas:Clarence Thomas accepted luxury gifts from GOP megadonor for decades without disclosing them: report\n\nRoundup:Transgender athlete ban one of many LGBTQ fights brewing in courts\n\nCase tracker:A look at the key cases pending before the Supreme Court\n\nOther courts, meanwhile, are considering policies dealing with school bathrooms. A federal appeals court in December backed a Florida school district's policy banning transgender students from using bathrooms that match their gender identity. The 7-4 opinion reached a different conclusion from an appeals court in Virginia considering a similar policy – creating a split among courts that may entice the Supreme Court to review the issue.\n\nAdvocates are awaiting a decision from the Virginia-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit about North Carolina's exclusion of coverage for gender affirming treatment in the state health insurance plan for government employees.\n\nThe big picture\n\nThe Supreme Court last debated transgender rights in 2019, ultimately siding with three employees who were fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nA 6-3 majority ruled in 2020 that when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars workplace discrimination on the basis of \"sex,\" that also covers sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nBut the nation's highest court has since passed on a number of high-profile appeals. In 2021, the court declined to take up a case about school bathrooms. At issue was a Virginia policy that required transgender students to use unisex bathrooms. Gavin Grimm, a transgender man who was denied access to the boys’ bathroom when he was a student, sued over the policy.

The 162 bills that were introduced through July of this year tally just above the 151 considered for all of 2021, and more than double the 76 considered in 2020.\n\nMost of the bills introduced this year target transgender and nonbinary people, with a particular emphasis on trans youth. The issue has been seized upon in the run-up to the midterm elections, predominantly in Republican-led states.\n\nThe ACLU tracks anti-LGBTQ legislation by focusing on “bills specifically attacking or targeting LGBTQ people,” which include measures restricting school curricula that deal with LGBTQ issues and religious exemption bills. To tabulate anti-trans bills, the group keeps an eye out for legislation “barring or criminalizing health care for trans youth, barring access to the use of appropriate facilities like restrooms, restricting trans students’ ability to fully participate in school and sports, allowing religiously-motivated discrimination against trans people, or making it more difficult for them to get identification documents with their name and gender.”\n\nAlthough many of the bills didn’t get far in the legislative process, 2022 also already marks a record-breaking year for the number of measures that went into effect: 21 anti-LGBTQ bills have been enacted into law during the 2022 legislative session, according to the ACLU.\n\nThe rise in anti-trans bills comes as more and more young people publicly identify as transgender, both aiding the community’s overall visibility in society and fueling an intense political reaction. A study released last month by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found that the number of people between the ages of 13 and 17 who identify as trans doubled, from an estimated 150,000 in 2017 to about 300,000 by 2022.\n\nIn pushing the bills, Republicans have raised concerns about fairness in women’s athletics and called for greater parental oversight over what students learn and discuss at school. They’ve also said that children shouldn’t make major decisions about their health at a young age, arguing bans on gender-affirming health care are necessary to prevent such action.\n\nThe influx of bills has alarmed both families of LGBTQ youth and advocacy groups, some of which have begun to fight such legislation in court, arguing the measures violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, among other provisions.\n\n“This is by far the worst year. And every year is worse than the previous years,” Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice at the ACLU, told CNN. “It’s definitely the most extreme anti-trans legislative session that I’ve ever been a part of.”\n\nHere’s what these bills target, and which states have introduced – and passed – anti-LGBTQ policies.\n\nParticipation in same-gender youth sports\n\nRepublican state lawmakers have in recent years focused on the participation of trans youth in school sports, claiming that transgender women and girls have physical advantages over cisgender women and girls in sports, though a 2017 report in the journal Sports Medicine that reviewed several related studies found “no direct or consistent research” on any such advantage.\n\nThough some of the bans apply just to primary and secondary schools while others are intended to reach students at colleges, or both, they all seek to do the same thing: prohibit trans women and girls from competing on sports teams that are consistent with their gender identity. Many of the measures use the same language or titles, such as “Fairness in Women’s Sports.”\n\nUnderscoring the intense desire by conservatives to pass the restrictions, lawmakers in three of those 11 states – including two led by Republican governors – enacted the bans by overriding vetoes issues by their governors.\n\nIn issuing the vetoes, the governors stressed that the legislation sought to address a non-issue in their states.\n\n“Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few. I don’t understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said, noting that studies have shown that the high rates of suicide among trans students can be reduced when they’re shown “even a little acceptance and connection.”\n\nPublic opinion, however, is largely on the side of the bans’ proponents. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released last month found a majority of respondents saying they opposed trans women competing on teams that match their gender identity at the high school and college level. And a Gallup poll from May 2021 showed that among US adults, 62% of respondents said trans athletes should only be allowed to play on teams that match their gender assigned at birth rather than their gender identity.\n\nThe NCAA has come out in opposition to bans on trans women competing on teams that match their gender identity, saying in April 2021 that it’s closely monitoring them to make sure NCAA championships can be held “in ways that are welcoming and respectful of all participants.”\n\nLGBTQ advocates have had some limited legal success in fighting the bans, including last year when a federal judge temporarily blocked West Virginia’s enforcement of its ban after advocates sued the state, with the judge saying he had “been provided with scant evidence that this law addresses any problem at all, let alone an important problem.” And in 2020, a federal judge blocked Idaho’s enforcement of its sports ban.\n\nSchool and curriculum restrictions\n\nThis year has also seen a record number of bills designed to restrict what teachers and educators can say about LGBTQ-related topics in the classroom. In all of 2021, 16 bills were introduced across statehouses that aimed to restrict how schools could approach topics about LGBTQ issues in the classroom.\n\nSo far this year, that number jumped to more than 40 bills across 18 states.\n\nRepublicans have argued that the measures provide parents with greater oversight over what kinds of topics are discussed at school and that LGBTQ-related topics should be left for families to discuss at home. When Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed HB 1557 earlier this year – which opponents have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” law – he said it recognizes that “parents have a fundamental role in the education, health care and well-being of their children.”\n\nBut Democrats and LGBTQ advocates say the bills are discriminatory. The first lawsuit against Florida’s law was filed in March, with the challengers describing the measure as an “unlawful attempt to stigmatize, silence and erase LGBTQ people in Florida’s public schools.”\n\nLawmakers have also sought to protect instructors who take issue with using a student’s preferred pronouns. A Tennessee bill, for example, would have prohibited some schools in the states from requiring teachers or other school employees to “use a student’s preferred pronoun when referring to the student if the preferred pronoun is not consistent with the student’s biological sex.”\n\nWhile sex is a category that refers broadly to physiology, a person’s gender is an innate sense of identity. The factors that go into determining the sex listed on a birth certificate may include anatomy, genetics and hormones, and there is broad natural variation in each of these categories. For this reason, critics have said the language of “biological sex,” as used in bills like the Tennessee one, is overly simplistic and misleading.\n\nBans on gender-affirming care\n\nLegislators in 21 states have introduced more than two dozen bills that block access to gender-affirming care to minors, according to the ACLU.\n\nGender-affirming care is medically necessary, evidence-based care that a person transitioning from their assigned gender – the one the person was designated at birth – to their affirmed gender – the gender by which they identify.\n\nMajor medical associations agree that gender-affirming care is clinically appropriate for children and adults with gender dysphoria, which, according to the American Psychiatric Association, is psychological distress that may result when a person’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth do not align.\n\nBut conservative lawmakers have argued that decisions around such care should be made after an individual becomes an adult. Many of the bills introduced this year pertaining to the issue criminalize pediatricians who provide this care.\n\nLast year, only Arkansas was able to successfully pass a ban on gender-affirming health care, but this year, two states – Alabama and Arizona – put similar bans on their books, making it illegal for physicians in those states to provide such care to trans youth. A federal judge temporarily blocked Arkansas’ ban last year, and Alabama’s ban was partially blocked by a federal judge in May.\n\nWhen Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, signed his state’s ban, he said in a statement that his decision was based on his concerns about the seriousness of such health care. “The reason is simple, and common sense – this is a decision that will dramatically affect the rest of an individual’s life, including the ability of that individual to become a biological parent later in life,” the governor said.\n\nTexas, meanwhile, approached the issue differently. Instead of the state enacting a ban similar to those in Alabama and Arizona, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton released a non-legally binding opinion in February declaring that providing gender-affirming surgical procedures and drugs that affect puberty should be considered child abuse under state law. The move prompted the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to begin investigating parents who provide their children with such care, causing alarm among families of trans children.\n\nPaxton’s order has been mired in lawsuits since it was signed in February, but the state Supreme Court recently ruled that the child abuse investigations can continue.\n\nAfter Arkansas passed its ban last year, Dr. James L. Madara, the CEO and executive vice president of the American Medical Association, urged governors nationwide to resist enacting more bans, writing in a letter: “We believe this legislation represents a dangerous governmental intrusion into the practice of medicine and will be detrimental to the health of transgender children across the country.”\n\nMadara emphasized that “improved body satisfaction” is linked to “dramatic reductions in suicide attempts, as well as decreased rates of depression and anxiety.”\n\nAlready, the bans are being used as campaign tools in the upcoming midterm elections, underscoring how some Republicans are leaning into the issue to gin up support among their base.\n\nSingle-sex facility restriction, ID restrictions and religious exemptions\n\nFor LGBTQ Americans, other areas of life were also targeted this year. At the end of May, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed into law a measure requiring students at public schools and public charter schools to use restrooms and locker rooms that match the sex listed on their birth certificates.\n\nIt’s the only so-called “bathroom bill” signed into law this session, though several other states considered similar legislation this year. Stitt also approved earlier this year a bill that requires the sex designation on a birth certificate to read as either male or female, prohibiting birth certificates filed with the state from containing an “X” or other marker used by nonbinary individuals.\n\nReligious exemption bills in South Carolina and Indiana, meanwhile, would have allowed adoption and foster care agencies to refuse to provide services to members of the LGBTQ community based on a person’s religious beliefs.\n\nWhat’s next for the laws?\n\nThough many of the bills introduced so far in 2022 failed, advocates have warned that Republican efforts to pass laws affecting the lives of LGBTQ people – and trans people specifically – will likely intensify in the coming years.\n\nStrangio told CNN that the party’s focus on trans people is a “base-mobilizing tool” that is being steadily tested in the run up to the 2024 general election. “What we are seeing are, you know, sort of the trial balloon testing grounds from 2021 being refined and escalated in 2022 in the lead up to the midterms and then, of course, in the lead up to the 2024 presidential election,” he said.\n\nSome of the laws enacted this year have already or will soon go into effect, creating a new reality for LGBTQ Americans around the country. And lawsuits filed against a few of them could eventually slow down their implementation, including the Utah sports ban, which was challenged in court by the families of two Utah teenagers.\n\n“Litigation is the next step. There are already cases filed in Alabama, for example, challenging the medical care ban there. And there are additional cases that are also being filed across the country,” said Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, one of the nation’s largest LGBTQ rights groups.\n\nAdvocates’ legal efforts may soon get a boost from the Biden administration, which last month proposed extending the protections guaranteed under Title IX, the landmark 1972 federal law that prohibits sex discrimination at federally funded schools, to transgender students. In its announcement, the administration said the 50-year-old law should also protect students against “discrimination based on sexual orientation” and “discrimination based on gender identity.”\n\nIf finalized, the new protections could be used by lawyers in court as they seek to block some of the measures targeting trans students, giving them a strong federal policy to lean on when arguing the laws violate students’ rights, according to advocates.\n\n“This is a much-needed step in the right direction,” Paul D. Castillo, an attorney with Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group, said in a statement following the announcement. “These new rules will provide a stronger, clearer measure of recourse and better ensure that victims of unlawful discrimination can avail themselves of the longstanding protections under Title IX.”", "authors": ["Priya Krishnakumar Devan Cole", "Priya Krishnakumar", "Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/28/supreme-court-wont-decide-trans-bathroom-case-involving-gavin-grimm/5318886001/", "title": "Supreme Court declines to hear Virginia school board's transgender ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court on Monday declined to wade into a dispute over whether schools may bar transgender students from using a bathroom that reflects their gender identity, permitting a lower court ruling against those prohibitions to stand.\n\nAt issue in the case was whether federal anti-discrimination law applied to LGBTQ students. Gloucester County School Board in Virginia argued its policy of requiring transgender students to use unisex bathrooms was permitted under a 50-year-old law that prohibits discrimination at schools that receive federal funding.\n\nBy not taking the case, the Supreme Court without comment let stand a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit that found the school’s policy discriminated against Gavin Grimm, a transgender man who was denied access to the boys’ bathroom years ago when he was a high school student.\n\n\"I am glad that my years-long fight to have my school see me for who I am is over,\" Grimm said in a statement released by the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented him in the case. \"Trans youth deserve to use the bathroom in peace without being humiliated and stigmatized by their own school boards and elected officials.\"\n\nNeither the school district nor its attorneys responded to a request for comment.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAssociate Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they would have taken the case, though they did not elaborate on their position. The Supreme Court did not rule on the underlying legal questions and experts say more cases involving transgender rights will arrive at the high court as conservative states pass a bevy of laws restricting those rights.\n\nBathroom battle:Trans teen is back at Supreme Court, years after graduation\n\nBiden:Transgender students protected at school, U.S. Department of Education says\n\nThe case returned to the court at a time when the Biden administration is seeking to expand legal protections for transgender students. In one of his first executive orders, President Joe Biden said the federal government would seek to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear the case once before, in 2016, based on guidance from the Obama administration that nudged schools to adopt policies favoring transgender students. But the court dropped the case months later, wiping out a lower court ruling for Grimm, when the Trump administration withdrew the guidance. Biden’s administration reinstated the Obama-era guidance earlier this month.\n\nGrimm's case, meanwhile, continued to wind its way back through the federal courts , even as he graduated from high school and moved to California for college.\n\nIn the meantime, the Supreme Court held last year that prohibitions on workplace discrimination on the basis of \"sex\" also extended protections to LGBTQ Americans. The legal fight between LGBTQ advocates and their opponents has since shifted to whether other laws that bar “sex” discrimination similarly protect people in other settings based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThat debate featured prominently in Grimm's case.\n\nGrimm was a rising sophomore when he changed his first name to Gavin and began using male pronouns. Officials at Gloucester High School were supportive, but blowback from parents prompted the school board to bar Grimm from the boys’ bathroom, directing him instead to unisex bathrooms – three of which were built in response to the controversy.\n\nGrimm said the mandate made him feel \"stigmatized and isolated.\" The unisex bathrooms were unavailable when he attended football games and afterschool activities. Grimm would often \"hold it,\" leading to urinary tract infections. He sued in 2015, claiming the board’s policy violated Title IX and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThough the ACLU and LGBTQ advocates applauded the court's decision as a victory, the legal ramification was less clear. Appeals courts in Chicago and Atlanta, as well as the 4th Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, have held that schools violate federal law when they prohibit transgender boys from using the same restrooms as cisgender boys. But that legal question remains unsettled at the national level.\n\n\"The Supreme Court's decision to not hear the Grimm case is a victory for trans students and it might influence how some lower courts view similar cases,\" said Jami Taylor, political science professor at The University of Toledo and an expert on LGBTQ policies. \"However, it does not set national precedent.\"\n\nThat lack of clarity comes amid an onslaught of state laws attempting to limit transgender rights. Those include a Tennessee law requiring transgender students to compete in school sports according to their sex assigned at birth. Arkansas this year became the first state to ban gender-affirming treatments for transgender minors.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/28"}]}

However, only ground and instant coffee with caffeine reduced the risk for an irregular heartbeat called arrhythmia. Decaffeinated coffee did not lower that risk, according to the study published Wednesday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.\n\nPrior studies have also found moderate amounts of black coffee — between 3 and 5 cups daily — has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, as well as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, liver disease and prostate cancer.\n\n“This manuscript adds to the body of evidence from observational trials associating moderate coffee consumption with cardioprotection, which looks promising,” said Charlotte Mills, a lecturer in nutritional sciences at the University of Reading in the UK, in a statement.\n\nHowever, this study, like many in the past, was only observational in nature and therefore cannot prove a direct cause and effect, added Mills, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“Does coffee make you healthy or do inherently healthier people consume coffee?” she asked. “Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove the relationship between coffee and cardiovascular health.”\n\nGround, caffeinated coffee lowered risk the most\n\nThe study used data from the UK Biobank, a research database which contained coffee consumption preferences on nearly 450,000 adults who were free of arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. They were divided into four groups: those who enjoyed caffeinated ground coffee, those who chose decaffeinated coffee, those who preferred caffeinated instant coffee, and those who did not drink coffee at all.\n\nAfter an average of 12.5 years, researchers looked at medical and death records for reports of arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease, stroke and death. After adjusting for age, diabetes, ethnicity, high blood pressure, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, sex, smoking status, and tea and alcohol consumption, researchers found all types of coffee were linked with a reduction in death from any cause.\n\nThe fact that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was beneficial “might suggest that it is not simply the caffeine which could potentially explain any associated reduction in risk,” said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston University Medical School in Birmingham in the UK, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Caffeine is the most well-known constituent in coffee, but the beverage contains more than 100 biologically active components,” said Kistler, who holds joint appointments as professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne and Monash University.\n\n“It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival,” Kistler said.\n\nDrinking two to three cups of coffee a day was linked to the largest reduction in early death, compared to people who drank no coffee, according to the statement. Ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of death by 27%, followed by 14% for decaffeinated, and 11% for instant caffeinated coffee.\n\nThe link between coffee and a lowered risk for heart disease and stroke was not as robust: Drinking two to three cups a day of ground coffee lowered risk by 20%, while the same amount of decaf coffee reduced risk by 6% and instant by 9%.\n\nThe data changed when it came to coffee’s impact on irregular heartbeat: Four to five cups a day of caffeinated ground coffee lowered risk by 17% while two to three cups a day of instant coffee reduced the likelihood of arrhythmia by 12%, the statement said.\n\nMore study needed\n\nA limitation of the study was that coffee consumption was self-reported at a single point in time, said Annette Creedon, a nutritional scientist and manager at the British Nutrition Foundation, which is partially funded by food producers, retailers and food service companies.\n\n“This study had a median follow-up period of 12.5 years during which many aspects of the participants diet and lifestyle may have changed,” said Creedon in a statement. She was not part of the research.\n\nIn addition, coffee can produce negative side effects in some people, she added. People with sleep issues or uncontrolled diabetes, for example, should check with a doctor before adding caffeine to their diets.\n\nThese negative side effects “can be particularly relevant to individuals who are sensitive to the effects of caffeine,” Creedon said. “Hence, the findings of this study do not indicate that people should start drinking coffee if they do not already drink it or that they should increase their consumption.”\n\nMost studies are focused on the health benefits of black coffee, and do not take into account the extra sugars, creams, milks and processed additives that many people use in coffee.\n\n“A simple cup of coffee perhaps with a little milk is very different to a large latte flavoured with a syrup and added cream,” Mellor said.\n\nAdding sugars and dairy fats to coffee can reduce their health benefits, experts say. Adobe Stock\n\nIn addition, how coffee is brewed can also affect its benefits for health. Filtered coffee catches a compound called cafestol that exists in the oily part of coffee. Cafestol can increase bad cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoproteins).\n\nHowever, using a French press, Turkish coffee maker or boiling coffee (as is often done in Scandinavian countries), does not remove cafestol.\n\nAnd, finally, coffee’s benefits do not apply to children – even adolescents should not drink colas, coffees, energy drinks or other beverages with any amount of caffeine, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/health/high-cholesterol-blood-sugar-alzheimers-wellness/index.html", "title": "Alzheimer's linked to having high cholesterol, blood sugar in mid ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHaving high cholesterol and blood sugar in your 30s may raise your risk for Alzheimer’s disease decades later in life, according to a new study.\n\n“We have shown for the first time that the associations between cholesterol and glucose levels and the future risk of Alzheimer’s disease extend much earlier in life than previously thought,” senior study author Lindsay Farrer, chief of biomedical genetics at Boston University Biomedical Genetics, told CNN.\n\n“This study gives us more fuel for the fire that we need to start as early as possible in the fight against Alzheimer’s,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic in the Center for Brain Health at Florida Atlantic University’s Schmidt College of Medicine. Isaacson was not involved in the study.\n\nA type of cholesterol and blood sugar\n\nPeople ages 35 to 50 who had high levels of triglyceride, a type of cholesterol found in blood, and lower levels of the “good cholesterol” called high-density lipoprotein were more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease later in life, the study found.\n\n“In the early age group (35-50 years) only, an increase of 15 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) in triglycerides was associated with an approximate 5% increase in Alzheimer’s disease risk,” Farrer said via email.\n\nThe association was not seen for older age groups, perhaps because older adults are treated for cholesterol more aggressively, he said.\n\n“Alternatively, it could reflect that high triglycerides in early adulthood may trigger a cascade of metabolic events that over time initiate processes that directly lead to Alzheimer’s disease,” Farrer said.\n\nA rise in blood sugars between age 50 and 61 was linked to higher risk for Alzheimer's, according to the study. Maskot/Getty Images\n\nIn people ages 51 to 60, it was higher blood sugar levels that raised the risk for Alzheimer’s, according to the study.\n\n“For every 15 points that your blood sugar goes up, your risk of Alzheimer’s goes up by 14.5% later in life,” said Farrer, who is also a professor of medicine, neurology, ophthalmology, epidemiology and biostatistics at Boston University School of Medicine.\n\n“Having high cholesterol may not cause Alzheimer’s, but it presses the fast-forward button on the disease pathology and cognitive decline,” Isaacson said. “There’s also a relationship between diabetes and the development of amyloid pathology.”\n\nBeta amyloid plaques in the brain are one of the hallmark signals of Alzheimer’s, along with tangles of a protein called tau.\n\n“Just like any chronic disease of aging – high cholesterol, heart attacks, strokes – they all start silently decades before they show up. Alzheimer’s disease is no different,” Isaacson said. “Targeting them early on is the best recipe for optimal brain health as we age.”\n\nRaising HDL helps\n\nThe study, published Wednesday in Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association, followed people enrolled in the Farmingham Heart Study, a government-supported study that is now in its 74th year.\n\n“What’s unique about the study is the large sample of individuals that are examined every four years or so, starting at age 35, and followed into the age when an Alzheimer’s diagnosis may occur,” Farrer said.\n\nThere was some good news from the study: People 35 to 50 could lower their Alzheimer’s risk by 15.4% if they raised their high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, by 15 milligrams per deciliter. People between the ages of 51 and 60 who raised their HDL reduced their risk by 17.9%.\n\nHigh-density lipoprotein is called the “good cholesterol” because it gathers up the bad stuff floating in the bloodstream and takes it to the trash (the liver), where it is flushed from the body. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that high HDL levels can be protective against heart disease and stroke. Levels of HDL should be at least 40 milligrams per deciliter for men and 50 milligrams per deciliter for women, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nPeople who wish to tackle their cholesterol should work carefully with a preventive cardiologist and neurologist, as there are many nuances to how to measure blood lipids and which medications are best, Isaacson said.\n\n“The take-home message is that people who are in their 30s and early 40s need to have their lipids and blood sugar measured. That’s the only way you’ll detect any issues,” Farrer said.\n\n“But many people that age feel they’re healthy and say, ‘Why do I need to see a doctor all the time?’ So it’s encouragement for people to start having regular checkups at that period of your life,” he added.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/07/blood-sugar-dementia-risk/2629549/", "title": "Study ties higher blood sugar to dementia risk", "text": "Marilynn Marchione\n\nAssociated Press\n\nAlzheimer%27s is the most common form of dementia\n\nDiabetes makes Alzheimer%27s more likely\n\nEating well%2C exercising help to keep blood sugar in line\n\nHigher blood-sugar levels, even those well short of diabetes, seem to raise the risk of developing dementia, a major new study finds.

What causes it isn't known. Current treatments just temporarily ease symptoms. People who have diabetes don't make enough insulin, or their bodies don't use insulin well, to turn food into energy. That causes sugar in the blood to rise, which can damage the kidneys and other organs — possibly the brain, researchers say.\n\nThe new study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, just tracked people and did not test whether lowering someone's blood sugar would help treat or prevent dementia. That would have to be tested in a new study, and people should not seek blood-sugar tests they wouldn't normally get otherwise, Crane said.\n\n\"We don't know from a study like this whether bringing down the glucose level will prevent or somehow modify dementia,\" but it's always a good idea to avoid developing diabetes, he said.\n\nEating well, exercising and controlling weight all help to keep blood sugar in line.\n\nThe study involved 2,067 people 65 and older in the Group Health Cooperative, a Seattle-area health care system. At the start, 232 participants had diabetes; the rest did not. They each had at least five blood-sugar tests within a few years of starting the study and more after it was underway. Researchers averaged these levels over time to even out spikes and dips from testing at various times of day or before or after a meal.\n\nParticipants were given standard tests for thinking skills every two years and asked about smoking, exercise and other things that affect dementia risk.\n\nAfter nearly seven years of follow-up, 524, or one quarter of them, had developed dementia — mostly Alzheimer's disease. Among participants who started out without diabetes, those with higher glucose levels over the previous five years had an 18 percent greater risk of developing dementia than those with lower glucose levels.\n\nAmong participants with diabetes at the outset, those with higher blood sugar were 40 percent more likely to develop dementia than diabetics at the lower end of the glucose spectrum.\n\nThe effect of blood sugar on dementia risk was seen even when researchers took into account whether participants had the apoE4 gene, which raises the risk for Alzheimer's.\n\nAt least for diabetics, the results suggest that good blood-sugar control is important for cognition, Crane said.\n\nFor those without diabetes, \"it may be that with the brain, every additional bit of blood sugar that you have is associated with higher risk,\" he said. \"It changes how we think about thresholds, how we think about what is normal, what is abnormal.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/08/09/heartburn-medicine-increases-dementia-risk/70549091007/", "title": "Popular heartburn medicine may increase dementia risk by 33 ...", "text": "The study examined people who took a type of heartburn drug called proton pump inhibitors.\n\nProton pump inhibitors are prescribed or sold over the counter under the brand names Some over-the-counter versions are sold under the brand names Prilosec, Nexium and Prevacid.\n\nPeople who took these drugs for nearly 4.5 years faced a 33% greater risk of dementia.\n\nPeople who use a common type of acid reflux drug for more than four years face a higher risk of dementia later in life, a new study found.\n\nThe research examined people prescribed proton pump inhibitors for frequent acid reflux, stomach ulcers, or other digestive tract issues. Those who took the drugs for more than 4.4 years had a 33% greater likelihood of developing dementia compared to those who did not take the medication, according to a study published Wednesday in the medical journal \"Neurology.\"\n\nAcid reflux occurs when acid escapes the stomach and reaches the esophagus, often after a meal or when going to bed. The common condition can cause gastroesophageal reflux disease, which can damage the esophagus and increase cancer risk. Proton pump inhibitors reduce stomach acid by targeting acid-producing enzymes in the stomach lining.\n\nThe study is the latest to link these medications used by millions of Americans to a growing list of conditions such as stroke, heart disease and kidney disease.\n\nPrevious studies have reported mixed results on links to dementia. Two robust reviews − both examining a collection of independent studies − found no significant links between dementia or Alzheimer's disease and the use of proton-pump inhibitors.\n\nAnd while authors of the National Institutes of Health-funded \"Neurology\" study caution it does not prove these medications cause dementia, they said it provides evidence that sustained use of these medications could pose a risk for dementia, which afflicts about 1 in 3 adults ages 85 and older.\n\nHow common is dementia?

Researchers followed the study participants for 5.5 years. Participants had an average age of 75.\n\nResearchers reviewed study participants during in-person visits or once-a-year phone calls. Those who were prescribed the acid-reflux medications were placed in four groups based on how long they took the medications. Those who took the drugs for at least 4.4 years had the highest rates of dementia. The study excluded people who used over-the-counter versions of the drugs, which have been sold without a prescription since 2003. Some over-the-counter versions are sold under the brand names Prilosec, Nexium and Prevacid.\n\nResearchers adjusted the results for age, sex, race and chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Participants who used the medication for at least 4.4 years had a 33% higher risk of developing dementia compared to those who never took the drugs, the study said. Those who used the drug for a shorter period did not have a higher risk of dementia.\n\nLakshminarayan said the study provides valuable clues because it evaluated dementia risk for those who took the drug for a while. Dementia was determined by cognitive screening reviewed by doctors. Some past studies have provided a one-time look at medication use and relied on billing data for a dementia diagnosis.\n\nHow do I safely take acid reflux drugs?\n\nDr. Fouad J. Moawad, a gastroenterologist and spokesman for the American Gastroenterological Association, said past studies with conflicting results on dementia risk can be \"confusing for both patients and prescribers.\"\n\nHe said the design of the new study does not measure factors that might influence results, including vitamin B12 deficiency, depression, socioeconomic status and H. pylori, a type of bacteria that can infect the stomach. He added that it's difficult to tell whether patients take the acid-reflux drugs as needed, for brief periods or long term. Also, the study excluded people who took over-the-counter versions of the drugs.\n\nIn 2022, the American Gastroenterological Association updated its guideline for doctors on when acid-reflux drug prescriptions should be reduced or discontinued.\n\nMoawad recommends taking the lowest effective dose for those who need the drugs to control stomach acid for severe reflux esophagitis, Barrett’s esophagus and peptic ulcers. He also recommends people reduce foods known to trigger stomach acid, don't eat within three hours of sleeping, elevate their head when sleeping and lose weight.\n\nProton pump inhibitors are \"well-tolerated drugs and work well for acid-related disorders, \" Moawad said. \"With that said, PPIs are likely overprescribed.

The recommendations are virtually unchanged from prior guidance but are now supported by additional research, the group said.\n\nThe recommendations are a little more conservative than guidelines put out by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, and some doctors wonder if they should be more aggressive.\n\nHeart disease is the number one killer for men and women in the world. One person dies every 34 seconds in the US from cardiovascular disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Task Force’s guidance\n\nSpecifically, the USPSTF guidance published Tuesday in JAMA recommends statins for adults ages 40 to 75 who have one or more risk factors of cardiovascular disease and a 10% or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years. Those risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking or high cholesterol. To calculate a person’s risk score, doctors also take into account factors like a person’s age, sex, race, blood pressure, cholesterol numbers and family history.\n\nFor people who have a slightly lower 7.5% to 10% risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years, the latest guidance recommends that they talk to their doctor and then decide if they should take statins.\n\nBecause the risk is slightly lower with this group, the benefits are smaller, even though they are still effective. In this case, the patient should talk to their doctor to determine if, based on individual factors, they need to take one. “There are other factors at the individual level that a healthcare professional and a patient can together decide what might be best for that patient because there are other ways of lowering your risk for having a stroke or first heart attack,” according to task force member Dr. John Wong, a professor of medicine at Tufts University. That includes things like diet and exercise.\n\nFor adults 76 and older, there was not enough research to make a recommendation about taking a statin for the first time.\n\nThe last time USPSTF revised its statin guidelines was in 2016. Since then, there have been several new studies that determine how effective statins are, Wong said.\n\nThe bottom line, Wong said, is that 40 years of science have shown that statins are safe and a good primary prevention that can reduce a person’s risk of developing or dying from heart problems.\n\nTo make these recommendations, USPSTF reviewed 26 studies to compare the results from people who took statins and those who didn’t. The studies involved more than half a million patients.\n\n“Statins were significantly associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality,” the study said. This was true for all demographics.\n\nThe risk of taking statins, based on these studies, seemed small. In the past there had been some concern that statins may elevate a person’s risk for muscle problems or diabetes, but other than one study that involved high-intensity statin therapy, on the balance, these latest studies used to create these guidelines did not show real increase in either problem, experts said.\n\nWhat other guidelines recommend\n\nAn editorial that accompanied the recommendations in JAMA suggested that these guidelines should have been more aggressive and better matched to cholesterol guidelines recommended by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. Those guidelines recommend statins for adults ages 40 to 75 who have a 7.5% or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years, as opposed to a 10% risk. The ACC/AHA guidelines also recommend statins for patients with diabetes without having to also calculate a person’s 10-year risk score and recommend statins for those patients with extremely high levels of cholesterol.\n\n“Individuals with higher baseline risks have greater absolute benefits from intervention than the lower-risk population. Were statins either risky or expensive, such a tailored treatment strategy would be reasonable. However, statins are now available as generic drugs and are both safe and affordable,” wrote the doctors at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas in an editorial.\n\nDr. Edward Fry, the president of the ACC, said it is important to keep in mind that the USPSTF guidelines are statements that are to be applied to a broad group or population of patients, whereas the ACC/AHA guidelines are directed more toward the individual. Neither make statins an automatic decision for a patient.\n\n“Any medical decision needs to be made in an individual context and these guidelines give a sort of roadmap. There may be several different routes to get to where you want to go, but this is a roadmap,” Fry said. “The distinctions between the guidelines are relatively small.”\n\nOne area not touched on in the USPSTF guidelines, for instance, is a person’s coronary calcium score. A heart scan can look for calcium in the coronary arteries. There’s a relationship between calcium and plaque. For a patient that is borderline between a high or intermediate risk, that score could be used as another determining factor.\n\nOther factors ACC/AHA’s guidelines take into account that are not a part of the USPSTF calculus, are what doctors call “risk enhancers” that could also help with decisions about those borderline cases. For example, a 35-year-old who has a family history of heart disease and high cholesterol would not be included in these guidelines, but may be a good candidate for a statin, according to Dr. Salim Virani, a professor of medicine in the section of cardiovascular research at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\n“The risk enhancers may increase a patient’s short-term, 10-year risk, or in some cases, their lifetime risk of having a cardiovascular event, then those guidelines recommend that clinicians should err on the side of early treatment, something not considered in the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations,” Virani said. “But I do want to emphasize, even if clinicians were to take the more conservative US Preventive Service Task Force recommendations and follow them very, very aggressively, we definitely will see a population-level impact because of the statin therapy. It’s really been studied for a very, very long time and now we know it works.”\n\nDr. Ian Neeland, a cardiologist at the University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute and the Director of UH Center for Cardiovascular Prevention, who did not work on either guidelines, said the other big takeaway from the USPSTF is a “reaffirmation” of their earlier guidelines and that the science they used clearly show that statins are safe.\n\n“Overall, the serious risk for serious, adverse events is very low and so the risk benefit will usually be in favor of a statin for individuals at risk,” Neeland said.\n\n“Statins can be very helpful for long-term risk reduction and with very minimal side effects and great benefits. It’s one of those key medications that have changed the face of medicine,” Neeland added.\n\nAlso he said it’s important to keep in mind that guidelines are just guidelines. “They need to be used in clinical context and within the art and science of medicine,” Neeland said.\n\nVirani said more has to be done to prevent heart problems.\n\n“We are definitely facing a big wave of cardiovascular disease in our nation and we really need to treat it by both lifestyle therapies as well as medications when indicated,” Virani said.\n\nWhat patients can do\n\nVirani said it’s important for patients to ask their providers what their 10-year risk of having a heart attack or stroke is. It’s a calculation that needs the knowledge of an expert and cannot be done on one’s own.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“Having this conversation does not mean you need to be put on a therapy, but it will lead to a lot of important discussions even related to your lifestyle,” Virani said.\n\nAnd statins, of course, aren’t the only way to help a person prevent a heart attack or stroke.\n\nBoth USPSTF and ACC/AHA recommend patients should stop smoking, be physically active and eat a healthy diet to lower their risk.\n\n“Statins are one piece of the prevention wheel. They are not the only piece,” Neeland said. “There’s diet, physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, blood pressure control, making sure you control diabetes or a risk for diabetes.

Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nA large new study published provides evidence that people 50 and older who sleep five hours or less at night have a greater risk of developing multiple chronic diseases as they age compared with peers who get a longer night’s rest.\n\nThe study, published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine, took a closer look at a group of nearly 8,000 civil servants in the United Kingdom who had no chronic disease at age 50. Scientists asked the participants to report on how much sleep they got during clinic examinations every four to five years for the next 25 years.\n\nFor those whose sleep was tracked at age 50, people who slept five hours or less a night faced a 30% higher risk that they would develop multiple chronic diseases over time than those who slept at least seven hours a night. At 60, it was a 32% increased risk, and at 70, it was a 40% greater risk.\n\nDiseases for which there was a higher risk included diabetes, cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, depression, dementia, mental disorders, Parkinson’s and arthritis.\n\nOther research has shown that adults who do not get enough sleep – about seven to nine hours a night – have a greater chance of developing chronic diseases that also include obesity and high blood pressure, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUnlike other studies, the new one did not find that those who slept longer than nine hours had health problems, but few people in the study slept that much, and that may have affected the results.\n\nThe study has some additional limitations. Most of the subjects were White men; only about a third were women. The researchers say the civil servants also tend to be a little healthier than the general population. And the study relied on self-reported data, which is considered less reliable than if people were in a sleep study in which scientists could directly observe how the person was sleeping.\n\n“Short sleep duration in midlife and old age is associated with higher risk of onset of chronic disease and multimorbidity,” the study concluded. “These findings support the promotion of good sleep hygiene on both primary and secondary prevention by targeting behavioral and environmental conditions that affect sleep duration and quality.”\n\nSharon Cobb, who has worked on sleep research and was not involved with the new study, said it’s important because it provides more evidence that sleep and chronic conditions are related.\n\n“I think for a long time, we’ve stressed that you need your sleep. But now we’re starting to really push forward. There’s more literature coming out that sleep can affect more than just mental health. It’s also affecting more comorbidities,” said Cobb, who is the director of prelicensure nursing programs and an associate professor at the Mervyn M. Dymally School of Nursing at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles.\n\nCobb points out that duration is important with sleep, but so is quality – a factor this study did not capture. The study also doesn’t explain what may be causing the chronic conditions among the people who slept five hours or less.\n\nOther research has shown that sleep is a restorative process that, among other things, produces and regulates hormones in the body, explains Adam Knowlden, an associate professor of health science at the University of Alabama, who was not involved in the new research but is working on a different large sleep study.\n\nHormones regulate things like appetite, metabolism, sex drive, blood pressure and heart rate, body temperature, and circadian rhythms. If the body doesn’t produce adequate hormones due to a lack of sleep, that is thought to lead to chronic health problems in addition to things like fatigue, body aches and problems with blood pressure.\n\nStudies show that a lack of sleep can also increase inflammation, the body’s natural defense against infection or injury. Temporary inflammation works well to protect the body, but if it is chronic, it can lead to multiple diseases.\n\n“Sleep is always one of the biggest pieces of the equation for people to be healthy,” Knowlden said.\n\n“Often, people see the need to sleep as an inconvenience. They think to get the most out of life, they need to deprive themselves of sleep to get ahead or to be more social, but it’s really the other way around,” he said. “Most of the research shows your quality of life actually improves if you get sufficient sleep.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nKnowlden said that when people tell him they’re having trouble sleeping, he offers several recommendations.\n\nFirst, establish a consistent sleep schedule. Training your body to go to bed at a consistent hour and get up at the same time every day makes getting a regular night’s rest easier.\n\nThe bedroom should be dark, quiet and free or pets who can interfere with sleep.\n\nAvoid caffeine, alcohol and large meals before bedtime. Exercise during the day can also lead to better sleep at night.\n\n“The more we can encourage people to get a better night’s rest, the better,” Knowlden said. “Sleep impacts everything.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/health/naps-high-blood-pressure-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Napping regularly linked to high blood pressure and stroke, study ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nPeople who often nap have a greater chance of developing high blood pressure and having a stroke, a large new study has found.\n\n“This may be because, although taking a nap itself is not harmful, many people who take naps may do so because of poor sleep at night. Poor sleep at night is associated with poorer health, and naps are not enough to make up for that,” said clinical psychologist Michael Grandner in a statement. Grandner directs the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Clinic at the Banner-University Medical Center in Tucson, Arizona, and was not involved in the study.\n\nStudy participants who typically napped during the day were 12% more likely to develop high blood pressure over time and were 24% more likely to have a stroke compared with people who never napped.\n\nIf the person was younger than age 60, napping most days raised the risk of developing high blood pressure by 20% compared with people who never or rarely nap, according to the study published Monday in Hypertension, an American Heart Association journal. The AHA recently added sleep duration as one of its eight essential metrics to optimal heart and brain health.\n\nThe results held true even after researchers excluded people at high risk for hypertension, such as those with type 2 diabetes, existing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep disorders and who did night-shift work.\n\n“The results demonstrate that napping increases the incidence of hypertension and stroke, after adjusting or considering many variables known to be associated with risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke,” said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\n\n“From a clinical standpoint, I think it highlights the importance for health care providers to routinely ask patients about napping and excessive daytime sleepiness and evaluate for other contributing conditions to potentially modify the risk for cardiovascular disease,” said Zee, who was not involved in the study.\n\nLonger naps are worse\n\nThe study used data from 360,000 participants who had given information on their napping habits to the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database and research resource that followed UK residents from 2006 to 2010.\n\nTaking a regular, lengthy nap may be a sign of an underlying sleep disorder, said Dr. Raj Dasgupta of the University of Southern California. globalmoments/Adobe Stock\n\nPeople in the UK study provided blood, urine and saliva samples on a regular basis, and answered questions on napping four times over the four year study. However, the study only collected nap frequency, not duration, and relied on self-reports of napping, a limitation due to imperfect recall.\n\n“They didn’t define what a nap should be. If you’re going to be sleeping for an hour, two hours, for example, that’s not really a nap,” said sleep specialist Dr. Raj Dasgupta, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\n“A refreshing power nap that’s 15 to 20 minutes around noon to 2 p.m. is 100% the way to go if you’re sleep deprived,” said Dasgupta, who was not involved in the study. “If you have chronic insomnia we don’t encourage napping because it takes away the drive to sleep at night.”\n\nMost of the people in the study who took regular naps smoked cigarettes, drank daily, snored, had insomnia and reported being an evening person.\n\nMany of these factors could impact a person’s quality and quantity of slumber, Dasgupta said. Poor sleep causes “excessive daytime fatigue which can result in excessive napping during the day,” he said.\n\n“I do believe napping is a warning sign of an underlying sleep disorder in certain individuals,” he added. “Sleep disorders are linked to an increase in stress and weight regulation hormones which can lead to obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes – all risk factors for heart disease.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/health/balance-on-one-leg-longevity-wellness/index.html", "title": "Wobbly on one leg?

Previous research has linked the inability to stand on one leg to a greater risk of falls and to cognitive decline.\n\nThe study involved 1,702 people ages 51 to 75 living in Brazil, who were asked to balance unsupported on one leg during an initial check. Researchers told the participants to place the front of the free foot behind the standing leg, keep their arms by their sides and eyes fixed straight ahead. Up to three attempts on either foot were permitted.\n\nBeing able to balance on one leg is important for older people for a number of reasons, and it is also reflective of wider fitness and health levels, said study author Dr. Claudio Gil Araújo at Exercise Medicine Clinic - CLINIMEX - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n“We regularly need … a one-legged posture, to move out of a car, to climb or to descend a step or stair and so on. To not have this ability or being afraid in doing so, it is likely related to loss of autonomy and, in consequence, less exercise and the snowball starts,” he explained.\n\nPoor balance and longevity\n\nThe study participants had an average age of 61 and two-thirds of them were men. Around 1 in 5 failed to balance on one leg for 10 seconds at the initial checkup.\n\nResearchers monitored the participants after the initial checkup for a period of seven years, during which 123 – 7% – of the people being studied died. The proportion of deaths among those who failed the test (17.5 %) was significantly higher than deaths among those who were able to balance for 10 seconds (4.5%).\n\nMore than half of those ages 71 to 75 were unable to complete the test compared with 5% in the 51 to 55 age bracket. mheim3011/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe study found that for those unable to complete the balance test there was an 84% higher risk of death from any cause, and this link remained even when other factors – including age, sex, BMI, and preexisting conditions or health risks such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes – were taken into account.\n\nHowever, the researchers were not able to include in their analysis other variables such as recent history of falls, pattern of physical activity, exercise or sports practice, diet, smoking, and the use of medications that may interfere with balance.\n\nThe research was observational and doesn’t reveal cause and effect. The study didn’t look at any possible biological mechanisms that might explain the link between poor balance and longevity.\n\nDr. Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine in the Institute of Cardiovascular & Medical Sciences at the University of Glasgow, said the research was interesting but not definitive.\n\n“As one leg standing requires good balance, linked to brain function, good muscle strength and good blood flow, it likely integrates muscular, vascular and brain systems so it is a global test of future mortality risk – albeit crude,” said Sattar, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n\n“If someone cannot do the 10 seconds and is worried, they should reflect on their own health risks,” he said.\n\n“They could try to make positive lifestyle changes such as walking more, eating less if they realize they could do better – most underestimate importance of lifestyle to health,” he said. “But also they could consult with their doctor if, for example, they have not had risk factors for cardiovascular disease measured or other chronic conditions such as diabetes tested for.”\n\nImproving balance\n\nIn general, those who failed the test had poorer health and included a higher proportion of people who were obese and/or had heart disease, high blood pressure, and unhealthy blood fat profiles, according to the study. Type 2 diabetes was also more common among those who failed to complete the test.\n\nThe study took place between 2009 and 2020 and was part of wider research project that started in 1994.\n\nThe inability to complete the balance test rose with age, more or less doubling at subsequent 5-year intervals from the age range of 51 to 55 and onward. More than half (around 54%) of study participants ages 71 to 75 were unable to complete the test, compared with 5% in the lowest age bracket who couldn’t do it.\n\nThere were no clear trends in the deaths, or differences in the causes of death, between those able to complete the test and those who weren’t able to do so.\n\nAraújo said that balance could be substantially improved by specific training, and this was something he worked on with patients involved in a medically supervised exercise program. However, he said that he didn’t yet have the data to assess whether improving balance influenced longevity.\n\nIf you want to test your own ability to balance on one leg for 10 seconds, Araújo advised that it is best to stand close to a wall or table or another person for support.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-world/2017/12/12/trump-reportedly-drinks-12-cans-diet-coke-each-day/16286277007/", "title": "Trump reportedly drinks 12 cans of Diet Coke each day", "text": "Marwa Eltagouri\n\nThose keeping tabs on President Donald Trump’s diet know that Wendy’s and McDonald’s are staples.

The Canadian Medical Association Journal found in July that there are very few randomly controlled studies on artificial sweeteners - just seven trials involving only about 1,000 people - that looked at what happened when people consumed artificial sweeteners for more than six months.\n\nNearly half of adults and a quarter of children consume artificial sweeteners each day, according to the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nDiet soda might be a good short-term substitute for people trying to stay away from the high-sugar content of regular soda, when consumed in small amounts. Some dietitians and nutrition scientists believe sucralose and stevia, which can both be found in diet sodas, are a healthier alternative for people to enjoy sweet drinks without the calories.\n\nBut others say artificial sweeteners can confuse the brain and the body, desensitizing consumers to sugar and leading them to consume more sweets without being aware of their calorie intake.\n\nThere is one thing, however, most studies agree on: Even if diet soda is healthier, you probably shouldn’t be drinking 12 cans a day.\n\nHere’s what the risks might be if - like Trump - you do.\n\nStroke or dementia\n\nPeople who drank diet soda daily were three times more likely to develop stroke and dementia than those who consumed it weekly or less, according to a study published in April in the journal Stroke.\n\nThe study followed 2,888 people aged 45 and over for risk of stroke and 1,484 people 60 and over for dementia over 10 years. They were participants of the Framingham Heart Study, in which several thousand men and women have taken regular health tests since the 1970s.\n\nThe study found those who consumed at least one artificially sweetened drink a day, compared to less than one a week, were three times as likely to have an ischemic stroke from blood vessel blockage. They were also three times as likely to be diagnosed with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. The effect of diet sodas persisted even if the researchers controlled for factors such as diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\nBut Matthew Pace, a Boston University School of Medicine neurologist and the study’s lead author, emphasized that the research showed only a correlation - and not causation. While the risk of stroke and dementia was greater, the numbers were low.\n\n“Three percent of the people had a new stroke and five percent developed dementia, so we’re still talking about a small number of people developing either stroke or dementia,” he said in a video explaining the study.\n\nIn responding to the study, the American Beverage Association said in a statement that low-calorie sweeteners have been proven safe by worldwide government safety authorities as well as “hundreds of scientific studies.”\n\n“There is nothing in this research that counters this well-established fact,” officials said.\n\nAn unsafe amount of caffeine consumption\n\nAbout 400 milligrams of caffeine a day is what’s considered safe for most healthy adults, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThat amount is equal to four cups of brewed coffee and 10 cans of soda - two cans less than the amount Trump drinks.\n\nThat much caffeine can lead to migraines, insomnia, restlessness and muscle tremors.\n\nWeight gain\n\nObesity rates have leveled off in the last decade in terms of BMI, while the consumption of noncaloric sweeteners increased.\n\nThose patterns could mean that artificial sweeteners have helped curb obesity, but studies in recent years suggest those sweeteners are causing the exact thing the people consuming them are hoping to avoid: weight gain.\n\nThe Canadian Medical Association Journal study in July found there wasn’t much evidence proving sweeteners prevented weight loss. Researchers looked at 30 studies tracking people’s diets over time and found that those who consumed sweeteners were more likely to have increases in their waist and waistlines - and had a higher risk of obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes and strokes.\n\n“I think originally it was calories were the problem, and we’ve made something that was zero calories, so we’re good,” Meghan Azad, a researcher at the University of Manitoba, told The Washington Post in July. “But we’re learning that it’s not just about the calories.”\n\nIn 2015, researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio examined data for nearly 10 years from 749 Mexican Americans and European Americans ages 65 and older and found that daily and occasional diet soda drinkers gained almost three times as much belly fat as non-drinkers.\n\nOccasional diet soda drinkers added an average of 1.83 inches to their waist circumferences, while the non-drinkers added .8 inches over the nearly 10-year period. Those who consumed diet soda daily gained 3.16 inches.\n\nBut some reports show that the benefits or harm of artificial sweeteners depend on what they’re paired with.\n\nFor example, a 2012 study by The New England Journal of Medicine found that Dutch children who consumed one artificially sweetened beverage each day for 18 months gained less weight than those who drank one sugary beverage a day.\n\nThen, in August, Dana Small, a neuroscientist at Yale University, told Vox that her research suggests artificial sweeteners could cause weight gain if consumed with carbohydrates, because the blend of foods disrupts the body’s metabolic response. A diet drink consumed on an empty stomach could be less harmful than one consumed with, say, a Big Mac.\n\nIt’s a concerning discovery, she said, because food companies are designing “healthier” products that contain blends of sweeteners and carbohydrates. For example, Chobani’s Simply 100 yogurt contains 14 grams of carbohydrate (six of them from sugar) and stevia leaf extract, Vox reported.\n\nPeople who drink three or more artificially sweetened beverages a day, Small told Vox, could be more likely to drink them during meals with carbs that disrupt the body’s metabolic response.\n\nIn various Q & As during his campaign, Trump expressed his love for pasta, second helpings of potatoes au gratin and steak.\n\nIf he’s drinking 12 cans of Diet Coke a day, it’s likely he’s drinking some of them with carbs.\n\nTrump tweeted “I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.”\n\nTrump also tweeted “People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let’s face it—this stuff just doesn’t work. It makes you hungry.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/health/women-early-alzheimer-intervention-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Women responded better to early Alzheimer's interventions, study ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter age and genetics, being a woman is the single most important risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease, experts say.\n\n“Two out of every three brains affected by Alzheimer’s disease are women’s brains,” said Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic in the Center for Brain Health at Florida Atlantic University’s Schmidt College of Medicine.\n\nNow, a new study has good news when it comes to giving women a chance to reduce their increased risk. Personalized lifestyle interventions – such as diet, exercise, stress reduction and sleep hygiene – were able to reduce Alzheimer’s risk factors in both sexes, but they worked even better in women.\n\n“Our individually tailored interventions led to greater improvements in women compared to men across risk scales for Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disease,” said Isaacson, who coauthored the paper.\n\nWomen also showed greater improvements than men in biomarkers such as lower blood sugar and lower LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, which is the “bad” cholesterol.\n\nLifestyle changes such as increased exercise, improved sleep and diet, and reduced stress can impact brain health. Jacek Chabraszewski/Adobe Stock\n\n“This study clearly reinforces the need for additional larger studies to be able to better predict the baseline cognitive trajectory in aging females versus males,” said Rudy Tanzi, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. He is director of the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\n“As we aim to find ways to nip this disease in the bud stage, we will need to know if prevention and treatment strategies will work equivalently on both men and women. This new study clearly brings us a big step closer to that goal,” said Tanzi, who was not involved in the study.\n\nImpact of personalized interventions\n\nThe new study followed a subset of people participating in a 10-year study designed to test the impact of personalized recommendations on cognitive function and risk factors for dementia. The Comparative Effectiveness Dementia and Alzheimer’s Registry trial, which began in 2018, is being conducted at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City.\n\nAfter full blood, physical, cognitive and genetic workups, patients were provided with individualized genetic counseling and education. Medications, vitamins and supplements were tailored to each person’s unique results as well. In addition, all participants received personalized lifestyle interventions, such as counseling on exercise, diet, blood pressure control, sleep hygiene and stress reduction.\n\nEveryone in the CEDAR trial has a family history of Alzheimer’s, but the majority had no signs of cognitive decline when the study began, Isaacson said. Of the 154 men and women participating in the research, 35 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, due to Alzheimer’s, but it was not severe enough to “impact their daily lives,” he said.\n\nThe original study’s main findings were published in 2019. People with MCI saw their performance on cognitive tests for memory and thinking skills improve by nearly 5 points when they followed at least 60% of their lifestyle recommendations (on average, at least 12 of the 21 different recommendations) for 18 months.\n\nHowever, the 2019 study found that people with mild cognitive impairment who followed less than 60% of the suggestions showed no cognitive improvement – in fact, they continued to decline by 6 points on average.\n\nThe cognitively normal patients with a family history of Alzheimer’s disease, called the prevention group, were able to get an “equally impressive” cognitive boost of an average of 4.5 points by following at least some of the lifestyle recommendations. It didn’t seem to matter if they followed less than 60% of them, Isaacson said.\n\n“The good news from our study is that there were actually cognitive improvements at 18 months in both women and men when compared to the control populations,” Isaacson said. “A lot of the drugs that have been studied aim to delay cognitive decline, but it is harder to show improved cognition over time.”\n\nApproximately half of the participants in CEDAR carry at least one APOE gene, which may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. However, the study found no difference in the intervention’s cognitive benefits for those with one or two copies of APOE compared with those without the gene, “so that was also reassuring,” Isaacson said.\n\nImpact on women versus men\n\nThe new study, published Tuesday in the journal of the Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease, took the original 2019 study a step further by analyzing a subset of participants to see whether there was any difference between men and women when it came to how well the lifestyle interventions work.\n\n“Women have very different and unique risk factors than men for dementia,” Isaacson said. “Women have a 39% higher risk of dementia if they have fat accumulating around their midsection.\n\n“And the rapid decline in estrogen during the perimenopause transition can actually be one of the most impactful risk factors for developing Alzheimer’s pathology in the brain,” he said.\n\nIn the new analysis, women in the prevention group, who started the trial with no cognitive issues, demonstrated greater improvements than men in two areas: one of two cardiovascular risk scales and in levels of the good cholesterol, HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, which is protective against heart disease.\n\nWomen with mild cognitive decline, called the early treatment group, showed greater improvements than men when it came to average blood sugar levels and two cardiovascular risk scales. This female cohort also had more significant improvements in several important cholesterol (or lipid) biomarkers than men in the early treatment group.\n\nFor all participants, complying with an additional 10% of the personalized recommendations resulted in an additional 0.9 point improvement for women and 0.41 points of improvement for men on tests of cognition.\n\nHow does reducing cardiovascular risk impact future cognition? Because what’s good for the heart is good for the brain, experts say.\n\n“Vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar or diabetes may not be the cause of Alzheimer’s disease, but it can fast-forward Alzheimer’s pathology,” Isaacson said. “I would prefer to slam on the brakes rather than rev the engine on the path to cognitive decline.”\n\nFinding that women were able to reduce their risk even more than men is welcome news, Isaacson said, as it provides a promising area for future study and gives hope that women can tip the battle against Alzheimer’s in their favor.\n\n“By treating people in an evidence-based yet safe way, using multiple lifestyle and medical interventions, we’ve shown that you can really make an impact on brain health,” he said.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}]}

A source familiar with the dinner confirmed to CNN that Trump on Tuesday met with Fuentes and West, who became engulfed in controversy after repeating antisemitic conspiracy theories and making other offensive claims during an appearance on a podcast in October.\n\nThe source said that Fuentes was a guest of West, who attended the dinner along with Karen Giorno, who ran Trump’s 2016 Florida campaign, and another unidentified man. The group feasted on a Thanksgiving dinner for roughly two hours at Trump’s outdoor patio table.\n\nTrump was engaged with Fuentes and found him “very interesting,” the source said, particularly Fuentes’ abilities to rattle off statistics and data, and his familiarity with Trump world.\n\nDuring the dinner, Fuentes told Trump that he was familiar with “Trump’s base,” which preferred Trump being natural and himself, speaking off the cuff and ad-libbing. Trump said that his advisers don’t like that, and want him reading from the teleprompter.\n\nAt one point during the dinner, Trump declared that he “liked” Fuentes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback GOP governor calls Trump's dinner with a Holocaust denier and Kanye West 'very troubling' 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\nAccording to the source, the dinner grew tense at various times, including after West asked Trump to join his 2024 campaign ticket for president as vice president, which Trump “laughed off.” The source could not pinpoint the exact moment the former president’s mood shifted.\n\nTrump acknowledged the dinner in a post on Truth Social Friday stating: “This past week, Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Shortly thereafter, he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends, whom I knew nothing about. We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio. The dinner was quick and uneventful. They then left for the airport.”\n\nTrump repeated later Friday that he “didn’t know” Fuentes and had offered West business as well as political advice.\n\n“I told him he should definitely not run for President, ‘any voters you may have should vote for TRUMP,’” the former president wrote on Truth Social. “Anyway, we got along great, he expressed no anti-Semitism, & I appreciated all of the nice things he said about me on ‘Tucker Carlson.’”\n\nThe White House on Friday condemned Fuentes’ appearance at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Former GOP lawmaker identifies 'larger problem' after Trump's dinner 02:15 - Source: CNN\n\n“Bigotry, hate, and antisemitism have absolutely no place in America - including at Mar-A-Lago. Holocaust denial is repugnant and dangerous, and it must be forcefully condemned,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to CNN.\n\nDavid Friedman, Trump’s former Ambassador to Israel, also condemned the former president’s association with West and Fuentes.\n\n“To my friend Donald Trump, you are better than this. Even a social visit from an antisemite like Kanye West and human scum like Nick Fuentes is unacceptable. I urge you to throw those bums out, disavow them and relegate them to the dustbin of history where they belong,” he said in a pair of tweets Friday afternoon. “Antisemites deserve no quarter among American leaders, right or left.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Kanye West's Hitler 'obsession' helped create hostile work environment, source says 03:25 - Source: CNN\n\nWest’s recent antisemitic remarks caused companies that he was affiliated with – including Adidas and Balenciaga – to sever their relationships with him. He has made numerous inflammatory statements over the years, including assertions that slavery was a “choice” and “racism is a dated concept.”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League has identified Fuentes as a White supremacist and he has been banned from most major social media platforms for his White nationalist rhetoric. Fuentes was present on the grounds of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and he has promoted Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about fraud in the 2020 election. The House select committee investigating the events of January 6 issued a subpoena to Fuentes in January.\n\nWest tweeted late Tuesday night that he had kept Trump waiting during his first visit to Mar-a-Lago due to rain and traffic. And Right Wing Watch, a project of the left-leaning group People for the American Way, posted Tuesday footage of West and Fuentes walking through the Miami airport together. That footage was included in the video West posted on Twitter.\n\nThis story has been updated with new reporting about the dinner.", "authors": ["Maeve Reston Kristen Holmes", "Maeve Reston", "Kristen Holmes"], "publish_date": "2022/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/06/27/how-to-watch-the-presidential-debate/74230247007/", "title": "How to watch the presidential debate: Time, channel guide", "text": "U.S. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face off on Thursday in the CNN Presidential Debate, the first of the 2024 election cycle and more than four months before the November election.\n\nJune 27 will mark the first match-up since 2020 featuring either Trump or Biden since neither participated in primary debates this cycle and the first-ever debate between a sitting and former president, according to the Atlanta-based network.\n\nIt’s also the first in decades not to be held by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has organized presidential debates since 1988.\n\nViewers can tune into the ‘CNN Presidential Debate,’ Thursday, June 27, at 8 pm Central time on CNN or simulcast on USA Today via YouTube.

The former “Will & Grace” star was among dozens of celebrity Democratic supporters and activists who joined a call with White House aides last Monday to discuss the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe mood was fatalistic, according to three people on the call, which was also co-organized by the advocacy group Build Back Better Together.\n\nMessing said she’d gotten Joe Biden elected and wanted to know why she was being asked to do anything at all, yelling that there didn’t even seem a point to voting. Others wondered why the call was happening.\n\nThat afternoon, participants received a follow-up email with a list of basic talking points and suggestions of Biden speech clips to share on TikTok.\n\nThe call, three days after the decision eliminating federal abortion rights, encapsulates the overwhelming sense of frustration among Democrats with Biden. It offers a new window into what many in the President’s party describe as a mismanagement permeating the White House.\n\nTop Democrats complain the President isn’t acting with – or perhaps is even capable of – the urgency the moment demands.\n\n“Rudderless, aimless and hopeless” is how one member of Congress described the White House.\n\nTwo dozen leading Democratic politicians and operatives, as well as several within the West Wing, tell CNN they feel this goes deeper than questions of ideology and posture. Instead, they say, it gets to questions of basic management.\n\nMore than a week after the abortion decision, top Biden aides are still wrangling over releasing new actions in response, despite the draft decision leaking six weeks earlier.\n\nWhite House counsel Dana Remus had assured senior aides the Supreme Court wouldn’t rule on abortion that day. A White House press aide assigned to the issue was walking to get coffee when the alert hit. Several Democratic leaders privately mocked how the President stood in the foyer of the White House, squinting through his remarks from a teleprompter as demonstrators poured into the streets, making only vague promises of action because he and aides hadn’t decided on more.\n\nThen, Biden’s July 1 meeting with governors to talk about their efforts to protect abortion rights was planned so last minute that none of those who attended came in person, and several of those invited declined to rearrange their schedules to appear virtually.\n\nMultiple Democratic politicians who have reached out to work with Biden – whether it’s on specific bills, brainstorming or outreach – often don’t hear anything back at all. Potential appointees have languished for months waiting to hear if they’ll get jobs, or when they’ll be done with vetting. Invitations to events are scarce, thank you calls barely happen. Even some aides within the White House wonder why Biden didn’t fire anyone, from the West Wing or at the Food and Drug Administration, to demonstrate some accountability or at least anger over the baby formula debacle.\n\nInside the White House, aides are exhausted from feeling forever on red alert, batting at a swarm of crises that keeps growing – enough for White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre to make an offhand joke about the constant “eleventh hour” decision-making in the building when under fire at a recent daily briefing.\n\nSeveral officials say Biden’s tendency to berate advisers when he’s displeased with how a situation is being handled or when events go off poorly has trickled down the ranks in the West Wing, leaving several mid-level aides feeling blamed for failings despite lacking any real ability to influence the building’s decision-making. That’s contributed to some of the recent staff departures, according to people familiar.\n\nDemocrats worry the lack of decisions and authority are deepening their own midterm problems and feeding a sense that the President couldn’t truly handle the extra complications of a run for reelection in 2024 – and along the way, reinforcing narratives that he’s an old man not fit for the moment.\n\nThe President who campaigned on putting America back together again after four years of deep divisions appears to have stopped trying, supporters say.\n\n“There’s no fight,” another Democratic member told CNN. “People understand that a lot of this is out of his hands – but what you want to see is the President out there swinging.”\n\n‘Throwing spaghetti at the wall’\n\nA year and a half in, the Biden administration is struggling to untangle supply chains and tackle soaring inflation— which is by far the biggest problem facing Democrats up and down the ballot in November.\n\n“It’s got to look like you’re taking actions,” said California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna. “Any economist who says the President shouldn’t do anything on the economy should be fired. They can be at a think tank, they can be a professor. But they shouldn’t be at the White House.”\n\n“There’s not a frontline office out there that isn’t frustrated with the lack of action coming from the White House on inflation,” one aide told a member fighting to hang onto an endangered seat. “At the very least, the President should get caught trying to bring prices down just about every day.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden calls for a federal gas tax holiday as he speaks about gas prices during remarks in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building's South Court Auditorium at the White House on June 22, 2022. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nWhite House aides say that is exactly what they are doing. In the past few months, the administration has announced a historic release of oil from the nation’s strategic petroleum reserve, invoked the Defense Production Act to address baby formula shortages, and even floated a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax.\n\nBut none of these moves have solved the problems: The baby formula shortage persists, inflation remains high and gas prices, though slightly down from their high, are still hovering close to $5 a gallon.\n\nBiden’s support of a gas tax holiday was the subject of months of deliberations among officials – many of whom were against it and privately suggested it was a purely political step to show initiative on gas prices, and only recently put the question in front of Biden directly.\n\n“It had the appearance of throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks,” one official said privately.\n\nBottlenecks and indecision\n\nSources also say that decisions in the White House are getting bottlenecked, as veteran advisers urge Biden to take the long view, rather than focus on fast responses. Few are trying, and even fewer succeeding, in pushing back against Biden’s infamous inability to settle on decisions, on everything from whether to lift tariffs on Chinese imports or cancel student loan debt.\n\nBiden has been mulling what to do on student loans for more than a year. White House staff drafted a memo on the topic weeks ago, and a final decision is now being targeted ahead of when the current repayment pause expires on August 31 – further aggravating progressives who say Biden’s indecision is hurting people with debt who are trying to make plans, and losing much of the political benefit he could get from it.\n\n“We picked that date for a reason: we’d like to see where the inflation problem is, and we’d like to see where our legislative agenda is. There’s nothing uncertain or hesitating about it: it’s a deadline, and we will deliver on it,” White House spokesperson Chris Meagher told CNN about the timeline.\n\nPresident Joe Biden listens to a question during an interview with the Associated Press in the Oval Office of the White House, June 16, 2022. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nTaking time on major decisions isn’t a bad thing, White House aides argue, and neither is taking seriously, for example, that independent agencies like the FDA and US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention are supposed to function without the President’s direct interference – something Biden allies say is a key differentiation from the last President.\n\n“This is what separates him from Donald Trump, and it’s an important separation. He says, ‘I am not a dictator. I am not an autocrat,’” said Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor who’s coordinating the implementation of the $1 trillion infrastructure law passed last year.\n\nWhite House officials also lament not getting more help from their colleagues in Congress, most recently on trying to lower gas prices. If congressional Democrats thought Biden took too long to offer his gas tax holiday proposal, the thinking in the White House goes, they could have easily come up with another idea of their own, and sooner. Aides also eagerly point out how much support multiple polls show for Biden’s proposal.\n\nLandrieu ticked off a number of initiatives the White House has gotten behind and hoped for congressional action by Democrats only to have bills languish.\n\n“The President has called on Congress to pass a reconciliation bill. The President has called on Congress to pass the COMPETES Act. The President has called on Congress to reduce prescription drugs, to reduce costs to health care, to fill in the gap on the challenges with the Affordable Care Act and to continue to basically do everything they can, and Congress has gone, ‘Oh, well, we can’t do anything.’ So it’s just the nature of politics sometimes you just say, ‘I wish somebody else would help,’ when we’re really this is all hands on deck,” said Landrieu.\n\n‘Scapegoating the President’\n\nThroughout, the President’s defenders argue, Biden is the one who’s taking action, even if much of that action is out of view. They hold up the gun legislation passed by Congress as a perfect example of how his approach works even if not always in the spotlight: Biden deliberately left the negotiations to the rank-and-file members to avoid aggravating a delicate situation.\n\nWhite House aides checked in daily, and Biden spoke several times with Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who led the efforts. “The President’s early attention to this issue was a big part of setting the table for the process that led to the bill’s passage,” Murphy told CNN.\n\nInside the White House, criticism and proposals from fellow Democrats are often seen as the latest version of, essentially, presidential fan fiction – the kind of visceral, political statement that sounds great from the sidelines but doesn’t actually make sense.\n\nPresident Joe Biden meets with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to discuss the state of the American and global economy in the Oval Office at the White House on May 30, 2022. Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nFor example, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s abortion reversal, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul have called for the White House to open up federal lands to abortion clinics, a move that lawyers inside and some outside the government believe would backfire by leaving abortion providers and women open to potential prosecution as soon as they stepped off the federal lands.\n\nFundamentally, Biden and his aides are operating from a very different sense of the presidency. He’s being realistic, they believe, and responsible – not just because his options are truly limited, but specifically because he’s trying to restore the structural integrity of the government and of democracy after four years of Trump. They also see him as taking a more integrated view – moving on canceling student loan debt, for example, they believe, could imperil whatever is left of the legislative agenda that is starting to emerge from Senate negotiations.\n\nBiden has been batting away complaints that he’s out of sync with his party since before he launched his presidential campaign.\n\n“The country didn’t elect Joe Biden because they wanted a Democratic Donald Trump to go out there every day and divide the country more,” said Cedric Richmond, who left his own seat in Congress to serve in the West Wing for Biden’s first year. Democrats attacking Biden are “scapegoating the President, or distracted and not focusing on what they should be focused on. He saved democracy once by beating a tyrant. He’s doing it again, but he doesn’t do it by beating his chest.”\n\nThe attacks Biden is facing now are “the same foolishness that got us Donald Trump – ‘Hillary wasn’t good enough,’ ‘She’s not fighting hard enough,’” Richmond said. “That’s what got us Donald Trump. And that got us Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Case closed.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/09/27/gop-republican-debate-live-updates/70982273007/", "title": "Republican debate highlights: UAW strike, a government shutdown ...", "text": "SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — Republican presidential candidates gathered in California on Wednesday for the second GOP primary debate of the 2024 election season.\n\nThe seven candidates who qualified for the event in Simi Valley battled over issues ranging from abortion rights in American to the war in Ukraine and healthcare costs. The White House hopefuls addressed the spread of fentanyl in the United States and workers' rights.\n\nBut the debate also turned personal Former President Donald Trump didn't attend the debate, but his Republican rivals took time to launch new attacks against the GOP frontrunner. As former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley sparred with South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, she told him to \"bring it\" on the debate stage.\n\nThe Republican hopefuls started off the debate by discussing the United Auto Workers strike, with several criticizing President Joe Biden for joining the workers on the picket line earlier this week.\n\nSen. Tim Scott showed a feistier side in this debate, taking on Vivek Ramaswamy for having done business with China.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis jabbed at GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for not participating in the debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action.

Nikki Haley or current Sen. Tim Scott.\n\n\"Twelve years - where have you been?\" Haley asked Scott, citing the Senate's uneven record on issues like debt and federal spending.\n\nScott responded that Haley's experience as governor is inadequate, and the two drowned out each other in argument. It was broken up by DeSantis, who touted his own record as governor of Florida.\n\nHaley shot back at Scott \"Bring it, Tim.\"\n\nBoth Haley and Scott are aiming for the South Carolina primary on Feb. 24 - if they can make it that far.\n\n– David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy spar over Ukraine, China\n\nAnother fight broke out between Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy over foreign policy, this time over Russia’s war against Ukraine, as he said the candidates need to “level with the American people” on the issue.\n\n“Just because…Putin’s an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good,” he said, bringing up the country’s ban on 11 political parties with ties to Russia.\n\nInterrupting him, Haley said, “A win for Russia is a win for China.” She added, “But I forgot, you like China.”\n\nRamaswamy hit back that “hurling personal insults” were not helping.\n\nMike Pence also got in on the action, arguing that letting Russian President Vladimir Putin have Ukraine would be a “greenlight” to China to invade Taiwan. “Peace comes through strength,” Pence responded, in a nod to Reagan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nNikki Haley criticizes Donald Trump on his handling of China\n\nNikki Haley, who served as an ambassador to the United Nations under the Trump administration, took a jab at her former boss for his handling of China.\n\nShe said that she would end all normal trade relations with China until it stops contributing to the spread of fentanyl.\n\n“This is where President Trump went wrong,” Haley said. “He focused on trade with China. He didn't focus on the fact that they were buying up our farm and he didn't focus on the fact that they were killing Americans. He didn't focus on the fact that they were stealing $600 billion in intellectual property.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley tells Vivek Ramaswamy 'Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber'\n\nVivek Ramaswamy tried to defuse the biggest criticism of him: That he's a young and arrogant \"know-it-all\" who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\n\"I'm here to tell you, I don’t know it all,\" Ramaswamy said, adding that he knows how to use staff and develop a strong organization.\n\nHis rivals didn't seem convinced, especially Haley.\n\nNoting that Ramaswamy has joined TikTok while pledging to confront Chinese spying, Haley told the upstart candidate: \"Every time I hear you I feel a little bit dumber for what you say.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMike Pence: ‘I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American’\n\nWhen asked how he would protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination and violent attacks, Mike Pence said “I’ll stand up for the safety and the civil liberties of every American from every background.”\n\nBut Pence quickly turned to transgender children and their rights at school.\n\n“We've got to empower parents at the state level with the ability to choose where the kids go to school, whether it's public, private, parochial or homeschool,” Pence said. “You empower parents, and our schools will straighten up and reflect our values and focus on the basics faster than you can possibly imagine.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'How it's done': Ron DeSantis touts education record\n\nRon DeSantis answered controversy around Florida’s new history curriculum, which requires teachers to instruct students on “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” The Florida governor called criticism and response to the change a “hoax” led by Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nDeSantis turned his comments to Florida’s other education policies, including the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by opponents. The law bans instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in grades K-12.\n\n“Florida is showing how it’s done,” DeSantis said, boasting his administration’s focus parents’ rights and having “eliminated critical race theory.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence takes on 'former running mate' Trump\n\nMike Pence also got in a few digs at Donald Trump on Wednesday, faulting him for proposals that would expand government.\n\nReferring to the ex-president as \"my former running mate,\" Pence said that \"Donald Trump has a plan to consolidate more power to the government.\"\n\nIt looked like a planned attack: Pence dragged in Trump after a question about whether former President Barack Obama's health care would survive all Republican efforts to repeal it. However, Pence did not address Obamacare.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley calls for transparency in the healthcare system\n\nNikki Haley told a story about her mother being in the hospital, and when healthcare workers tried to bring her Tylenol and she refused, they said ‘honey, go ahead and take it because you're paying for it anyway.’\n\n“Why is it that when we got the bill, the insurance company in the hospital negotiated the bill for her without her having anything to do with it?” Haley said. “When I'm president, we will bring all that from the insurance company to the hospitals.\n\n\"We will make it all transparent because when you do that, you realize that's what the problem is,\" Haley added.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Address fentanyl crisis by sealing border, addressing mental health\n\nWhen asked how he would stop fentanyl brought into the country through ports of entry, Vivek Ramaswamy said that there’s two sides to the issue: seal the southern border and address the mental health epidemic in America.\n\nHe referenced two parents he met whose son died after buying Percocet on Snapchat.\n\n“It is our job to make sure that never happens,” Ramaswamy said. “But it's also our job to make sure that 17 year olds don't turn to Percocet via Snapchat. We have to bring back mental health care in this country, not with pumping pharmaceuticals but with faith based approaches.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMore politics, in your inbox.

It's a reference to the Chinese Communist Party\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRon DeSantis: Donald Trump is 'missing in action'\n\nFollowing Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis also invoked Donald Trump's absence from the debate by saying that Biden and others are \"missing in action\" when it comes to national leadership.\n\n\"You know who else is missing in action?\" DeSantis said, referencing the former president's choice to skip the second GOP debate. \"Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be here!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Missing in action':Ron DeSantis blast Donald Trump for skipping the GOP presidential debate\n\nVivek Ramaswamy veers from Tim Scott, sides with workers\n\nWhile saying he agrees with the “spirit” of Tim Scott’s comments on the ongoing UAW strike, Vivek Ramaswamy added that he sympathizes with workers.\n\n“I understand that hardship is not a choice,” Ramaswamy said, referencing his own family and upbringing. He added, though, that he believes “victimhood\" is a choice and told workers to picket outside the White House in Washington in a message to President Joe Biden.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMike Pence: Joe Biden should be on the unemployment line, not the picket line\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence pulls out the first pre-planned line of the night, saying that Biden \"doesn't belong on the picket line - he belongs on the unemployment line.\"\n\nLike the other candidates, Pence hits Biden for the condition of the economy. The group of GOP hopefuls quickly zeroed in on inflation, jobs and other economic issues.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott weighs in on UAW strike, blasts Biden\n\nTim Scott, when asked about his previous comments that striking workers should be fired, said that the president can’t fire anyone in the private sector.\n\nHowever, he criticized workers for wanting additional benefits and fewer hours, saying that this will simply not stand.\n\nHe also blasted Biden for being on the picket line in Michigan to show support to striking autoworkers and said the president should be at the southern border instead.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump praises unions, attacks Joe Biden, mocks GOP rivals before debate\n\nSeeking to divert attention from a debate among his Republican opponents, Donald Trump traveled to Michigan for a speech extolling union members, attacking President Joe Biden, and mocking his GOP campaign opponents.\n\n\"You know, we're competing with the job candidates,\" Trump said at one point during an event in Clinton Township, Mich., adding he didn't even see a potential vice president or Cabinet secretary in the group.\n\nTrump designed his speech on \"economic nationalism\" to take advantage of the ongoing auto workers strike. He blamed it on Biden, saying his emphasis on electric cars will lead to the elimination of auto workers' jobs.\n\n\"Yesterday, Joe Biden came to Michigan to pose for photos at the picket line,\" Trump said. \"But it's his policies that send Michigan auto workers to the unemployment line!\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTim Scott needs a breakout moment. Will this debate be his chance?\n\nTim Scott, who is lagging in the Republican primary polls, struggled to have a breakout moment on stage in the last debate, often disappearing into the background as other candidates sparred over issues like Ukraine aid and abortion.\n\nThis debate, however, could look different.\n\nModerators could contrast Scott's positions with Nikki Haley, since both candidates are from South Carolina. The senator will also likely face questions about a complaint filed by the UAW over his comments supporting the idea that striking workers should be fired.\n\nBut Scott has said he doesn’t think he needs a standout moment on stage in the second debate\n\n“What I need to do is continue to do what I have been doing — showing up,” Scott told “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate fact check: Follow along live\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data?

You can also expect a lot of attacks on President Joe Biden on these issues, many of which will follow the campaign for the next 13-and-a-half months.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a previous proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublican debate in the shadows\n\nThe Ronald Reagan presidential library is nestled in the mountains of Simi Valley, Calif., but the candidates who debate here Wednesday night will be in some political shadows.\n\nAs much or more attention is being given to Donald Trump's speech in Michigan, and a prospective government shutdown is also soaking up media coverage.\n\nThat means the GOP challengers will have to work extra hard to get attention, perhaps on the topics of Trump and the shutdown.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRepublican candidates on immigration\n\nOfficials in New York City and San Diego have recently warned about the migrant crisis in their cities that have overwhelmed shelters, schools and other services.\n\nAnd Republican White House hopefuls will likely discuss immigration and the U.S. southern border during Wednesday's debate.\n\nOne candidate has already vowed to bring up the issue. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday that his first action if elected to the White House will be to send the National Guard to the border. He has also criticized Trump and Biden’s border policies and said he would be the only candidate willing to address the issue head on at the second debate.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAnd then there were 7: Asa Hutchinson, other candidates aren't debating in Simi Valley\n\nThe debate stage in Simi Valley will be a little less crowded than the last time the GOP candidates went up against one another.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson barely made the August debate and did not meet the threshold for the September match. He’ll be watching on Wednesday evening from a Washington, D.C. hotel.\n\nHe is the only candidate who qualified for the first debate who missed the mark the second time.\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, pastor Ryan Binkley, radio host Larry Elder and businessman Perry Johnson have not qualified for any of the primary debates yet.\n\nGOP frontrunner Donald Trump has met the donor and polling requirements, but he has declined to go head-to-head with his opponents so far.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates try to appeal to \"maybe Trump\" voters while he's in Michigan\n\nThe Republican debaters are looking for any slivers of good news in the polls, and they found a little bit this week: Many self-proclaimed Trump voters also say they are open to other candidates.\n\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, \"most voters are still considering multiple candidates,\" CBS News said about its most recent survey of those states. These \"maybe Trump\" voters will be big targets in the debate.\n\nMany of the Republican presidential candidates have hesitated to criticize Trump for fear of alienating the many Republican voters who have backed him in the past. Those are voters they'll need if they are to somehow wrest the GOP presidential nomination away from him in 2024.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWill there be a Democratic primary debate?\n\nJoe Biden probably won't take the debate stage with his Democratic rivals.\n\nIf an incumbent president is running, political parties usually rally around that person's reelection bid. There's no formal rule, but at this point, Biden is the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nGavin Newsom: Republican debate is ‘vice presidential debate at best’\n\nThe second Republican presidential primary debate is nothing more than a try out to be Donald Trump’s running mate in 2024. At least that’s how California Gov. Gavin Newsom sees things.\n\n“This is a vice presidential debate at best,” he told CBS News. “This is the JV team.”\n\nNewsom, whose state is where Wednesday’s discussion is taking place, has been a surrogate for the Biden campaign and has vigorously defended the president and Democratic Party's record. He emphasized how Trump is “running away” with the primary in every poll.\n\n“This is the XFL, and it’s entertainment, I guess,” he said.\n\nNewsom is also set to debate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis later this year in Georgia in a Fox News event\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHow will the Republican candidates line up?\n\nThere's a new debate lineup tonight, and not just because there are only seven candidates on stage.\n\nJust like the first Republican debate in Milwaukee, poll averages helped determine where the candidates will stand on stage: Nikki Haley and Tim Scott have moved up, while Mike Pence has moved down.\n\nOnce again, Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy are listed first and second, and will be in the middle of the pack on stage at the Ronald Reagan library.\n\nHaley and Tim Scott will be on either side of those first two, in the 3 and 4 slots. Chris Christie is in the fifth position, Pence is in sixth, and the late-qualifying Doug Burgum is in seventh.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhich candidates would pardon former President Trump?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is facing four sets of criminal charges, and it has raised questions among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected president − and he's found guilty.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, who has defended Trump on the campaign trail, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have leaned towards a pardon, though Haley noted in interviews that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis indicated he would be pursuing pardons aggressively if he's elected but hasn’t given a definitive answer on Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoug Burgum will appear on the debate stage - this time without an injured leg\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, the final candidate to qualify for the debate, will appear on stage with six other candidates vying for the Republican nomination. But with this debate, he won't have just injured his leg.\n\nBurgum, 67, was rushed to a emergency room after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball a day before the first GOP debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin last month. But he still made it on stage the next day.\n\n“I think I took them a little too literally when they said go to Milwaukee and break a leg,” he joked on stage that day.\n\nSudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Republican candidates clash with Ramaswamy again?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy will again be near the center of the debate stage, ensuring high-profile skirmishes with other candidates, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\"\n\nIn the last debate, many candidates sparred with Ramaswamy over his lack of experience and some of his controversial stances on foreign policy and former President Donald Trump’s indictments, which will likely resurface in the second debate.\n\nRamaswamy has leaned on ultra-conservative values to try to appeal to voters, but he has also reached out to younger Republicans as the youngest Republican candidate in the field.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGOP debate live updates:Republicans face off for 2nd time at Ronald Reagan library\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on abortion?\n\nNikki Haley reiterated her abortion stance in the first Republican debate, arguing that leaders need to find consensus on the issue, including agreeing to not jail women who have the procedure. A self-described “pro-life” candidate, Haley said Republicans need to be honest about a national ban, which would require 60 votes in the Senate.\n\nMike Pence, abortion’s harshest opponent among the Republican candidates, took immediate issue with Haley’s comments during the event, saying abortion is “a moral issue.”\n\nMost Republican candidates, including Chris Christie and Doug Burgum, have dodged the question by saying they would leave the issues to the states.\n\nRon DeSantis has touted his record on the issue as Florida governor, having signed a statewide six-week ban into law earlier this year.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nNikki Haley seeks to keep the debate spotlight\n\nMany Republicans said Nikki Haley \"won\" the first debate − she certainly garnered the best reviews − and they are watching to see if the former South Carolina governor can do it again.\n\nAfter the Aug. 23 set-to in Milwaukee, Haley saw a spike in fundraising and poll numbers. She passed DeSantis for second place in a few national and state polls.\n\nThat may make her a target tonight for other Republican candidates, as the former United Nations ambassador seeks to make it two in a row.\n\n\"America deserves a choice, not an echo,\" Haley said in a pre-debate post on the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on transgender rights?\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed multiple anti-trans bills in Florida earlier this year targeted at gender-affirming care for minors, instruction of gender identity in schools and more.\n\nHe isn’t alone among the Republican candidates. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a law that allows schools and government employees to ignore pronouns that transgender individuals use.\n\nOther GOP candidates have also been vocally opposed to transgender rights. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has made disparaging remarks about transgender individuals, and former Vice President Mike Pence said he wouldn’t allow transgender Americans to serve in the military.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie stands apart. He has said he opposes transgender health care bans, along with other measures.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat are the candidates saying about Donald Trump's criminal indictments?\n\nDonald Trump’s four sets of criminal charges in both federal and state cases have led some of his rivals to fiercely defend him – while others have knocked him.\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has taken the former position, alleging without evidence that the indictments are politically motivated. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have also condemned the indictments on the campaign trail.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about the indictments.\n\nMeanwhile, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, two of Trump's most vocal critics, have argued that the Republican Party can't stand behind Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence said in response to federal allegations that Trump tried to steal the 2020 presidential election that anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican debate moderator Dana Perino: The 'rubber meets the road' for GOP debaters\n\nFor students of political history, one of tonight's debate moderators will look familiar: She's a former White House press secretary.\n\nDana Perino, the chief spokeswoman for President George W. Bush and now a Fox News host, says tonight's showdown is where \"the rubber meets the road\" for GOP candidates who are struggling to catch the front-running Trump.\n\n\"This is the moment where all of them realize, 'if I don't have some sort of break-out moment to show that I could be the rival, the alternative to President Trump, their campaigns probably start to lose even more steam,'\" Perino told Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe other moderators tonight are Fox Business Network host Stuart Varney and Univision anchor Ilia Calderón.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates. “It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped. What a difference a few years makes. The nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Earlier this year, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. – John Fritze\n\nNikki Haley, Tim Scott and others oppose student debt forgiveness\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court had struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt for hundreds of Americans, a move that many of the 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy supported the court’s decision.\n\n“We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do: more $$ to stay at home than to work, more $$ to be a single mother than married, more $$ for those who *fail* to repay loans than those who do,” Ramaswamy wrote on X.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the third Republican debate?\n\nThe third Republican debate will be held in Miami on Nov. 8, the day after Election Day 2023.\n\nThe Republican National Committee announced that the requirements to participate in the debate will the strictest yet: participating candidates must secure 4% of the vote in multiple polls and 70,000 unique donors.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRepublican primary polls: Trump still leads, DeSantis a distant second\n\nDonald Trump continues to lead Republican primary polls by about 40 points in most national surveys heading into the debate night. The frontrunner will not be on the stage, though, opting instead to hold a rally for United Auto Workers members in Detroit.\n\nSecond and far behind Trump in polls is Ron DeSantis, who will stand at the center of the debate stage. Next in the polls, each less than ten points behind DeSantis and standing on either side of him on stage, are Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMike Pence and Chris Christie are close behind Ramaswamy in most polls, followed by Tim Scott and Doug Burgum.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican debate ratings ahead of 2024\n\nMillions of Americans may be tuning into the GOP debate on Wednesday night Approximately 12.8 million people watched the first Republican presidential primary debate last month, when GOP candidates faced off in Milwaukee.\n\nEight Republican candidates pitched their vision for the country’s future during the event, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nCandidates focused on issues like climate change, the war in Ukraine and the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. But the debate also got personal, with Republican hopefuls targeting Ramaswamy’s lack of political experience, Haley’s perspective on abortion restrictions in the U.S. and more.\n\nDonald Trump did not participate in the event, instead opting for an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolitical groups divide their forces between Trump speech, non-Trump debate\n\nSome political interest groups seem more interested in Donald Trump’s speech in Michigan this week than in the challengers' debate in California.\n\nFor example: American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive group, financed a plane to fly over the site of Trump's union event with a banner saying \"Trump Sold Us Out.\"\n\n“It’s obvious that, barring something drastic, Donald Trump is going to be the GOP nominee next year,\" said Pat Dennis, president of American Bridge 21st Century. \"The Republicans on the debate stage know that, too.\"\n\nGroups that flooded Milwaukee for the first Republican debate are not much in evidence in Simi Valley, though the Reagan library is a fairly remote location compared to Wisconsin's Fiserv Forum.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhere is the second Republican debate?\n\nThe seven Republican presidential candidates will take the stage in Simi Valley, California, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.\n\nNorthwest of Los Angeles, the library opened in 1991 with a ceremony that at the time boasted the largest ever gathering of former presidents and their families. The site is also the final resting place for the 40th president and his wife, Nancy Reagan.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhy is Donald Trump not debating?\n\nNo, Donald Trump won’t go head-to-head with his Republican rivals on Wednesday night.\n\nInstead, Trump, the current Republican frontrunner, is traveling to Michigan to speak with supporters in a battleground state.

The visits amounted to a duel in optics, if not specifics.\n\nBiden called on Trump to join him in asking Congress to pass wide-ranging border security legislation negotiated by a team of Democratic and Republican senators, which the House GOP rejected at Trump’s urging.\n\n“Instead of playing politics with the issue, why don’t we just get together and get it done?” Biden said from Brownsville, in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley.\n\nTrump, speaking roughly the same time 325 miles away in Eagle Pass, showed no interest in working with Biden, or the Democrats for that matter. He hurled insults at his successor, charging that Biden is solely responsible for the immigration crisis and unable to deal with it effectively.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"This is a Joe Biden invasion,\" Trump said from Shelby Park, which sits on the Rio Grande and has become the epicenter of the national immigration debate. \"This is a Biden invasion over the past three years. ... He's a terrible president, worst president our country's ever had probably, the most incompetent president we've ever had.\"\n\nThe competing stops by Biden and Trump come just eight months before the November election and as polls show Americans are deeply concerned about the situation along the border.\n\nA Gallup Poll released this week showed that, for the first time since the last decade, Americans now believe immigration to be the most important issue facing the United States. A separate survey earlier in February by the Pew Research Center survey showed 80% of Americans believe the government is doing a bad job dealing with the large number of migrants at the border.\n\nYet another poll in February by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas showed that a majority of Texans want to see more border enforcement and support Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's border security initiatives, such as building border barriers and installing razor wire along the Rio Grande.\n\n'We can't afford not to do this'\n\nIn Brownsville, Biden's motorcade drove a road alongside a 20-foot-high border fence, just inside the U.S.-Mexico border. The entourage drove through a gate in the fence and down a bumpy dirt road, along which parked cars were flying Trump flags.\n\nBiden walked along a section of the border and later met with federal immigration agents, who gave him a lengthy briefing on efforts to deter illegal crossings. Brownsville was once the nation’s busiest corridor for illegal crossings, but in recent months has seen a sharp drop in the number of people entering illegally into the United States.\n\nIn his remarks at the Brownsville Border Patrol Station, Biden said officials desperately need more resources to secure the border. The legislation killed by House Republicans included funding to hire additional border patrol agents and buy additional security inspection technology and equipment.\n\n\"We can't afford not to do this,\" Biden said.\n\nBefore Biden's arrival, several hundred mostly Biden supporters lined up on Boca Chica Boulevard outside the city’s airport, waving blue Biden flags and chanting “Four more years!” More residents parked along the boulevard, stretching for about half a mile, waving U.S. flags and hoping to catch a glimpse of the president.\n\nElia Zamora-Hernandez, 71, drove 30 miles from Harlingen to show her support. Donning a Biden cap and waving a Biden flag, she said Republicans are not cooperating enough with Biden to allow him to do his job.\n\n“The border has been a problem for years, years, years,” Zamora-Hernandez said. “This is not something he created.”\n\nFarther down the boulevard, groups organized by La Union del Pueblo Entero, a migrants' and workers’ rights group, chanted, “Biden, escucha – ¡estamos en la lucha!” (Biden, listen – we’re struggling!) and “¡Si se puede!” (Yes we can!)\n\nVictor Cavazos, a director at The Sidewalk School, a nonprofit that helps asylum-seekers in Reynosa, Mexico, said he was baffled that Biden chose not to meet with leaders of nongovernmental organizations while in Texas.\n\n“He’s missing a big piece of the puzzle,” he said. “We know what the needs are on the ground.”\n\nUnease in Eagle Pass:As border battle brews between Texas and U.S., tiny Eagle Pass braces for its next conflict\n\nTrump travels to Eagle Pass\n\nIn Eagle Pass, Trump was joined by Abbott and Texas National Guard soldiers, who showed off the razor wire they erected along a 29-mile stretch of border upon Abbott’s orders – and in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court order.\n\nSpeaking without notes, Trump veered from praising himself to criticizing immigration policies in Democratic-controlled California to lauding Abbott for taking a hardline approach to the border. He reprised his 2016 campaign theme that \"murderers\" and \"rapists\" were coming into the United States from Mexico.\n\n\"These are the people that are coming into our country and they're coming from jails and they're coming from prisons and they're coming from mental institutions and they're coming from insane asylums,\" Trump said. \"And they're terrorists and being let into our country.\"\n\nTrump also made reference to Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was found murdered in a wooded area at the University of Georgia in Athens last week. The man charged with the killing of the student was a migrant from Venezuela who entered the U.S. illegally.\n\nBefore Trump's arrival, city police cordoned off the streets leading down to Shelby Park. On Main Street, the four corners of the intersection with Commercial Street were filled with a mix of Trump and Biden supporters amid a collection of stores such as Claudia’s Perfuma Fina and the Cowboy Corral, which sells western wear.\n\n“We’ve seen two surges under two administrations, and it was better under Trump,” said Freddy Arellano, a junior at nearby Sul Ross University, who sported a Make America Great Again ball cap. “Under Biden it’s unbearable.”\n\nAt the opposite corner, Steve Fischer, who is the chief public defender for the region, called Trump’s visit and Abbott’s policies at the border “a big joke” and \"political theatrics.”\n\nJose Hernandez, who served in the Army and wore a Vietnam veterans cap, was in the middle – figuratively and literally.\n\n“I’m 50-50 on Biden and Trump,” he said. “Whoever can fix it.”\n\nHernandez said he voted for Biden in 2020, but the president has not yet earned his support for a second term.\n\nDomingo Garcia, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, welcomed Biden’s and Trump’s visits.\n\n“They’re a little late,’’ Garcia said. “But at least they’re finally paying attention t a humanitarian crisis that has been festering for years.’’\n\nGarcia said immigration and border issues are going to be key campaign issues in November, and Latino voters will be an important voting bloc.\n\n“I think that shows that they both know how important immigration is as an issue and that the road to the White House goes through the Latino communities,’’ he said.\n\nTragedy at the border:Mexican family's death at border looms over ongoing Justice Department standoff with Texas\n\nWill Trump, Biden's visits to the border shift the conversation?\n\nNo one in the White House, in Congress or on the campaign trail has figured out how to address the pace and swell of modern migration, as people arrive at the U.S. border in record numbers.\n\nBiden has called on Mexico and its regional partners to stem the flow of migrants north. Biden has created new legal pathways to encourage migrants not to cross the border unlawfully. And he’s funneled resources to struggling nations to address the root causes of why people leave.\n\nTrump has proposed more barriers at the border, from razor wire to fences, and mass deportations. Republicans in Congress have proposed sharply restricting access to the U.S. asylum system.\n\nBut the flows northward continue at a pace that has been mind-rattling for many Americans. A once-impenetrable jungle connecting North and South America has become a human highway. The Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama is now being trod through by half a million people annually – nearly all of them headed for the U.S. border.\n\n“Nobody has figured out how to deal with this in a short-term way with the existing tools they have,” said Adam Isacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America. “The most they’ve been able to do is to come up with a small tweak to policies that can push the numbers down for a few months – and then the numbers recover.”\n\nThe push-and-pull factors of immigration have proved more powerful than the limited opportunities for legal pathways at the U.S. border and the deterrents of 30-foot fences and razor wire.\n\nThere are more than 9 million job openings in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics – a magnet for workers. Meanwhile, countries throughout the hemisphere are still suffering the economic fallout of the pandemic.\n\n“You have the United States in a moment of relative domestic stability with more job openings than workers,” Isacson said. “Throughout the region, you have economies that haven’t crawled out of the crater COVID left. You have repressive governments, climate change and gangs running rampant. You also have a broken U.S. asylum system where you can claim fear and be here for four or five years.”\n\nThe number of migrants arriving at the U.S. border dipped in the first year of the Trump administration before climbing again in 2018 and more than doubling in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic, when travel was restricted across the western hemisphere, depressed migration in 2020 and apprehensions at the U.S. border plummeted.\n\nBut as the pandemic waned and regional economies remained in distress, people began heading to the U.S. border in record numbers.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 1.7 million migrant encounters at the Southwest border in fiscal 2021, 2.4 million in fiscal 2022 and an additional 2.5 million in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe images of tens of thousands of families crossing the Rio Grande in Texas, or waiting to be received by Border Patrol at the border fence in Arizona or California, have captivated American voters and stoked real worries about the federal government’s ability to quickly vet so many people and the ability of American cities to welcome them.\n\nAbbott has bused more than 100,000 migrants from the Texas border to cities including New York, Chicago and Denver – effectively exporting humanitarian crises to American backyards.\n\nEven before Biden and Trump arrived, a border battle was being waged in a federal court in Texas.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Alan Ezra on Thursday preliminarily prevented Texas from enforcing a law that would make it a state crime to cross the Texas-Mexico border. In his order granting an injunction, Ezra said “states may not exercise immigration enforcement power except as authorized by the federal government.”\n\nTexas’ Senate Bill 4, previously scheduled to take effect March 5, would have allowed state law enforcement officers to arrest, detain and deport individuals suspected of illegally crossing the Texas-Mexico border.\n\n“Surges in immigration do not constitute an ‘invasion’ within the meaning of the Constitution, nor is Texas engaging in war by enforcing SB4,” Ezra said in the order.\n\n“To allow Texas to permanently supersede federal directives on the basis of an invasion would amount to nullification of federal law and authority – a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War,” he said.\n\nContributing: Deborah Berry, Swapna Venugopal and The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/09/09/second-gop-debate-presidential-2024/70703738007/", "title": "Second GOP debate time: What to watch for as 2024 candidates ...", "text": "WASHINGTON−Republican candidates vying for their party’s nomination in the 2024 presidential race will take the stage Sept. 27 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Simi Valley, Calif., for the second GOP primary debate.\n\nAfter last month’s showdown, some candidates will likely change their strategies and whom they will attack during the two-hour debate, from 9 to 11 p.m. EST, that night.\n\nThe first debate in Milwaukee in late August brought more attention to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who have both seen polling bumps since then. Haley spent much of her time on offense against competitors as she focused on her vision for the country. Ramaswamy played defense most of the night, targeted by fellow Republicans on stage as he has attracted larger campaign crowds and more media coverage.\n\nHere's a look at what to watch for in the second debate.\n\nWho has qualified for the second GOP debate?\n\nSo far, the six candidates who have qualified for the second debate include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Ramaswamy, Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIt is unclear whether North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson will be on stage. GOP frontrunner Donald Trump also said he will skip the debates, citing his large lead in the polls.\n\nRamaswamy will likely be the other candidates' punching bag − again\n\nRamaswamy remains in the upper tier of candidates and will again be near the center of the stage, ensuring high profile skirmishes with other candidates, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and co-author of \"Debating The Donald.\"\n\n“Ramaswamy did an excellent job in the first debate of being extremely blunt and interjecting himself into a lot of important exchanges,” Kall said. “This earned Ramaswamy a lot of airtime, but he also absorbed a tremendous amount of political punches.”\n\nNotably in the last debate, many candidates sparred with Ramaswamy over his lack of experience. For instance, Haley shot back at Ramaswamy after he said the U.S. should cede eastern Ukraine to Russia, arguing he has “no foreign policy experience and it shows.”\n\nPence also said during the first debate that “we don't need to bring in a rookie” to the White House - a direct nod to Ramaswamy - and later added the country needs a president who’s been there and knows how the government works.\n\n“His weakness is that he spouts a lot of nonsense and comes across as the kid who reminds the teacher to collect everyone's homework,” David Niven, a political scientist at the University of Cincinnati, told USA TODAY. “Expect even more of his competitors to expose Ramaswamy's lack of depth and sincerity in the next debate.”\n\nBut as a newcomer, Ramaswamy declared in the last debate that he's the only one “not bought and paid for” on stage and leaned on Trump-style, far-right values to try to appeal to voters. This divide between populism and traditional conservatism embraced by candidates like Pence will likely emerge as a theme in the second debate, said Michael Traugott, a political scientist at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"This is the most important problem that the party is facing now, as Trump leads the populist faction - and Ramaswamy knows this - while Pence is trying to steer it back to its recent historical roots,\" Traugott said.\n\nTopics that could be discussed: economy, natural disasters and Trump\n\nBecause Fox Business and the Reagan Foundation are hosting the debate along with other partners, a more nuanced focus on business and economic issues could be in store, Kall said.\n\n“Ramaswamy and Burgum - if he qualifies - both have overseen wildly successful startup businesses and these experiences may come up during the debate,” Kall said. He added that the candidates will continue to knock Bidenomics, inflation and high interest rates.\n\nThe regulation of private companies like TikTok and Disney could be ripe for discussion given “traditional Republican orthodoxy regarding regulation,” and attention on union strikes or a future shift to electric vehicles could also be debated given the timeliness of events, he said.\n\nNatural disasters and climate change could also crop up as topics of interest. Hurricane Idalia’s recent damage to Florida and DeSantis’ handling of events at the time, including his decision not to meet with President Joe Biden, could be a talking point for some candidates like Christie.\n\nWhile Trump is not expected to show up at the second debate, his four indictments will likely take center stage as it did in the first GOP primary debate when six candidates raised their hand that they would support the former president if he gets chosen as a Republican nominee even if he was convicted.\n\n“The most compelling question for the second debate is how many of these candidates are actually running against Donald Trump, and how many are deferentially running behind him in hopes of being asked to join the ticket,” Niven said.\n\nChristie and Hutchinson will likely criticize the former president while Ramaswamy will fiercely defend him.\n\nDeSantis and Scott could have their big moments on stage\n\nTraugott said he thinks both DeSantis and Scott’s performances in the first debate didn’t stand out.\n\n“They had a cautious approach to the event, which explains that - no harm no foul,” he said. “Even though both are well funded, they have yet to attract many new supporters. Without any movement, their funding will decline.”\n\nDeSantis came into the first debate with the “greatest degree of difficulty and biggest target on his back given Trump’s absence,” Kall said, but he stayed above the back and forth attacks between other candidates.\n\n“DeSantis appeared confident and engaged during the first debate and showed some leadership by initially criticizing ‘hand-raising’ questions from the moderators. He was well-prepared and came with a catchy basket of debate zingers that were competently timed and delivered,” Kall said.\n\nNiven, on the other hand, said he thought the governor was “awkward, boring, and reactive instead of polished, compelling, and dominant.” Either way, DeSantis could likely face a moment of conflict on stage with other candidates based on recent events. For instance, he recently hit back against a man who blamed his policies for the Jacksonville, Florida, shooting last month.\n\nKall said he thinks Scott delivered a “strong closing statement\" in Milwaukee. If Burgum and Hutchinson fail to qualify for the second debate and more opportunities exist for lower-tier candidates to be given a spotlight, Scott could potentially make a comeback.\n\n“I would expect the moderators to contrast the positions of Haley and Scott, so both candidates should be prepared for this likely battle,” Kall said.\n\nScott will likely face questions about faith - a central theme in his campaign - as he did in the first GOP debate.\n\nNikki Haley: Lone wolf or part of the pack?\n\nHaley, the only woman running in the GOP primary, stood apart from other candidates in the first debate when she acknowledged that climate change was real, criticized Republicans on their spending and called for finding a middle ground on abortion.\n\nBefore the first debate, Haley was leading behind Pence in the polls for the Republican nomination, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics. Now, she has surpassed him.\n\n“Nikki Haley was the pragmatic voice in the first debate, offering an assessment of issues like abortion that was much more grounded in practical politics,” Niven said.\n\nKall said that Haley’s background as a U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and her experience debating others as a gubernatorial candidate contributed to her performance.\n\n“She benefited from low expectations heading into the first debate and will undoubtedly be a larger target in Simi Valley,” Kall said. “Some recent polling has indicated that Haley could be the toughest general election opponent for Biden and this electability argument will feature prominently during the next debate.”\n\nBut whether she will gain more momentum in the second debate with her moderate perspective or take a more right-view approach on policies like her other rivals to appeal to GOP voters remains to be seen.\n\n“Haley’s more moderate positions on abortion and climate change could be an asset in a general election against Biden, but could prove problematic to Republican primary voters,” Kall said. “Pence will likely continue to lead the charge here on the social issue front.”\n\nAsa Hutchinson and Doug Burgum might not make an appearance\n\nThere’s a chance two GOP candidates might not make an appearance to the second debate this time around: Hutchinson and Burgum.\n\nPolitico first reported the requirements candidates must meet to qualify for the second GOP debate include having a minimum of 50,000 unique donors and polling at a minimum of 3% in two national surveys or one national poll and two polls conducted in two early states.\n\nWhile both Burgum and Hutchinson remain confident that they will qualify, they are still polling at low numbers in the race for the Republican nomination compared to their rivals, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics.\n\nBurgum was the sixth candidate to qualify for the first debate - using an unusual tactic of giving away $20 gift cards for everyone that pitched in $1 to his campaign - while Hutchinson was the last.\n\n\"Whether the final roster of candidates will include Doug Burgum and Asa Hutchinson will be interesting and genuinely impact the tenor and flow of the debate,\" Kall said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/09"}]}

Floodwaters breached the Rapidan Dam in southern Minnesota and local officials warned Monday that the dam is in \"imminent failure condition.\"\n\nAuthorities asked residents to watch out for possible evacuations. Blue Earth County Emergency Management said it was made aware of \"accumulating debris\" at the dam on Sunday, which is currently being monitored by Blue Earth County Public Works and law enforcement.\n\n\"We do not know if it will totally fail or if it will remain in place, however we determined it was necessary to issue this notification to advise downstream residents and the correct regulatory agencies and other local agencies,\" the Blue Earth County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook early Monday.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the sheriff's office reported a \"partial failure\" of the dam on the west abutment but noted that the dam was still intact and there were current plans for a mass evacuation. Residents who were in \"imminent danger\" were notified, according to the sheriff's office.\n\nScattered, fast-moving showers were slated to impact the region early this week before more organized thunderstorms bring heavy rain by Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. Last week, parts of the region were hit with a month's worth of rain in a span of 48 hours. Sioux Falls, South Dakota, received 6.33 inches of rain from Thursday to Saturday, with 10.8 inches of rain so far in June, AccuWeather said.\n\n\"So much rain has fallen in a zone from southwestern Minnesota to northeastern Nebraska, including northwestern Iowa and southeastern South Dakota, that multiple rivers are on the rampage,\" said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski.\n\nMeanwhile, heat advisories warning of potentially record-breaking temperatures remained active on Monday across a vast swath of the U.S. Tens of millions of people across the country, from South Dakota to Texas to parts of northern Florida and Georgia, face heat indices – temperatures that take humidity into account – in the high 90s and up to 110 degrees, according to the weather service.\n\nMinnesota dam breached by floodwaters\n\nOn Monday, the department of emergency management in Le Sueur County said the Rapidan Dam was \"breached,\" and urged residents to prepare for potential evacuations. The dam is located downstream from Mankato, Minnesota, about 80 miles southwest of Minneapolis.\n\n\"Residents of Le Sueur County in low-lying areas of MN River Valley communities of Kasota, Le Sueur, St. Peter and Ottawa are advised to closely monitor situation and potentially evacuate. This does not effect residents of Waterville or surrounding area.\"\n\nThe Blue Earth County Sheriff's Office said in an update Monday afternoon that a portion of the river flow was diverted \"around the west side of the dam and water continues to flow.\"\n\nAuthorities evacuated homes on Birch Avenue and Neubert Lane, which is just northwest of the dam. Various roads in Mankato were also closed due to flooding.\n\nNorth Mankato declared a flood emergency earlier as city crews rushed to construct a temporary earth wall levee, city officials said in a Facebook post.\n\nAn Xcel Energy substation at the dam was washed away early Monday after heavy rain over multiple days caused the Blue Earth River to flood. The utility company said nearly 600 customers were without power as a result and crews were working to replace the substation and restore power.\n\nA U.S. Geological Survey gauge tracking water in the area also lost power, according to the weather service.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz said on Monday afternoon agencies are in close contact with county and local officials about the dam. \"Emergency management is on the ground and acting quickly to ensure the safety of Minnesotans as the situation develops,\" he posted on X.\n\nWater flow of Minnesota river rapidly increased over the weekend\n\nWater flow in the Blue Earth River at the dam grew by 3.5 times between Friday morning and Monday morning, its flow increasing from 9,530 cubic feet per second to 34,500 cubic feet per second, according to USGS data.\n\nThe river’s height at the gage rose from 8.2 feet at 5 a.m. on Friday to 16 feet at 10:30 p.m. on Sunday. By Monday morning, it had risen another two feet, the third-highest level on record.\n\nThe record height was set at 23.63 feet on Jan. 18, 2020, according to the USGS data. The previous record height had been 21.36 feet on April 9, 1965. Records for the location date back to at least 1951.\n\nThe Rapidan Dam was constructed between 1908 and 1910 and measures about 475 feet in length and about 87 feet from the top of the dam to the stream bed, according to the Blue Earth County government website.\n\nHigh temperatures continue in parts of U.S.\n\nLows will mostly remain in the mid-to-upper 70s, \"bringing little relief from the heat overnight,\" the weather service said.\n\nMeanwhile, east-central South Carolina could experience a heat index of 110 degrees, and a stretch of Southern California is forecast to bake under temperatures between 90 to 100 degrees on Monday.\n\n\"The arrival of this more intense heat early in the Summer season leads to a higher level of heat-related stress, especially for those outdoors and without reliable air conditioning available,\" according to the weather service.\n\nThe shift west for the scorching heat comes as a cold front brings relief to millions across New England and the mid-Atlantic regions, where record-breaking afternoon highs reached the high 90s and surpassed 100 degrees throughout last week and over the weekend.\n\nThe heat will bear down on the central U.S. before concentrating mostly on the South by the latter half of the week, the weather service said.\n\nHundreds rescued; nearly 2K buildings damaged in Iowa floods\n\nBetween Friday and Sunday, some areas of northwest Iowa – where the ground was already saturated – recorded up to 15 inches of rain, a deluge that damaged public infrastructure and triggered hundreds of evacuations and rescues. At least 16 flood gauges recorded historic river levels as waterways across the northwest region of the state rose several feet above previous record levels.\n\nAt least 250 people were rescued over the weekend while 1,900 properties were \"impacted\" and hundreds were destroyed, said Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds at a news conference on Sunday.\n\n\"The devastation is severe and it's widespread,\" Reynolds said. \"While we're still very early in the response, the projected damage is staggering.\"\n\nOfficials reported at least 10 city water systems and 21 waste water systems have been disrupted by the floods, leaving many residents without drinkable water. Well over 1,000 Iowans took to shelters over the weekend.\n\nJohn Benson, Iowa director of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said at the news conference the \"flood\" is not over, warning that as the water recedes, much of it will flow into larger waterways, including the Missouri, Big Sioux, South Fork and Mississippi rivers, which are expected to reach \"major flooding\" stages in the coming days. The expected rain this week only adds to the flood threat.\n\n\"(The flooding) is not going to cease, it is going to blossom across the state,\" Benson said.\n\nContributing: Gabe Hauari, Cybele Mayes-Osterman, Dinah Pulver, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/24"}]}

Rainsford, a spokesman for the 18th Airborne Corps, said that as of Saturday morning, there were no positive cases of the new coronavirus at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the largest Army installation in the country.\n\nThe quarantining of the soldiers was directed by the Army, which said that troops leaving areas that are labeled Level 2 or higher by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should stay in quarantine for two weeks.\n\nWhile in quarantine, the paratroopers will be monitored for health and get appropriate medical treatment, according to the division.\n\n– Rachael Riley and Steve DeVane, The Fayetteville (N.C.) Observer\n\nAt least 20 states close all schools\n\nTwenty states and a number of large urban school districts – including Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest – are shutting down all K-12 schools as part of a sweeping attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAlabama, Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin have made plans to close all schools.\n\nIn addition to Los Angeles, major metropolitan districts in Atlanta, Austin, Denver, Miami-Dade County, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington, D.C., have also shuttered. A growing number of smaller districts around the country have also chosen to close.\n\nAccording to a count updated mid-afternoon Friday by Education Week magazine, about a quarter of American schoolchildren had been or were scheduled to be affected by a school closures – and that was before some states announced their actions.\n\nThe magazine said at least 46,000 schools were closed, are scheduled to close, or were closed and later reopened, affecting at least 21 million students.\n\nCustoms intercepts fake virus tests\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection is advising Americans to be aware of “bogus home testing kits for sale either online or in informal direct to consumer settings” after officers at Los Angeles International Airport intercepted a package containing suspected counterfeit COVID-19 test kits arriving from the United Kingdom, the agency said Saturday.\n\nThe officers discovered six plastic bags containing various vials while conducting an enforcement examination Thursday. The vials were filled with a white liquid and labeled “Corona Virus 2019nconv (COVID-19)” and “Virus1 Test Kit,” the agency said.

Households have until July 31 to respond to the population survey.\n\nCivil rights groups said they’re worried about the safety of census takers and are concerned communities that have long been under counted may not respond.\n\nCensus officials have been scrambling to meet deadlines, including recruiting and hiring thousands of workers who will knock on the doors of people who don’t respond to the survey. The deadlines are critical as the Census is required to provide information to Congress. That information is used to distribute billions in federal funds and determine the number of members of Congress for each state.\n\n— Deborah Berry\n\nNCAA had, spent rainy-day fund\n\nThe cancellation of the NCAA’s Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments is likely to wreak financial havoc on colleges and universities that depend on the millions of dollars in revenue the games bring in.\n\nIt turns out the NCAA did have the foresight to begin planning for an unknown catastrophic event that would threaten its biggest and most lucrative event.\n\nBy 2014, the association had accumulated a nearly $400 million cushion as a hedge against a massive loss of revenue from the tournament.\n\nThen, at the direction of its governing board of college presidents, the NCAA distributed that money to schools to help them with increasing costs and spent it on their behalf in other ways, including a $208.7 million legal settlement.\n\n“The NCAA will be fine,” said Barbara Osborne, a sports administration professor at the University of North Carolina. “But all schools will be having huge belt tightening because of this.” Read more here.\n\n– Steve Berkowitz\n\nMnuchin says more bills coming on cruise, hotel, airline assistance\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin praised the legislation passed by the House early Saturday morning and said the next round of legislation would address the cruise, hotel and airline industries.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday in a letter to lawmakers the House would start work on a third legislative package to \"protect the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.\"\n\nThe House passed a bill early in the morning to provide paid sick leave and free coronavirus testing, and Mnuchin told reporters the bill \"delivers on what the president announced in his speech the other night.\"\n\n\"People who need to be quarantined, we want them at home and we don't want them to fear not getting paid,\" he continued.\n\nMnuchin said there was language agreed to with Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that did not make it into the final bill, \"so there will be a technical correction Monday morning.\"\n\n- Nicholas Wu and Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump: Federal Reserve should be ‘more proactive’\n\nTrump again slammed the Federal Reserve on Saturday, saying the central bank hasn’t done enough to calm financial markets amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt an unusual Saturday news conference, Trump offered praise to Congress, the American people and even the press for their response to the coronavirus scare. But the Fed – one of his favorite targets – got only presidential scorn.\n\n“I thought the Fed would be and should be much more proactive,” Trump said. “Our Fed is following.”\n\nTrump is frequently critical of the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he appointed to the chairmanship in 2017. Trump claims that interest rate hikes have slowed economic growth.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates two weeks ago in a rare emergency move in response to the threat the coronavirus posed to the economy and financial markets. But Trump thinks it should be doing more.\n\n“Our Fed is not doing what they should be doing,” he said, arguing the U.S. shouldn’t have a rate higher than competitor nations such as Germany and Japan.\n\nAsked whether he intends to fire Powell, Trump said he has the authority to do so, “but I’m not doing it.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nFrance closes all schools, restaurants, Eiffel tower; Spain locks down 46M citizens, Israel bans gatherings\n\nFrance and Spain followed Italy's lead with tough new measures, leaving the Eiffel Tower and Louvre shuttered and 46 million Spanish citizens in a lockdown.\n\nItaly also invoked sharp new measures, including closing playgrounds and parks.\n\nFrance's orders closed cafes, restaurant and cinemas. The government has banned all gatherings of more than 100 people, ordered all schools closed and asked companies to allow workers to stay home.\n\nIn declaring a two-week state of emergency Saturday, Spain prepared to close all schools, universities, restaurants, bars and hotels nationwide.\n\nSpain’s declaration comes as coronavirus cases soared to over 5,700 with 136 deaths. The declaration also would allow the government to limit free movement, confiscate goods and take over control of industries and private facilities, including private hospitals.\n\nResidents of Madrid, which has around half the infections, and northeastern Catalonia awoke to shuttered bars and restaurants and other non-essential commercial outlets as ordered by regional authorities.\n\nIn Italy, mayors of many cities, including Rome and Milan, decided to close public playgrounds and parks as European countries fashion different polices to try to combat the spread of the virus.\n\nElsewhere, Denmark and Poland became the latest countries to shut their borders to most travelers.\n\nIsrael on Saturday banned gatherings of more than ten people and ordered that restaurants and movie theaters close.

It is intended to cut red tape that otherwise might hold up emergency relief, officials said.\n\nIt will apply to drivers hauling critical medical supplies like masks, hand sanitizer, soap and disinfectants needed by health care workers. Also mentioned are sanitation supplies for communities. Included, too, is food for emergency restocking of stores, workers and supplies for temporary housing or quarantine facilities related to COVID-19 and transportation of medical or other emergency-service personnel.\n\n\"This declaration will help America’s commercial drivers get these critical goods to impacted areas faster and more efficiently,\" said Jim Mullen, acting administrator of the department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\n\nThe order requires truckers be allowed to rest for a minimum of 10 consecutive hours if they say they need time off before returning to work at the terminal or their normal reporting location. Normally, truckers are subject to elaborate rules that limit them to 11 hours of driving a day during a 14-hour period after 10 hours of rest.\n\nThe administration's order includes stipulations to prevent abuse. It won't apply to commercial deliveries, for instance, or to mixed loads – items both considered part of the emergency relief shipped along with general cargo.\n\n- Chris Woodyard\n\nAhead of Pence briefing, White House checks temperatures for those around Trump, Pence\n\nAhead of a press briefing Saturday with Vice President Mike Pence, a member of the White House Physicians Office took the temperature of reporters and television crews.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,\" said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere.\n\nOne symptom of the coronavirus, which has been named COVID-19, is a fever.\n\nOne reporter whose temperature was too high was escorted out by staff.

Democrats and advocates have criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to address the crisis.\n\n“I’m extremely concerned that our lack of preparedness ... would result in a Katrina-like response where there was vast inequities between who receive services and who did not receive services and that line was drawn based on race, primarily, and class,’’ Derrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, told USA TODAY.\n\nFormer President George W.

In Green Bay, Wisconsin, an effort to push a similar citywide measure there was narrowly defeated this month.\n\nAnd in Florida, Republican state Rep. David Borrero has introduced a bill that would similarly limit flag displays at all governmental and public school buildings statewide.\n\nHow do these measures ban Pride flags?\n\nThe municipal measures that prohibit rainbow flags aren't explicitly expressed as such. Presented as a means to avoid favoring any one group over another, they limit flag displays to government and military flags – but the effect is the same.\n\nIn the measure in Delaware, Ohio, city manager Thomas Homan in May 2022 informed flag and banner applicants that the city was pausing its program for review in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that month ruling that Boston city officials had violated a Christian group’s free speech rights when they denied a request to fly a Christian flag over city hall. Delaware’s program allowed organizations to request their flags be displayed on city street poles.\n\n“While unfortunate for our local nonprofit organizations who use the banner and flag program to support cultural and community events, it is reasonable and prudent to take this step to protect the interests of our city,” he wrote.\n\nA city spokesman told USA TODAY the review was ongoing.\n\nOn March 7, City Council members in Huntington Beach, California, are set to take their final vote on a similar measure.\n\nAt the council's meeting earlier this week, board member Dan Kalmick criticized the proposal as cloaked in language hiding its true intentions.\n\n\"This is a poor and cowardly ordinance couched in 'equality,' \" Kalmick said. \"It’s, of course, a ban on the city flying the Pride flag. Call it what it is. ... If it walks like a ban and quacks like a ban, it’s a ban.\"\n\nTwo previous council votes have favored the ordinance 4-3. The proposed measure notes that businesses and individuals can still display flags of their choice on private property.\n\nLast week, Debbie Chang, president and CEO of the private foundation funded by nonprofit health plan Blue Shield of California, informed Huntington Beach officials that given the situation, the group had canceled plans to conduct a two-day retreat for trustees and senior management in the city in June.\n\n“We decided that we could no longer in good conscience meet in your city until the uncertainty of this situation is resolved,” Chang wrote in a letter Friday.\n\nGiven the LGBTQ community’s high rates of health inequities and domestic violence, she said, the city's move to ban the Pride flag \"puts a vulnerable population at risk of further harm.”\n\nIn response, Huntington Beach council member Casey McKeon said at this week's meeting: \"I don’t know why they are trying to blackmail us economically when we are drafting our government flag policy to only fly government flags that represent every individual equally.\"\n\nWhy is the rainbow flag important?\n\nGilbert Baker, a Kansas-born artist who spent much of his life in San Francisco, created the iconic six-striped rainbow flag in 1978 at the behest of LGBTQ activist and lawmaker Harvey Milk in 1978, according to the New York-based Gilbert Baker Foundation. He died in 2017.\n\nThe symbol has since become an icon of LGBTQ inclusion.\n\n“It’s that age-old visibility, of knowing where you’re welcome,” said Adkison, of TransOhio. “The Pride flag is an easy way of knowing you have some allies there.”\n\nPeg Corley, executive director of LGBTQ Center OC, based in Santa Ana, California, said Huntington Beach council members were sending \"a very loud message\" by considering the measure.\n\nThe rainbow flag “is the most diverse symbol we have,” Corley said. “Literally every walk of life is represented in the LGBTQ community, so saying we’re not going to fly a symbol of diversity and inclusion – that’s the message they’re sending.”\n\nHow is the LGBTQ community responding?\n\nThe Gilbert Baker Foundation, the New York-based organization named for the flag's creator, on Friday launched a Save the Rainbow Flag campaign with instruction for local community advocates on mobilization and letter-writing activism, plus an open letter from the ACLU with legal arguments against flag restrictions.\n\n“Make no mistake – right-wing groups want to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, and they’re starting with banning the rainbow flag,” Charley Beal, the foundation’s president, said in a press release.\n\nSome such bans have already been reversed – for instance, in Newberg, Oregon, where school board members last month rescinded a controversial 2021 measure prohibiting political signage, which had included the rainbow flag, after the measure was challenged by the ACLU.\n\nBut, Beal said, “every month brings a new threat to LGBTQ+ rights and equality. It’s time to stop the haters.”\n\nCorley, whose organization has been asked to participate in public raisings of the rainbow flag when Orange County municipalities kicked off Pride Month celebrations in previous years, said she expects more businesses to withdraw from Huntington Beach should the ban remain in effect.\n\n“We’re people, not a political agenda,” she said.\n\nDig deeper:\n\nWhat is the meaning of other LGBTQ+ flags?\n\nBook bans are on the rise.

But some challenges are more endemic, the product of decades of low pay and lack of appreciation for the service that administrators and teachers perform.

We must counter by teaching truth\n\nShaun Harper Bradford Rogne\n\nLast year, Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe lost his reelection campaign, at least in part because his Republican opponent, Glenn Youngkin, repeatedly declared that McAuliffe’s reelection would lead to the widespread teaching of critical race theory in schools across the Commonwealth. Simply put, attacking critical race theory helped the now-governor of Virginia secure his win.\n\nCritical race theory is a set of concepts seeking to explain the structural underpinnings of inequality and racism in the United States. But the term has been attacked by its critics as unfairly pinning blame on White Americans for some of society’s most pernicious ills.\n\nClassroom discussions about race, and what I like to call “truth teaching,” haven’t been as much of a talking point as they were a year ago, and critical race theory isn’t being debated as much in this year’s midterm campaigns. It doesn’t have to be. For the most part, conservatives have already succeeded in banishing talk about racism from the classroom.\n\nAfter a campaign of intentional misinformation and fear mongering, critical race theory quickly became one of our nation’s most contested and misunderstood education issues. Conservative strategists successfully convinced millions of Americans, including concerned parents of school-aged children, that it was being taught in K-12 districts across the country. No evidence exists to confirm that this was actually the case.\n\nAs of last month, elected officials in 42 states have introduced legislation that broadly aims to ban the teaching of racial and social justice topics in public schools, according to data compiled by Education Week. Similar bills have passed in 17 of those states. Many more school boards have enacted local bans. In addition, books about race have been banned in numerous districts.\n\nThe campaign to eliminate critical race theory succeeded mostly because White parents and state lawmakers were led to believe that White school children were being made to feel badly about being White. Where’s the proof that teachers, nearly 80% of whom are White, were doing this? They weren’t, certainly not in any widespread fashion.\n\nWith no credible evidence of an actual problem and no opportunity to vote on the issue, citizens who recognize the value of teaching our children the truth about America’s racial past and present won’t have a voice in the upcoming election.\n\nThere’s at least one state where voters will decide this fall what gets taught in the classroom. West Virginians will consider a ballot question known as the Education Accountability Amendment, which if passed, would amend the state constitution to give the majority-Republican legislature more control over just about every aspect of public schooling.\n\nUntil bans on truth teaching are lifted, our democracy will become increasingly susceptible to the exacerbation of the racial tensions, inequities, injustices and violent acts of racism that have always kept America from reaching its full potential. Educators, meanwhile, will have unchecked authority to lie to school children about race. One recent example of this is educators’ failed attempt to change slavery to “involuntary relocation” in Texas schools.\n\nThose who truly care about the advancement of our democracy must insist that its full truth be taught. Unfortunately, we may have to wait a while before that discussion resumes in our public schools.\n\nShaun Harper is a professor at the Rossier School of Education and the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California.

He tweets @DrShaunHarper.\n\nValerie Wolfson: Teachers deserve trust and respect\n\nValerie Wolfson Courtesy Valerie Wolfson\n\nI’m a middle school social studies teacher in New Hampshire and an avid supporter of public education. Having taught for over 20 years, my greatest joy is participating in a democratic institution that is for everyone.\n\nI stand for all my students by committing myself to perpetual learning and growth. I continue to update instructional strategies, let go of old projects that no longer serve my current students and adapt my curriculum and language to ensure my approaches are culturally sensitive.\n\nI teach well-rounded history to the best of my ability as I continually strive to keep my background knowledge robust. I am here to hold space for all my students regardless of their identity, political positions or other affiliations. To do this, I must rigorously and regularly examine my biases, consider what and whom I am centering and why.\n\nThat’s why it was so disheartening to see laws like House Bill 2 (sometimes referred to as the “divisive concepts” law) pass in New Hampshire. The disrespect and lack of trust it communicates to the hundreds of honorable educators I know and work with cannot be overstated.\n\nThe measure, formally known as the Right to Freedom from Discrimination in Public Workplaces and Education bill, was written with the mistaken idea that discrimination is somehow endorsed or practiced in public spaces and classrooms.\n\nThe new law bars educators from teaching that any particular group is inherently racist, sexist or otherwise oppressive. It purports to promote teaching about people without regards to their race, gender, disability or other differences. But the language is so vague that it discourages teachers from having classroom conversations about race, racism and discrimination.\n\nLegislation like HB2 and similar laws in other states are obstacles to growth, student well-being and compassionate practices. HB2 prohibits schools in New Hampshire from creating mandatory equity training for faculty because someone might “feel bad.”\n\nBecause I teach social studies, I’ve developed a healthy resilience around complex conversations and divergent opinions. My entire career has been centered around navigating one tricky topic or another. I’ve mediated dialogues around presidential elections, the events of September 11, different wars and conflicts, and facilitated a variety of debates.\n\nThrough it all, I’ve dedicated myself to building a foundation of trust, joy, understanding, respectful discourse, care and acceptance in my classroom. Some of us are finding that harder to achieve under the new legislation. For example, a colleague who teaches in a nearby school district was told that if she openly said slavery was a “bad practice,” she must make it clear to her students that she is expressing an “opinion.” It’s an experience other teachers in my state have spoken about as well.\n\nAt what point did we decide it’s divisive to take a stance on cruel and dehumanizing activities? Who are we harming by taking a hardline on the concept of slavery? Our silence is an endorsement. That is our ethical crisis. That is what fear-mongering yields.\n\nTeachers deserve better: Shame and blame have been imposed upon a profession that is filled with loving, kind, compassionate and principled people. Choosing a career in education is almost always driven by a heart-centered desire to make a positive difference. I have never encountered a teacher in four districts, two states and 22 years who displayed devious political intentions.\n\nThe conflation of equity and inclusion work with “critical race theory” has led to wildly inaccurate and unfounded accusations. This “threat” has taken seed in the imaginations of some legislators and families.\n\nFuture voters must understand that disagreement is normal and healthy. Changing your mind in light of new evidence is logical and admirable. Nothing could be more American, patriotic or democratic than striving for a more just society.\n\nFeeling discomfort and dissonance often accompanies growth and learning; this is something I strive to normalize for my students. Teachers teach critical thinking and analysis by asking students to wrestle with challenging ideas and evidence. At some point, we have confused feeling uneasy with a lack of safety. There is a crucial difference.\n\nPoorly constructed laws were drafted to stop good, productive work under the guise of being “anti-critical race theory” and have resulted in the oppression of free thought, critical thinking and children. I know we can do better.\n\nMy message to lawmakers? Trust teachers. Asking them to be thoughtful, sensitive and inclusive is always reasonable. You’ll find that’s what they generally already are.\n\nValerie Wolfson, a middle school social studies teacher, was named the 2020 New Hampshire Social Studies Teacher of the year.\n\nNeal McCluskey: American schools have a diversity problem\n\nNeal McCluskey Neal McCluskey\n\nPublic schooling struggles with diversity. From early battles over the Bible to current fights over race, gender identity, prayer and more, public schooling – in which all must fund a single system of government schools – inevitably pits people with diverse values, needs and backgrounds against each other.\n\nBut why are conflicts burning especially hot now?\n\nCovid-19 set the conditions, creating clashes over in-person instruction and masking that many saw as having literally life-and-death stakes.\n\nThe murder of George Floyd added fuel, prompting many public school officials to target systemic racism – discrimination built into American institutions – and conservatives to demand colorblindness and an emphasis on America’s basic goodness. Graphic novels, such as “Gender Queer,” with graphic depictions of sexual activity, and other books on hot-button topics sparked dueling accusations of “hate” and “indoctrination.”\n\nThis all happened amid rapid demographic and social change.\n\nIn 2000, the US population was 71% non-Hispanic white. By 2020, that was down to about 58%. Gay marriage support skyrocketed from 27% of Americans in 1996 to 77% in 2021, while the share of people belonging to a church, synagogue or mosque plummeted from 70% in 1999 to 47% in 2020.\n\nWhat can deescalate education politics?\n\nNot “parents’ rights,” a term that can encompass useful things like requirements that districts share curriculum information, but sometimes seems invoked so that just one group of parents will get what it wants.\n\nGiving parents more say does nothing to change a system that forces diverse people, including parents, to fund – and fight to control – government-run schools.\n\nFreedom is the answer: Attach money to students – as many other countries do – and let families choose among diverse options. This can be accomplished through universal education savings accounts, such as Arizona recently enacted, scholarship tax credits and other choice vehicles.\n\nRegardless of how it is done, the goal of choice is to enable diverse families to access education they think is right rather than forcing neighbor to defeat neighbor to control public schools.\n\nNeal McCluskey directs the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute and is the author of “The Fractured Schoolhouse: Reimagining Education for a Free, Equal, and Harmonious Society.”\n\nDenise Forte and Randi Weingarten: How we can recover ground lost to Covid-19 closures\n\nDenise Forte Courtesy Denise Forte\n\nRandi Weingarten AFT\n\nAmerican students’ steady progress in reading and math has become the latest casualty of the Covid-19 era.\n\nIn the first results since the pandemic began, the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) showed steep declines in the math and reading scores of fourth- and eighth-grade students. It’s not hard to see why. The pandemic has disrupted three years of students’ lives.\n\nMore than 200,000 children in the United States are grieving the loss of at least one parent to Covid-19. The economic fallout of the pandemic exacerbated food and housing insecurity. People were, and still are, stressed and scared. And remote learning has always been an inadequate substitute for in-person instruction, although NAEP results show comparable drops in student performance in school systems that were quicker to reopen.\n\nSome critics see this as a chance to point fingers and to use kids as political pawns. We see it as an urgent call to institute short-term and long-term investments and proven strategies to support students’ emotional development and to accelerate learning, especially for Black and Latino students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who were underserved and behind their peers prior to the pandemic.\n\nWhat we must not allow is for students and educators to be dragged into bad-faith battles over bathroom access and participation on sports teams as an unwelcome distraction from ensuring that every student receives a great education and the supports needed to thrive academically and socially.\n\nThe good news is that we know what works from research and experience, and there is historic federal funding to accelerate learning and to start to remedy long-standing inequities. Resources from the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan and the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund can be directed so students have better access to experienced, diverse and certified teachers, high-quality summer and after-school programs, engaging and relevant curriculums and mental health supports.\n\nBoth our organizations are engaged in longer-term strategies to address the needs of kids, families and communities, but there are interventions that can help students right now.\n\nIn the short term, targeted, intensive tutoring has large positive effects on both math and reading achievement. Teachers tend to be the most consistently effective tutors; however, recent studies have found that paraprofessionals (teaching assistants), AmeriCorps volunteers and others who are trained to support student learning can be just as effective when tutoring one-on-one or in small groups.\n\nMany states are using state and federal funds to invest in strategies to increase the diversity of the workforce. Access to a racially and culturally diverse teacher workforce is beneficial for all pre-K-12 students, particularly for students of color, who often thrive in classrooms led by teachers who share their racial and cultural background.\n\nThe pandemic’s impact on children cannot be measured by assessments alone. But we hope that the alarm over the steep drop in NAEP scores creates urgency to address the conditions that contributed to the decline, many of which far predate the pandemic.\n\nEducators didn’t need to see declines in test scores to know what to do right now: focus like a laser on helping our kids recover and thrive.\n\nSafety was required to return to in-person teaching and learning. Now is the time to double down on proven strategies, using the resources we are fortunate to have, to deliver on a promise the US has not yet fulfilled—providing every child access to a high quality public education, without exception.\n\nDenise Forte is the CEO at The Education Trust. Randi Weingarten is president of the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nJay Richards: The battle over parents’ rights in education is just getting started\n\nJay Richards The Heritage Foundation\n\nIt should come as no surprise that parents have been fighting for their rights so vociferously when it comes to public education. They’re fighting because they sense that those rights are under attack.\n\nIt started with the lockdowns in 2020. For the first time, many parents suddenly saw, courtesy of online conferencing apps like Zoom, what their kids were being taught. And they didn’t like it: Toxic and divisive ideas about race – disguised as lessons on slavery and racism – contradicted the belief in racial equality that most Americans – whatever their politics – shared with civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nBut critical race theory is far less shocking than the radical gender ideology that seems to have overtaken our nation’s schools. It teaches children that “some people are boys, some people are girls, some people are both, neither, or somewhere in between”’ – as one popular children’s book puts it.\n\nSchools are promoting the notion that some kids – perhaps many kids if recent trends continue – are born in the wrong body. Suddenly, from Florida to Texas to Wyoming, parents are discovering that schools are teaching, seemingly across the curriculum, that an internal sense of gender trumps biological sex. Worse, some schools are changing, at their students’ request – but without their parents’ knowledge or consent – their students’ names and pronouns to conform to a child’s surprising new “gender identity.”\n\nWhen parents come to school board meetings to complain, far too many are met with silence or risible accusations that they are politicizing education. Parents have the primary right and responsibility to raise and teach their children.\n\nMany parents delegate part of the teaching task to schools, in an act of trust. Rather than acting as faithful stewards of that trust, too many schools have decided that it’s their job to alienate kids from “regressive” views of their parents.\n\nIs it any wonder that this has proved controversial?\n\nWe could dissipate some of the heat by increasing the rights of parents over their children’s schooling. States should connect school money to children, rather than to school buildings. Universal school choice for everyone – rich and poor, conservative and liberal – would not just make schools better and more competitive. It would make them less of an arena for the culture war that is otherwise roiling our culture.\n\nJay Richards is the William E. Simon Senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, where he is also director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Life, Religion, and Family.\n\nAkilah Alleyne: The education investments we need to make\n\nAkilah Alleyne Akilah Alleyne\n\nBook bans and censorship debates have always existed, but America’s children are facing an unprecedented moment in history. Today, school resources are stretched thin, schools are facing teacher and staff shortages and districts are still grappling with the long-term effects of the pandemic on student learning, as individuals’ rights to quality education are under increasing threat.\n\nImportant investments toward providing more supports for teachers, classroom aid and salary increases – such as by passing the RAISE Act – are needed now more than ever. That measure would provide teachers tax credits totaling as much as $15,000 each year.\n\nRather than addressing the real challenges facing teachers, many MAGA extremists have taken aim at books, racial and gender inclusion and more. Defunding the Department of Education, an ongoing federal level tactic among other changes in public school funding, should not be a topic of debate. However, it has also been central to MAGA Republicans’ federal policy agenda and could have devastating consequences for students nationwide.\n\nWhile parents are working with teachers and librarians to ensure that every child is acknowledged in school curricula and has a chance to thrive in school, regardless of who they are or where they live, far-right MAGA extremists are increasingly running for vacant school board seats or for reelection to gain control and power over decision-making at all levels of government.\n\nStudents and teachers want safer schools that reflect the diversity of their families and teach truthful history.

The result has been overwhelming bipartisan support for public schools over generations.\n\nBut the evidence of a crisis in our public schools is overwhelming: Hundreds of thousands of students have disappeared from school rolls, derailing their futures and foreshadowing budget woes when emergency Covid-19 relief funds expire. The Nation’s Report Card reported historic declines in reading and math scores, not surprising given pandemic disruptions.\n\nWhat’s more, educator morale is low, exacerbating staff shortages. Classrooms are targets in the culture wars, leading to book bans and speech codes that never end well. Young people report epidemic levels of anxiety and depression.\n\nThe pandemic and broader turmoil afflicting the nation have left public education in peril. Every one of us has a stake in reversing this decline because, whether we’re talking about growing the economy or strengthening democracy, every path to redeeming the promise of America runs through public schools. Addressing lost learning is important, and so is addressing the lack of trust in public education.\n\nPublic education has played an enormous societal role: In the 19th century, common schools forged shared identity when government of the people, by the people, for the people was a novel idea. In the 20th century, universal high school fueled the growth of the middle class.\n\nOver the last several decades, the broad vision that propelled America’s public schools has dwindled into a narrow, technocratic policy frame.\n\n“A Nation at Risk,” a major report on education released by the Reagan administration in 1983, used fear-based arguments to argue that reading and math test scores were essential for national security. This logic eventually transformed test scores from one critical indicator (which they are) to the very purpose of public schools (which they are not).\n\nEarly accountability reforms led to gains among low-income students and students of color, but progress plateaued a decade ago. Test-and-accountability reforms over-promised and under-delivered and no longer command broad bipartisan support.\n\nRenewing the promise of public education starts by rebuilding trust. Local education leaders were left holding the bag on school closings that should have been shared with health officials and political leaders.\n\nSchools were expected to arrange meals, computers and broadband access – burdens they often shouldered alone. This was thrust on school systems where teachers already felt beleaguered and disrespected; in truth, our schools have operated in a low-trust environment for years. This led to schools being closed for far too long with continuing consequences, not only in diminished learning but also in diminished public support.\n\nWe must recommit to the mission of public education.\n\nThe Aspen Institute recently convened a bipartisan group of state policymakers to ask: What do we want to be true about the opportunities our public schools offer? After reflecting on values and reviewing research, these policymakers authored “Opportunity to Learn, Responsibility to Lead.” The principles they developed refocus attention on the core purposes of education in a diverse democracy and market-driven economy. It presents an evidence-informed vision for schools as engines of opportunity, which could galvanize the political middle to coalesce around a more positive approach.\n\nState leaders should call for a public conversation about the future of their state and the role of public education in realizing that future. Unspent federal Covid-19 relief can be a perfect catalyst for this work. Grants to community-based organizations and PTAs, after-school providers, 4-H Clubs and faith-based youth groups can support stakeholders in articulating what they want to be true about their public schools and identifying opportunities in their communities. Universities, chambers of commerce and other civic organizations can use their own resources to sponsor similar inquiries.\n\nExperience demonstrates there is much common ground to be found in efforts to strengthen public schools. Channeling Americans’ shared commitment to opportunity is the ideal antidote to the cynicism and division currently plaguing the policy and politics of public education.\n\nRoss Wiener is executive director of the Education & Society Program at the Aspen Institute and the author of “We Are What We Teach.”\n\nElisa Villanueva Beard: We can fix America’s teacher shortage\n\nElisa Villanueva Beard Teach for America\n\nTeacher shortages are not new, especially in schools serving predominantly students from low-income backgrounds, who are disproportionately young people of color. Yet cracks in the system before the pandemic have become gaping crevasses: In February 2022, there were nearly 600,000 fewer educators in public schools than there were in January 2020, and National Center for Education data showed less than half of schools serving majority Black and brown students were fully staffed.\n\nThe organization I lead, Teach For America, has 33 years of experience attracting talented individuals early in their careers to teach in rural and urban classrooms. Our research into the priorities of current college students finds that they want to have an impact on what matters most in the world, and the issue of quality education for all children is in their top five.\n\nHowever, they also want to preserve their mental health and have financial stability, and the teaching profession’s low pay and structures that challenge work-life balance are deterrents – especially when the average student-loan debt is nearly $30,000 and many other professions offer flexible schedules and remote work options. This disconnect affects the profession at large, which has been struggling for years. Between 2008 and 2019, the number of graduates from traditional teacher education programs fell by more than a third.\n\nWe can tackle these issues in a number of ways: by increasing teacher pay; creating financial incentives for effective educators to teach in schools serving low-income communities; expanding student loan forgiveness for teachers, especially in hard-to-staff schools and subjects; ensuring teachers’ have sufficient resources and planning time, proper administrative help and the support of counselors and nurses; and fostering educator wellbeing by offering mental health supports and addressing sources of occupation-related stress.\n\nThese policies and practices will make teaching more desirable and accessible and will work to increase the racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the teaching workforce, a move that research shows has a positive impact for students.\n\nAs essential as these efforts are, they are not sufficient to address teacher shortages in the long term. Our country must think boldly at this moment about another problem that needs solving: What if the real issue is not that young adults don’t want to teach, but that the purpose of education has changed drastically and our education system has not kept up? What if we’ve reached the limits of this outmoded system and the conventional role of the teacher?\n\nIt’s time to expand the traditional definition of learning to include all the skills and mindsets that students want and need to thrive in our 21st century world and careers of the future: qualities like developing empathy, sustaining mental health and wellbeing, building relationships and applying learning to solve real-world problems.\n\nRedefining learning opens the door to a more diverse set of adult leaders to work alongside educators and students: professionals in various fields who can support the development of students’ workplace skills; college students who can support digital literacy and serve as tutors and mentors; and any number of community leaders who can support students’ sense of belonging.\n\nGet our weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFor example, technology could allow expert educators to teach multiple classes virtually while a colleague who is expert in creating productive learning spaces – where every student is valued and feels they belong – focuses there. Many teachers excel at both roles – we just don’t have enough of them to staff every classroom in our country. This shift is not only about making teachers’ jobs more sustainable, but also about positioning teachers to further develop their areas of greatest expertise.\n\nFundamental changes of this magnitude don’t happen quickly. But, for too long, we’ve expected teachers to carry the weight of an outmoded education system. We can’t just replenish this system. We must redefine what and how students learn and reimagine the role of the teacher to inspire a new generation of purpose-driven young people to get involved and reinvent the system for a stronger, more equitable future.\n\nElisa Villanueva Beard is the CEO of Teach For America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving educational access, opportunity and outcomes for young people in low-income communities.

For the latest updates from USA TODAY, click here.\n\nWASHINGTON – In a significant increase in measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus, President Donald Trump on Monday issued guidelines that called for Americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people and to limit discretionary travel.\n\nThough he stopped short of imposing a national quarantine or curfew, Trump said the country may be dealing with a number of restrictions through July or August as a result of the virus. He acknowledged the economy may be heading into a recession.\n\n“If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration all together,’’ Trump said in the closest he came to displaying levity in a somber news conference that underscored the seriousness of the situation.\n\nJust the previous day, Trump had sounded gleeful over news that the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates to near zero, though that did not stop the stock market from tanking again on Monday.\n\nThe new guidelines, which are recommendations and not mandates, call on Americans to avoid social gatherings involving groups of more than 10 for the next 15 days. They also suggest that school-age students take classes from home when possible.\n\nTrump called for governors in states with evidence of community transmission to close schools in affected and surrounding areas. Bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms and other venues where groups of people congregate should also be closed in states with evidence of community transmission.\n\n“Each and every one of us has a critical role to play,” Trump said, surrounded by members of his coronavirus task force.\n\nAmong the other guidelines:\n\n-- If someone in your house has testified positive, keep the entire household at home. Do not go to work or school.\n\n-- If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.\n\n-- If you have a serious underlying health condition, stay home and away from others.\n\n-- Avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips and social visits.\n\n-- Avoid eating or drinking in restaurants bars and food courts. Use drive-through, pickup and delivery options.\n\n-- Do not visit nursing homes or retirement or long-term care facilities unless you are there to provide critical assistance.\n\n-- Practice good hygiene such as washing your hands, especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces. Avoid touching your face.\n\nEarlier Monday, the White House pushed back on news reports that it is considering imposing curfews and a national quarantine in the wake of the spread of the epidemic.\n\n\"This is not correct,\" tweeted Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the task force.\n\nTrump confirmed he's not ready at this point to impose a national quarantine.\n\nIn the morning, markets halted trading for 15 minutes moments after opening when stocks immediately fell more than 7%. When trading resumed the drop continued. For the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,997 points, its biggest drop of all time, eclipsing the 2,352-point fall it had on Thursday.\n\nThere were slivers of light in the darkness – U.S. health officials on Sunday pledged to ramp up testing efforts by the tens of thousands. And testing began on a vaccine.\n\nBut the U.S. death toll rose to 85, with more than 4,600 known cases as of Monday afternoon. The global deaths surged past 7,100.\n\nIn an attempt to slow the virus, more than 30 states ordered the shuttering of all schools.\n\nOther important headlines on coronavirus:\n\nMost of S.F. Bay Area told to shelter in place\n\nIn the most restrictive measure yet by local governments, officials in six San Francisco Bay Area counties on Monday issued a shelter-in-place mandate affecting nearly 7 million people.\n\nThe order, effective Tuesday, says residents must stay inside for three weeks and venture out only for necessities. The order affects the counties of San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa, as well as the city of Berkeley.\n\nPeople should work from home unless they provide essential services such as public safety, sanitation and health care.\n\n“The most important thing you can do is remain home as much as possible,” San Francisco Mayor London Breed posted on Twitter. “There is no need to rush out for food or supplies, as these stores will remain open.”\n\nResidents can still go outside to perform essential functions, such as obtaining services or supplies for the household, and they're also allowed to go exercise and take pets out as long as they maintain a social distance of at least six feet.\n\nThe other three Bay Area counties of Napa, Solano and Sonoma were not included in the order, at least for now.\n\nSome courts in the California, including the Bay Area, are delaying trials and even temporarily closing their doors in hopes of helping prevent the virus from spreading further.\n\nFitness chains announce closures throughout U.S.\n\nPopular fitness clubs — from Orangetheory, SoulCycle, Gold's Gym and Equinox — announced closures Monday.\n\nBoca Raton, Florida-based Orangetheory announced it was closing its franchise-owned high-intensity training locations nationwide at end of classes Monday, and asking independent owners to follow suit. In a letter, CEO David Long stated a March 31 goal to re-open. Orangetheory Fitness franchisees have opened over 1,300 studios in all 50 U.S. states and over 23 countries, per a news release.\n\nSoulCycle stationary-bike studios announced a closure around the world for its clubs on Monday. Interim CEO Sunder Reddy did specify a re-opening date. Soulcycle has nearly 100 locations, most of them in the United States, according to its website.\n\nGold's Gym announced on Instagram that the franchise-owned gyms would close nationwide Monday at 8 p.m. through March 31. Gold's Gym has over 400 US locations, according to its website.\n\nIn announcing the closure of Equinox Clubs to members on Monday, starting at 8 p.m., chairman Harvey Spevak wrote, \"The COVID-19 health crisis is presenting challenges that are unprecedented in our lifetime.\" Equinox has 106 clubs, according to its website.\n\nLife Time Clubs also announced the closure of all locations Monday. The company has more than 150 locations in 41 markets across the U.S. and Canada, according to its website.\n\n-- Jordan Culver, Bryan Alexander and Bill Keveney\n\nCBS, ABC reporters test positive for coronavirus\n\nSix people at CBS News have tested positive for coronavirus, including a correspondent stationed in Italy, as media organizations fought Monday against the same epidemic they’re charged with covering.\n\nFive employees with the virus work in CBS’ New York offices, where most of its journalists were ordered to stay away as a result.\n\nABC News said Monday that a journalist who worked on the network’s coverage team of the outbreak in Seattle had tested positive for coronavirus. The person, who works in ABC’s Los Angeles bureau, has been isolated since last week and has suffered only mild symptoms.\n\nThe network said it has told its entire Seattle coverage team to stay home and has closed its Los Angeles bureau for a thorough cleaning.\n\nAt NBC, an employee who worked on the “Today” show tested positive, forcing the show’s anchors Craig Melvin and Al Roker and others who came into contact with the person to be ordered to isolate in their homes as a result.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nKentucky Derby postponed\n\nFor the first time in 75 years, the Kentucky Derby will not be a part of the first Saturday in May.\n\nAmid growing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, Churchill Downs will postpone the Derby from May 2 to Sept. 5, according to a source, the Louisville (Kentucky) Courier Journal reported.\n\nThe last time the Kentucky Derby wasn’t held on the first Saturday in May was in 1945, when the government issued a ban on horse racing because of World War II. The ban was lifted on V-E Day (May 8), and the Derby was held on June 9. The only other year the Derby wasn’t held in May was in 1901, when it was raced on April 29.\n\n-- Jason Frakes, Louisville Courier Journal\n\nMcDonald's to close seating, play areas\n\nThe McDonald's fast-food chain will shut down seating areas at all of its company-owned outlets throughout the U.S., limiting sales to walk-in takeout, drive-thru and delivery service. Play areas will also be closed.\n\nThough the move only currently applies to restaurants McDonald's corporately owns, the company expects many of its franchisees to follow suit. That is likely to mean large swaths of McDonald's restaurants - of which there are roughly 13,800 in the U.S. - will operate as drive-thru only.\n\n\"Franchisees are strongly encouraged to adopt similar operations procedures while keeping the needs of their people and communities at the center of their decisions,'' McDonald's said.\n\n-- Charisse Jones\n\nAmtrak to cut Northeast Corridor trains by 60%, cancels Canada routes\n\nAmtrak is cutting its frequency on the Northeast Corridor by 60% of its typical weekday schedules between Boston, New York and Washington Monday in response to plummeting demand due to the coronavirus.\n\nAmtrak said Sunday that its Acela Express and Northeast Regional trains would continue to operate but at significantly lower frequencies. The railroad said in an email to employees last week that bookings had dropped 50% while cancellations had soared 300%.\n\nCanada on Monday closed its borders to non-citizens. The new restriction does not apply to U.S citizens. Still, on Monday Amtrak canceled its Cascades service north of Seattle to Vancouver, British Columbia. Starting Tuesday, Amtrak trains in New York that usually operate to Canada will no longer do so.\n\n-- Curtis Tate\n\nLos Angeles schools, Red Cross to open 60 food centers\n\nThe Los Angeles Unified School District, which announced it would shut down for two weeks starting Monday, won't be able to open 40 Family Resource Centers to provide childcare, district Superintendent Austin Beutner said in a statement.\n\nInstead, the district, along with the Red Cross, will open 60 \"grab-and-go\" food centers that'll be open for three hours on weekdays (7 a.m. until 10 a.m.). Students will be able to take home two meals at a time from the stations.\n\n\"At this time, state and local health and public safety officials cannot assure us it will be safe for the children and adults at the Family Centers for us to provide care for children at these sites,\" Beutner said in his statement, which was posted to social media. He added the district is \"deeply disappointed.\"\n\nThe food centers are set to open Wednesday.\n\n-- Jordan Culver\n\nN.Y. college dorms may serve as hospitals\n\nCollege dormitories, former nursing homes and other buildings could be converted into medical facilities to help treat the wave of coronavirus infections expected to hit New York state's hospital system in coming weeks and months.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo called on local governments to identify existing buildings that could most easily be renovated to handle the thousands of additional beds needed to treat New Yorkers with the illness COVID-19, as well as other unrelated medical conditions.\n\nThe plan includes deploying the National Guard as well as partnering with private developers and construction unions to complete the emergency project.\n\nIt would create an additional 2,000 beds in Westchester County alone. New York City would need another 5,000 beds and Long Island needs 2,000 beds based on the current rate of infections in New York and prior outbreaks in China, South Korea and Italy, Cuomo said.\n\nWithout adding new beds at temporary facilities, the state’s existing hospital capacity cannot handle the projected surge in COVID-19 patients, he said.\n\n“The wave is going to break, and the wave is going to break on the hospital system,” Cuomo said.\n\n-- David Robinson, The Journal News\n\nActors Idris Elba, Kristofer Hivju have the virus\n\nActor Idris Elba, known for his role in the HBO series \"The Wire'' and his movie portrayal of South African icon Nelson Mandela, revealed on Twitter that he has tested positive for coronavirus.\n\n\"I feel OK, I have no symptoms so far but have been isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus,\" the actor said in a video announcement. \"Stay home people and be pragmatic.''\n\nMonday evening, Kristofer Hivju, 41, the actor best known for embodying the renowned warrior (and admirer of Brienne of Tarth) Tormund Giantsbane on Game of Thrones, wrote on an Instagram post from Norway, \"Sorry to say that I, today, have tested positive for COVID19, Corona virus.\"\n\nLast week, fellow actors Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson revealed they have tested positive as well.\n\nCould US see high mortality rate if Americans don't follow guidelines?\n\nThe United States will end up with as high a coronavirus mortality rate as Italy without an aggressive response that includes Americans following the federal government’s guidance, Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on “Fox & Friends” Monday.\n\n“When you look at the projections, there's every chance that we could be Italy,” Adams said. Actual mortality rates are difficult to determine because not everyone who becomes infected is tested. But about 7% of Italy's confirmed cases have resulted in fatalities. South Korea, which tested and acted aggressively against the outbreak, has seen a death rate of less than 1%.\n\n“There's every hope that we will be South Korea if people actually listen, if people actually social distance, if people do the basic public health measures that we've all been talking about as doctors all along, such as washing your hands, such as covering your cough, and cleaning surfaces,\" Adams said.\n\nIn Washington state, where the virus' death toll has been heaviest, health officials reported that six more people have perished, bringing the total there to 48. By comparison, 71 deaths have been confirmed nationwide.\n\nKing County officials said the latest victims ranged in age from 50 to a woman in her 90s who lived in a nursing home in Redmond. None was identified as being a resident of the Life Care Center in Kirkland, which has been the epicenter of the virus in the state.\n\nUpdates from Washington:White House says coronavirus curfews not under consideration\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSeventh TSA officer tests positive\n\nA Transportation Security Administration officer at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the nationwide total to seven, according to the agency.\n\nOn Sunday, TSA said two officers in Florida had tested positive, one at Orlando International Airport and the other at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nLast week, three TSA officers at Norman Mineta San Jose International Airport tested positive, followed by a fourth one.\n\n-- Curtis Tate\n\nStocks plunge again\n\nStocks plunged at the opening bell despite the Federal Reserve's emergency action to cushion the economy from a pandemic that is shutting down global business and travel.\n\nMonday’s 12% drop for the S&P 500 means it has plummeted nearly 30% since setting a record less than a month ago, and it’s at its lowest point since the end of 2018. Losses accelerated in the last half hour of trading after Trump said the economy may be headed for a recession.\n\n“Investors aren’t happy because these rate cuts won’t stimulate the economy in the near term. You can’t stimulate demand if everyone is stuck in their house,” says Shana Sissel, a senior portfolio manager at CLS Investments.\n\n– Jessica Menton\n\nNJ, NY, Conn., Md. tighten rules for restaurants, other businesses\n\nNew York, New Jersey and Connecticut will limit all bars and restaurants to takeout and delivery services, part of a series of steps the states are taking collectively and separately to fight the spread of coronavirus. The states will also shut down all casinos, gyms and movie theaters, their governors said in a joint announcement. Grocery stores will remain open.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy went further, urging state residents not to leave their homes from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. daily.\n\n\"The #Coronavirus doesn't care about state borders, so this agreement with @GovNedLamont & @GovMurphy will help protect the entire Tri-State Area,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted. 'These temporary closures will last as long as is necessary to protect the public health.\" Maryland, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Washington state, Indiana and New York City are among places that have ordered bars to close and restaurants to stop dine-in service. Takeout and delivery will still be allowed.\n\n– Ashley Balcerzak, Joseph Spector and Jon Campbell\n\nSchools go dark across most of USA\n\nNew York City closed its 1,900 public schools, a difficult decision made by dozens of states and big cities as the coronavirus crisis swept through the nation's educational system. Mayor Bill de Blasio had balked at the move affecting more than 1 million students, in part due to meal plans that keep hundreds of thousands of low-income kids fed. The city was providing \"grab and go\" breakfast and lunch at all schools.\n\n\"We made the painful decision to suspend classes,\" de Blasio said. \"We’re going to begin remote digital learning on Monday, March 23, and we’ll do everything in our power to help our kids through this.\"\n\nLos Angeles, Houston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are among a long list of big cities that shuttered their schools. Disadvantaged families that rely the most on schools for stable services, such as meals and access to learning materials, will be some of the most negatively affected, experts said.\n\n“Wide-scale learning loss could be among the biggest impacts coronavirus has on children,” said Betsy Zorio, vice president of U.S. programs at Save the Children, an international children's charity.\n\n– Erin Richards\n\nCoronavirus news: What to know\n\nA roundup of additional important coronavirus news you need to know today:\n\nCurbside voting, a lack of poll workers: How coronavirus is affecting Tuesday's election\n\n'We're not being quarantined.

Trudeau is self-isolating at home with his wife, who has tested positive for the virus. His edict came as many Canadian \"snowbirds\" are returning home from winter respites in the southern U.S.\n\nAuthorities said everyone entering Canada will undergo screening and be asked to self-isolate for 14 days.

Non-Disney tenants in those locations \"will make decisions on whether to continue or adjust operations,\" read an announcement from Disney Parks.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor the situation and maintain regular contact with the appropriate officials and health experts,\" the Twitter announcement added. It did not include any projected re-opening dates.\n\n– Hannah Yasharoff\n\nSchools are closed. Does online learning really work?\n\nThousands of schools across the nation were closed Monday and will remain closed for weeks. Some school districts are trying to cope using online studies. But many students have no access to the Internet at home, and teachers and advocates worry the crisis will worsen the existing education gap for low-income households, even as they take steps to try to accommodate students with paper packets or loans of electronic devices.\n\nIn Paterson, New Jersey, where more than a quarter of the city lives below the poverty level, about 22% of households don't own a computer, tablet or smartphone and 36% lack an internet subscription, according to 2019 Census data.\n\n“Whenever possible, we will be using the district’s website and resources like Google Classroom,\" said school district spokesman Paul Brubaker. \"But we will still need to make resources available on paper for many of our students.\"\n\n– Hannan Adely and Ashley Balcerzak, Bergen Record\n\nWuhan, once the epicenter, sees normalcy returning\n\nChina relaxed travel restrictions in and around Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected, and thousands of workers returned to factories now ramping up production, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.

All travelers entering Beijing from overseas are now required to be quarantined at designated sites for 14 days.\n\nCoronavirus screening website launches in California\n\nA coronavirus screening pilot website for some California counties has been launched by Verily Life Sciences, a sister company of Google. The site – which President Donald Trump had hailed as a nationwide screening site in a press conference that reportedly caught Google off guard – is now live for people in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. Verily created the website in collaboration with federal, state and local officials. The goal is to take the site statewide. Californians can input their personal health information and then are directed to mobile testing sites for a nasal swab test. They'll get test results within days.

Giroir, assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health and Human Services, said gear and federal health care workers were being shipping out Monday.\n\nHealth officials said they were focusing those tests on two groups: Healthcare workers and first responders, as well as those who are 65 and older with a symptoms of respiratory problems and a fever of at least 99.6 degrees.

So it should come as no surprise that the thought of banning a book would make us riled.\n\nWhat happens when a book is challenged in school boards and public libraries? Titles can be removed from school curriculums or library shelves. Most public schools and libraries have boards made up of elected officials or members appointed by elected officials. It is by the power of these officials that a book can go from challenged to banned in a school district or public library. Even if it happens only once, it is one time too many.\n\nSure, there is the argument that we can bypass places such as public libraries and purchase a book. But that is true only for those with the financial resources to do that. For many, particularly children and young adults, school and public libraries are the only means to access literature.\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY staff looked at challenged and banned books and chose those that are meaningful to them. In the books' defense, we've written why they deserve a place in our schools, libraries and society.\n\nBanned books explained:Book bans are on the rise. What are the most banned books and why?\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\n'All Boys Aren’t Blue' by George M. Johnson\n\nWe’re failing young queer readers, specifically Black and young people of color, if a book like activist George M. Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” stays on banned-book lists. Published in 2020, this memoir-manifesto follows the author’s journey of growing up a queer Black person and is an indispensable piece of literature for high school readers. Johnson explores their childhood, adolescence and college years while revisiting traumatic and transformative experiences and weaves in important statistics about the LGBTQ community. Johnson candidly – and some might think, explicitly – explores their sexuality and unpacks their experiences with sexual assault in a way that’s necessary for readers to heal. The American Library Association listed the book No. 3 on its list of the 10 most-challenged books of 2021. Both a primer for teens looking to be allies to the LGBTQ community and a YA book meant to make young queer readers feel seen, Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is a force to be reckoned with. – Pamela Avila\n\n'Gender Queer' by Maia Kobabe\n\nWhy do we tell teens to shave their legs if we resent having been told to ourselves? This question, among so many others, has been haunting me since I read “Gender Queer,” Maia Kobabe’s autobiographical graphic novel that explores the author's experience coming out as nonbinary and asexual. Through the novel, Kobabe vividly unravels small personal moments common to so many young people, exploring the discomfort inherent in everyday experiences like routine Pap smears. Kobabe raises a lot of excellent questions about the social mores of gender and the avidity with which society feels compelled to assign gender even though it is unique to individuals. Reading “Gender Queer” for the first time was like experiencing a jolt of adrenaline. It’s a book about Kobabe’s journey, but it allowed me to reframe mine, offering me the space to excavate my past and challenge my own self-concept. “Gender Queer” encourages growth and self-acceptance, and its removal from libraries is a huge disservice to teens. – Madison Durham\n\n'The Hate U Give' by Angie Thomas\n\nOne of the most challenged books in the country is this award-winning, bestselling middle-grade novel. Since the book’s release in 2017, it has been no stranger to controversy. The book’s critics say there’s too much sex and profanity. Some said it breeds contempt for police. The crux of the story, however, is systemic racism. Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter loses her best friend, Khalil, after he is shot and killed by a police officer. It’s a familiar story: Khalil, a Black kid, was unarmed when the white officer shot him. Khalil’s death becomes national news. Protests ensue. And a narrative forms, painting Khalil as a troublemaker and drug lord. Starr is caught between two worlds: her poor neighborhood and the rich prep school she attends. It’s the same story many Black children have lived. After Khalil’s death, Starr finds her voice of activism and pride in her Black identity. The banning of Thomas’ book is another reminder many people are uncomfortable with the message of the Black Lives Matter movement. – Tracee Herbaugh\n\n‘Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda’ by Becky Albertalli\n\nSixteen-year-old Simon Spier has a crush on an anonymous gay classmate who goes by the name Blue online, and with whom he has been exchanging increasingly flirtatious emails. One problem: Neither knows the other’s real identity. Another problem: Simon is still closeted. But when a nosey classmate finds Simon’s emails and threatens to out him, cautious Simon needs to step outside his comfort zone before he’s pushed out. What’s so welcome about Albertalli’s tale of high school high jinks, secret crushes and fraught friend-group dynamics is how ordinary and familiar it is. This sweet and funny high school story is light on trauma and big on laughs, and a balm to queer readers who want to see themselves reflected in happy coming-out stories. (It also has a rather good film adaptation, “Love, Simon,” starring Nick Robinson and Jennifer Garner.) – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Kafka on the Shore' by Haruki Murakami\n\nThis is one of the most hauntingly, mind-bendingly beautiful books I've ever read. The surreal novel weaves two parallel plots that meld music and metaphysics, time and fate, and loss and alienation as it follows the young Kafka Tamura, who is fleeing an Oedipal curse, and Satoru Nakata, an old man with a knack for talking to cats. \"Kafka on the Shore\" is an imaginative literary puzzle sure to challenge students and their conceptions of what a novel could, or should, be. Chock-full of surreal happenings, nothing is clearly defined in this book. Murakami leaves the story open-ended for readers, giving them space to decide what to draw from it – a level of freedom they may not often be afforded when dissecting more “classic” novels typically included in curriculums. In a setting where students are often instructed to find \"the right answer,\" \"Kafka on the Shore\" is a breath of fresh air that can stretch their imaginations. – Christine Fernando\n\n'Twilight' by Stephenie Meyer\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, I snuck into my sister’s room and grabbed a copy of \"Twilight.\" It was just before the \"Breaking Dawn – Part 1\" movie release, and \"Twilight\" fever had hit my school. The story of Bella, Edward, vampires and forbidden love features all the hallmarks of coming-of-age literature and introduced me to themes I hadn’t seen in media yet. \"Twilight\" brought me together with my peers to talk about reading, giving me new worlds to explore and new friends to talk about them with. Banning \"Twilight\" severely limits the opportunity for students to take reading into their own hands and enjoy a coming-of-age story full of fantasy and imagination. – Chris Panella\n\n'I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter' by Erika L. Sanchez\n\nFor young women struggling with mental health struggles, the loss of a loved one, the loss of innocence and outdated expectations that often come with growing up in a Latino household, Sanchez’s 2017 YA novel “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” can be a lifeline. In August, Madison County Schools in Mississippi removed 10 books from general library circulation, including Sanchez’s. High school is a tough time, and young people in particular pick up a book to escape reality or to make sense of the changing world around them – reading makes them feel safe enough to express how they’re feeling. And making a book like Sanchez’s inaccessible hinders the representation young Latino readers need. – Avila\n\n'The Odyssey' by Homer\n\nOdysseus’ 10-year journey after the Trojan War back home to Ithaca to his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, has a lot going on – a lot dark going on. Witches, slavery, tricks, betrayal, Cyclopses, grim and gory deaths, cannibal giants, varied monsters, murderous guests and mass slaughter all feature in the epic (in the original sense) tale from the eighth century BCE. It’s a wild ride with bad role models, and there couldn’t be a more classic example of the Books by Dead White Men vein of literature. That being said: “The Odyssey,” both the book itself and the themes it explores, are so deeply woven into the fabric of our modern culture that the name itself is a genre. Knowing \"The Odyssey\" is like getting a peek into the source code of innumerable (truly) works of literature spanning 28 centuries, giving any reader a deeper, more nuanced understanding of not just countless works of art but of culture itself. (And as it happens, it’s a fantastic, gripping story that’s a joy to read in its own right.) – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry\n\n'Speak' by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nIt's funny that \"Speak\" is so challenged, considering I was in high school when I read it. Apparently, it \"exposes children to immorality\" – reasoning you don't know whether to laugh or cry at. Adults who think teenagers aren't already exposed to everything probably don't remember what it was like being a teenager. Sexual assault, unhappy families and the nuances of high school life are real-world issues that teens are already aware of. Kids need books that start difficult conversations, that demonstrate the importance of using your voice and having someone who listens, that show you can rise above adversity. \"Speak\" is beautiful in its spare prose and simplicity. Many can relate to, and laugh with, Melinda's dry humor and cynical voice. It's a necessary story that gives permission to students whose voices are silenced to take up space – and speak. – Nusrat Sultana\n\n'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodi Picoult\n\nI was in eighth grade when the Columbine shooting happened, back when the concept of a school shooting was new. Children and teens today live in a very different reality, with active shooter drills and school shootings as part of their everyday life and consciousness. Parents have challenged this book because of its depictions of a school shooting; the bullying and romantic partner violence that led up to it; and the trauma and suicides that came after. Children are bullied. Teenagers are in abusive relationships. They get pregnant and grapple with decisions about abortion. Adolescents struggle to define their sexuality. Young people contemplate suicide and kill themselves. Banning books about these topics doesn’t make them cease to exist. The story, so beautifully told, touches on all of these topics because these are the traumas teens battle, some of which have directly contributed to violence in schools. If we’re unwilling to let young people read about, think about, process and dissect the very traumas they experience all around them, how can ever hope to solve these problems? – Katie Wedell\n\n'Blubber' by Judy Blume\n\nI read “Blubber” in fifth grade, and it's the most pivotal book of my youth. The book’s main character is a young fifth grader, Jill, who joins the more popular kids in the class to ostracize Linda, a girl nicknamed Blubber because of her size. The main reason the book has been banned is because nothing happens to Jill and her fellow bullies. That is precisely why I needed this book. In the fifth grade, I was Linda. “Blubber” was inspired by an incident in the author’s daughter’s own fifth grade class, and what Blume saw was not the exception but often the rule. In real life, bullies often get away with their behavior. While the similarity between myself and Blubber stung, it also provided solace. I was not alone. This was not something that happened only to me. Others knew how I felt. And that meant everything. It is always satisfying to read stories with happy endings, but it is just as important to read ones that don’t. Because in life, there are bullies and unresolved endings, and that is something that every fifth grader should know. – Mary Cadden\n\n'Lord of the Flies' by William Golding\n\nGolding uses preteen boys to show readers how a group of people will mistreat those they simply don’t like and even beat a child to death out of fear arising from a conspiracy theory. The use of boys as main characters may make it easier for some to understand the forces that can erode a society, or may make readers feel alarmed about the “end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.” Either way, this book can prompt young readers think deeply about governance and societal leadership in a way that will inform them throughout their lives. – Erin Mansfield\n\n'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" revolves around the friendship between two migrant workers during the Great Depression. I remember reading the book for my high school English class and thinking about loneliness as well as companionship. The two protagonists are brought together by a shared dream of purchasing land that's eventually shattered by the predatory social environment for migrant workers at that time. With this book, school-age readers have the opportunity to examine the conflict between reality and the American dream, in addition to human friendships. – Rayna Song\n\n'A Light in the Attic' by Shel Silverstein\n\nSilverstein’s collections of poetic nonsense was a classic on our living room bookshelf. His fantastical black-and-white sketches begged a wild imagination and a healthy sense of humor. They posed impossible scenarios, built as much for wordplay as they were for plot. \"A Light in the Attic\" has been banned in some schools over claims it promotes disrespect and violence. To argue this is to argue that children are unable to understand hyperbole. I am a deep believer that adolescent minds should be taken seriously, that they always understand more than we think and that they grow best when we overestimate them. The greatest children’s authors know this. I want the next generation to learn just as I did from Silverstein the joy of twisting words in different ways, of laughing at themselves, and of finding poetry and humor in everyday life. – Anna Kaufman\n\n'Eleanor & Park' by Rainbow Rowell\n\nRowell’s novel captures what it means to be a misfit teenage girl in a world that wants to cast you aside. As a teenager, this book made me feel seen as it keys into the nuances of being an outcast while coming into your own. This book has been banned for coarse language and sexuality, but it covers difficult topics such as racism, domestic abuse and body image that are enlightening for teen and adult readers alike. With high school years being a turbulent time for many, \"Eleanor & Park\" provides a much-needed perspective on surviving your teenage years in the face of adversity. – Samantha Mangino\n\n'Two Boys Kissing' by David Levithan\n\nI revisited “Two Boys Kissing” almost 10 years after first reading it, and – in the best possible way – it was more of a gut-punch than I'd recalled. The narration by a Greek chorus of men who died of AIDS is an emotional reminder of the strong bonds of chosen family. This book feels especially timely as progress on LGBTQ rights faces renewed political backlash and as monkeypox spreads mainly through our community. Reading “Two Boys Kissing” today shows how much has changed in the past decade while highlighting what work there still is to be done – and what we may be in danger of losing if we become complacent about our progress. The young characters remind us what is at stake and who most needs to hear these stories and feel a community’s love today. – Zach Wichter\n\n'Something Happened in Our Town: A Child’s Story About Racial Injustice' by Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins, Ann Hazzard\n\nAs this book follows a Black family and a white family discussing the police shooting of a Black man, its first page reads, “the grown-ups didn’t think the kids knew about it.” Amid nationwide conversations about race, many parents assume children are in the dark or unable to have meaningful discussions about racism. But children hear the murmurings and have questions. Shutting those down means lost opportunities for learning. A growing body of research shows children begin to notice race years before adults want to talk about it with them. Delaying these conversations and ignoring the realities of racism could make children more susceptible to racist beliefs. After all, it’s the adult’s responsibility to help children make sense of their social world. “Something Happened” approaches these conversations with care and includes child-friendly discussion guides curated by child psychologists to help encourage vital parent-child conversations about race. – Fernando\n\n'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky\n\nEvery person I’ve spoken to who read “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” when they were in high school remembers it as a teenagehood-defining book. Chbosky writes beautifully and timelessly from the mind of high school freshman Charlie, an introvert who gets taken under the wing of a group of upperclassmen and learns the value of letting others into his life. Some of the content throughout can be intense or inappropriate for younger readers – topics include alcohol, drugs, sex, abortion, mental health struggles, suicide and sexual abuse. But these are all things high schoolers can and often do experience, and blocking them from a story that explores them in a thoughtful, empathetic way doesn’t do anyone any good. More, it holds teenage readers back from discovering a story that may guide them through a tumultuous period. Years later, I count myself one of the lucky many to have found this story when I did. – Hannah Yasharoff\n\n'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' by Maya Angelou\n\nAngelou’s beautifully written autobiographical novel touches on two important and painful subjects that often get it banned from schools: rape and racism. While they may not be the most comfortable topics, they’re still as prevalent in 2022 as they were in 1969, when the book was published. It features some graphic depictions, but the sad truth is these topics are not new to many young adults, and reading about Angelou’s healing journey is instrumental in letting them know they’re not alone. Simply banning a book that depicts rape and racism doesn’t shield readers from facing them in their lives; it just removes another resource that may help them move forward. – Kate Ellsworth\n\n'The House on Mango Street' by Sandra Cisneros\n\nThere are some novels that read like poetry, and \"The House on Mango Street\" is on that list. Cisneros uses short vignettes to show key moments in the life of Esperanza, a 12-year-old Latina girl growing up in Chicago, poised in the awkward time between childhood and adolescence. The writing is truly lovely, and the use of vignettes creates a feeling of being inside someone’s memories. Through Esperanza, Cisneros creates a portrait of a community, both the love and support as well as the restrictive and painful aspects. The latter includes moments of domestic and sexual abuse, and as Esperanza ages within the novel, her understanding and descriptions of those situations become more explicit, although never graphic. It is easy to understand why the book has won multiple awards, as Cisneros plays with narrative form and storytelling, and questions what it means to belong in a fascinating and wonderful way. – Rebecca Viser\n\n'Maus' by Art Spiegelman\n\nSpiegelman's semi-autobiographical novel about his parents' experiences in Auschwitz and his family's subsequent lifelong traumas is a masterpiece of Holocaust literature and should be essential to all school-age readers. Though \"Maus\" is not a children's book, its graphic medium and depiction of Jews and Germans as mice and cats makes the topic more approachable for younger readers still trying to get their heads around the unfathomable historical horror. The only way to avoid a second Holocaust is to teach the first. –VanDenburgh\n\n'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry' by Mildred D. Taylor\n\nAmerican public school reading curriculum is heavily white. I can attest to that with my own experience: In my 12 years as a student in American public schools, I was assigned only one novel by an African American writer, and that was Taylor’s Newbery Medal-winning story of the Logan family, sharecroppers in rural Mississippi whose love for one another helps them survive the cruelties of the Jim Crow South. I grew up a pretty privileged white kid with no personal experience of racism, and I can keenly recall how hot I burned with the unfairness of it reading “Roll of Thunder” for the first time in the second grade. If we want to create more anti-racists, we need to assign more diverse books in schools, and “Roll of Thunder” is still a great place for young readers to start. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Animal Farm' by George Orwell\n\nI first read it in middle school in Phoenix, only a few years after my family had escaped communist Vietnam in 1975. I checked it out of my school library because of the title and was ready for enchanted spiders and pigs like in “Charlotte's Web” by E.B. White. Instead, in Orwell’s attack on the Soviet Union, I recognized all too well what my family was hearing from relatives who hadn’t been able to flee the fall of Saigon. Daily indoctrination classes, South Vietnamese officers sent to reeducation camps and their homes confiscated and given to communist officers. Those who could still afford radios risked imprisonment to listen to Voice of America because you couldn’t believe the state-run media. Orwell wrote “Animal Farm” because he wanted to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a way anyone could understand. And children everywhere need to. – Thuan Le Elston\n\n'Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out' by Susan Kuklin\n\nA 2019 study revealed that about 3% of American teens (ages 13 to 17) identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming. In this book, Kuklin interviews six trans teens about their childhoods, their coming-out experiences and where they are today. It brings hope to trans teens that there is a future for them, and it provides a clear look into their minds for loved ones to truly understand their points of view. Despite this book receiving many awards, it was in the top 10 Most Challenged Books lists for 2015 and 2019 for “its effect on any young people who would read it.” To the contrary, this book provides a unique perspective on gender and sexuality to help teens learn about themselves from other people their age. I believe this book does a great service to the young LGBTQ community. – Melissa Rorech\n\n'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' by Sherman Alexie\n\nI first read the story of Junior as he leaves his school on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington for an all-white school during Banned Books Week in middle school. As Junior struggles to find his place in a school where the only other Indian is the mascot, he grapples with generational poverty and discrimination. While I cannot fully understand Junior’s experience, I, as a person of color at an extremely white school, saw myself in his battle to explore identity in an environment that seeks to erase it. While the classroom offered a whitewashed, sanitized reality of Native Americans’ experiences, this book offered me a glimpse into the systemic oppression Native communities have faced since colonization. It shows tribes as part of the current fabric of our nation rather than merely part of history. And it examines a dimension of diversity that’s often forgotten: disability. In the hands of a trusted teacher who can guide students through difficult conversations, this story has the power to push readers into uncomfortable but important spaces and allow students whose experiences are often ignored in classrooms to be seen – all through the lens of an uproariously funny teen. – Fernando\n\n'Goosebumps' (series), by R.L. Stine\n\nIt’s fun to be scared. Granted, in controlled environments – movie theaters, haunted houses, or between the covers of a book. Or in the case of Stine’s beloved horror series, dozens of books starring a bevy of spooky frights: werewolves, ghosts, haunted Halloween masks and even an evil ventriloquist's dummy. These books have long been challenged in school libraries for being too scary, but those who object clearly don’t remember what it was like to be a kid with a vivid imagination. In a world so full of real horrors, the pretend ones offer escape and catharsis. Besides, if my generation could survive the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustrations, what possible danger could a few “Goosebumps” books be? – VanDenburgh\n\n'Bridge to Terabithia' by Katherine Paterson\n\nFarm boy Jess Aarons and imaginative, bright-eyed new girl Leslie Burke become friends and create Terabithia, a fantasy kingdom in the woods. Inspired bythe magic they brought to that wooded glade, I once made my own Terabithia in a circle of tall trees in my backyard while playing outside with my friends. But (spoiler alert) after Leslie fell to her death when the rope they used to swing to Terabithia snapped, I was shocked. I didn’t know then that Leslie’s death and Jess’ experience of it would feel much like how my own loss would feel in the many years to come – random and senseless. Seeing Jess in the aftermath of Leslie’s death prepared many of us for what loss would feel like, the unsparing pendulum swinging between the good days and the bad. Their story also taught me the power of joyful imagination and creativity, that people are complicated (even the bullies) and that, despite the devastating reality of death, there is hope for life after loss. – Fernando\n\n'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley\n\nFew classic sci-fi novels bear a more direct resemblance to modern times than \"Brave New World.\" Huxley explores a future in which the government’s obsessive need for economic growth creates an endless consumerist cycle and a society divided into a rigid caste system that separates people by jobs, intelligence and appearance. The world is painted as a utopia but only because its citizens are kept complacent by entertainment and mood-altering drugs. They believe they receive everything they want, but their places in society have been carefully curated by the government (and cloning technology). There’s no room to be an individual in Huxley’s futuristic England, and anyone who tries is punished. Consumerism. Prejudice. Happiness above truth. These are all things we continue to grapple with as a modern, global society. It’s as if Huxley traveled through time to 2021 before writing his novel. – Joanna Nelius\n\n'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret' by Judy Blume\n\n“Why would anyone want to ban ‘Are You There God’?” my sixth grade daughter asked. “It’s my favorite book.” Grace is 11, the same age I was when I read Blume’s classic novel – only it was too new to be called a “classic” back then – about preteen girls grappling with puberty (breasts and periods, anyone?), religion and sexuality. As with Grace today, it was my favorite book then. I found comfort and familiarity in Margaret, her friends and her conversations with God. Their world was my world, and Blume paints an unvarnished picture of what life is like for maturing girls. Those frank discussions of sensitive topics – often challenging for tweens and adults alike – are why girls love the book and adults challenge it. And why this mom is thrilled that it’s still one sixth graders reach for and cherish, a generation later. – Kristen DelGuzzi\n\n'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger\n\nTwenty years ago, a school board member in small-town South Carolina checked out Salinger's work from the high school libraries in his district. He planned to pay for the copies instead of returning them, he told the local newspaper. He didn't want students to read the “filthy, filthy\" book and said the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, was a poor role model. He already had tried once to ban it. His second attempt failed as well – though it wasn’t part of any curriculum. When I agreed to write about \"The Catcher in the Rye\" as part of this year’s Banned Book Week, I had no idea that the most infamous protest against it happened at my high school. Or that it played out when I was a sophomore, only a few years younger than the fictional Caulfield, in the throws of the kind of angst and ennui that defined Salinger’s prose. I didn’t read it until my mid-20s. Afterward, I realized I’d missed the moment. My rebellious years were behind me and I’d forgotten how isolating they could be. How much I could have used a book like that at the time. Finally, learning why it had been kept from me has reignited some of that disquiet. It’s not lost on me that old men who think they know best and stand in the way of students reading great literature are exactly the sort of people Caulfield railed against. So let me now be the proverbial catcher for the next generation: Kids, read it all. Especially the ones The Man tells you not to. – Cara Kelly\n\n'Persepolis' by Marjane Satrapi\n\nWhen I first read “Persepolis” in college, I was immediately enchanted with the punk rock protagonist of the graphic memoir. I never lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran, but to see Satrapi depict how the revolution disrupted people, families and communities has always stuck with me. I’m very much a supporter of women and girls who like to talk back, as Beyonce once sang, and who challenge the status quo. I’m not sure how anyone can read “Persepolis” and not be touched by how loving Satrapi’s family is even when they fear for her safety. Satrapi showed us what life was like as a young, rebellious woman growing up in Iran during the 1980s. For those who found a way to survive, they lived life as best they could. And like so many other young women coming of age, Satrapi had sex (gasp!) and cursed and used drugs. Experimenting is what young people do. It’s an insult to her vulnerability that some have tried to ban her book. – Mabinty Quarshie\n\n'The Glass Castle' by Jeannette Walls\n\nI first read \"The Glass Castle\" on assignment as a rookie reporter in my college town. The memoir had been selected by the university and county library as a summer book. It was an appropriate choice for two institutions little more than 100 miles from Welch, West Virginia, the closest thing the author has to a hometown. Many of the issues Walls faced as a kid are endemic to the area: poverty, substance abuse, violence. She tackled them head-on – so much so that her detailed descriptions have been used as fodder to ban the book from school curriculums. That shortsightedness misses how masterfully Walls infuses the truth about her problematic childhood with a sense of pride and perseverance. As a reporter in the Appalachian mountains, I knew kids there and across America were suffering the same social ills (and still do, made worse by the opioid epidemic, COVID-19 and financial downturns). Walls' writing tells them that they shouldn’t be ashamed of their circumstances and the decisions of adults around them, and that they don’t have to carry the stigma of poverty or abuse. I can think of few more meaningful messages. Save, maybe, the one she inscribed in my copy: “Just tell the truth!” – Kelly\n\n'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' by Mark Haddon\n\nThis was among the first books I read with a neurodiverse character at its core. Instead of letting Christopher sit on the periphery, Haddon brings the reader into Christopher’s perception of the world by writing the text in ways that make it more representative of his lived experience. The novel directly shows how Christopher perceives things, including how signs at a busy airport become overwhelming walls of text. This allows Haddon to bring into question whether what most people think of as “normal” is actually better. Christopher’s world is more compassionate and empathetic toward animals, including his pet rat, Toby, and the dog whose mysterious death he sets out to solve. Aside from being a phenomenal bildungsroman, the novel stands the test of time. I read it first as a teenager, and again in my senior year of college. Both times I walked away feeling as though I’d learned more than you’d think a fictional book could ever teach. – Lindsey Vickers\n\n'The Things They Carried' by Tim O'Brien\n\nThe Vietnam War may have started more than 60 years ago, but that doesn't make the war stories of \"The Things They Carried\" any less relevant for young readers today. It's not an easy read – but that's the point. Learning about the day-to-day struggles soldiers have to endure is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to be vulgar, explicit, and confusing because that's exactly what soldiers face. The novel provides an unfiltered view of war that vastly contrasted the way people felt about World War II. It represents a pivotal point in history and mirrors the public sentiment of the ’70s when people stopped romanticizing war and started critically examining why we go to war and how it affects those who fight. This book presents a much-needed glimpse into the real lives of soldiers, and while it may not be a feel-good read, it’s a necessary one. – Ellsworth\n\n'The Golden Compass' by Philip Pullman\n\nThe same reason as to why “The Golden Compass” was banned is the reason it should be a must-read. The novel is often described as the antithesis of “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which is known for its Christian allegories, because of its supposed message of atheism. Pullman’s first book in \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy pushes the boundaries with young characters seeing through the lies of organized religion (in this case the Magisterium) and eventually killing “God” himself. Regardless of the readers’ religion, it’s important for children to learn to question any and all institutions. Through a more contemporary lens, readers will surely appreciate Pullman’s themes even if they don’t agree with his conclusions. – Josh Rivera\n\n'Beloved' by Toni Morrison\n\nMotherhood in the U.S. has never been easy. We are a nation that reveres motherhood without providing the resources moms need to thrive. Just look at how many mothers suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Now imagine the trauma of being an enslaved Black mother who doesn’t even control her own body, much less her children's. “Beloved” shows us the impossible choices Black mothers were forced to make during slavery. Who could blame Sethe, the protagonist, for doing anything to prevent her children from being enslaved – even to the point of death? I certainly can’t. Slavery has never been pretty, and it never will be. There are moments of incredible pain and violence inflicted upon Black men and women in “Beloved.” We can’t look away from these horrors because a few people refuse to accept that racism was a fundamental part of U.S. history. Holding up the nation’s sins to our faces was a heroic choice Morrison made in her writing. And we were all the better for it. – Quarshie\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee\n\nWhen the school board in Biloxi, Mississippi, argued \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" should be kept out of the classroom in 2017 because it makes people \"uncomfortable,” they actually nailed the best reason to keep it on the shelves. Everything in the book is uncomfortable, and not because it accurately describes overt racism in sometimes noxious language. It’s uncomfortable because it holds up a mirror to our present: the ease with which neighbors will embrace lies and willingly fall in with a mob; a legal system working overtime to send a Black man to prison; how fear informs our uninformed view of the mentally ill; and the brutal dividing line between the poor and the privileged. This is a provocative book, not a perfect one. But the shortcomings of 1930s race, society and language it depicts which so distress critics – and made the Biloxi school board so uncomfortable – are not failings of the author’s words. They are the continued failings of our world. Now is not the time to look away. – Patricia Beall\n\n'The God of Small Things' by Arundhati Roy\n\nWinner of the Man Booker Prize, \"The God of Small Things\" focuses on twins and their family in Kerala, India. Roy explores how her characters’ lives – both past and present – are shaped by their social, political, religious and environmental surroundings. She provides readers with an insightful look into India’s colonial history, discriminatory caste system and the rise of the Communist Party in the nation in the late ’60s while challenging notions of forbidden love to present a complex portrait of an era and its societal consequences years later. It's an important read for students to understand the legacy of colonialism and the devastating impacts of discrimination. – Grace Hauck\n\n'The Outsiders' by S.E. Hinton\n\nWhen Johnny Cade implores Ponyboy Curtis to “stay gold,” it’s more than a wish from a dying friend. It’s a prayer of sorts to be carried throughout life, an adage to turn to when we need to offer encouragement or uplift ourselves. That line, taken from Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” is the moral centerpiece of Hinton’s “The Outsiders” and its study of innocence lost. Pitting the blue-collar “Greasers” against the wealthy “Socs” is a frequently employed trope, but the melancholy that pervades Hinton’s debut novel (which she wrote in high school!) resonates beyond a seemingly simplistic setup of contrasting socioeconomic status. Some find the murder in the book – Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the Socs and Johnny knifes one in self-defense – unsuitable for teen readers. But when Johnny later tries to rescue some schoolchildren from a burning church (and dies from his injuries), the point is made. Golden is eternal. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain\n\nBecause of needed context, I wouldn’t read it before “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” But “Tom” was a fling; “Huck” still holds my hand when I write. I can’t remember when I first read them, but English is my second language, and both helped me learn not only how English has changed but also how America has changed. When I met Huck, I heard only the boy’s voice and saw only what he understood. Upon rereading and realizing what Jim had been saying all along, I entered another universe through the eyes of a Black enslaved man, ripped from his family and fighting through his fear to survive. I never forgot how Twain gave depth to such different voices in “Huck.” He helped me write and rewrite my own novel. Keep “Huck,” for its teaching mechanics as well as its wise heart. – Elston\n\n'50 Shades of Grey' by E.L. James\n\nIn a time in which we consider ourselves forward thinkers, it is shocking to still consider any conversation revolving around sex taboo. \"50 Shades\" is one of the most well-known and controversial erotica novels, but there are a vast number of authors trying to broach the subject, many worrying their writing is good only behind closed doors. In writing \"50 Shades,\" James gives those writers a voice – those that have been waiting for the right moment to share their deepest, darkest desires with the world. It is necessary to normalize thoughts about sex and not slap tape across our lips to keep from expressing our tastes in the bedroom. – Nishka Dhawan\n\n'The Color Purple' by Alice Walker\n\nThe world would be a poorer place without Walker’s “The Color Purple.” Taking inspiration from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston, Walker centers on Southern Black women, who are all too often misrepresented in American culture. I was a little girl when I first picked up “The Color Purple” but it would take until I was an adult to fully comprehend the courage it took for Celie to let go of all the oppressive teachings she internalized and find her own freedom. Oftentimes, what people call “controversial” in literature is simply an author refusing to ignore the truth. Walker gave a gift to Black women and everyone else with “The Color Purple.” Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery may be a relationship that makes some people uncomfortable. But for Black LGBTQ people, it’s a necessary and affirming literary coupling. Don’t we all deserve to see our lives and truths reflected in the literature we read? – Quarshie\n\n'The Giver' by Lois Lowry\n\nA must-read dystopian novel for any teen, I first read this book in middle school, and then I reread it in high school and college. The main character, a tween named Jonas, is given the important role as ‘Receiver of Memory,’ where he is supposed to retain the beautiful and dark moments others in his community can't see. He can see color in a black-and-white world as well as the environment, animals, human emotions and past experiences. The book sheds light on the importance of freedom and living life as one chooses to, but the message goes deeper than that. Valuing our relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues in the real world is a gift. Oftentimes, we lose sight of what makes our life beautiful, even though it is right in front of us. And those lessons are conveyed elegantly in this book, from start to finish. Life is spontaneous and crazy, and there shouldn’t be someone telling us how to live our life when we have the ability to carve our own destiny. Banning this book would be a loss for children, not a gain – Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'A Separate Peace' by John Knowles\n\nI first read Knowles’ 1959 novel “A Separate Peace” at 14 as a closeted gay teenager. I next read “A Separate Peace” at 29 as an out gay adult. I provide this context because it absolutely shaped the way I read the story about wealthy teens at a New England boarding school at the start of World War II, and understood the relationship between Gene and Finny – one of platonic love bordering on romantic, one of pride bordering on envy and one of playing around bordering on violence. As clarified in David Levithan's afterword included in my edition, Knowles did not intend on homoeroticism between the characters. But Levithan gets to the heart of how I felt: “Knowles did not write about two boys who know they are gay or have conscious gay feelings, but he certainly created a compelling resonance for boys who do.” Thank you, Knowles, either way. – David Oliver\n\n'The Bluest Eye' by Toni Morrison\n\nSetting aside every major literary award bestowed upon her, Morrison’s oeuvre is too important to American literature to ever be cast aside or banned. I was a teenager the first time I read “The Bluest Eye,” too young to truly grasp the horror of what Morrison was writing about. Now, as a dark-skinned Black woman rereading it, I understand the suffering that Pecola Breedlove was subjected to. Little Black girls deserve literature that doesn’t shy away from the pain that white supremacy and patriarchy inflicts upon them. If we can’t read and contemplate the horrors that are inflicted upon our children, how will we ever make the world a better place? Yes, “The Bluest Eye” takes an unflinchingly look at sexual violence and incest. But in a nation still reeling from the #MeToo movement, we cannot afford to look away. Black women, like Native American women, are at a disproportionate risk for sexual violence. The literature written about African American women shouldn’t ignore these horrifying statistics either. – Quarshie\n\n'The Handmaid\\'s Tale' by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood said she didn’t include any events in the book that hadn’t already happened in history or any technology not already available. “No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities,” she wrote in The New York Times in 2017. The result is a book about a theocratic dictatorship that takes over the United States after climate change and declining birth rates threaten to cripple the nation’s economy. Fertile women are reproductive slaves, forced to bear children for the elite. In the 1980s, when it was published, the book read as a response to the political rise of Christian fundamentalists, the bombing of abortion clinics and the control of those behind the Iron Curtain. As we sit in 2021 with climate change threatening our coastlines and crops, a rising threat of nationalism and attempts to chip away at the hard-fought rights of women, minorities and the LGBTQ community, the plot seems evermore an apt prediction. What could be more important now than a book that explores the dangers of totalitarianism as we watch democracy challenged on the very steps of Congress? A book that explores the power of women as the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements push the next wave of feminism forward? A book with dire warnings about what can happen when resources get scarce, as drought and wildfires have become the new norm for a swath of our country? Because of its plausibility, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\" is timeless and relevant. It was a necessary book in the 1980s, and it's still a necessary book in 2021. – Wedell\n\n'1984' by George Orwell\n\nI read \"1984,\" one of the most thought-provoking and interesting dystopian books I have come across, back in high school when it was assigned reading for my English class. There is simply no other book that can show readers what it would be like to live in a society where the freedom to think and make choices for oneself is not allowed. The book sheds light on why it is important for people to express themselves and make choices, and why freedom of expression is important in society. Another important theme that struck my attention was misinformation and disinformation being spread by the ruling party. As an early career reporter, I strive to make sure the public knows the truth and the facts. This book is a must-read for any high schooler because it teaches lessons you wouldn’t get from any other book – Kochi\n\n'The Hunger Games' (series), by Suzanne Collins\n\nI fell down the \"Hunger Games\" rabbit hole during the pandemic. What started as something to pass time turned into a deep dive into Collins' post-apocalyptic world of Panem, a society deeply divided by wealth disparity, where the elite are more concerned with pageantry than basic human rights. I couldn’t help but notice some striking parallels between the dystopia and our pandemic-riddled nation. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And although we don’t send a boy and girl from each district to their televised demise, the constant loop of the trauma of Black and brown bodies being killed by police felt similar in the summer of 2020. The tale may have beenoutrageously dystopian when Collins published her first installment in 2008, but it is not as outrageous in the lens of 2021. Some Twitter users even compared the 2021 Met Gala in New York to a lavish party in District 1 as many communities grapple with the lasting effects of COVID-19. That’s exactly why this book shouldn’t be banned. – Cydney Henderson\n\n'A Wrinkle in Time' by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nThe first time I read “A Wrinkle in Time,” I was even younger than the sci-fi classic’s 13-year-old heroine, Margaret (Meg) Murray. At the time, I didn’t know how much I needed a heroine like her in my life. As I’ve reread the book (and read it to my own kids) many years later, I’ve sent up a brief word of thanks that I was introduced to Meg. She is thrust into impossible peril with unfathomable stakes, and she overcomes it. Resentfully, even angrily, she saves her family, not despite her flaws but because of them. A wild, strange, sprawling tale, “A Wrinkle in Time” let me know, just as it has for generations of young readers, that there’s immense power in being yourself; that the galaxy is weird, wide and wonderful; that love is the answer no matter the question; and that you can be terrified and do brave things anyway – in fact, you must. – Beaudry\n\n'Born a Crime' by Trevor Noah\n\nNoah’s 2016 memoir, \"Born A Crime,\" is at its core a love letter to his mother, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss man was a punishable offense in South Africa’s apartheid state. She rears Trevor through apartheid and its chaotic collapse, and eventually through her own abusive relationship with his stepfather by a mix of tough love, gallows humor and religion. Yet \"Born A Crime\" forces the reader – particularly American-born consumers – to look critically into corners where we too easily looked away. Certainly, apartheid was touched on in our history or government classes. Too often, though, its abstract presentation – brutal colonization, minority rule, a worthy martyr named Nelson Mandela – never encouraged us to get too close, lest we recognize our own pathologies. \"Born A Crime\" is breezy and sweet and often hilarious, a dubious target for censure, it would seem. Yet it does not equivocate in recounting a brutal chapter of history. – Gabe Lacques\n\n'Harry Potter' (series) by J.K. Rowling\n\nIt's a shame that Rowling tarnished her own legacy in recent years by attacking transgender people – for fans, her hate speech felt like a betrayal of the very values her books espoused. \"The Harry Potter\" novels have been frequently challenged by religious groups for supposedly promoting witchcraft. But snatching these books out of the hands of children because of that supernatural bogeyman would be doing them an awful disservice. The series taught a generation of readers about empathy, friendship and courage in the face of political danger – themes that Rowling would do well to apply to her own recent comments. Harry Potter is a powerful example of fiction's ability to make us more thoughtful and discerning people, and for that, it should not be banned. The books should continue to be shared and obsessed over, as they've been by readers of all ages for the past two decades. – Jason Lalljee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/09/10/racial-justice-central-york-students-protesting-school-board-book-ban/8259508002/", "title": "Racial justice: Central York students protesting school board book ban", "text": "This story has been updated to include a statement by the Central York School Board.\n\nStudents at Central York High School this week have been protesting over a list of Black- and Latinx-focused books the school board banned in August.\n\nMany staff and students believe a list of racial justice resources promoted by the district's diversity team last year led to a list of books that students are not able to access through Central York.\n\nFriday morning, about 40 students stood outside the school before class with signs calling for the school board to reverse the ban and recognize diverse voices.\n\nIn August, Central York High School Principal Ryan Caufman sent staff members a list of articles, videos, books and other resources that were banned from the school district. The list was mainly material focusing on Black and Latino representation in America.\n\nBanned resources include items such as a CNN collaboration episode with the children’s television show “Sesame Street,” an exhibit in the Smithsonian Museum available online and the PA Association of School Administrator’s statement on race.\n\n“If you look at it, I honestly and genuinely have to wonder if they looked at it themselves,” said Lauri Lebo, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania State Education Association. “Because if you look at this material, it's offensive what they banned. They have banned materials from Black voices, and they've had almost a year now and they haven't proposed anything else.”\n\nAccording to the Panther Anti-Racist Union (PARU), the student group organizing the protests, students plan to protest one more time on Monday morning, the date of the next school board meeting.\n\nResource refusal\n\nDiscussions began on the resource list in the summer of 2020, when racial justice protests began after the death of George Floyd.\n\nAccording to Delma Rivera, the diversity education specialist at Central York Middle School, the diversity committee put together the list to help educate students and parents who had questions about the racial unrest in the country.\n\nMore:Community outraged after Central York School Board members oppose anti-racism curriculum\n\n“Many of those books and articles and TED talks are even ones that I in my position at Central have recommended,” Rivera said. “Not as part of the curriculum, but as part of only a resource list for people to have available to them.”\n\nThe list was available to students and staff until Caufman sent an email on Aug. 11 announcing the materials were not to be used at all.\n\nSome teachers and students have suggested the ban was linked to a social studies program that was shelved by the school board in November.\n\nEvery five years, curriculum taught at the school is reviewed for possible updating, and the social studies team put together a program that highlighted more racially diverse history and influence.\n\nThere were debates, discussions and protests over the proposed program.\n\nTwo school board members, Vickie Guth and Veronica Gemma, said the curriculum would breed white guilt into the students.\n\n\"The references that were made in this committee about teaching tolerance talked about white privilege and white saviorism,\" Guth said at an August 2020 school board meeting. \"So, you can’t win. If you’re normal, you’re a white privilege. If you’re trying to change things, you’re doing it out of the savior mentality.\"\n\nThe board shelved the program.\n\nMore:Protesters speak 'inclusion' and 'diversity' outside Central York board meeting\n\nIn an email sent to Central parents Sept. 10, board president Jane Johnson wrote, in part:\n\n\"...Many District parents have expressed concern that certain resources on this particular list foster the opposite by promoting unequal treatment of individuals on immutable characteristics. They believe that rather than uniting on diversity, certain resources polarize and divide on diversity and are based on disputed theories and facts. The Board believes that the fundamental purpose of school is that of core academics, objective education without indoctrination from any political or social agenda, and we look forward to the forthcoming review of the List and bringing balance to our classrooms.\"\n\nThe “Twilight Zone”\n\nThe ban list hit students and teachers hard. Rivera, a Central York graduate, felt that much of the diversity progress she had seen over her lifetime began to recede.\n\n“I have been employed at the Central York School District as the diversity education specialist for the past 16 years, and I have never seen anything come close to this,” she said.\n\nRivera, who helped make the list of resources, was baffled by some of the materials banned. Teaching Tolerance, an organization that provides diversity-related resources to educators, had been supplying the school with posters and videos for years. It was halted by one email.\n\nAfter years of bringing diversity-conscious speakers to the district — such as Terrence Roberts, one of the Little Rock 9, or Nina Davuluri, the first Miss America of Indian and South Asian descent — Rivera saw York Central getting a reputation as a racist school district.\n\n“Sometimes I look at this situation and think, am I in the 'Twilight Zone' in Central York School District?” she said.\n\nAccording to the most recent census, York County is as diverse as it has ever been, with increases in the Black and Hispanic communities.\n\nRivera said that despite the change in racial makeup in the area, she feels her position is in danger under the current school board.\n\n“I must speak my truth that what is going on at Central is wrong,” Rivera said. “This is not the Central I know.”\n\n“The Exact Opposite”\n\nChristina Ellis, a high school senior and vice president of PARU, was at home studying calculus when she got a text from Edha Gupta, a senior and PARU president. The text was the list of books that were banned.\n\n“My heart dropped,” Ellis said. “I felt culturally attacked because I was like, 'Why do we need to ban those things, something that is a real part of American history.'”\n\nThe students at PARU had a lot of thinking to do. The state of their school, their history with the board, and what the next steps would be.\n\nGupta said she felt betrayed by the board. The students at PARU had met with the board six months earlier to discuss racial issues and try to address some of the tensions they had detected at the school.\n\nPARU thought it had a good reception from the board, which only made the ban list feel like more of a betrayal.\n\n“That's why this year I was in disbelief when they came out with it because instead, they were doing the opposite of what we had talked about,” Gupta said. “(The board blocked) material that would help students learn more about diversity and race in a positive, healthy way, not in a detrimental or tension-bringing way.”\n\nPARU members decided to speak up and be as visible as possible while still respecting their classmates. They made signs and campaigned on social media to get students to stand with them at the school entrance.\n\nFrom 7:15 to 7:30 a.m. from this past Tuesday until the board meeting on Monday, PARU and any Central High students who want to join will be hosting a “walk-in” — a peaceful protest where the students can express their disappointment with the decision.\n\nThe students are planning to attend the meeting on Monday. They hope their protest will result in reversal of the ban.\n\n“I'm not doing this for me,” Gupta said. “I'm graduating in a few months. I'm doing this for the elementary school kids, the middle school kids who are going to grow up in this district not getting the full history. I hope that us doing this will inspire (other) young people.”\n\nMore:Dallastown Area school board meeting canceled after protesters refuse to wear masks\n\nSilver lining\n\nWhile the board will meet on Sept. 13, and some hope for an explanation of what happened and a potential reversal of the ban, Rivera believes the controversy has heightened public awareness of the issues facing the school district.\n\nRivera said nobody knew who was involved in the educational decision making. She’s hoping this situation makes people more aware.\n\n“If you would be asked what's the name of one school board member, you wouldn't even know,” Rivera said. “Now they're invested.”\n\nStaff members say that students standing up to administration is also a beacon to their peers and teachers that they have a voice at the school.\n\n“They’re sending a very strong message to the school board,” Lebo said. “They want a diverse list of resources to draw on that so they can have nuanced, in-depth conversations.”\n\nThe board statement in full\n\nCentral York School Board Statement on Diversity Committee Summer Meeting Resource List:\n\n\"With respect to the “Diversity Committee Summer Meeting Resource List” (List) from summer 2020, a significant portion of our District's parents raised concerns with certain of the materials included on the List. These concerns were based on the content of the resources, not the author or topic. On November 9, 2020 the then-Board unanimously approved a decision to freeze the use of these resources pending restoration of the Board curriculum-oversight mechanism. One solution to this oversight was creation of a Curriculum Committee. Additionally, upon the incumbent Superintendent’s retirement announcement, the Board felt the new Superintendent should also be part of this important discussion. We will soon have both a newly formed Curriculum Committee and a new Superintendent to engage in this discussion.\n\n\"The Board embraces diversity in its many forms, including diversity of thought. We have always welcomed myriad quality diversity materials embracing differences and fostering equality, tolerance, inclusiveness, communication and kindness. However, many District parents have expressed concern that certain resources on this particular list foster the opposite by promoting unequal treatment of individuals on immutable characteristics. They believe that rather than uniting on diversity, certain resources polarize and divide on diversity and are based on disputed theories and facts.

The Covenant School shooter, armed with two assault-like rifles and a handgun, killed the head of school, a teacher, a custodian and three 9-year-old students. As the bill awaits action in the House, students, parents and others are staging vocal protests against allowing teachers to carry guns at school.\n\nBut Tennessee is far from alone in a nation plagued with deadly school shootings. Here is a closer look at laws in other states governing guns in schools.\n\nWhich states allow teachers to carry firearms on school grounds?\n\nMore than half of all states have some type of law allowing teachers and other school employees to carry concealed guns on campus, according to data compiled by the Giffords Law Center.\n\nIowa is the most recent state to push for more guns, with lawmakers this week sending a bill to the governor that would allow teachers and other school employees to obtain permits to carry guns on school grounds.\n\nJust 16 states and the District of Columbia have laws specifically prohibiting teachers from carrying guns - Alabama, California, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\nMost states, including Tennessee, allow non-law enforcement school security to carry guns on campus, and of the states that allow teachers and other school employees to carry guns, many require permission from the school district.\n\nSpotlight on teacher gun laws\n\nCalifornia, a state with some of the nation’s strictest gun laws, allows non-law enforcement to carry guns without needing permission from the school district, but it prohibits teachers and other school employees from carrying them.\n\nTexas, Florida, Arizona, Mississippi and South Dakota allow teachers and other employees to carry if they are designated school guardians or part of a program.\n\nTennessee and Arkansas prohibit teachers in public schools from carrying guns but allow exemptions for private schools.\n\nSix states - Delaware, Nebraska, North Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Maine - prohibit guns for non-law enforcement school security, teachers and other staff.\n\nWhat do schools allow for the general public?\n\nMost states prohibit members of the general public from carrying guns on campus, but a handful - Kansas Michigan Mississippi New Hampshire Oregon Utah and Wyoming - allow the guns if the individual has a concealed carry permit.\n\nJust over half of all states allow people with concealed carry permits to keep loaded, unlocked guns in their cars on campus.\n\nHow would Tennessee's law arming teachers work?\n\nTennessee’s law would allow facilities or staff to carry concealed guns on their respective campuses. The state already allows non-law enforcement school security to carry.\n\nThe individual would have to get permission from the district and a law enforcement agency. The district would not be required to notify parents if a gun is in their child’s classroom.\n\nA teacher would have to follow these additional requirements:\n\nHave a valid handgun carry permit\n\nUndergo a background check\n\nComplete 40 hours of additional training\n\nPass a psychological evaluation\n\nHow would Iowa's bill arming teachers work?\n\nLawmakers in Iowa introduced legislation after a deadly shooting at Perry High School in January, when a high school student shot and killed sixth-grader Ahmir Jolliff and Principal Dan Marburger and wounded half a dozen others before fatally shooting himself.\n\nThe legislation sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds this week would allow teachers and other school employees to obtain permits to carry guns on school grounds and grant them qualified immunity for using reasonable force.\n\n\"Time and math do not lie,\" said Rep. Phil Thompson, R-Boone, the bill's manager on the Iowa House floor said. \"The first 30 seconds in these scenarios are extremely critical. This bill does set a high standard for districts and staff that want to participate in this and go the extra mile to protect our kids.\"\n\nThose who want to carry firearms at school under the bill would have to go through a permit process that includes one-time, in-person legal training covering qualified immunity, emergency medical training and communication training, as well as quarterly firearm training and annual \"live scenario\" training.\n\nOpponents say arming teachers will lead to accidental shootings\n\nGun violence prevention groups have held protests and spoken out against the legislation, saying it will make students and school employees less safe by increasing the likelihood of accidents involving guns in schools.\n\n\"It does nothing to protect children who might be the victim of crossfires, of accidents, of a gun not being properly stored or a curious student finding a gun and accidentally injuring other children,\" said Iowa, Rep.

Just take a look around the country at what taxpayers are being asked to shell out to keep books off the shelves.\n\nLibrary advocates say that the process of banning books across the nation - including recent book-ban battles in Texas, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Florida alone - run up hefty costs, often in the tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\n\"Your taxpayer dollars pay the salary of the employees who are spending some of their time, or much of their time, reading books that have been challenged by just a handful of activists in your district,\" according to EveryLibrary, a national organization which supports libraries across the country. \"And every hour they spend reading a book to review, is an hour of other work they are not doing for you.\"\n\nThe EveryLibrary group says the cost of \"the book-banning crusade\" boils down to parts and labor - the parts being the books themselves, the labor being the man-hours to review the books that have been challenged.\n\nIn Northampton County, Pennsylvania, Nazareth Area School District officials estimate it could cost the district $109,931.74 to pay staffers to review 23 books challenged by Northampton County Moms for Liberty, a local chapter of the Florida-based Moms for Liberty.\n\nJennifer Simon, the president of the local Moms for Liberty Chapter wants at least four books – Push by Sapphire, Boy Toy by Barry Lyga, Sold by Patricia McCormick and Crank by Ellen Hopkins – removed. The group argues that the books are not age-appropriate for school kids in the district. The district has already spent about $8,000 to review those books so far, said Richard Kaskey, the district's superintendent.\n\nNationwide, K-12 school districts are spending potentially tens of thousands in taxpayer dollars to compensate staffers to read and review challenged books, remove some of those books from classrooms and library shelves and store them. The spending is concentrated in states where schools are responding to new state legislation restricting or limiting books around sexuality and racial and social justice – including Florida, Texas and Utah. And it is supercharging taxpayers to confront their school boards.\n\n\"I'm a strong supporter of public education and I actually don't mind paying taxes to support our public schools. However, I am appalled that my taxes are being wasted to combat a campaign to limit what students can read,\" said Evan Davis, a Nazareth resident at a recent district school board meeting.\n\n\"I pay taxes in order to educate our youth – not to deny them educational freedom,\" said Davis, who called the limits on books students can read \"not only detrimental,\" but \"dangerous.\"\n\nPEN America's Freedom to Read Projector Director Kasey Meehan said the bans are not only costly for kids in terms of what information they could be losing, but they are also financially costly for taxpaying school families and their neighbors.\n\n\"It's a significant amount of money,\" she said. \"There are certainly time and personnel costs, and then there are the emotional costs for students, educators, librarians, school board members and parents.\"\n\nIn what other cases have schools dipped into their pocketbooks to review book complaints?\n\nThe Spring Branch Independent School District in Harris County, Texas spent $30,119 to pay 16 staffers to review the book \"The Black Friend, On Being a Better White Person\" by Frederick Joseph, ABC 13 Houston reported in March. Other districts in Texas have estimated it could cost thousands to screen for books that contain material around sexual identity or racial justice, according to BookRiot in 2021.\n\nSchool districts across the state of Florida have spent \"between $34,000 to $135,000 annually\" in the last several years to comply with state laws requiring schools to restrict books that contain sexual content, according to POLITICO. One of the laws requires schools to find or hire an employee with a media specialist certificate to check inventories and vet books in school libraries to ensure they meet the requirements of the law. Some Florida schools in the last few years have limited access to \"The Hill We Climb\" by Amanda Gorman and \"Gender Queer: A Memoir\" by Maia Kobabe, POLITICO reported.\n\nThe Utah Legislature's Interim Education Committee studied one large state school district to analyze the impact of HB 374, known as the Sensitive Materials in Schools Bill. The unnamed large district spent about $20,000 for staffers to spend 500 hours to review 202 challenges of 42 uniquely-titled books from three staff members, one parent and three parent groups, said Patty Norman, the deputy superintendent of student achievement in October 2022. The district ultimately ended up barring 10 of the 42 book titles from schools, according to the case study presented by Norman.\n\nFlorida set to release listBanned books months after DeSantis called the bans a hoax\n\nWhat does it take to ban a book?\n\nGenerally, once a book challenge hits a district, school board officials decide whether they will spend funds to pay a staffer, or multiple staffers, to read the book and decide whether the book should be legitimately banned. The could be additional costs for staff to remove the material from district libraries and classrooms and store the books.\n\nThe typical process by which books are challenged varies by district.\n\nAt the Nazareth Area School District, for example, a parent, group or community member can submit a formal request via a district form to have school officials review a book and reconsider whether it is appropriate for students.\n\nThen, the district's director of curriculum will coordinate a team of people, consisting of a school principal, administrators, teachers, counselors and/or library media specialists to \"review the material that is the source of the complaint,\" according to the district's policy. \"This process might involve reviewing the material, reading the material in whole, etc. This process timeline will vary depending on the complexity of the review of the material,\" district records show. \"For example, the reading of a library book will need additional time provided for the reading of the entirety of the book.\"\n\nDisagreements are solved by the district's school board. The school board hasn't decided whether to review the books challenged by Moms for Liberty, but any funds used to do that will come from its \"general operation budget,\" said Stuart Whiteleather, a business administrator for the Nazareth Area School District.\n\n\"This expense was not budgeted so funding would come our budget reserve line item that would cover any non budgeted expenses,\" he said.\n\nThe district hasn't taken into account costs to store the books if they are removed from libraries and classrooms, said Isabel Resende, the assistant superintendent of the district.\n\nHow common are book bans in America?\n\nRequests for book restrictions in American schools are on the rise in part due to increased state legislation shielding certain books in classrooms, according to PEN America's Index of School Book Bans.\n\nThe nonprofit organization is tracking individual books banned across the country.\n\nDuring the first half of the 2022-23 school year, PEN America found 1,477 instances of books being banned, affecting 874 unique titles, an increase of 28 percent compared to the prior six months, according to a report titled \"The State of Book Bans in the USA\" on the organization's website.\n\nBanned Books Week:A visual dive into an alarming increase in attempts to restrict books\n\nIn the same report, the organization attributed part of the increase during the 2022-23 school year to an uptick in state legislation restricting the content of books in schools.\n\n\"School districts in many states are reacting to new laws that dictate the types of books that can even be in schools, or what kinds of policies they have to follow to add new books and review their collections,\" according to a report from the organization.\n\nParent activists who have long been at the forefront of book bans in schools remain committed to their cause.\n\nNorthampton County Moms for Liberty in Pennsylvania is a chapter of the Florida-based conservative organization Moms for Liberty, which has challenged a slew of books with content around race relations, social justice and LGBTQ+ issues. The organization is listed as an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nSupporters of Moms for Liberty and other parent-led activist groups across the country are confronting local school boards with complaints about several books, including other books on a longer list include The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison and The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood. Parents who are afraid of their kids learning about content surrounding race and LGBTQ+ issues at schools have backed them.\n\nWhat's behind the national surge?In book bans – a low-tech website tied to Moms for Liberty\n\nWhat other costs are schools paying to ban books?\n\nOver the last two years, Meehan said she and her colleagues at PEN America have heard about media specialists librarians being called in over summer or on weekends to review book collections and librarians \"jumping across multiple libraries within a district pulling from collections – reviewing books and helping make decisions when books are being challenged.\"\n\n\"It's such an emotional burden to go through these book ban considerations and fights,\" said Meehan.\n\nPeter Bromberg, an associate director of EveryLibrary, said he agrees that there is emotional debt for staffers tasked with reviewing books in in addition to community-wide financial costs.\n\n\"I’ve had people call me crying at 10:30 at night – there was a school librarian didn’t want her family to see her having a breakdown,\" he said. \"The cost of the destruction of the truth is as emotional as the dollar.\"\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

But on Wednesday morning, zoo visitors learned they have something big (and furry) to look forward to again.\n\nThe zoo said Wednesday that it's set to receive male panda Bao Li and female panda Qing Bao, both 2 years old, from China sometime in 2024.\n\nThe news comes after Mei Xiang and Tian Tian − who had been in the U.S. for 23 years − and Xiao Qi Ji, who was born in August 2020, returned to China in November following a bittersweet farewell in Washington.\n\nZoo staff put up new banners Wednesday letting visitors know, \"the pandas are coming.\"\n\nFlanked by stalks of bamboo on the zoo’s Asia Trail, local graduate student Summer Zhou said the environment felt ready for the panda’s return.\n\n“I just feel like their spirit is still here,” she said. “They never left my heart.”\n\nFamilies rolled strollers beneath the decorations as they walked through the zoo's entrance. Teresa Willibey, 30, was among them with her 4-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter, visiting from Buffalo, New York.\n\n“It’s exciting for my kids to get to see them so they can learn more about other animals,” said the former Washington resident.\n\nThe two new giant pandas will replace the trio that came before them beginning sometime before the end of 2024, said Lonnie Bunch, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in a social media video announcing the news.\n\n\"I'm thrilled to announce that within this year we'll once again welcome a new pair of giant pandas,\" Bunch said.\n\nOne of the new pandas is closely related to the pair that just left the zoo, officials said Wednesday.\n\nPANDA MASCOT:The National Zoo pandas are gone. Among those hardest hit is 'Pantwon.'\n\nWho are Bao Li and Qing Bao, the new pandas?\n\nBao Li is the grandson of Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, the pandas who returned to China in November. Bao Li's mother is Bao Bao, the pair's second offspring, born in 2013 at the National Zoo.\n\nBao Li means \"treasure\" and \"energetic\" in Mandarin Chinese, according to the zoo.\n\nQing Bao means \"green\" and \"treasure,\" the zoo said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nThe zoo also said a new 10-year research and breeding agreement has been signed with China.\n\nHow long have pandas been at the National Zoo?\n\nThe first panda came to the U.S. from China in 1972, and the fluffy animals have been a staple of Washington's Smithsonian National Zoo ever since.\n\nThe zoo's previous pandas Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and Xiao Qi Ji returned to China last year after attempts to renew the Smithsonian's 3-year agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association failed.\n\nWednesday's announcement follows increased engagement between Washington and Beijing which has put ties on a steadier footing since relations hit historic lows last year.\n\nChina's ambassador to the United States Xie Feng said the new panda cooperation agreement was “a very good sign” for U.S.-China relations.\n\n\"To deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples, today I am very glad to share with you some good news,\" he said during remarks at the zoo.\n\nWashington is not the only city that will soon be home to the pandas.\n\nZoos in California announced earlier this year they would also continue to benefit from the more than 50 years of diplomacy surrounding the giant pandas.\n\nIn February, the San Diego Zoo announced it will be getting a new pair of pandas, Xin Bao and Yun Chuan. In April, the San Francisco Zoo said it will host pandas again for the first time since 1985. Timelines for both zoos have not yet been announced.\n\nThe latest example of 'panda diplomacy'\n\nIn 1972, China gifted the first panda to the U.S. after President Richard Nixon formalized normal relations with China. Since then China has loaned pandas to other foreign zoos in hopes that it will build ties with those countries.\n\nThe practice has been dubbed \"panda diplomacy.\"\n\nBarbara Bodine, director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University and a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen with more than 30 years’ experience in U.S. foreign service, said the the bears are “probably the most successful soft diplomacy animals any nation has ever come up with.\"\n\nBodine doesn't think the panda moves reveal too much about the current relationship between the U.S. and China, which is certainly strained. But the attention does show how effective the bears are at generating a “warm, fuzzy feeling.\"\n\nBodine hopes the pandas are greeted with this optimistic spirit: “The children of America thank you, and the pandas are a wonderful representation of the Chinese people and their culture.”\n\nNews of pandas' arrival sparks excitement in Washington\n\nChildren, filled with excitement, shouted the names of their favorite animals as they ventured through the zoo's entrance on Wednesday morning.\n\n“Can I see the panda?” one young visitor asked her parents.\n\nEven though Willibey's family had already left the Washington area, they were still sad to see the black and white bears go last year.\n\n“It worked out that we weren't affected too much, but we were bummed that it was happening in general,” she said.\n\nAlthough her kids shouted in excitement about the pandas, Willibey expressed a note of concern. “I feel kind of mixed,” she said. “It's exciting that it's coming back… but at the same time, maybe it should be growing up where it's supposed to come from.”\n\nTo Eric Williams, a longtime Washington resident, and his 7-year-old daughter, the loss of the pandas deprived the zoo of one of its main attractions.\n\n“It kind of took away from a big part of coming here,” Williams, 50, said as he shepherded his daughter and her first grade classmates past the otter exhibit. “My kids have always enjoyed seeing them.”\n\nWilliams isn’t a frequent zoo visitor, but he returned on Wednesday morning to accompany the class on a school field trip.\n\nGRAPHICSTrace more than 50 years of panda diplomacy between the US, China\n\nThe kids also had the pandas on their minds. “Actually, on the ride here, they were asking about them,” Williams said. “Whether they were going to get the opportunity to see the pandas.”\n\nWilliams’ message about the return of the pandas – the more, the merrier.\n\n“Probably need a little more,” he said. “I’d say minimum, five or six. Give everybody an opportunity to see them.”\n\nGrad student Zhou said she can hardly wait for the pandas to return – the zoo just isn’t the same to her without them.\n\n“It definitely feels like a missing component of the zoo,” said Zhou, a 25-year-old graduate student studying sustainability at American University in Washington's Tenleytown neighborhood, just north of the zoo.\n\nZhou, originally from Texas, traveled the short distance from her home with a fellow grad student on Wednesday morning to get up close with the animals.\n\nVideos she captured of the pandas last summer are more than just a memento to Zhou – they’re a life lesson.\n\n“When I watch them, I get relaxed too,” she said. “They’re like these big, fluffy animals who know how to enjoy life.”\n\nContributing: Julia Gomez, Saman Shafiq, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/25/national-zoo-giant-pandas-china-december/70681246007/", "title": "National Zoo's iconic giant pandas head to China in December", "text": "Visitors to the Smithsonian's National Zoo have less than five months to say their farewells to the iconic giant pandas who've been at the zoo for nearly 23 years.

The adult pandas were supposed to stay for a decade as part of a research and breeding agreement, but the program with China was extended several times.\n\nThe once-endangered species are now designated as \"vulnerable,\" following a population growth of nearly 17% between 2007 and 2017. The International Union for Conservation of Nature upgraded giant Pandas on the global list of species at risk of extinction, according the World Wildlife Fund. Only 1,864 wild pandas remain in the wild, mostly in China's Sichuan Province.\n\nHistory of giant pandas in US zoos\n\nOver 50 years ago, The National Zoo received its first pandas from China, Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, as an effort to save the species by breeding them. The Zoo's giant panda team works closely with colleagues in China to advance conservation efforts around the world, according to the zoo's conservation biology institute.\n\nMei Xiang has given birth to seven cubs while at the zoo. Four of her cubs are living, and three died before adulthood. As part of the agreement with China, cubs must be returned by age 4.\n\nWhen Mei Xiang gave birth to Xiao Qi Ji in August of 2020, she became the oldest giant panda to have a cub in North America.\n\nOnce the three giant pandas return to their homeland from Washington, D.C., only four giant pandas will be left in the U.S.: Lun Lun and Yang Yang, and their offspring Ya Lun and Xi Lun, all of which live at Zoo Atlanta.\n\nThe younger cubs at Zoo Atlanta are expected to travel to China in 2024, the zoo says. The adult pandas are expected to return as well, as there has been no discussion about extending the loan agreement instated in the mid-1990's, according to the zoo.\n\nThe Memphis Zoo returned their panda, Ya Ya, in April after a 20-year loan agreement with China ended, according to The Associated Press.

Staff met the giant pandas, as well as the people caring for them at the Wolong and Bifengxia Panda Bases in China.\n\n“Our conservation partners in China shared photographs and personality traits of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, but meeting them in person was so special,\" Dr. Megan Owen, vice president of conservation science at San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, said in a news release. \"It’s inspiring as people from around the world come together to conserve, protect, and care for these special bears, and we can’t wait to welcome them to San Diego.\"\n\nMeet Xin Bao\n\nOne of the zoo’s new arrivals is 3-year-old Xin Bao, a female who will soon turn 4 years old. Her name means “new treasure of prosperity and abundance,” the zoo said.\n\n“Giant pandas often symbolize wildlife conservation, peace, and friendship, but her name also reminds us that in Chinese culture, pandas also symbolize blessings and success,” the zoo said. “Her name will no doubt remind us that it’s an honor to play a part in her success and to help giant pandas thrive, both here and in China.’\n\nThe zoo said she is very active, alert, witty and a superb climber. She’s playful and will sometimes roughhouse with other pandas.\n\nAccording to the zoo, guests may be able to spot Xin Bao pretty easily due to her large, round face and big ears that give her a unique look.\n\nAnd don't forget Yun Chuan\n\nIn addition to Xin Bao, the zoo is welcoming Yun Chuan, who is almost 5 years old.\n\nThe first part of his name, “Yun,” means cloud in Chinese. The second part of his name, \"Chuan,\" means big river and alludes to the place where he’s from, Sichuan.\n\nAltogether, his name means “big river of cloud,” a reminder of the “flowing clouds that often shroud the forests where giant pandas live in the mountains of southwestern China,” the zoo said.\n\nYun Chuan has familial ties to the San Diego Zoo. His maternal grandmother, Bai Yun, as well as his grandfather, Gao Gao, both stayed at the San Diego Zoo in the early 2000s. His mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the zoo in 2007.\n\n“Yun Chuan’s lineage has deep connections to the San Diego Zoo and we’re excited by the prospect of caring for them,\" said Owen, from the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.\n\nWildlife care specialists from the Wolong Shenshuping Panda Base who have worked with him said Yun Chuan is kind, clever and sensitive. He is mild-mannered with other pandas and always lets them go first.\n\n“When he sees a meal has arrived but has not yet spotted wildlife care specialists, he will hum gently to get their attention,” the zoo said.\n\nHe’s also a bit of a sleepyhead and takes a while to get up, the zoo said. He loves afternoon naps and sits for a bit to gather himself once he wakes up.\n\nHis nickname is “Chuan Chuan” and guests may be able to spot the giant panda by his long, partially pointed nose tip.\n\nA resilient species\n\nFor more than 20 years, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considered the giant panda endangered. In September 2016, the agency updated their status to vulnerable thanks to multiple conservation efforts.\n\n“While we do not believe the giant panda is completely safe, our IUCN Red List evaluation highlights how far we have come in panda conservation,” said Ron Swaisgood, director of applied animal ecology at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research, at the time.\n\n“This iconic species, which is the poster child of endangered species globally, no longer qualifies as endangered,” Swaisgood said. “All the trends support this conclusion: Habitat is increasing and the population is growing.”\n\nThe San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance worked with Chinese conservation institutions for nearly 30 years in an attempt to protect and recover giant pandas and bamboo forests.\n\nSome projects the institutions have worked on include developing a giant panda milk formula and neonatal conservation techniques that helped increased survival rates for nursery-reared cubs from 5% to 95%, the alliance said in a news release.\n\n\"The conservation collaboration between San Diego Zoo Wildlife Association and China Wildlife Conservation Association aims to improve giant panda population health and resilience in some of the smallest and most isolated populations vulnerable to extinction and loss of genetic diversity,\" the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance said in a news release.\n\nRegarding the zoo’s newest additions, the team said it is thrilled to get to know Yun Chuan and Xin Bao more.\n\n“As our team members continue to spend time with Yun Chuan and Xin Bao in China, we look forward to sharing more of our experiences with you, our allies in conservation,” the zoo said.\n\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

The San Diego Zoo returned its pandas to China in 2019.\n\nAll of the other zoos currently with pandas have sent pandas back to China in the past, which is standard for the zoo.\n\nRepresentatives for the Memphis Zoo were not available for comment and it is unknown whether a new agreement was in the works for pandas after Ya Ya and Le Le are sent back to China Wednesday morning. But the Zoo said in a social media statement that they hope to continue the relationship.\n\n\"It has been a wonderful 20 years fostering this relationship with Ya Ya, Le Le and the Chinese Association of Zoological Gardens and we look forward to continuing this partnership in the future,\" the zoo said.\n\nBaby animals:New aardvark born at Memphis Zoo given a name from a long time ago, in a galaxy far away\n\nThe two pandas are in their early 20s, with Ya Ya, the female panda, the younger of the duo and Le Le, the male, the older. Although the life span for pandas in the wild is in flux, the Smithsonian said it could range from 15-20 years. That number could reach upwards of 30 years in human care.\n\nThe pandas first arrived in Memphis in 2003, a project recently promoted president Matt Thompson worked on at the time. The first contract ended in 2013, with a second 10-year contract being signed keeping the pandas in the Bluff City until 2023.\n\nIn recent years, the Memphis Zoo drew the ire of activists who believed the pandas were being mistreated and neglected. The allegations were furthered when pop star Billie Eilish voiced disdain for perceived mistreatment of the pandas.\n\n\"CAZG is confident that the giant pandas at the Memphis Zoo are receiving the highest quality of care,\" the organization said in a written statement at the time.\n\nA series of detailed statements from the Memphis Zoo explained that both Ya Ya and Le Le were in great health, especially for their age.\n\nOn Facebook, Memphians were disappointed with the news that Ya Ya and Le Le were leaving the zoo.\n\n\"Noooooooo pandas are my favorite animal!

Pandas have been in the country since 1972, after former President Richard Nixon normalized relations with China, a gift that some dubbed \"panda diplomacy.\" But China's gradual pulling of pandas from Western nations is considered the result as a sign of declining relations with the U.S. and other countries, the Associated Press has reported.

The money will go to the Giant Panda Conservation Fund, where 70% will be directed toward \"protecting giant pandas in their natural habitat\" Twenty percent will be dedicated to breeding research and the rest will go to administrative costs.\n\nAfter a going away ceremony at Chengdu, the giant pandas boarded a Lufthansa cargo flight on Friday and arrived at their new home on Saturday. Now in Berlin, the duo will be under quarantine before going on display in July.\n\nThe animals, which are born the size of a stick of butter, can grow to more than four feet tall and up to 330 pounds, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which features a giant panda as its logo.

Rick Snyder, who raised the idea of pursuing the pandas during an interview on CBS 62's \"Michigan Matters\" in December 2013, has decided to throw in the towel.\n\nIt's simply too dang expensive.\n\nSnyder had tapped a team of leaders from across Michigan — led by Dennis Muchmore, his chief of staff — to explore the idea. They have been going over nuances of bringing two giant pandas — the rock stars of the animal kingdom — to Detroit.\n\nThere was even discussion about bringing them to Belle Isle, which became a state park last year as part of the city's bankruptcy.\n\n\"We would love to have had them in Detroit, but it was just too much money,\" Muchmore told me.\n\nThe cost would have topped $50 million to $60 million over the 10 years the two pandas are typically lent by the Chinese government. Muchmore said the bulk of that money would have gone towards building an exhibit at Belle Isle.\n\nMuchmore added that business and political leaders had been exploring the prospect internally before reaching out to the Chinese government which they had not done.\n\n\"We had foundations and companies willing to help, but we just decided it wasn't worth it,\" Muchmore said. He added that attendance at zoos with them tended to dwindle after the first two years.\n\n\"Once you've seen the pandas, you don't need to go again,\" he said. They aren't as playful as the polar bears, for example.\n\n\"They mostly eat and sleep,\" he said.\n\nSnyder, who is launching an economic tour across the country to talk up Michigan's revival, has made China a focal point of his global efforts, traveling there four times since taking office.\n\nHe also reopened the dormant sister relationship the state established with Sichuan Province, which is one of two areas in China where the giant pandas still live.\n\nThe giant panda is on the endangered list with just 1,600 alive in the wild and another 300 in zoos and breeding grounds. Zoos in Washington, D.C., San Diego, Atlanta and Memphis have giant pandas.\n\nEveryone knew it would take a herculean campaign of political might and millions of dollars to work with the Chinese government in getting a deal done for the pandas.\n\nChina has been lending pandas to other nations since 1984.\n\nAmerica saw its first pandas in 1972 after President Richard Nixon opened relations with China. The Chinese government sent Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing to Nixon. First lady Pat Nixon sent them to the National Zoo.\n\nSnyder credited former Michigan School Superintendent Tom Watkins, who is now president and CEO of Detroit Wayne Mental Health Authority, for suggesting the idea of pandas for Michigan.\n\nRon Kagan, CEO of the Detroit Zoological Society, is one person who was never a fan of the idea.\n\nKagan, who runs the Belle Isle and Detroit Zoos, has been part of the advisory group meeting with Muchmore.\n\nKagan said there were more effective ways to educate the public about conservation of the planet and animals than going the route of trying to secure giant pandas.\n\nIt's all moot — for now — as there will be no giant pandas in Detroit's immediate future.\n\nLooks as if red pandas at the Detroit Zoo are about as close as we will get .\n\nCarol Cain can be reached at 313-222-6732 or clcain@cbs.com.

Do not eat them. If you froze a product without the original packaging and can’t tell if it is part of the recall, throw it away. You can get a refund from the store where you bought the products.\n\nClean and sanitize any surfaces the recalled products may have touched, as listeria can survive in refrigerators and spread to other foods and surfaces. Follow the FDA's safe handling and cleaning advice to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.\n\nWhat is listeria infection?\n\nYou can get a serious infection by eating food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, a bacteria. Most people who get listeriosis do not become seriously ill, but a serious infection can develop in those most susceptible including pregnant women and their newborns, adults ages 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems, according to the Centers for Diseased Control and Infection.\n\nEach year, about 1,600 people get sick and 260 die from listeriosis, the CDC says.\n\nSymptoms may start the same day you eat contaminated food, but more typically begin within two weeks after consumption and may start as late as 10 weeks later, the FDA says.\n\nSymptoms may include fever, muscle aches, nausea, fatigue, vomiting and diarrhea for those with a mild illness. Those who develop more serious cases may have headaches, a stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions.

All Kraft Heinz's products, including Lunchables, \"tested well below the acceptable limits,\" according to the company.\n\n\"The metals they focus on are naturally occurring, and thus low levels may be present in any food product,\" Kraft Heinz said. \"We do not add these elements to our products.\"\n\n'Lunchables adhere to all USDA standards', Kraft Heinz says\n\nKraft Heinz maintains that the \"National School Lunch Program-approved Lunchables adhere to all USDA standards,\" according to the statement.\n\n\"We increased the amount of meat in the products to increase protein levels and help fuel kids throughout the day,\" the food company said. \"With more meat comes naturally elevated levels of sodium to ensure safe preservation of the product. It’s worth reiterating that Consumer Reports did not test our school products.\"\n\nKraft Heinz said it is proud of the product.\n\n\"By offering Lunchables in schools, we’re able to help meet schools’ needs by giving them affordable, convenient solutions that provide students with quality nutrition at lunchtime,\" the company said. \"We’ve received feedback that products like Lunchables are more trusted by school administrators due to our strict food safety and quality guarantee.

Consumer Reports is suggesting to the USDA that the snack kits be removed from the National School Lunch Program.\n\nKraft Heinz would have to voluntarily initiate a recall of Lunchables, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn some situations, the FDA can request or mandate a recall, but the federal agency has not done so for Lunchables. If it did, any violation could be corrected and Lunchables would return to the marketplace, according to the FDA's website.\n\nLunchables also do not appear on the FDA's enforcement reports for April.\n\nAre Lunchables healthy?\n\nMaya Feller, a registered dietitian and nutritionist who worked with New York City Public Schools, said she's concerned about the \"regular inclusion of Lunchables and Lunchable-type kits\" because they're not \"nutrient-dense options\" for students, according to an interview with ABC News.\n\n\"The high sodium content is definitely of concern, especially from a young age,\" Feller said. \"The health risks associated with high and chronic consumption of added salts are well documented.\"\n\nFrom Feller's clinical experience, she would like to see more \"nutrient-dense plant-forward options\" in schools, especially meals with less added sugars, saturated fats and added salts, ABC News reported.\n\nThough many may be skeptical of picking up a Lunchable, the FDA says, it is \"not possible to completely prevent lead from entering the food supply.\"\n\nAlthough it's impossible to prevent lead in food, it is food manufacturers' legal responsibility to \"significantly minimize or prevent chemical hazards when needed,\" according to the FDA.\n\nWhen did Lunchables come out?\n\nLunchables were introduced in 1988 as simple packages of meat, cheese and crackers, according to a Washington Post article in 1999.\n\nOver time, other variations of Lunchables have been released, including Pizza Swirls and Pizza Dunks, hot dogs, hamburgers, tacos and nachos, The Post reported.\n\nWho owns Lunchables?

Americans are eating at home more than they used to, especially since offices and some schools remain closed.\n\nWeather-related events, from snowstorms in the Northeast to wildfires in Colorado, also have impacted product availability and caused some shoppers to stock up more than usual, exacerbating supply problems caused by the pandemic.\n\nU.S. groceries typically have 5% to 10% of their items out of stock at any given time; right now, that unavailability rate is hovering around 15%, according to Consumer Brands Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman.\n\n►New Oreo flavor:Oreo releasing a limited-edition Chocolate Confetti Cake Cookie for its 110th birthday\n\n►Lettuce recall 2022:Dole recalls salad sold at Walmart, Kroger, Aldi, H-E-B for listeria risk\n\nPatrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse University’s Whitman School of Management, recently told USA TODAY that cream cheese and international foods were among the food products in short supply.\n\n“As you walk through a lot of stores you won’t see the quantity and quality of items you are accustomed to seeing,” Penfield said, adding some shortages are regional due to labor and truck shortages.\n\nIn a recent study by business consultancy KPMG, 71% of grocery consumers said they were somewhat or very concerned about shortages or stockouts with 35% switching brands when their favorite items are out of stock.\n\nCostco limits purchases of some items\n\nSome retailers have been limiting purchases of select items, similar to policies implemented at the start of the pandemic.

Davey said some of the nation’s 10 largest retailers had more than 20% of baby formula out of stock the week ended Jan. 2.\n\nSome parents have been taking to social media to ask formula makers where they can buy products.\n\n“We are experiencing obstacles in the production and shipping of some of our products as the pandemic continues to cause issues with the supply chain.

But the pandemic is only part of the problem.\n\nThe demand for can products accumulated for years according to a Quartz article. Canned drinks are cheaper to make and transport, and easier to market and design, initiating the highest prices for aluminum the market has seen in the past 10 years, senior analyst Salvator Tiano told Quartz.\n\nCat food, dog food shortages\n\nShipping woes and aluminum shortages have led to a scarcity problem for the pet food industry as stores throughout the country are unable to stock all their traditional brands and products.\n\nConsumers are also feeling the impact. Many USA TODAY readers said canned or wet cat food was one of the top items they have been struggling to find.\n\nThese shortages are impacting the movement of ingredients and finished products, the Pet Food Institute told USA TODAY. Along with labor and transportation shortages, pet owners are spending more time with their pets which can lead to increased feeding and more treating. The high demand has resulted in larger purchases.\n\nMarcie Rivera, a spokesperson for Wegmans told the MetroWest Daily News in Framingham, Massachusetts, part of the USA TODAY Network, that suppliers around the world \"are being faced with an array of challenges affecting their businesses, causing a domino effect on retailers and customers.\"\n\nChicken tender shortage\n\nChicken tenders may be the next casualty of supply-chain-generated shortages, according to a recent NBC News story.

The flight from New York City to Rome with a stop in Paris broke apart and fell into the ocean below. The 230 people onboard Trans World Airlines Flight 800 perished.\n\nAs quickly as the wreckage plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, questions arose. Conspiracy theories took shape.\n\nTwenty-five years later, the questions and conspiracies live on.\n\nFollowing a four-year, $40 million investigation – the longest in the history of the National Transportation Safety Board – board officials concluded an electrical failure ignited fuel vapors in a nearly empty tank in the belly of the jet.\n\nTheories that Flight 800 may have been destroyed by a bomb, missile or meteor have nonetheless lingered.\n\nTWA Flight 800:Remnants to be scrapped, 25 years after explosion killed 230 passengers, crew\n\nAs recently as July 2014, NTSB officials had to publicly respond to requests to reconsider its findings in the investigation of the 1996 crash. Petitioners from a high-profile group called The TWA 800 Project claimed a “detonation or high-velocity explosion” caused the crash. An NTSB review determined the claim cast insufficient doubt of a flawed initial investigation.\n\nOn the day of the crash, witnesses said they saw a streak of light near the plane and one or more explosions near the aircraft. Speculation bloomed that the crash had been touched off by a proximity-triggered rocket, missile or flare.\n\nThe day after the crash, the possibility that an explosive device was fired toward the plane or placed inside before takeoff took hold. The Federal Bureau of Investigation considered potential terrorist links and began a criminal investigation.\n\n230 people perished when TWA Flight 800 exploded. 25 years later, the wounds are 'still raw.'\n\nConspiracies were born\n\nAt the time, fears of domestic terrorism were high. The nation was still processing the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the 1995 Oklahoma City explosion and the trial of Ramzi Yousef for conspiracy to destroy American-bound airliners. Ten days after the crash, a bombing rocked the Atlanta Olympics.\n\nNTSB officials quickly said the initial evidence surrounding the crash of Flight 800 did not point to an outside explosive device. Still, speculation stemming from eyewitness accounts spread through chat rooms on the burgeoning World Wide Web.\n\nShane Miller, a professor at Saint John’s University in Minnesota who researched the conspiracy theories surrounding the crash, said the Flight 800 conspirators used the web in novel ways.\n\n“It was really the first conspiracy of the internet age,” Miller said. “It was the first to be picked up and widely circulated online.”\n\nMichael Barkun, professor emeritus of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said internet forums and social media platforms have served as mass media outlets without gatekeepers. They allow unconventional ideas to quickly become mainstream.\n\n“Now anyone with an idea, no matter how bizarre, has a way of potentially getting it in front of fairly large audiences,” he said. “That has eroded what was once a firm boundary between the fringe and the mainstream.”\n\nAccidents that changed aviation:Controlling in-flight fires and more\n\nTed Goertzel, emeritus professor of sociology at Rutgers University said the internet has been a game changer for conspiracy theory consumption and evolution. The way the theories germinate nonetheless remains relatively standard.\n\nConspiracy theories regularly emerge from idle speculation in the face of more probable explanations, Goertzel said. They often gain acceptance and spread from those “who score low in measures of interpersonal trust and general agreeableness,” he added.\n\n“Someone says, 'I wonder if X happened,' \" Goertzel said. \"Someone else says, 'I heard X' and it spreads.\"\n\nAs the theory that federal officials were covering up a terrorist attack to thwart panic spread, it evolved and eventually split, Miller said. Both camps agreed on a government coverup. However, the divergent group blamed friendly fire.\n\nOne early version posted online alleged the crash resulted from an attack designed to kill former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who was, in fact, not on board. Another claimed the friendly fire was designed to kill former Arkansas state troopers once assigned to then-President Bill Clinton’s security detail.\n\nThe one that took off was an August 1996 America Online post claiming the airplane was “shot down by a U.S. Navy guided-missile ship.” The information came from Richard Russell, a 66-year-old former United Airlines pilot and safety representative for the Air Line Pilots Association.\n\nIt was later progressed by Pierre Salinger. Once John F. Kennedy’s press secretary, Salinger misrepresented the post as a document he obtained by someone in French intelligence that originated from a Secret Service agent with U.S. Navy contacts before a CNN reporter pointed out the similarities.\n\nHigh-profile supporters can help build a case for a conspiracy theory, even if their reputations were built in other areas of expertise, Miller said. In this case, Russell said that a longtime friend said he had radar footage that showed a missile traveling toward the plane just prior to the crash.\n\nRussell's message was meant for an inner circle of aviation experts but was leaked online. It ended up a topic of discussion at a Sept. 16 NTSB news briefing on Long Island after media outlets began to investigate.\n\nEasy to blame the government\n\nGovernments are common targets for conspiracy theories, according to Goertzel. They offer someone tangible to blame for unfortunate events, are often disliked and rarely give immediate, comprehensive or definitive answers. Even when government officials respond with emphatic denials, distrust is common.\n\n“A common rhetorical device of conspiracy theorists ... is to advance speculations and then criticize the authorities for not definitively refuting them,” Goertzel said. “They also rely on an inherently implausible claim of a coverup by government agencies that don't really have a very good record of covering things up.”\n\nRussell followed up his claim with a radar tape he said amounted to proof of a rocket strike. Again, Salinger progressed the claim. Ultimately, NTSB officials determined the alleged evidence was a “ghost” signal produced by another jet airplane.\n\nThe personal investment involved in accepting or progressing conspiracy theories can make them tough to dismiss, Barkun said. Corroborating evidence is nice but not necessary. Moreover, contrary evidence can easily be dismissed as another stage in the alleged conspiracy's coverup.\n\n“The conspiracy theory then becomes a closed system,” Barkun said. “There's no way to disprove it.”\n\nTWA Flight 800 investigation\n\nDuring the NTSB's four-year investigation, federal officials obtained signed certifications from U.S. military chains of command running crash area assets, training exercises and armaments capable of reaching the aircraft. They also essentially pieced 95% of the plane back together over a 30-month span.\n\nPurported evidence of a missile strike dried up. CIA analysts determined the Linda Kabot photo of a missile in flight was taken from the opposite direction and featured an airplane flying the opposite way. Another photo that appeared to show an object near the airplane showed debris on the film surface, FBI officials said.\n\nThe airplane’s oddly stained upholstery brought to light by TWA’s chief 747 pilot Robert Terrell Stacey also proved to have a less than salacious origin. Once subjected to microscopic and chemical examination, federal investigators found the red flaky residue was from contact adhesive used to stick the upholstery to its foam base, not rocket fuel.\n\nNTSB officials said any internal speculation into bomb and missile theories dried up within months. Michael Marx, a former metallurgist with the NTSB said FBI personnel unreasonably pushed the sabotage theories, even after a January 1997 ATF report pegged the cause as a mechanical failure.\n\n“By the fall of 1996, in looking at all of the physical evidence and not seeing any evidence of any bomb or missile damage, it became unreasonable to continue to push that theory,” he said during a May 1999 congressional hearing.\n\nStill, doubt lingered. Henry Hughes, a senior accident investigator with the NTSB, was among the group that in 2013 unsuccessfully petitioned the NTSB to re-investigate the crash.\n\nDuring the investigation, FBI officials demanded full control over photographs and were inconsistently inventorying, handling and analyzing aircraft components, NTSB officials said. Meanwhile, the NTSB's assessment overlooked evidence of a missile strike, such as radar data, witness statements and holes in the fuselage, according to Hughes.\n\nAsk the Captain:The unnecessary mystery of EgyptAir 804\n\nThe finger-pointing and varying interpretations of the data between officials at the federal agencies added to the uncertainty, Miller said. Combined with concurrent reporting about real government experiments and other real conspiracies, a tone had been set, he added.\n\n“They really did create a perception that nobody had a clue of what had happened,” Miller said.\n\nWhat really happened to Flight TWA 800?\n\nUltimately, NTSB officials proved that an electrical short could have sparked flammable vapor trapped in a nearly empty fuel tank and concluded that was the likely cause of Flight 800's demise.\n\nThe finding led to regulations requiring a system that pumps inert gas into fuel tanks as they empty. They also spurred the aircraft producer, Boeing, to replace the brittle old wiring on other 747s and redesign their air conditioning packs.\n\nStill, investigators seemed to have difficulty finding a definitive answer for the trails of light witnesses claimed to see near the plane, Miller said. As long as there is ambiguity surrounding the crash, conspiracy theories will remain, Barkun said.\n\nOther potential causes introduced in late 1990 persist along with the friendly-fire claim more than two decades later. One alleged the plane may have been struck by fragments of a meteor that broke up as it entered the Earth’s atmosphere. Another, from Harvard professor Elaine Scarry, claimed electromagnetic interference from a nearby U.S. Navy aircraft triggered the explosion.\n\nPeople have an innate desire to explain evil and misfortune, Barkun said. They also have an aversion to the idea that the world is random — even if that means there is some evil force creating the order, he added.\n\n“Conspiracy theories never die,” Barkun said. “There's no way really to test them.”\n\nFollow reporter David Zimmer on Twitter: @dzimmernews\n\nInvestigations:Massage schools across the US are suspected of ties to prostitution and selling fake diplomas.

But those charges were dropped in 2019 after eight years of judicial scrutiny. Now, owing in large part to pressure from families and friends of the victims, they are back in court.\n\nAir France denied the company was responsible for the crash and said the charges should again be dismissed.\n\n“Air France will continue to maintain, as it has always done, that it did not commit any criminal fault at the origin of this accident and will therefore plead for acquittal,” Claudia Chemarin, a lawyer for the airline, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nAirbus gave a similar statement to French newspaper La Tribune.\n\nIf convicted, the companies each face a fine of 225,000 euros ($219,000).\n\nThere was mystery surrounding the crash of the flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris from the outset. For one thing, most fatal aircraft accidents happen on take-off or landing: this disaster occurred mid-flight.\n\nThen there was the debris. When searchers first found parts of the plane floating in the South Atlantic 400 miles northeast of the Brazilian coast they were in a relatively confined area. A catastrophic loss of cabin pressure, or a bomb, would have scattered debris over miles of the ocean.\n\nThe Air France A330 aircraft plunged into the Atlantic Ocean in June 2009. Evaristo SA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe first recovered parts of the plane added to the mystery. Many, like the shelves from the galley, showed evidence of damage from what experts called “downward compression.” That is, the plane hit the water seemingly flat with extreme downward force, as if it had pancaked onto the water with little forward motion.\n\nThat is what accident investigators eventually concluded had happened. France’s Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses (BEA), which investigates aircraft accidents, found in 2012 that the plane was falling more than 10,000 feet per minute when it hit the ocean but had a forward ground speed of just 107 knots, about 123 miles an hour, well below the stall speed of the Airbus A330.\n\nBAE’s accident investigators concluded that the initial cause of the crash was icing on devices called pitot tubes, sensors that are crucial to determining an aircraft’s speed and attitude. It was a problem that had affected a few Airbus aircraft in the past, but one which the company had not corrected.\n\nThe investigators found that once the sensors failed, the autopilot disengaged and the cockpit crew lost reliable readouts of flight data. Because the senior pilot on board was on a rest break, the two, more junior co-pilots took over, flying the plane manually. Within seconds, one of the two at the controls pitched the nose upward, apparently to gain altitude, but inadvertently put the A330 into a high-altitude stall.\n\nWithout sufficient forward speed, the Airbus began dropping like a stone. The two co-pilots signaled the senior pilot to come assist. But from the cockpit voice recordings, it is evident that without visual references in the pitch-black night, with unreliable instruments, none of the three understood exactly why the plane was falling.\n\nFor four minutes, as the plane plummeted downward from nearly 40,000 feet to the sea, the three tried desperately to figure out what was going wrong and what to do about it.\n\nThe charges against Airbus center on its failure to correct the known problem with the pitot tubes. Air France stands accused of failing to train pilots on how to respond to the kind of situation the crew faced.\n\n“To say today that only the pilots are at fault is too easy, it is very exaggerated and therefore it is not the truth,” Philippe Linguet, who lost his brother in the crash, told CNN on Friday.\n\n“We want to confront the accused with their faults and if the court recognizes these faults, the accused Airbus and Air France should be condemned,” he added.\n\nThe trial is expected last until early December.\n\n— Pierre Bairin contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Jim Bittermann"], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/2024/01/10/issues-boeing-737-max-over-the-years-cruising-altitude/72159879007/", "title": "Taking stock of the Boeing 737 MAX over the years | Cruising Altitude", "text": "Corrections and Clarifications: Boeing’s MAX is the company’s fourth generation of 737s.\n\nIssues with the Boeing 737 MAX family of jets have defined my career as an aviation reporter.\n\nI cut my teeth at The New York Times following the saga of two of the new jets that crashed within six months of each other in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people between the incidents.\n\nIn the years since, a slow trickle of MAX news has served as mileposts in my career. I’ve had the chance to cover the airplane program at virtually every outlet I’ve written for since those first crashes, and so when I saw the news about Alaska Airlines flight 1282 – which lost a door plug midflight on Friday evening – I knew it was another chapter for both the plane and me.\n\nThe MAX is the company’s bestselling jet of all time, but it’s been a thorn in the company’s side. There’s steep competition for efficient single-aisle planes with Airbus, Boeing’s main competitor and manufacturer of the equally popular A320 family of planes. New efficiencies in recent generations of the Airbus led Boeing to develop the MAX in the first place.\n\nSeeing this latest MAX incident left me wondering first whether the plane was safe, and then, whether its reputation would ever recover.\n\nExperts assure me the answer to both questions is yes.\n\n“The immediate response by the (Federal Aviation Administration) and the manufacturer and the airlines was to instantly ground those particular models of aircraft that have this type of configuration,” Laura Einsetler, a pilot for a major U.S. airline and author of the Captain Laura blog told me. “Once this situation is remedied and they can find the cause, the root source cause, the fact that the safety record has been so good to this point, it’s not a concern of mine that the aircraft will continue to be very safe and secure for passengers and crew.”\n\nEinsetler is qualified to fly Boeing 737 MAX planes, though she’s working on 757 and 767 aircraft.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst and managing director at Aerodynamic Advisory, said he’s confident the issue with MAX jets will be addressed quickly and have little impact on customer confidence.\n\n“The question most people ask these days is how quickly can they resume ramping up MAX production and I don’t think this will be a major crimp in that,” he said. “At the end of the day, airlines are keeping the faith.”\n\nEven so, it felt like a good time to take stock of the 737 MAX’s history. And I’ll confess that in the back of my mind, I still wonder if the jet’s reputation will ever really recover.\n\nThe FAA announced on Tuesday that the affected planes would remain grounded indefinitely as inspection and remediation procedures are ironed out.\n\nBoeing 737 MAX development\n\nAirbus announced a more efficient version of its popular A320 single-aisle family, the A320neo, in 2010. Airlines, constantly looking for cost savings in a tight-margin business, were eager to try out the jet and orders began stacking up. That put Boeing behind its main competitor, leaving them with a decision: should they produce another generation of their bestselling 737 or start fresh with a new design, rather than relying on an airframe developed as a workhorse in the 1960s?\n\nUltimately, the question came down to cost. It was cheaper to stretch and redesign the existing plane than to start from scratch, and faster development was a competitive advantage. So, Boeing unveiled its plans for the 737 MAX, an update to its venerable family of short-to-mid-range jets. The MAX would have larger, more efficient engines and be able to accommodate more passengers than earlier generations of the 737. But those bigger engines posed a problem for Boeing. They changed the aerodynamics of the plane, which could have wiped out some of the efficiencies Boeing was hoping to deliver.\n\nDifferent aerodynamics mean different flying characteristics and different flying characteristics meant that pilots could be required to undergo costly training to fly the newest 737s. To stay competitive, Boeing needed to make the new jets fly like their older cousins. If pilots had to get retrained, the cost-savings of keeping the 737 going would likely be erased, or at least greatly eroded.\n\nThe development of MCAS\n\nTo keep the newest 737s feeling familiar to pilots, Boeing developed software called the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or MCAS. It automatically compensated for the changed aerodynamics of the new jets. But Boeing applied to the FAA to leave any mention of the system out of the pilot manual, and that application was approved. The plane was flying for more than a year before most pilots even knew MCAS existed.\n\nLion Air 737 MAX crash\n\nThe first major incident for Boeing’s 737 MAX family was the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 on Oct. 29, 2018. The MAX 8 operating that flight plunged into the Java Sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nBoeing initially hesitated to identify MCAS as a contributor to the crash, but some details of the system’s performance emerged within days of the incident. By early November, the team I was working on at The Times was reporting on how flight control software may have contributed to the crash.\n\nEven so, the plane kept flying.\n\nEthiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash\n\nMonths later, on March 11, 2019, another 737 MAX 8 crashed shortly after takeoff. Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 was heading from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Nairobi, Kenya, when MCAS again activated shortly after takeoff, pushing the plane to the ground and killing all 157 people on board.\n\nThe FAA did not ground the U.S. fleet of MAX jets until March 13, but that order ultimately stayed in force until Nov. 18, 2020.\n\nWarning signs at Boeing\n\nWhile the planes were grounded, a trove of internal Boeing documents was released. By that time, I was writing for The Points Guy and still covering the story.\n\nAmong the revelations: Lion Air had specifically asked Boeing to include a training mandate for the new aircraft, which Boeing officials still feared could tarnish the program.\n\nIn an instant message between employees that was distributed in a June 2017 email, more than a year before the fatal Lion Air crash, one Boeing worker said, \"Now frigging Lion Air might need a sim to fly the MAX, and maybe because of their own stupidity. I'm scrambling trying to figure out how to unscrew this now!\"\n\nWhat caused the crashes\n\nIn both MAX crashes, MCAS was identified as a key cause. Flaws in its design, including relying on data from only one sensor and the decision not to notify pilots of its existence, all but doomed the Lion Air and Ethiopian flights.\n\nWhen the MAX family of jets returned to the skies in November 2020, regulators assured the public that the planes were safe and that issues with MCAS had been rectified, but many travelers swore they would never fly the plane.\n\nThe latest 737 MAX incident\n\nFor Boeing, Alaska Airlines flight 1282’s explosive decompression was surely an unwelcome development.\n\nWhile the safety record of the MAX has been fine since it returned to service in 2020, the cloud of the plane’s early career disasters continues to shadow the program.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the plane involved in Friday’s incident was a MAX 9, a slightly larger version than the MAX 8s that operated the infamous Lion Air and Ethiopian flights.\n\nThe issue on Friday has been identified as a poorly installed plug over a spot that could accommodate an extra emergency exit in certain aircraft configurations. Early inspections by U.S. airlines have already revealed similar faults in other MAX 9s, suggesting that it was only a matter of time before a flight experienced this kind of failure.\n\nThe FAA has ordered airlines to stop flying some of their MAX 9s until the jets can be inspected and any door plug issues remedied, but I have to imagine that even if the planes soon return to the skies, Boeing executives may continue to worry about what other shoes may yet drop on this family of aircraft.\n\nGraphics by Karl Gelles, Ramon Padilla, George Petras, Janet Loehrke, USA TODAY\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

Sebastián Piñera, who served two terms as the president of Chile, was killed when his helicopter crashed in February.\n\nThrough the years, the deaths of both American and international politicians in such crashes have stirred grief, blame, and conspiracy theories.\n\nPaul Wellstone\n\nSen. Paul Wellstone was killed in a plane crash in 2002, just 11 days before he was up for re-election for a third term as Minnesota's Democratic senator. His wife, Sheila, and 33-year-old daughter, Marcia Wellstone, were also killed, along with three members of his campaign.\n\nThe plane, a Beechcraft King Air A100, crashed as Wellstone was on the way to a funeral in Virginia. It went down less than an hour after it took off from St. Paul, Minnesota, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nAn investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board named the probable cause of the crash as the pilots' failure to \"maintain adequate air speed,\" causing an \"aerodynamic stall\" that the plane could not recover from.\n\nAt a memorial service held days after Wellstone's death, around 20,000 people filled two sports stadiums at the University of Minnesota, the New York Times reported.\n\nA six-acre memorial site in Wellstone's honor now stands near the wooded area in northeastern Minnesota where the plane went down.\n\nMore:Doctor, 2 children who were students at LSU killed in Nashville plane crash: What to know\n\nThomas Hale Boggs Sr.\n\nRep.

Nick Begich, a first-term Democratic representative from Alaska, was also on board the flight, along with one of his aides.\n\nIt set off the most intensive search-and-rescue operation up to that point in history – 40 military aircraft and 50 civilian planes poured over an area of 325,000 square miles over more than 3,600 hours in search of the lost plane, according to Politico.\n\nThe search was called off after 39 days. No trace of the plane was ever found. Begich was declared dead in December of the same year, according to his scholarship fund, and Boggs was declared dead around a month later.\n\nAfter his death, Boggs' wife, Corinne Claiborne “Lindy” Boggs ran for Congress and went on to serve for 15 years.\n\nMel Carnahan\n\nA plane crash also cut short the senatorial bid of Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, who was killed in 2000 while headed to a campaign event.\n\nIncumbent Republican Sen. John Ashcroft was leading the race when Carnahan was alive, but after he took a 10-day break from campaigning out of respect for the late governor, the winds changed, the New York Times reported.\n\nThen, Carnahan's wife Jean Carnahan announced that she would \"do what Mel would have wanted me to do\" and took on the electoral mantle of her husband. Three weeks after his death, she won the election.\n\nShe went on to serve in the position for two years until a special election was held.\n\nA jury ruled four years later that faulty vacuum pumps made by Parker Hannifin Corporation were behind the plane's crash and awarded Carnahan's family $4 million in damages, NBC reported.\n\nMore:Air Force pilot-instructor dies after seat of training plane ejects at Texas base\n\nRon Brown\n\nA diplomatic mission ended in tragedy when Ron Brown, then-President Bill Clinton's secretary of commerce, was killed along with 34 other people when his plane crashed in Croatia in 1996.\n\nBrown was on a trade mission with a group of business leaders interested in exploring business opportunities in the central European country, according to Politico.\n\nAn investigation by the Air Force later concluded the pilot of the plane committed basic errors that led to the crash. The landing system at the airport in Dubrovnik, Brown's destination, was also improper, according to the probe, which took two months and filled a more-than-7,000-page report. Three commanders who worked with the flight crew were fired as a result.\n\nConspiracies swirled around the death of Brown, a Democratic party insider. They sparked demonstrations demanding more information on his death and accusing the Clinton administration of involvement.\n\nMickey Leland\n\nLess than a decade before Brown's death, Texas Rep. Mickey Leland was also killed in an overseas plane crash. Leland died in Ethiopia in 1989 while on a mission to combat world hunger, the cause that defined his activism and work in Congress.\n\nThe burned wreckage of the plane was later found on a mountainside in the East African nation. Everyone on board was killed, including Leland's chief of staff.\n\nAn investigation by the Ethiopian government found that the crew may have flown too low into a bad weather and \"unknowingly collided with a mountain,\" the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nWhen he died, Leland was on a relief mission to a refugee camp that sheltered thousands of children displaced by conflict in neighboring Sudan, according to the Mickey Leland Center on World Hunger & Peace at Texas Southern University.\n\nWhen he died at 44, Leland had already become the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, as well as chairing the House Select Committee on Hunger, which he formed.\n\nMore:Medical plane crashes in North Carolina, injuring pilot and doctor on board\n\nInternational leaders killed in plane crashes\n\nThe death of then-United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld in a 1961 plane crash set off of waves of suspicion surrounding the Swedish statesman's untimely death. Two investigations by British officials blamed pilot error for the crash of the chartered DC-6 plane carrying Hammarskjöld and 14 other people, according to the Flight Safety Foundation.\n\nBut Hammarskjöld had enemies – his decision to send U.N. peacekeeping troops into Congo angered the Soviet Union, which demanded his resignation. The questions were far from resolved in 2017, when a Tanzanian judge appointed by the U.N. to carry out an independent investigation into his death found no definitive conclusion, writing that an \"external attack or threat\" was \"plausible.\"\n\nRamon Magsaysay, the 4-year president of the Philippines who the U.S. staunchly supported in the hopes of undermining communist movements in the region, died along with 24 others when his plane crashed in the province of Cebu.\n\nThe death of Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq, another U.S. ally who served as the president of Pakistan, also triggered questions of a possible assassination. After seizing power in a 1977 coup, Zia ordered his rival Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto executed, suspended other political parties, and declared martial law in the country.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan two years later, the U.S. strengthened its ties with Zia and pumped money into Pakistan's military.

The airline confirmed to USA TODAY on Monday that the plane is not on its 2021 schedule yet.\n\nUnited, which had 14 planes and received several more since the grounding, said it will fly the first of its 737 Maxes on Feb. 11, though it has not announced the plane's route.\n\nThough there have been several test flights leading up to and after the 737 Max's recertification, it has not been flown on any commercial flights in the USA since March 2019.\n\nBrazil's National Civil Aviation Agency greenlighted the plane's return about a week after the FAA decision. On Dec. 9, GOL Linhas Aereas airline became the first to fly it commercially, according to flight-tracking site FlightRadar24.\n\nThe European Union's Aviation Safety Agency has not recertified the plane but said it expects to make its decision in mid-January.\n\nEASA director Patrick Ky, told the BBC that he is \"certain\" the aircraft is safe and that EASA \"left no stone unturned\" in its review.\n\nIn October 2018, a 737 Max operated by Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff in Indonesia, killing all 189 aboard. Five months later, as concerns over its Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) were voiced, an Ethiopian Airlines jet with 157 passengers and crew crashed six minutes into its flight from Addis Ababa.\n\nThe FAA and its counterparts around the world grounded all 387 of the aircraft in service after the two crashes.\n\nIn both cases, pilots wrestled to keep their aircraft aloft as MCAS repeatedly pushed the nose down. The system was intended to compensate for the plane's new, larger engines, which had to be repositioned on the wings. That change led to changes in the plane's flight characteristics under certain circumstances. The pilots were unable to disengage the system, which sent them into dives from which they could not recover.\n\nThere were several hurdles that stretched out the recertification process. American, United and Southwest repeatedly added the plane back to their schedules, only to have to pull it back out when it became clear the plane wouldn't fly anytime soon.\n\nThe U.S Office of Special Counsel, acting on a whistleblower complaint, discovered that the FAA inspectors who originally certified pilots on the 737 Max were not qualified to do so.\n\nBoeing was peppered by a series of disclosures that painted a dark picture of serious errors in development of the 737 Max, which had been rushed to compete with a similar plane being developed by archrival Airbus. An inquiry uncovered flaws in MCAS and efforts within Boeing to deceive regulators and its airline customers about the jetliner. By December 2019, CEO Dennis Muilenburg resigned.\n\nMany of the shortcomings were detailed in a report from the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in September. It said Boeing test pilots identified MCAS problems as early as 2012, including a finding that it took 10 seconds to deal with an uncommanded activation. The problem was considered potentially \"catastrophic,\" the report said.\n\nThere were also logistical obstacles to overcome.\n\nAirlines had to retrain all 737 Max pilots, but there weren't enough flight simulators to accommodate them. As recertification neared completion, pilots' unions complained that the new manual was too confusing and could lead to errors in an emergency.\n\nAmerican's 737 Max FAQ page says pilots' retraining included simulator time and computer- and classroom-based training, all of which gave them an \"improved understanding of 737 Max flight control systems and reinforce their technical knowledge of associated flight deck effects and operational procedures.\"\n\nThe planes had to be removed from storage after 21 months. In its FAQ about the 737 Max's return, American noted that it continued maintenance on all of the dormant planes, including checks of their engines and auxiliary power units, flight controls and other systems, as well as their tires and fuel tanks.\n\nIn the same document, American assured potentially uneasy customers that any passenger who did not want to fly on a 737 Max had the choice of being rebooked on the next available aircraft at no charge, adjusting their itinerary or canceling and getting a flight credit.\n\nThe airline said it made the booking process more transparent, making it easier to tell if a flight is on a 737 Max. Passengers whose flights are moved to a 737 Max will be notified through the American Airlines mobile app within 72 hours of departure, and anyone who doesn't want to fly will be reaccommodated on another aircraft.\n\nContributing: Chris Woodyard, Dawn Gilbertson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/27/april-2024-total-eclipse-news/73108826007/", "title": "When is the 2024 total solar eclipse?

Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nWe're less than two weeks away from the astronomical event of the decade: A total eclipse of the sun, which will grace the nation's skies from Texas to Maine on the afternoon of Monday, April 8.\n\nMillions of people are expected to travel to see the spectacle, which will also attract scientists from across the country to study its unique effects on the Earth and its atmosphere. (Meanwhile, brands such as Burger King, Pizza Hut, Applebee's and Sonic are getting in on the eclipse excitement too.)\n\nThe full total solar eclipse experience will plunge people along a narrow path into darkness midday, but people outside the path of totality could still use eclipse glasses to see the moon pass in front of the sun. It's an awesome and confusing sight on the ground and in the sky.\n\nIt should go without saying:Don't drive while wearing eclipse glasses\n\nOne task to do now is to get yourself a pair of special eclipse glasses (and luckily there's still time to score a free pair of eclipse glasses). They're important eyewear during an eclipse because they will block out the sun's harmful rays, which could damage your eyes when you're looking at the sun — even if it's partially blocked.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses are still readily available from plenty of vendors across the internet as of Thursday, March 28. But be wary of counterfeit or fake glasses, experts warned.\n\nThe other big factor everyone's anxiously awaiting is the weather forecast, which most experts say is still a bit far away for a specific forecast. But more detailed, realistic forecasts will start to roll in over the next few days.\n\nOf particular interest will be the cloud forecast, as a deck of thick, low clouds would likely ruin the entire event. But if the clouds are higher up in the atmosphere, such as thin, wispy cirrus, they'd act to diffuse but not ruin the eclipse.\n\nUSA TODAY 10Best:10 solar eclipse fun facts to share with your friends\n\nThere's plenty to know before the big day, which won't happen again for about two decades. Read on for answers for all your eclipse questions, including how to watch the eclipse, understand the eclipse and use eclipse glasses to stay safe.\n\nHow do I watch the 2024 solar eclipse?\n\nThere are a few ways of watching the eclipse:\n\nGet the full experience in person : If you're in a narrow band of U.S. land that spans from Texas to Maine, you could see the moon block the sun and its shadow cast a night-like darkness over Earth for a few minutes. You'll briefly be able to look up without eye protection and see the moon block the sun.\n\n: If you're in a narrow band of U.S. land that spans from Texas to Maine, you could see the moon block the sun and its shadow cast a night-like darkness over Earth for a few minutes. You'll briefly be able to look up without eye protection and see the moon block the sun. Watch from outside the path of totality : Much of the U.S. is set to get a partial view of the eclipse that isn't nearly as impressive as being in the path of totality. Earth won't be plunged into complete darkness and you'll have to wear protective eyewear to see the moon partially block the sun.\n\n: Much of the U.S. is set to get a partial view of the eclipse that isn't nearly as impressive as being in the path of totality. Earth won't be plunged into complete darkness and you'll have to wear protective eyewear to see the moon partially block the sun. Watch a livestream: Check back on April 8 for a video feed from the path of totality. It's not the same as being there in person, but hey, at least you won't have to sit in traffic.\n\nTotality explained:The real April 2024 total solar eclipse happens inside the path of totality\n\nWhat time is the solar eclipse on April 8?\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT and end in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT, but the exact time of the eclipse varies by where you are in its path.\n\nYou can search by zip code to find the exact time for your location.\n\nWhere will the April eclipse be visible?\n\nAll of the lower 48 U.S. states will see the moon at least clip the sun, but that sight is a trifle compared to being in the path of totality.\n\nBecause the narrow path includes or is near some of the nation's largest cities, expect millions of people to crowd into a band of land a little over 100 miles wide that spans from the Texas/Mexico border to the Maine/Canada border.\n\nHere are the major cities in each state where you can expect to experience totality (note that the included times do not account for when the partial eclipse begins and ends):\n\nDallas, Texas: 1:40-1:44 p.m. CDT\n\nIdabel, Oklahoma: 1:45-1:49 p.m. CDT\n\nLittle Rock, Arkansas: 1:51-1:54 p.m. CDT\n\nPoplar Bluff, Missouri: 1:56-2:00 p.m. CDT\n\nPaducah, Kentucky: 2-2:02 p.m. CDT\n\nCarbondale, Illinois: 1:59-2:03 p.m. CDT\n\nEvansville, Indiana: 2:02-2:05 p.m. CDT\n\nCleveland, Ohio: 3:13-3:17 p.m. EDT\n\nErie, Pennsylvania: 3:16-3:20 p.m. EDT\n\nBuffalo, New York: 3:18-3:22 p.m. EDT\n\nBurlington, Vermont: 3:26-3:29 p.m. EDT\n\nLancaster, New Hampshire: 3:27-3:30 p.m. EDT\n\nCaribou, Maine: 3:32-3:34 p.m. EDT\n\nWill clouds block the April 2024 eclipse?\n\nIt's too soon to say for sure, but history offers some clues.\n\nChances of cloudy skies are pretty high along much of the eclipse's northern path, and some areas such as Buffalo have about a 1-in-3 chance of clear skies in early April.\n\nSkies are usually more clear to the south. Right along the Texas/Mexico border, chances of a clear sky can be nearly 75%.\n\nHowever, early forecasts tell a different story — although forecaster caution it's too early for truly accurate forecasts.\n\nKeep in mind that clouds don't always ruin an eclipse. High, wispy clouds won't spoil the show in the same way that low thick clouds would. In that case, you wouldn't be able to see the moon pass in front of the sun, but you would still notice a sudden darkness in the path of totality.\n\nWhat dangers are associated with the eclipse?\n\nThe eclipse, as exciting and fun as it promises to be, comes with a growing number of safety warnings — both for what will happen in the sky and what will happen on the ground.\n\nIn addition to the dangers of looking at the eclipse without proper eyewear, we've heard warnings about potentially dangerous fake eclipse glasses, the possibility for increased car crashes around the time of the eclipse — and possible air travel headaches due to delayed or cancelled flights.\n\nWhere is the best place to watch the eclipse?\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the eclipse, Texas was considered the best state for eclipse viewing. Historically, there's a good chance the skies will be clear and its location along the southern path of the eclipse means totality will last a little longer. That could change as the forecast evolves.\n\nA few lucky travelers will also have a front-row seat with unobstructed views — from a plane.\n\nWill traffic be bad?\n\nMost likely, yes — especially after the eclipse ends. Millions of people will crowd into the narrow path of totality, then many will attempt to leave all at once as soon as the eclipse is over.\n\nWhen a total solar eclipse passed over the U.S. in 2017, reports say some traffic jams didn't fully clear for more than 12 hours. Even worse, a recent study reported that the 2017 eclipse \"was associated with increased risks of a fatal traffic crash\" – potentially as much as a 31% increase, the study said.\n\nAlso worth noting: The eclipse is expected to have impacts for air travel as well.\n\nCities across the eclipse's path of totality are also bracing for an influx of visitors who are already booking up hotels and short-term vacation rentals, officials have told USA TODAY. \"Hotels are almost sold out,\" said Shalissa Perry, the chief marketing officer for Downtown Dallas.\n\nWhy are schools closing for the eclipse?\n\nPrimarily out of a concern for students' safety, schools across the country have given students the day of the eclipse, April 8, as a day off, a half day or a chance for e-learning. In Tennessee, for example, officials also say it gives students a chance to experience the eclipse with their family and friends.\n\nWhat's it like to watch a solar eclipse from space?\n\nEver wondered what it is like see the solar eclipse from space? NASA scientist and veteran astronaut Terry Virts has witnessed the spectacle in space.\n\n\"When I was in space in 2015, we saw an eclipse over the North Atlantic,\" Virts told USA TODAY this week. \"It was an eclipse that very few humans saw I think, but it was a really unique experience to look down and just see this big black circle kind of moving across the planet.\"\n\n\"It was unlike anything I've ever seen,\" Virts adds. \"I joke I'm glad they told us there was an eclipse because it would have been unsettling to look down at Earth and see this black spot moving across. It was really cool.\"\n\nVirts, who is the face of Sonic's eclipse-themed Blackout Slush Float, said that though he's seen one eclipse from space and many from Earth, he is super excited about the upcoming one on April 8.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse? Definition explained.\n\nA total solar eclipse happens when three celestial spheres — the sun, moon and Earth — line up in a specific way in space.\n\nAccording to NASA, a solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and Earth. That alignment casts a moving shadow on Earth that either fully or partially blocks the sun's light in some areas. This leads to a period of partial or full darkness on a narrow stretch of Earth.\n\nThe path is so narrow because of the huge distance and size of the sun — as well as the moon's distance from Earth. That focuses the moon's shadow on an area of land much smaller than the moon itself. The movement of the shadow across the land happens as the Earth's rotation interacts with the orbit of the moon.\n\nA total eclipse only happens occasionally because the moon doesn't orbit in the exact same plane as the sun and Earth do. In addition, a solar eclipse can only happen during a new moon.\n\nWhat's special about a total solar eclipse?\n\nThe total solar eclipse on April 8 is causing such a stir because the rare event is an astronomical experience like no other that will be unusually accessible to millions of people.\n\nApril's total solar eclipse will fall over more places in the U.S. than the total eclipse before and after it. And the broad length of the path of totality – where Americans have the best shot of getting a clear view – is \"much wider\" than it was for the eclipse in 2017, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nA total solar eclipse is also far more impressive than a lunar or an annular solar eclipse. During an annular eclipse, the moon covers the Sun but leaves an outside ring some call a \"ring of fire\" — it darkens the sky instead of plunging Earth into a night-like darkness, which is what happens during a total solar eclipse. And a lunar eclipse – the appearance of a red moon – happens when the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, according to NASA.\n\nTotal solar eclipses can have spiritual significance, too. Ancient cultures viewed as a sign of the gods' anger or impending departure. Some religions today are hosting eclipse viewings and services.\n\nHistorically, eclipses have left major marks on religious and spiritual civilizations. In Christianity, an eclipse has been associated with the darkness that accompanied Jesus' crucifixion and in Islam, the passing of the Prophet Muhammad's son Ibrahim.\n\nWhen was the last solar eclipse?\n\nThe USA's most recent total solar eclipse was on August 21, 2017, and stretched from Oregon to South Carolina.\n\nWhen will the next solar eclipse happen?\n\nThe next visible total solar eclipse to cross over the U.S. after April will come in more than two decades on Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nAnd that eclipse won't be as accessible as the 2024 one: The path of totality in 2044 will only touch the states of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. Another total eclipse will pass over the U.S. in 2045 that will be more accessible to Americans, including for people who live in California, Florida and Nevada.\n\nWhat are eclipse glasses and why are they needed for the eclipse?\n\nGazing at the bright rays from the eclipse without protective eyewear can seriously damage your eye, so wearing a pair of protective glasses is important.\n\nThere's a technical standard for eclipse glasses, which are designed to block out most light and let you safely see the moon pass in front of the sun: It's called ISO 12312-2 after the International Organization of Standardization.\n\nWhile there's concerns that not all glasses marketed as eclipse glasses live up to that standard, experts say in the past, the shortcomings haven't been significant.\n\nBut as the 2024 eclipse approaches, the American Astronomical Society has warned that there are some counterfeit and fake eclipse glasses being sold from unverified vendors that would be unsafe to use during the eclipse. They recommend buying from a vetted vendor and testing the glasses before the eclipse.\n\nHow do I get solar eclipse glasses?\n\nYou should buy from a reputable source who can ship the glasses to you in time for April 8. A guide to last-minute eclipse glasses explains more.\n\nHeads up: The online marketplace is flooded with retailers selling solar eclipse glasses they claim have the NASA seal of approval. Consider that a red flag to look elsewhere.\n\nHow can you test eclipse glasses?\n\nNASA shared an easy method to check eclipse glasses at home.\n\nBuyers should put on their glasses and look at a bright light, like a flashlight. If the light is \"extremely dim,\" or doesn't appear at all, the glasses are safe, Susannah Darling, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in an instructional video. Viewers should be able to see the filament of the lightbulb, not the glow surrounding the bulb.\n\nCan you really go blind watching a solar eclipse?\n\nYou could severely damage your eyes. Directly staring at the sun before and after the total eclipse, or watching a partial eclipse outside the path of totality without proper eye protection, can result in permanent damage including blurred and altered vision.\n\nWhile rare, eye damage from watching a partial eclipse happens in part because a person's natural response to squint when looking at sunlight does not get triggered. In the lead-up to the April 8 solar eclipse, doctors and a rare set of eclipse watchers are warning about watching this planetary event without adequate eclipse glasses or with the naked eye.\n\nIt’s hard for experts to know or even estimate how many people experience eye damage from solar eclipses. Since looking at an eclipse does not cause complete blindness, people with permanent damage may not know they have it or report it to a doctor. The 2017 eclipse, which passed from Oregon to South Carolina, is thought to have caused about 100 cases, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nHow can I watch the eclipse without glasses?\n\nIf you don't have access to eclipse glasses do not use regular sunglasses — You need a more creative solution for safe viewing, like a pinhole projector.\n\nWelding glasses are not recommended for eclipse viewing.\n\nShould I take dogs or cats to see the eclipse? Is it safe for pets?\n\nAn eclipse itself isn't dangerous for domestic animals such as dogs and cats, but experts say it's probably best to not bring pets.\n\nExperts' biggest concern is not what’s happening in the sky but on the ground as crowds of excited and anxious people gather, said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\n“Rather than the effects of the eclipse, I would be more worried about the excitement and all of the people,” she said.\n\nAnother fun way to experience the eclipse: disco balls\n\nDon't just reach for the solar glasses; a disco ball might be a fun and safe way to enhance the total solar eclipse experience.\n\nInspired by a research paper from European scientists, the Round Rock Public Library in Round Rock, Texas, near Austin, used disco balls during the annular eclipse in October and recommends people do the same for the April 8 eclipse. Officials said the use of a disco ball creates a \"party-like atmosphere\" to make a solar eclipse event more fun.\n\nThe mirrored ball can be placed outside where it can catch the sunlight and reflect it on a shaded wall at least several feet away, or it can be inside near a window to cast reflections of the sun around the room. Youth Services Librarian Andrea Warkentin recommends people get disco balls that have smaller mirrors on them as they will create bigger and better images.\n\n\"It's a way to make it really memorable and fun for little kids who may not really understand what's going on in the sky,\" Warkentin said.\n\n-Fernanda Figueroa, Austin American-Statesman\n\nContributing: Ramon Padilla, Karina Zaiets and Janet Loehrke", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/04/09/boeing-deliveries-fall-after-737-max-grounding/3411867002/", "title": "Boeing's deliveries fall after 737 Max grounding", "text": "David Koenig\n\nAssociated Press\n\nDALLAS (AP) – Deliveries of Boeing’s best-selling jet tumbled as expected after the newest version of the plane was grounded around the world following two deadly crashes.\n\nBoeing said Tuesday that it delivered 149 commercial airplanes, including 89 737s, in the first quarter. In the same period last year, the company delivered 184 planes, including 132 737s.\n\nThe company did not disclose how many of the 737s were the Max version that was grounded last month. Boeing is still producing an earlier model, but the Max is expected to account for a very high percentage of 737 deliveries this year.\n\nBoeing suspended deliveries in mid-March, and last week announced that it would cut production of the 737 from 52 a month to 42 a month.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, American Airlines cut a key revenue estimate after canceling 1,200 flights in the first quarter due to the grounding of its 24 Max jets.\n\nBoeing 737 Max: How will airlines convince skittish passengers it's safe to fly again?\n\n'Single point failure':Why was there no backup system on 737 Max jet?\n\nRegulators around the world grounded the plane last month after an Ethiopian Airlines Max crashed less than five months after a Lion Air Max plunged into the sea off the coast of Indonesia. In all, 346 people died.\n\nBoeing has acknowledged that in each crash, a faulty sensor triggered an anti-stall system when it wasn’t needed, pushing the plane’s nose down. Pilots on each flight fought unsuccessfully to regain control, according to flight data retrieved from the planes.\n\nBoeing is working on a software update that its CEO says will fix the problem, but the update was delayed recently by several weeks because of the discovery of a second software problem. Boeing hasn’t described the second issue but says it is not related to the anti-stall system.\n\nMeanwhile, airlines that own the nearly 400 Max jets are canceling flights.\n\nAmerican Airlines, the world’s biggest carrier, said that it can’t predict the future financial harm from the plane’s grounding until it knows how long the jets will be parked and the circumstances under which they will be allowed to fly again.\n\nOver the weekend, American removed the plane from its schedule through June 5 – six weeks longer than before – underlining the realization among airlines that the Max will be parked longer than previously expected.\n\nAmerican says revenue for each seat flown one mile will be flat to up 1 percent, down from its initial forecast of flat to up 2 percent.\n\nAmerican also blamed the government shutdown and 940 cancellations due to faulty work by a contractor on the interiors of several other Boeing planes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-history/2016/06/30/60-years-ago-2-planes-collided-over-grand-canyon/86529858/", "title": "60 years ago, 2 planes collided over the Grand Canyon and it ...", "text": "Alexis Egeland\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nThursday marks the 60th anniversary of a tragic event often forgotten today but seen by aviation experts as a pivotal moment in air safety.\n\nOn June 30, 1956, two planes collided over the Grand Canyon in one of the largest commercial airline disasters in American history.\n\nThe planes both were flying out of Los Angeles International Airport that Saturday morning, and both had encountered short delays.\n\nThe Trans World Airlines flight was scheduled to take off for Kansas City, Mo., at 8:30 a.m., but was delayed for minor maintenance. The plane took off at 9:01 a.m., according to an Accident Investigation Report from the Civil Aeronautics Board.\n\nThe United Air Lines flight took off for Chicago at 9:04 a.m., three minutes after the TWA flight, according to the report.\n\nThe crash, blamed on turbulent weather, outdated visual flight rules and a lack of communication, would be fully detailed in the 1957 report on the accident.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\nTWA Flight 2, flown by Capt. Jack Gandy, flew north over the San Bernardino Mountains at a speed of 270 knots and an elevation of 19,000 feet. United Flight 718, flown by Capt. Robert Shirley, flew east over Palm Springs at a speed of 288 knots and an elevation of 21,000 feet. The two should have crossed paths without a problem and made it to their respective destinations with no problem.\n\nEverything went as planned for about 15 minutes. Then Gandy called in to report turbulence. He requested approval to begin flying at 21,000 feet to avoid an overcast area up ahead. His request was denied, but he was granted permission to fly 1,000 feet on top of the bad weather.\n\nAccording to the Flight Information Manual at the time, \"Air Traffic clearances which specify 'at least 1,000 feet above all clouds' in lieu of a cruising altitude permits flight to be conducted at any altitude at or above the minimum en route altitude which is 1,000 feet or more above the cloud layer.\"\n\n\"1,000 on-top operations\" are common, but put a lot more responsibility on the pilots when it comes to air traffic,\" the manual reads.\n\nThe maneuver would limit how much information the pilot would be able to receive about how close the plane was to other planes, leaving the pilot to rely on what he could see.\n\nWith the implementation of flight radars and satellite surveillance, \"1,000 on-top operations\" are not used anymore, according to Ian Gregor, a FAA spokesman.\n\n\"The type of radar and satellite surveillance we have today is far different from what existed 60 years ago,\" he said. \"As a result, pilots would not typically need or ask to fly above the weather today. Pilots do sometimes request altitude changes to get above or below turbulence, and air traffic control will grant those if it is safe to do so.\"\n\nA critical lack of communication\n\nWhen Gandy was granted permission to move to 1,000 above the clouds, the investigation report says, Shirley was not notified, even though it meant that the two aircraft would be flying over the same area at the same altitude, at around the same time.\n\nThe last coherent reports from the pilots were reportedly received just before 10:00 a.m., according to the accident investigation. At 10:30, Aeronautical Radio communicators in Salt Lake City received a call that was indecipherable. According to the report, after weeks of studying, the message was finally interpreted: \"Salt Lake, United 718 ... ah ... we're going in.\"\n\nSee The Republic's front pages from the incident.\n\nAbout 10:31 a.m., the two planes collided over the Grand Canyon. The report states that the pilots' vision likely was obstructed by clouds that were moving in and out of the area at the time, and they probably did not see each other until it was too late to move.\n\nThe collision likely occurred over the confluence of the Colorado River and the Little Colorado River, according to the accident report. The two planes crashed downwards, with the TWA plane landing on the northeast portion of Temple Butte and the United plane coming to rest on the south side of Chuar Butte. The left wing of the United plane was found near the wreckage from the TWA plane.\n\nThe impact resulted in fires at both wreckage sites. All 128 passengers were killed.\n\n'Crash canyon'\n\n\"Airliner Collision Feared; Wreckage Found in Canyon\" was The Arizona Republic headline on July 1, 1956. A story by staff reporters Ray Silvius and Ted Kazy read, \"A Trans-World Airlines Super Constellation plunged into the upper end of the rugged Grand Canyon yesterday, apparently killing all 70 persons aboard. Another airliner carrying 58 persons is missing in the same area.\n\n\n\n\"The two planes may have collided. If they did, and all are dead, it would be the worst single disaster in commercial aviation history.\"\n\n\"The TWA plane and the other craft, a United Air Lines DC-7, make routine radio checks to separate airline radio stations from the Needles, Calif., area, just before they crossed into Arizona on their way East.\n\n\"Both planes radioed they planned to be over the same spot in the Painted Desert at exactly the same time, according to an air force official. They may have been.\"\n\nAccording to a New York Times article from 1956, two brothers were first to find the wreckage.\n\n\"Mr. Coffin (Lynn Coffin, then chief ranger at Grand Canyon National Park) said the find was made by Palen and Henry Hudgin, brothers who operate the Grand Canyon Airlines,\" the article said. \"The brothers said the wreckage was on the side of a butte about 1,000 feet above the Colorado River, in rugged terrain difficult to enter. The wreckage was scattered over the hillside, they said, and two fires were burning in the area.\"\n\nThe crash site is now informally known as Crash Canyon and is a popular tourist attraction. Many people like to hike through the area, looking for the scattered remains of the 60-year-old tragedy.\n\nSome of the wreckage is still resting in the canyon, glistening metal to remind hikers of the event on sunny days.\n\nA wake-up call for aviation\n\nSome good did come from the event, though. Although 65 crashes similar to this one had occurred from 1950 to 1955, this one was a wake-up call for aviation.\n\n\"The accident dramatized the fact that, even though U.S. air traffic had more than doubled since the end of World War II, little had been done to mitigate the risk of midair collisions,\" according to the FAA.\n\nIn 1958, inspired by this crash and others, the Federal Aviation Association was born.\n\nAccording to the FAA, the Federal Aviation Act was proposed in May 1958 by Sen. Mike Monroney from Oklahoma, hoping to increase safety of national airspace. The act was signed by President Dwight Eisenhower two months later.\n\nToday, planes do not fly under visual flight rules. Commercial jets always are directed by air traffic controllers at altitudes such as that where the 1956 crash took place, said Gregor, the FAA spokesman.\n\nAll commercial aircraft now have automated collision avoidance systems, called Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems, Gregor said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/11/18/boeing-737-max-grounded-since-2019-gets-faa-approval/6266753002/", "title": "Boeing 737 Max, grounded since 2019, gets FAA approval to fly again", "text": "Boeing's 737 Max, the jetliner grounded for 20 months after two international crashes that killed 346 passengers and crew, was cleared to fly again Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe troubled airliner's return to the skies won't be immediate, even with the ungrounding order. The planes will need to be refitted with improvements ordered by the FAA, and pilots will need to be retrained in procedures.\n\nAmerican Airlines, one of the largest operators, plans to have the planes flying again on Dec. 29 starting with a single round trip between New York and Miami. The airline recognized some travelers may be hesitant.\n\nIn a memo to employees Wednesday, American said, \"If a customer prefers to not fly on this aircraft, we’ll provide flexibility to ensure they can be easily re-accommodated.\"\n\nSouthwest Airlines, another large operator, said its 737 Max jets won't be in service again until the spring.\n\nPossibly as a way of curbing public apprehension, Boeing has hinted that the Max might even get a new name.\n\nBut no matter the additional procedures, the official ungrounding of the Max is the most significant step yet in Boeing's effort to resurrect the aircraft that devastated its reputation and led to congressional investigations. The inquiries revealed shortcomings and even outright deceit when safety questions arose during the plane's development.\n\n“The FAA’s directive is an important milestone,” Stan Deal, CEO of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, said in a statement. “We will continue to work with regulators around the world and our customers to return the airplane back into service worldwide.”\n\nSome of those questions linger, with critics saying that despite the fixes approved by the FAA, the twin-engine plane's design is inherently flawed and it shouldn't be allowed to fly again.\n\nBut FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson, himself a former commercial airline pilot, said he thinks the plane is ready, having taken it for a two-hour test flight himself recently.\n\n\"I can tell you my family and your family will be safe on this aircraft,\" he said on a conference call with reporters Wednesday.\n\nThe 737 Max is the latest iteration of the stubby jetliner that first flew in the 1960s and went on to become one of the most successful commercial aircraft ever. The Max was intended to take advantage of a new generation of jet engines that could save airlines more fuel.\n\n'Difficult to recall the steps in order':Southwest, American pilots say new Boeing 737 Max manual may lead to errors in emergencies\n\nThe problem, however, was that the new engines were larger, which would cause them to hang too low below the wings without a redesign. The engines had to be repositioned on the wings in a way that gave them added clearance above the runway.\n\nThe new location, however, was found to also change the plane's flight characteristics under certain circumstances. To compensate, Boeing added software to the plane's flight computer that would work in the background so the Max would feel to pilots like previous versions of the 737.\n\nIt was called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, and it proved to have serious flaws. In both the crashes, pilots wrestled to keep their aircraft aloft as MCAS repeatedly pushed the nose down. They were unable to disengage the system, which eventually sent them into dives from which they could not recover.\n\nA 737 Max operated by Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff in Indonesia in October 2018, killing all 189 aboard. Then, five months later as concerns over MCAS were being voiced, an Ethiopian Airlines jet with 157 passengers and crew crashed six minutes into its flight from Addis Ababa.\n\nFinancial freefall:Deeper job cuts at Boeing as coronavirus pandemic throttles air travel, company reports $449M loss\n\nIt was only then, in March 2019, that the 387 Max jets already delivered around the world were grounded. It was a blow to airlines that had incorporated them into their schedules, which were booming at the time. In the U.S. alone, Southwest Airlines had 34, American Airlines 24 and United Airlines 14.\n\nBoeing would go on to build scores more that it couldn't deliver. It still shows unfilled orders for 4,102 of them.\n\nThen came the investigations. Boeing was peppered by a series of disclosures that painted a dark picture of serious errors in development of the 737 Max that had been rushed to compete with a similar plane being developed by archrival Airbus. The inquiry uncovered flaws in MCAS and efforts within Boeing to deceive regulators and its airline customers about the jetliner.\n\nMany of the shortcomings were detailed in a report from the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in September. It said Boeing test pilots identified MCAS problems as early as 2012, including a finding that it took 10 seconds to deal with an uncommanded activation. The problem was considered potentially \"catastrophic,\" the report said.\n\nMCAS, a test pilot found, could kick in multiple times, which is what happened on the doomed flights. MCAS could be triggered into action by either of two sensors measuring angle of attack – whether the plane is headed up or down – instead relying on readings from both. If there was a big difference between the two, it would have been a sign that the other one was malfunctioning.\n\nAn instrument in the plane was supposed to let pilots know when the two sensors disagreed. But it was inoperable on 80% of delivered 737 Max jets. Boeing discovered the problem in 2015, but it didn't tell airlines until after the Lion Air crash, the report found.\n\nIn addition, the report said the 737 Max's chief engineer approved MCAS without fully understanding it.\n\nAfter the Lion Air crash, the FAA conducted an assessment that estimated if MCAS were not improved, it could cause 15 more crashes over the worldwide Max fleet's lifetime, with a loss of 2,900 lives.\n\nTo get the 737 Max flying again, Boeing modified the MCAS software and added other safety features to make sure that pilots can immediately disengage the system and take control of the plane. It also made sure that the two angle-of-attack sensors work in tandem with MCAS.\n\nAs part of its ungrounding order, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive requiring that the new software be added, flight manuals be revised and crews retrained before the planes can go back into service.\n\nThe nation's largest pilots union, the Air Line Pilots Association, said in a statement that it has faith in the plane, based on the revisions. \"ALPA believes that the engineering fixes to the flight-critical aircraft systems are sound and will be an effective component that leads to the safe return to service of the 737 Max.\"\n\nCritics say the changes are not enough. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, whose 24-year-old niece died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, wrote Dickson on Nov. 13, saying the 737 Max is fundamentally flawed and should never be allowed to fly.\n\nThere's no \"ignoring the basic aerodynamic problem of the plane’s 'quick and dirty' engine position/fuselage mismatch,\" he wrote, and \"human factors and the unstable aerodynamics of the 737 MAX have made it inherently unsafe.\"\n\nThe answer, he said, is to lengthen the jetliner's landing gear and return the engine to a safer position under the wings, similar to previous 737 models, thus making MCAS unnecessary.\n\nOn a conference call with reporters Tuesday, family members of the Ethiopian Airlines crash victims expressed exasperation about how a new jetliner from a highly regarded aerospace maker like Boeing could fall from the sky – not just once, but twice.\n\n\"It doesn't seem real. How could this happen?\" asked Naoise Ryan, whose husband, Michael Ryan, died in the crash along with six colleagues in the United Nations World Food Program. \"Not a single person has been held to account\" and \"aviation should not be a trial-and-error process.\"\n\nLinet Mwirigi, wife of another victim, Cedric Asiavugwa, pushed for a \"full disclosure\" of what went wrong.\n\n\"My biggest heartbreak is that it is a crash that could have been avoided,\" Mwirigi said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/03/24/french-alps-plane-crash/70397784/", "title": "Plane crash kills 150 people in French Alps", "text": "Lori Hinnant, Claude Paris\n\nAssociated Press\n\nA Germanwings jet carrying 150 people from Barcelona to Duesseldorf slammed into a remote section of the French Alps on Tuesday, sounding like an avalanche as it scattered pulverized debris across a rocky mountain and down its steep ravines.

Col. Jean-Marc Meninchini of the regional police rescue service, told The Associated Press in the mountain town of Seyne-les-Alpes. Recovery operations are expected to last a week, he said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted, \"We still don't know much beyond the bare information on the flight, and there should be no speculation on the cause of the crash.\n\nLufthansa Vice President Heike Birlenbach told reporters in Barcelona that for now \"we say it is an accident.\"\n\nIn Washington, the White House said American officials were in contact with their French, Spanish and German counterparts.\n\n\"There is no indication of a nexus to terrorism at this time,\" said U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan.\n\nVideo and photos of the site showed scattered white flecks across a stony mountain and several larger airplane body sections with windows.

Tuesday's crash was its first involving passenger deaths since it began operating in 2002. The Germanwings logo, normally maroon and yellow, was blacked out on its Twitter feed.\n\nGermanwings said Flight 9525 carried 144 passengers, including two babies, and six crew members. Officials believe 67 Germans were on board, including the 16 high school students from Haltern and two opera singers.\n\nBarcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu says German contralto Maria Radner was aboard the crashed plane along with her husband and baby. The opera house in Duesseldorf said bass baritone Oleg Bryjak, was also on the plane.\n\nOne Dutch citizen and one Danish citizen were among the victims as well, their governments said.\n\nThe plane left Barcelona Airport at 10:01 a.m., then began descending again shortly after reaching its cruising height of 38,000 feet, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann told reporters in Cologne. The descent lasted eight minutes.\n\nEric Heraud of the French Civil Aviation Authority said the Germanwings plane lost radio contact with a control center at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, but \"never declared a distress alert itself.\" He said the combination of loss of radio contract and the plane's quick descent prompted the control center to declare a distress situation.\n\n\"We cannot say at the moment why our colleague went into the descent, and so quickly, and without previously consulting air traffic control,\" said Germanwings' director of flight operations, Stefan-Kenan Scheib.\n\nThe plane crashed at an altitude of about 2,000 meters (6,550 feet) near the towns of Prads-Haute-Bleone and Meolans-Revels and the popular ski resort of Pra Loup. The site is 700 kilometers (430 miles) south-southeast of Paris.\n\n\"It was a deafening noise. I thought it was an avalanche, although it sounded slightly different. It was short noise and lasted just a few seconds,\" Sandrine Boisse, the president of the Pra Loup tourism office, told the AP.\n\nInterior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told BFM television he expected \"an extremely long and extremely difficult\" search-and-rescue operation because of the area's remoteness. The weather in the area deteriorated Tuesday afternoon, with a chilly rain falling.\n\nWinkelmann said the pilot, whom he did not name, had more than 10 years' experience working for Germanwings and its parent airline Lufthansa.\n\nThe aircraft was delivered to Lufthansa in 1991, had approximately 58,300 flight hours in some 46,700 flights, Airbus said. The plane underwent a routine check in Duesseldorf on Monday, and its last regular full check took place in the summer of 2013.\n\nThe plane had a minor technical problem Monday with a nose gear landing door, Lufthansa spokesman Christoph Meier said, but added that it was really only a noise problem that did not appear to have any link to the crash. He also said a few Germanwings crews asked not to fly after the crash \"for personal reasons.\"\n\nThe safest part of a flight is normally when the plane is at cruising elevation. Just 10 percent of fatal accidents occur at that point, according to a safety analysis by Boeing. In contrast, takeoff and the initial climb accounts for 14 percent of crashes and final approach and landing accounts for 47 percent.\n\nIn Paris, French President Francois Hollande called the crash \"a tragedy on our soil.\"\n\nThe last time a passenger jet crashed in France was the 2000 Concorde accident, which left 113 dead — 109 in the plane and four on the ground.\n\nMerkel spoke with both Hollande and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy about the crash, immediately cancelling all other appointments.\n\n\"The crash ... is a shock that plunges us in Germany, the French and the Spanish into deep sorrow,\" said Merkel, who planned to travel to the region Wednesday.\n\nThe A320 plane is a workhorse of modern aviation. The single-aisle, twin-engine jet is used to connect cities between one and five hours apart. It is certified to fly up to 39,000 feet but it can begin to experience problems as low as 37,000 feet.\n\nThe A320 family also has a good safety record, with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs, according to a Boeing safety analysis.\n\n___\n\nHinnant contributed from Paris.

The aircraft’s manifest stated it was loaded with cookies. Sudan rarely, if ever, exports cookies.\n\nA heated debate transpired between officials in a back office of Khartoum International Airport. They feared that inspecting the plane would vex the country’s increasingly pro-Russian military leadership. Multiple previous attempts to intercept suspicious Russian carriers had been stopped. Ultimately, however, the officials decided to board the plane.\n\nInside the hold, colorful boxes of cookies stretched out before them. Hidden just beneath were wooden crates of Sudan’s most precious resource. Gold. Roughly one ton of it.\n\nThis incident in February – recounted by multiple official Sudanese sources to CNN – is one of at least 16 known Russian gold smuggling flights out of Sudan, Africa’s third largest producer of the precious metal, over the last year and a half.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter confronts staff at alleged Russian operation in Sudan 08:55 - Source: CNN\n\nMultiple interviews with high-level Sudanese and US officials and troves of documents reviewed by CNN paint a picture of an elaborate Russian scheme to plunder Sudan’s riches in a bid to fortify Russia against increasingly robust Western sanctions and to buttress Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine.\n\nThe evidence also suggests that Russia has colluded with Sudan’s beleaguered military leadership, enabling billions of dollars in gold to bypass the Sudanese state and to deprive the poverty-stricken country of hundreds of millions in state revenue.\n\nIn exchange, Russia has lent powerful political and military backing to Sudan’s increasingly unpopular military leadership as it violently quashes the country’s pro-democracy movement.\n\nFormer and current US officials told CNN that Russia actively supported Sudan’s 2021 military coup which overthrew a transitional civilian government, dealing a devastating blow to the Sudanese pro-democracy movement that had toppled President Omar al-Bashir two years earlier.\n\n“We’ve long known Russia is exploiting Sudan’s natural resources,” one former US official familiar with the matter told CNN. “In order to maintain access to those resources Russia encouraged the military coup.”\n\n“As the rest of the world closed in on [Russia], they have a lot to gain from this relationship with Sudan’s generals and from helping the generals remain in power,” the former official added. “That ‘help’ runs the gamut from training and intelligence support to jointly benefiting from Sudan’s stolen gold.”\n\nAt the heart of this quid pro quo between Moscow and Sudan’s military junta is Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch and key ally of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe heavily sanctioned 61-year-old controls a shadowy network of companies that includes Wagner, a paramilitary group linked to alleged torture, mass killings and looting in several war-torn countries including Syria and the Central African Republic (CAR). Prigozhin denies links to Wagner.\n\nIn Sudan, Prigozhin’s main vehicle is a US-sanctioned company called Meroe Gold – a subsidiary of Prigozhin owned M-invest – which extracts gold while providing weapons and training to the country’s army and paramilitaries, according to invoices seen by CNN.\n\n“Through Meroe Gold, or other companies associated with Prigozhin employees, he has developed a strategy to loot the economic resources of the African countries where he intervenes, as a counterpart to his support to the governments in place,” said Denis Korotkov, investigator at the London-based Dossier Center, which tracks the criminal activity of various people associated with the Kremlin. The center was started by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once the richest man in Russia, now living in exile in London.\n\nCNN, in collaboration with the Dossier Center, can also reveal that at least one high-level Wagner operative – Alexander Sergeyevich Kuznetsov – has overseen operations in Sudan’s key gold mining, processing and transit sites in recent years.\n\nKuznetsov – also known by his call signs “Ratibor” and “Radimir” – is a convicted kidnapper who fought in neighboring Libya and commanded Wagner’s first attack and reconnaissance company in 2014. He is a four-time recipient of Russia’s Order of Courage award and was pictured alongside Putin and Dmitri Utkin – Wagner’s founder – in 2017. The European Union sanctioned Kuznetsov in 2021.\n\nThe growing bond between Sudan’s military rulers and Moscow has spawned an intricate gold smuggling network. According to Sudanese official sources as well as flight data reviewed by CNN in collaboration with flight tracker Twitter account Gerjon, at least 16 of the flights intercepted by Sudanese officials last year were operated by military plane that came to and from the Syrian port city of Latakia where Russia has a major airbase.\n\nGold shipments also follow a land route to the CAR, where Wagner has propped up a repressive regime and is reported to have meted out some of its cruelest tactics on the country’s population, according to multiple Sudanese official sources and the Dossier Center.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Russian foreign ministry, the Russian defense ministry and the parent organization for the group of companies run by Prigozhin for comment. None has responded.\n\nResponding to the findings of CNN’s investigation, a US State Department spokesperson said: “We are monitoring this issue closely, including the reported activities of Meroe Gold, the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, and other sanctioned actors in Sudan, the region, and throughout the gold trade.\n\n“We support the Sudanese people in their pursuit of a democratic and prosperous Sudan that respects human rights,” the spokesperson added. “We will continue to make clear our concerns to Sudanese military officials about the malign impact of Wagner, Meroe Gold, and other actors.”\n\nReceding into the shadows\n\nRussia’s meddling in Sudan’s gold began in earnest in 2014 after its invasion of Crimea prompted a slew of Western sanctions. Gold shipments proved an effective way of accumulating and transferring wealth, bolstering Russia’s state coffers while sidestepping international financial monitoring systems.\n\n“The downside of gold is that it’s physical and a lot more cumbersome to use than international wire transfers but the flip side is that it’s much harder if not impossible to freeze or seize,” said Daniel McDowell, sanctions specialist and associate professor of Political Science at Syracuse University.\n\nThe hub of Russia’s gold extraction operation lies deep in the desert of northeast Sudan, a bleached landscape peppered with gaping chasms where miners toil in searing heat, with only tents fashioned from scraps of tarpaulin and sandbags providing any respite.\n\nAlex Platt, CNN\n\nMiners from those remote artisanal mines converge on al-Ibaidiya – known as ‘gold town’ – every morning, lugging sacks of gold in carts hauled by donkeys along the town’s unpaved roads. The highest bidders for their goods, many of them say, are almost invariably merchants dispatched from a nearby processing plant known by locals as ‘the Russian company.’\n\nIt’s a helter-skelter selling process that sources tell CNN is the nerve center of Russia’s gold siphoning. Some 85% of the gold in Sudan is sold this way, according to official statistics seen by CNN. The transactions are mostly off-the-books, and Russia dominates this market, according to multiple sources, including mining whistleblowers and security sources.\n\nFor at least a decade, Russia has hidden its Sudanese gold dealings from the official record. Sudan’s official Foreign Trade Statistics since 2011 consistently list Russia’s total gold exports from the country at zero, despite copious evidence of Moscow’s extensive dealings in this sector.\n\nBecause Russia has benefited from considerable government blind spots, it is difficult to ascertain the exact amount of gold it has removed from Sudan. But at least seven sources familiar with events accuse Russia of driving the lion’s share of Sudan’s gold smuggling operations – which is where most of Sudan’s gold has ended up in recent years, according to official statistics.\n\nMilling machines grind gold ore in the al-Ibaidiya milling plant.

Alex Platt, CNN Gold flakes being weighed at a gold lab. Alex Platt, CNN The gold lab at al-Ibaidiya. Alex Platt, CNN Al-Ibaidiya is known as 'gold town' and sources say it lies at the center of Russia's gold smuggling operation. Alex Platt, CNN Al-Ibaidiya, Sudan Prev Next\n\nA whistleblower from inside the Sudanese Central Bank showed CNN a photo of a spreadsheet showing that 32.7 tons was unaccounted for in 2021. Using current prices, this amounts to $1.9 billion worth of missing gold, at $60 million a ton.\n\nBut multiple former and current officials say that the amount of missing gold is even larger, arguing that the Sudanese government vastly underestimates the gold produced at informal artisanal mines, distorting the real number.\n\nMost of CNN’s insider sources claim that around 90% of Sudan’s gold production is being smuggled out. If true, that would amount to roughly $13.4 billion worth of gold that has circumvented customs and regulations, with potentially hundreds of millions of dollars lost in government revenue. CNN cannot independently verify those figures.\n\nAn anti-corruption Sudanese investigator who has tracked Russia’s gold dealings in Sudan for years provided CNN with the coordinates of a key Russian processing plant. When CNN arrived at the site, some five miles from al-Ibaidiya, a Soviet flag fluttered above the compound. A Russian fuel truck was parked outside.\n\nA casual encounter with the guard – who confirmed that the facility belonged to the so-called “Russian company” – quickly turned into a tense confrontation.\n\nThe guard spoke through a walkie talkie, conveying CNN’s request to speak to “the Russian manager.” A group of Sudanese men then rushed to the scene and ordered the CNN crew to leave, before the CNN car was tailed by the security detail.\n\n“You need to go,” another Sudanese employee at the plant told CNN. “This isn’t a Russian company. It is a Sudanese company called al-Solag.”\n\nA Soviet flag flies over the processing plant deep in the Sudanese desert, a facility known to locals as the \"Russian company.\" Alex Platt, CNN\n\nAl-Solag is a Sudanese front company for Meroe Gold, the US-sanctioned Russian mining business, according to five official Sudanese sources and company registration documents reviewed by CNN.\n\nAl-Solag’s formation over the last year has marked a key turning point for Russia’s presence in Sudan. Under the new model, Russia’s dealings have receded into the shadows, making the arrangements more reliant on Sudan’s military leadership and further enabling Russian actors to circumvent state institutions, including regulations pertaining to foreign companies, under the guise of a local business. CNN has reached out to Sudan’s military leadership for comment, and received no reply.\n\n‘Too much US scrutiny’\n\nIn 2021, Russia’s Sudan envoy, Vladimir Zheltov, called for an impromptu meeting with Sudanese mining officials.\n\nAppearing visibly nervous, Zheltov demanded that Meroe Gold be “obscured” after becoming subject to “too much US scrutiny,” according to a whistleblower from Sudan’s Ministry of Mining who had first-hand knowledge of the meeting.\n\nBy June of this year, Zheltov’s demands had materialized. The transfer of Meroe Gold’s assets to the Sudanese-owned al-Solag appeared to have been completed. An analysis of the registration documents of the two companies revealed striking similarities, including two identical lists of legal penalties.\n\nUnder Sudanese law, a company wishing to transfer their holdings must also transfer judgments against it. It is illegal to have an undeclared foreign partner.\n\nSudan’s anti-corruption committee, a watchdog set up to assist Sudan’s transition to democracy, then blocked the attempted subterfuge, according to a former civilian official with direct knowledge of the events. The anti-corruption committee sent a detailed report to the armed forces in September 2021 with evidence of the Meroe Gold transfer to al-Solag, urging them to stop what they dubbed a “crime against the state.”\n\nThe watchdog also accused the military of complicity in Russia’s dealings, drawing the ire of the military leadership who lambasted the committee for “harming the armed forces,” according to the former civilian official.\n\n“The Russians and Sudanese officers saw the civilians in the government as an obstacle to their plans,” the former official added.\n\nIn October 2021, a month after the anti-corruption committee stopped the transfer of holdings from Meroe Gold to al-Solag, Sudan’s military staged a coup – which US official and former official sources accuse Russia of backing – and the junta immediately dismantled the committee.\n\n“Russia is a parasite,” the former official told CNN. “It pillaged Sudan. And it has exacted a very large political penalty by terminating a democratic project that could have turned Sudan into a great nation.”\n\nGen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary unit, is a key beneficiary from Russian support, as the primary recipient of Moscow’s weapons and training. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan – the country’s military ruler – is also believed by CNN’s Sudanese sources to be backed by Russia.\n\nHuman rights groups have implicated both Burhan and Dagalo (known as Hemedti) in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during Sudan’s Darfur conflict that started in 2003.\n\nOn the same day that Russia launched its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Hemedti was heading a Sudanese delegation in Moscow to “advance relations” between the two countries.\n\nWagner boots on the ground\n\nOn a dusty border-crossing between the CAR and Sudan in March 2019, a bespectacled 34-year-old Russian frantically sent his boss – Meroe Gold owner Mikhail Potepkin – a plea for help.\n\n“Radimir is pissed that no one was warned,” wrote Aleksei Pankov in a Telegram conversation which the Dossier Center shared with CNN. He was referring to Kuznetsov, the menacing high-level Wagner operative, depicted as manning the border alongside Sudanese intelligence operatives.\n\n“Tell Radimir that it was a ‘closed’ operation. That’s why we didn’t warn him about it,” came Potepkin’s reply.\n\n“F**k, Radimir is scary. I almost s**t my pants,” Pankov wrote back.\n\nThis exchange is part of a string of evidence collected by CNN that establishes Kuznetsov as a key Wagner enforcer across key locations in Sudan.\n\nCNN has also seen official Sudanese communiques referencing Kuznetsov as a “problematic” armed Russian who was overseeing security at the Russian gold processing plant near al-Ibaidiya. A source familiar with Meroe Gold’s activities in Sudan told CNN that Kuznetsov also frequented the company’s offices in Khartoum.\n\nWagner operatives deploy to Sudan on a rotational basis, the Dossier Center told CNN, and Kuznetsov may be one of several Wagner men in the country. These are strategically dispatched to protect Russia’s smuggling scheme that has grown in importance since Russia launched its war on Ukraine.\n\nThose Wagner operatives appear to be part of a growing climate of fear as Moscow tightens its grip on Sudan’s gold pipeline, sources say.\n\nSeveral local journalism networks whose work CNN has drawn on for this report – such as Mujo Press, al-Bahshoum and activist journalist Hisham Ali’s Facebook page – have been targeted in recent months, driven into exile under the threat of assassination. Ten protesters were gunned down in demonstrations in June alone, three of whom were prominent pro-democracy activists. CNN security sources believe they were deliberately targeted.\n\nHigh-level Sudanese officials repeatedly urged CNN’s Nima Elbagir to steer clear of protest sites. Since CNN began this investigation, Elbagir has been put on the military junta’s hit list, according to multiple Sudanese security sources.\n\nAs images of Russian tanks encircling Kyiv were flashing on TV screens at Khartoum International Airport, employees watched as the plane laden with cookies and gold took off last February. Senior army brass had intervened and a sense of foreboding set in.\n\nSome of the officials who uncovered the haul were reassigned, some to regional duty stations, and others were sent to army reserves, according to a source with direct knowledge of the incident.\n\n“They paid for doing their jobs,” the source told CNN.", "authors": ["Nima Elbagir Barbara Arvanitidis Tamara Qiblawi Gianluca Mezzofiore Mohammed Abo Al Gheit Marco Chacón Natalie Croker Henrik Pettersson", "Cnn Exclusive", "Nima Elbagir", "Barbara Arvanitidis", "Tamara Qiblawi", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Mohammed Abo Al Gheit", "Marco Chacón", "Natalie Croker", "Henrik Pettersson"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/middleeast/shireen-abu-akleh-jenin-killing-investigation-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "New evidence suggests Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in targeted ...", "text": "The cameraman filming the scene scrambles backwards to take cover behind a low concrete wall. Then a man cries out in Arabic: \"Injured! Shireen, Shireen, oh man, Shireen! Ambulance!\"\n\nWhen the camera operator pans around the corner, Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh can be seen lying motionless, face down on the ground as another Palestinian reporter, Shatha Hanaysha, crouches down beside her, using a tree trunk for cover. Hanaysha reaches out and tries to rouse her as gunshots continue. There's no response. Both women are wearing helmets and blue protective vests marked \"Press.\"\n\nIn the moments that follow, a man in a white T-shirt makes several attempts to move Abu Akleh, but is forced back repeatedly by gunfire. Finally, after a few long minutes, he manages to drag her body from the street.\n\nThe shaky video, filmed by Al Jazeera cameraman Majdi Banura, captures the scene when Abu Akleh, a 51-year-old Palestinian-American was killed by a bullet to the head at around 6:30 a.m. on May 11. She had been standing with a group of journalists near the entrance of Jenin refugee camp, where they had come to cover an Israeli raid. While the footage does not show Abu Akleh being shot, eyewitnesses told CNN that they believe Israeli forces on the same street fired deliberately on the reporters in a targeted attack. All of the journalists were wearing protective blue vests that identified them as members of the news media. ​\n\n\"We stood in front of the Israeli military vehicles for about five to ten minutes before we made moves to ensure they saw us. And this is a habit of ours as journalists, we move as a group and we stand in front of them so they know we are journalists, and then we start moving,\" Hanaysha told CNN, describing their cautious approach toward the Israeli army convoy, before the gunfire began.\n\nWhen Abu Akleh was shot, Hanaysha said she was in shock. She couldn't understand what was happening. After Abu Akleh dropped to the ground, Hanaysha thought she might have stumbled. But when she looked down at the reporter she had idolized since childhood, it was clear she wasn't breathing. Blood was pooling under her head.\n\n\"As soon as she [Shireen] fell, I honestly wasn't comprehending that she [was shot] ... I was hearing the sound of bullets, but I wasn't comprehending that they were coming at us. Honestly, the whole time I wasn't understanding,\" she said.\n\n\"I thought they were shooting so we stayed back, I didn't think they were trying to kill us.\"\n\nOn the day of the shooting, Israeli military spokesperson Ran Kochav told Army Radio that Abu Akleh had been \"filming and working for a media outlet amidst armed Palestinians. They're armed with cameras, if you'll permit me to say so,\" according to The Times of Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military says it is not clear who fired the fatal shot. In a preliminary inquiry , the army said there was a possibility Abu Akleh was hit either by indiscriminate Palestinian gunfire, or by an Israeli sniper positioned about 200 meters (about 656 feet) away in an exchange of fire with Palestinian gunmen — though neither Israel nor anyone else has provided evidence showing armed Palestinians within a clear line of fire from Abu Akleh.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on May 19 that it had not yet decided whether to pursue a criminal investigation into Abu Akleh's death. On Monday, the Israeli military's top lawyer, Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said in a speech that under the military's policy, a criminal investigation is not automatically launched if a person is killed in the \"midst of an active combat zone,\" unless there is credible and immediate suspicion of a criminal offense. United States lawmakers, the United Nations and ​the international community ​have all called for an independent probe.\n\nBut an investigation by CNN offers new evidence — including two videos of the scene of the shooting — that there was no active combat, nor any Palestinian militants, near Abu Akleh in the moments leading up to her death. Videos obtained by CNN, corroborated by testimony from eight eyewitnesses, an audio forensic analyst and an explosive weapons expert, suggest that Abu Akleh was shot dead in a targeted attack by Israeli forces.\n\nAl Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.\n\nThe footage shows a calm scene before the reporters came under fire in the outskirts of Jenin refugee camp, near the main Awdeh roundabout. Hanaysha, four other journalists and three local residents said that it had been a normal morning in Jenin, home to about 345,000 people — 11,400 of whom live in the camp. Many were on their way to work or school, and the street was relatively quiet.\n\nThere was a frisson of excitement as the veteran journalist, a household name across the Arab world for her coverage of Israel and the Palestinian territories, arrived to report on the raid. About a dozen or so men, some dressed in sweats and flip-flops, had gathered to watch Abu Akleh and her colleagues at work. They were milling around chatting, some smoking cigarettes, others filming the scene on their phones.\n\nIn one 16-minute cellphone video shared with CNN, the man filming walks toward the spot where the journalists had gathered, zooming in on the Israeli armored vehicles parked in the distance, and says: \"Look at the snipers.\" Then, when a teenager peers tentatively up the street, he shouts: \"Don't kid around ... you think it's a joke? We don't want to die. We want to live.\"\n\nIsraeli raids on the Jenin refugee camp have become a regular occurrence since early April, in the wake of several attacks by Palestinians that left Israelis and foreigners dead. Some of the suspected assailants of those attacks were from Jenin, according to the Israeli military. Residents say the raids often lead to injuries and deaths. On Saturday, a 17-year-old Palestinian was killed and an 18-year-old was critically injured by Israeli fire during a raid, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.\n\nSalim Awad, the 27-year-old Jenin camp resident who filmed the 16-minute video, told CNN that there were no armed Palestinians or any clashes in the area, and he hadn't expected there to be gunfire, given the presence of journalists nearby.\n\n\"There was no conflict or confrontations at all. We were about 10 guys, give or take, walking around, laughing and joking with the journalists,\" he said. \"We were not afraid of anything. We didn't expect anything would happen, because when we saw journalists around, we thought it'd be a safe area.\"\n\nBut the situation changed rapidly. Awad said shooting broke out about seven minutes after he arrived at the scene. His video captures the moment that shots were fired at the four journalists — Abu Akleh, Hanaysha, another Palestinian journalist, Mujahid al-Saadi, and Al Jazeera producer Ali al-Samoudi, who was injured in the gunfire — as they walked toward the Israeli vehicles. In the footage, Abu Akleh can be seen turning away from the barrage. The footage shows a direct line of sight towards the Israeli convoy.\n\nPalestinian journalist Shatha Hanaysha pictured in the West Bank city of Ramallah on May 12, a day after she and Abu Akleh came under fire.\n\n\"We saw around four or five military vehicles on that street with rifles sticking out of them and one of them shot Shireen. We were standing right there, we saw it. When we tried to approach her, they shot at us. I tried to cross the street to help, but I couldn't,\" Awad said, adding that he saw that a bullet struck Abu Akleh in the gap between her helmet and protective vest, just by her ear.\n\nA 16-year-old, who was among the group of men and boys on the street, told CNN that there were \"no shots fired, no stone throwing, nothing,\" before Abu Akleh was shot. He said that the journalists had told them not to follow as they walked toward Israeli forces, so he stayed back. When the gunfire broke out, he said he ducked behind a car on the road, three meters away, where he watched the moment she was killed. The teenager shared a video with CNN, filmed at 6:36 a.m., just after the journalists left the scene for the hospital, which showed the five Israeli army vehicles driving slowly past the spot where Abu Akleh died. The convoy then turns left before leaving the camp via the roundabout.\n\nCNN reviewed a total of 11 videos showing the scene and the Israeli military convoy from different angles — before, during and after Abu Akleh was killed. Eyewitnesses who were filming when the journalist was shot were also in the line of fire and pulled back when the gunfire started, so do not capture the moment she is hit with the bullet. ​\n\nThe visual evidence reviewed by CNN includes a body camera video released by the Israeli military, which captures soldiers running through a narrow alleyway, holding M16 assault rifles, and variants, as they spill out onto the street where the armored vehicles are parked. An Israeli military source told CNN that both sides were firing M16 and M4 style assault rifles that day.\n\nIn the videos, five Israeli vehicles can be seen lined up in a row on the same road where Abu Akleh was killed, to the south. The vehicle closest to the journalists, emblazoned with a white number one, and the vehicle furthest away, marked with the number five, are both positioned perpendicular across the street. Toward the rear of the vehicles, directly above the numbers, is a narrow rectangular opening in the exterior of the vehicle.\n\nThe Israeli military referenced such an opening in a statement about its initial investigation into Abu Akleh's shooting, saying that the journalist may have been hit by an Israeli soldier shooting from a \"designated firing hole in an IDF vehicle using a telescopic scope,\" during an exchange of fire. Several eyewitnesses told CNN that they saw sniper rifles sticking out of the openings before the shooting began, but that it was not preceded by any other gunfire.\n\nJamal Huwail, a professor at the Arab American University in Jenin, who helped drag Abu Akleh's lifeless body from the road, said he believed the shots were coming from one of the Israeli vehicles, which he described as a \"new model which had an opening for snipers,\" because of the elevation and direction of the bullets.\n\n\"They were shooting directly at the journalists,\" Huwail said.\n\nHuwail, a former parliamentarian and member of the Palestinian Fatah Party in Jenin, first met Abu Akleh two decades ago, when Israel launched a major military operation in the camp, destroying more than 400 homes and displacing a quarter of its population. When he spoke with the journalist briefly that morning of May 11 at the Awdeh roundabout, she had showed him a video of one of their early interviews from 2002. The next time he saw her up close, she was dead.\n\nShireen Abu Akleh lies face down in the street, after having been shot in the head.\n\nIn videos of the dawn army raid on Jenin camp earlier in the morning, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants can be seen battling each other with M16 assault rifles and variants, according to Chris Cobb-Smith, an explosive weapons expert. That means both sides would have been shooting 5.56-millimeter bullets. To trace the bullet that killed Abu Akleh to the barrel of a specific gun would likely require a joint Israeli-Palestinian probe, since the Palestinians have the bullet that killed Abu Akleh, while CNN's investigation suggests the Israelis have the gun. None is immediately forthcoming. While Israel weighs whether to launch a criminal investigation, the Palestinian Authority has ruled out collaborating with the Israelis on any investigation.\n\nA senior Israeli security official flatly denied to CNN on May 18 that Israeli troops killed Abu Akleh intentionally. The official spoke under the condition of anonymity to discuss details about an investigation that remains formally open.\n\n\"In no way would the IDF ever target a civilian, especially a member of the press,\" the official told CNN.\n\n\"An IDF soldier would never fire an M16 on automatic. They shoot bullet by bullet,\" the official said, in contrast with ​Israel's assertion that Palestinian militants were firing \"recklessly and indiscriminately\" while its soldiers conducted the raid in Jenin.\n\nIn a statement emailed to CNN, the IDF said it was conducting an investigation into the killing of Abu Akleh. It \"calls on the Palestinian Authority to cooperate with a joint forensic examination with American representatives to conclusively determine the source of the tragic death.\"\n\nAnd added, \"assertions regarding the source of the fire that killed Ms. Abu Akleh must be carefully made and backed by hard evidence. This is what the IDF is striving to achieve.\"\n\nEven without access to the bullet that hit Abu Akleh, there are ways to determine who killed Abu Akleh by analyzing the type of gunfire, the sound of the shots and the marks left by the bullets at the scene.\n\nCobb-Smith, a security consultant and British army veteran, told CNN he believed Abu Akleh was killed in discrete shots — not a burst of automatic gunfire. To reach that conclusion, he looked at imagery obtained by CNN, which show markings the bullets left on the tree where Abu Akleh fell and Hanaysha was taking cover.\n\n\"The number of strike marks on the tree where Shireen was standing proves this wasn't a random shot, she was targeted,\" Cobb-Smith told CNN, adding that, in sharp contrast, the majority of gunfire from Palestinians captured on camera that day were \"random sprays.\"\n\nPalestinian journalist Mujahid al-Saadi, who was with Abu Akleh when she was killed, points to bullet marks on the tree in Jenin where she died.\n\nAs evidence, he pointed to two videos that showed Palestinian gunmen firing haphazardly down alleyways in different parts of Jenin. The videos were circulated by the office of Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and Israel's foreign ministry, with a voiceover in Arabic saying: \"They've hit one — they've hit a soldier. He's lying on the ground.\"\n\nBecause no Israeli soldiers were reported killed on May 11, Bennett's office said the video suggested that \"Palestinian terrorists were the ones who shot the journalist.\" CNN geolocated the videos shared by Bennett's office to the south of the camp, more than 300 meters, or 1,000 feet, away from Abu Akleh. The coordinates of the two locations, which were verified using Mapillary, a crowdsourced street imagery platform, and footage of the area filmed by Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, demonstrate that the shooting in the videos couldn't be the same volley of gunfire that hit Abu Akleh and her producer, Ali al-Samoudi. CNN was also unable to verify independently when the footage was filmed.\n\nAccording to the Israeli army's initial inquiry, at the time of Abu Akleh's death, an Israeli sniper was 200 meters away from her. CNN asked Robert Maher, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University, who specializes in forensic audio analysis, to assess the footage of Abu Akleh's shooting and estimate the distance between the gunman and the cameraman, taking into account the rifle being used by the Israeli forces.\n\nThe video that Maher analyzed captures two volleys of gunfire; eyewitnesses say Abu Akleh was hit in the second barrage, a series of seven sharp \"cracks.\" The first \"crack\" sound, the ballistic shockwave of the bullet, is followed approximately 309 milliseconds later by the relatively quiet \"bang\" of the muzzle blast, according to Maher. \"That would correspond to a distance of something between 177 and 197 meters,\" or 580 and 646 feet, he said in an email to CNN, which corresponds almost exactly with the Israeli sniper's position.\n\nAt 200 meters, Cobb-Smith said that there was \"no chance\" that random firing would result in three or four shots hitting in such a tight configuration. \"From the strike marks on the tree, it appears that the shots, one of which hit Shireen, came from down the street from the direction of the IDF troops. The relatively tight grouping of the rounds indicate Shireen was intentionally targeted with aimed shots and not the victim of random or stray fire,\" the firearms expert told CNN.\n\nA Palestinian artist paints a mural in Gaza City honoring Shireen Abu Akleh, and depicting Shatha Hanaysha crouching beside her after she was killed.\n\nThe tree is now referred to in Jenin as the \"journalist tree\" and has become a makeshift shrine to Abu Akleh, with photographs of the beloved reporter taped to the trunk and Palestinian kaffiyeh scarves draped from its branches.\n\nAwad, one of the Jenin residents who inadvertently captured Abu Akleh's killing on camera, said the first time he saw her in person was in 2002, when she was covering the Intifada, or uprising, in Jenin. \"She is of course loved by so many, but she has a very special memory in our camp specifically because of the work she has done here. The people here are very sad for her loss,\" he said.\n\nLast month, Abu Akleh celebrated her birthday in Jenin, when she was there to cover an Israeli miltary raid, her longtime colleague, cameraman Majdi Banura, recalled. Banura and Abu Akleh started at Al Jazeera on the same day 25 years ago, and spent much of their careers out in the field together.\n\nBanura is still reeling from having seen Abu Akleh, whom he had filmed countless times before, die in front of his own eyes. But when the gunfire broke out, he knew he had to continue rolling, saying that it was important to have a \"continuous record\" of her killing.\n\n\"To be honest, as I was filming, I had hoped that she will be alive, but I knew seeing her motionless she had been killed,\" Banura said.\n\n\"Her picture doesn't leave my life and memory, everything I say or do or touch, I see her.\"", "authors": ["Zeena Saifi", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Celine Alkhaldi", "Kareem Khadder", "Katie Polglase", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Abeer Salman", "Cnn Video Livvy Doherty", "Oscar Featherstone"], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/01/30/ecuador-state-of-emergency-american-retirees/72367066007/", "title": "Retiring in Ecuador offered stability. Now Americans weigh new unrest", "text": "At her house in Ecuador’s third-largest city, its colonial buildings framed by the Andes mountains, LaRahna Hughes’ phone buzzed repeatedly with messages from relatives and friends back in the United States.\n\nAre you OK? Are you getting out of the country?\n\nIt was early January, and Ecuador’s president declared that the nation had entered an “internal armed conflict,” and mobilized the military to fight drug gangs. The violence had reached a boiling point. There had been bombings. Prison guards were taken hostage. Masked gunmen took over a live TV broadcast.\n\nIn Ecuador – long regarded one of Latin America’s safest nations for Americans seeking to retire abroad – many people fielded similar calls of concern.\n\nBut Hughes reassured loved ones that the attacks hadn’t targeted Cuenca. It’s nearly a four-hour drive from the epicenter of the violence in Guayaquil, the port city that has emerged as a new trafficking hub for cocaine from neighboring Peru and Colombia.\n\n“I feel safe here,” she told USA TODAY. She views the violence as more localized within Ecuador for residents and retirees alike than news headlines tended to suggest.\n\nStill, growing crime in recent years hadn’t left all her fellow retirees untouched. Many adjusted to a nighttime curfew or adopted new safety measures. A few months earlier, one retiree who lives on the Pacific coast said she sped away from an attempted carjacking that left bullet holes in her vehicle.\n\nExperts and retirees said there were no signs of a major exodus. Most lived in areas where they felt safe enough to remain, even as some watch the ramped-up crackdown on gangs warily.\n\n“You're always asking that question,” said Michele DeWolfe, who lives in Olon, Ecuador, after moving from Colorado with her husband, a retired land surveyor, about 12 years ago. “Are you underreacting or overreacting? And at what point is it too much?”\n\nThe tumult in Ecuador has highlighted the uncertainties and difficult choices that can accompany any overseas crisis for the increasing number of Americans who choose to retire abroad.\n\nForeign countries often beckon with lower costs that equal a higher quality of life. And Ecuador for years been on the top 10 list of the retire-abroad publication International Living. Though the country shouldn’t be written off, said editor Jennifer Stevens, “the current situation, however, gives us pause on the safety front.”\n\nThe U.S. State Department gives Ecuador a Level 2 travel warning, to “Exercise Increased Caution.” Some areas within the country have a Level 3, or “Reconsider Travel” warning, and some have a Level 4, meaning “Do Not Travel.”\n\n“Is it the best time in history to head off to retire in Ecuador? Perhaps not,” Stevens said. “Perhaps best to wait a month or so and see how all this plays out.”\n\nWhy Americans retire abroad\n\nFrances Hogg Lochow, 69, spent decades as a legal aid attorney in Detroit before moving to a small town on New York’s Hudson River when her husband retired.\n\nThe couple looked for a place outside the U.S. where they could live more affordably without his income. She said they visited Mexico and Turkey and finally settled on Ecuador, a country the size of Nevada filled with jungles and beaches and mountains.\n\nThey sold their home in the U.S. and bought a house in Cuenca, a historic city perched at 8,200 feet. They were charmed by its climate, architecture and costs that allow the couple to live comfortably on Social Security alone with money left to travel.\n\n“It’s like 70 degrees every day. You can get an apartment for $600 a month. Doctor appointments are 30 bucks. Drugs are less expensive,” she said. “It’s a very healthy place to live. The people are really friendly. And it's a cultural center.”\n\nA couple can live comfortably on $2,000 a month and together pay about $95 a month for government health care, according to International Living.\n\nHughes, 51, was operating a farm and a farm-to-table cafe in South Carolina when in 2022 she decided to move to Ecuador, where she could have an early retirement that wouldn’t have been possible in the United States.\n\n“The economics of Cuenca let me retire,” she said.\n\nEdward Lindquist, originally from California, now publishes the English-language Cuenca Expat Magazine. He says his publication estimates as many as 20,000 native English speakers live in Ecuador. The biggest chunk are U.S. expatriates and retirees.\n\nStevens said it’s a function of the growing interest in retiring abroad.\n\nMore:Think you'll work past 70? Good luck. Why most of us retire earlier.\n\nAs of December 2022, 450,156 retired workers were receiving Social Security payments abroad, more than double the 219,504 in 1999, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nThose figures don’t include retirees who have their checks deposited in the U.S. but live abroad, or who don’t claim Social Security.\n\nDriven by rising housing and health care costs and inadequate retirement savings, the trend was further buoyed by the growth of remote work that allows some retirees or spouses to earn supplemental income, and online groups offering tips and information – making overseas retirement increasingly mainstream, Stevens said.\n\n“It used to be like, ‘Oh my God, my crazy grandfather went to Costa Rica,’” she said. In addition, because people are living longer, many are “eager to figure out ways that they can have an adventure in that second chapter.”\n\nThose clusters of new Americans can boost the local economy and in some instances draw criticism from locals for pushing up housing prices.\n\nHer publication’s 2024 Annual Global Retirement Index, a ranking based on cost, lifestyle and safety, puts Costa Rica at the top, followed by Portugal, Mexico, Panama, Spain, Ecuador, Greece, Malaysia, France and Colombia.\n\nWhile predicting instability is difficult, whether it be a coup in Thailand or cartel violence in Mexico, often such events do not directly affect retirees. But some events can push residents to relocate or leave temporarily, Stevens said.\n\nSome left Nicaragua to see how things played out after President Daniel Ortega’s growing crackdown on opponents, which began in 2018 and went on to suppress clergy, media and civil society. In recent years, Stevens said, many have returned.\n\nShe suggests people consider countries that have a long history of stability and of policies designed to attract expats, such as Costa Rica; as well as to join expat Facebook groups to hear from people on the ground and follow news while understanding that the “drama in reporting from afar tends to be applied to a whole country, which paints neither a fair nor accurate picture of what's happening on the ground in specific communities.”\n\nMore:Nicaragua lost press freedom. Other countries are too\n\nEcuador shaken by drug-fueled violence\n\nMore than a decade after retiring, Janet Meinke, 58, and her 79-year-old husband, David, live on the beach in Punta Blanca, Ecuador – a country they chose in part because of its reputation as one of the region’s safest.\n\nBut that ranking has changed in recent years as drug gangs began using the country as a shipment point between some of South America’s largest cocaine producers. Crime and murder rates have soared. Killings, kidnappings, robberies and other crimes became part of Ecuadorians’ everyday life, The Associated Press reported last year.\n\nIn the fall, gangs assassinated a presidential candidate, Fernando Villavicencio, and set off car bombs in front of government buildings.\n\nEarlier this month, Meinke came out of her weekly Tuesday movie to find the mall’s shops closing and people hustling home.\n\n“What’s going on?” she asked.\n\nPresident Daniel Noboa, part of a family that had made a fortune in the banana trade, declared a national state of emergency, a measure that lets authorities suspend people’s rights and mobilize the military in places like prisons, saying the county had entered an “internal armed conflict,” the AP reported. An 11 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew was enacted.\n\nStarting on Jan. 8, criminal groups shot civilians, looted stores, and set off car bombs and other explosions in the capital Quito and Guayaquil, according to the International Crisis Group. It followed the escape from prison of two key criminal leaders, including the head of one of Ecuador’s most powerful drug gangs, Los Choneros.\n\nMasked gunmen stormed a Guayaquil TV studio during a live news broadcast, and rioting inmates overran a number of the country’s prisons, holding more than 150 prison guards hostage for almost a week, the group said.\n\nThe president ordered national security forces to neutralize 22 armed groups classified as “terrorists.” By Jan. 25, the government had detained 3,611 people.\n\nDeWolfe, the former Coloradoan, said the spike came amid already rising crime, including widespread extortion.\n\n“Two towns down, their school bus was held for ransom. A couple of days ago, two of the women who run the orphanage here were shot at and robbed,” DeWolfe said. “People are just tired of it.”\n\nLast fall, Atlanta native Bobbi de Winter told the The Wall Street Journal she and her husband intended to sell their house on the Pacific Ocean near Manta after nearby killings and a large cocaine stash for trafficking found at a beach close to them. Her husband once had to swerve his car to avoid a man who had been shot, she told the newspaper.\n\n“I had to let go of my dream,” she said.\n\nOne retiree − who asked that her name not be used in connection to her experience in Ecuador so she would not alarm American relatives − told USA TODAY that several months ago she was driving a woman considering moving to the country to view housing options near the coast when a car braked in front of them. Two men got out and started shooting at them.\n\nShe turned the car around and sped off, unhurt but shaken from the possible carjacking attempt. She feels safe enough to remain in the country but said the risk shouldn’t be dismissed. “It’s definitely riskier,” she said.\n\nBy Jan. 16, the U.S. Embassy said in a statement that Ecuadorian media reported relative calm in major cities and no major attacks as security forces continued their operations, with all hostages having been released.\n\nMaite Duran, an Ecuadorian who runs Gringo Visas, a business helping American retirees move to Ecuador, says that only a few of her clients have delayed moves and many are continuing to consider the county. Those in Ecuador continue to renew their visas, she said.\n\n“I believe that things had to get worse before they get better,\" she said. \"And that's in the stage that we're in right now.”\n\nDespite uncertainties, many retirees vow to stay\n\nIn Cuenca, where the biggest population of retirees live, Hughes had noticed a military presence in town but says most residents are “going about our daily life.”\n\nResidents are walking dogs and going to the market, restaurants and jobs. There’s a curfew, but most retirees said they’re usually in bed by 11 p.m. anyway.\n\nHogg Lochow, who was recently making earrings for a pet shelter as part of her volunteer work, said she’s still encouraging her family to come to visit.\n\nAt the same time, many are using greater caution, avoiding dangerous parts of the country, choosing restaurants with guards, and avoiding public buses and being out after dark.\n\nIn Salinas, Steven McKay, 46, a retired juvenile justice worker from Newport News, Virginia, who moved to Ecuador two years ago with his wife to stretch their pension, said that in expat groups most are vowing to remain.\n\nFor those aspiring to retire there? “It will definitely discourage people,” he said.\n\nLindquist said the long-term economic consequences are unknown. In Cuenca, he said, U.S. retirees contribute millions to the local economy through rentals, restaurants and other services.\n\n“I just hope the country didn't get too big of a black eye,” he said.\n\nMany are watching how Ecuador’s crackdown plays out and how closely it may resemble one in another Latin American country. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s 2022 crackdown on street gangs was controversial, sparking allegations of human rights violations amid mass arrests, but popular because it significantly reduced crime.\n\nMcKay and others said they hope Ecuador's efforts will curtail the violence, if not banish drug gangs.\n\n“They’re never going be able to get rid of it completely. But they can at least get it to a manageable place, kind of like Colombia did. I do have faith they’re going to solve it,” he said.\n\nHughes is sticking around – now rooted in a country and community whose future feels connected to her own.\n\n“Even though we're immigrants, this is our home for many of us. So much of expat sentiment has been, we're good. We're not leaving,” she said. “And if they throw an earthquake in tomorrow, we're still not leaving.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/07/05/france-unrest-why-is-the-country-rioting/70378340007/", "title": "The fatal police shooting of a teenager rocked France. Was it a ...", "text": "Was this France's \"George Floyd moment\"? Some in the country described it that way.\n\nFrench police have come under scrutiny after a 17-year-old boy of Algerian and Moroccan descent identified as Nahel M. was shot and killed last week by a police officer as he attempted to flee a traffic stop in Nanterre, a Paris suburb. The incident led to riots across French cities, with hundreds of cars and buildings set on fire and looting, mostly by minors. Schools, city halls and police stations were attacked.\n\nOver the weekend, rioters fired rockets at the suburban home of the mayor of one area of Paris, injuring his wife and children. Tens of thousands of police officers were deployed to try to restore calm. A heavy police response appeared to make an impact. As did an appeal on French TV made by the slain teenager's grandmother, who urged rioters not to \"smash windows, attack schools and buses. Stop. It is mothers who take those buses.\"\n\nBy Tuesday, days of nationwide unrest appeared to ease and French President Emmanuel Macron, who since coming to power in 2017 has weathered a succession of protests and street unrest ranging from the so-called yellow vest movement for economic justice to anger over pension reform, was due to meet Tuesday with the mayors of over 220 towns and cities that have been concerned by incidents and damages in recent days.\n\nAn age-old (and old age) problem:Amid French strikes, is retirement better in America?\n\nHowever, the United Nations has urged France's authorities to see the riots as a \"moment for the country to seriously address the deep issues of racism and racial discrimination in law enforcement.\"\n\nFrance's police violence under the microscope\n\nIn fact, some media have referred to Nahel's killing as reminiscent of Floyd's murder by U.S. police.\n\nFloyd, who died in May in 2020 in Minneapolis while in police custody, sparked demonstrations and unrest in scores of American cities. The episode led to a questioning about the role and scope of police in American life.\n\nHis killing unleashed a sweeping reckoning about everything from statues to sports team s names, from whether Black Americans would be safer moving overseas to louder, renewed calls for reparations.\n\n“This act was committed by a law enforcement officer, was filmed and broadcast almost live and involved an emblematic representative of a socially discriminated category,” Le Monde newspaper wrote in an editorial.\n\n'I'm leaving, I'm not coming back:Fed up with racism, Black Americans head overseas\n\nReparations bill gets new attention:Could other nations provide a blueprint?\n\nFollowing Nahel's death, there have been calls by French activists for the country to address long-running allegations that its police engage in systematic racial profiling and are poorly trained to deal with the social and economic tensions affecting racial minorities in France's so-called banlieues − the often bleak and poverty-stricken working class neighborhoods that ring French cities, where they disproportionately live.\n\nNanterre's prosecutor's office said that after an initial investigation, the police officer who fired the gun had been given a preliminary charge of \"voluntary homicide\" and remanded in custody.\n\nA recent survey by the France-based Defenders of Rights organization found that 80% of young French men perceived to be Black or of Arab descent reported being stopped at least once by police in the last five years. This compares to about 16% of the population as a whole that reported being stopped over this time.\n\n\"What remains constant is a refusal by political powers to act on one of the factors of this explosive cocktail: the police,\" historian Cedric Mas said on Twitter as the riots unfolded across France. \"Riots in the U.S. and Britain in the 60s and 80s have led to deep reforms of the police. In France? Nothing for the past 40 years.\"\n\nMade in the U.S.A. but rehabilitated in France\n\nOne person who may be uniquely qualified to reflect on the riots that convulsed France is Melvin McNair, a 74-year-old Black American who has lived in exile there for decades after he hijacked a plane to flee U.S. racism and police violence. USA TODAY has previously written in detail about McNair's complex story.\n\n‘I am at peace with what I did':In 1972, Melvin McNair helped hijack a plane to join Black Panthers in Algeria.\n\nAfter serving time in prison in France, McNair retrained as a social worker and devoted his life to mentoring troubled French youth. The kids he mentored are similar to the ones who have been participating in this latest bout of unrest in France. France's Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on Monday that the average age of the 3,200 people arrested was just 17.\n\nSome as young as 12 years old have been setting fires in the streets of France.\n\nMcNair, who is retired, is still wanted by the U.S. Department of Justice for his role in the hijacking of Delta Flight 841 in 1972. But in his social worker job, he came into frequent contact with both France's policing system and the country's disadvantaged kids from the banlieues. He is known in France as \"Mr. Baseball\" because he often used the sport as way to get through to kids who had little respect for authority or government institutions.\n\nIn an interview, he said there was no question the country's police needed reform. He said police needed more skills and training to know how to respond to youths in underprivileged communities who have \"lost all hope\" and often flirt, to various degrees, with various kinds of criminality. However, McNair was reluctant to describe French police, as many French commentators and experts have in recent days, as institutionally or systemically racist.\n\n\"There are many police officers in France who are racist, who have extreme right-wing views, who are opposed to immigration and don't want more Muslims here. But it's not everywhere,\" said McNair.\n\n\"There's police that are frustrated, too. They want to find solutions,\" he added.\n\nMcNair was also reluctant to draw direct comparisons between racially tinged police violence in the U.S. and France, though he views U.S. police violence against minorities as far more entrenched and problematic.\n\nHe ascribed some of this reluctance to his view that comparing countries with different histories, behaviors and social contexts just isn't that illuminating.\n\nCollecting race-based statistics is illegal in France as part of its so-called color-blind laws, but it's estimated that out of a population of 68 million, France has about 6 million residents of Arab descent and 4 million Black people.\n\nNahel's was the third fatal shooting by French police during a traffic stop this year, according to French media. In the U.S., last year, 86 people were killed during traffic stops, according to an analysis by the BBC that used data from Mapping Police Violence, a public database that tracks the work of law enforcement. Black people are almost three times as likely to be killed by police than white people in the U.S., according to the database.\n\nStill, McNair said the situation with France's police \"was not getting better,\" and that there needed to be a wholesale revamping of the overall the balance between \"education, prevention and repression.\"\n\nHe said it \"boils down to haves and have nots.\"\n\nThis is cold comfort to Nahel's family.\n\n\"I don't blame the police,\" his mother Mounia M., told France 5 television.\n\n\"I blame the man who took my son's life ....

However, it inevitably raises the question: if China tries to take Taiwan, are the United States and its allies able to stop it?\n\nAnd the alarming answer is: Quite possibly not. Analysts say China has more troops, more missiles and more ships than Taiwan or its possible supporters, like the US or Japan, could bring to a fight. That means that if China is absolutely determined to take the island it probably can.\n\nBut there’s a caveat; while China could likely prevail, any victory would come at an extremely bloody price for both Beijing and its adversaries.\n\nMany analysts say an invasion of Taiwan would be more dangerous and complex than the Allied D-Day landings in France in World War II. US government documents put the number of killed, injured and missing from both sides during the almost three-month-long Normandy campaign at almost half a million troops.\n\nAnd the civilian carnage could be far, far worse.\n\nTaiwan’s population of 24 million people is packed into dense urban areas like the capital Taipei, with an average of 9,575 people per square kilometer. Compare that to Mariupol, Ukraine – devastated in the war with Russia – and with an average of 2,690 people per square kilometer.\n\nDespite its numerical advantages in sea-, air- and land-based forces in the region, China has Achilles heels in each arena of war that would force Beijing to think long and hard about whether an invasion is worth the overwhelming human cost.\n\nHere are some scenarios of how a Chinese invasion might play out:\n\nThe naval war\n\nChina has the world’s largest navy, with around 360 combat vessels – bigger than the US’ fleet of just under 300 ships.\n\nBeijing also has the world’s most-advanced merchant fleet, a large coast guard and, experts say, a maritime militia – fishing boats unofficially aligned with the military – giving it access to hundreds of additional vessels that could be used to transport the hundreds of thousands of troops that analysts say China would need for an amphibious invasion.\n\nAnd those troops would need massive amounts of supplies.\n\n“For Beijing to have reasonable prospects of victory, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) would have to move thousands of tanks, artillery guns, armored personnel vehicles, and rocket launchers across with the troops. Mountains of equipment and lakes of fuel would have to cross with them,” Ian Easton, a senior director at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote in The Diplomat last year.\n\nGetting a force of that size across the 110 miles (177 kilometers) of the Taiwan Strait would be a long, dangerous mission during which those vessels carrying the troops and equipment would be sitting ducks.\n\n“The thought about China invading Taiwan, that’s a massacre for the Chinese navy,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThat’s because Taiwan has been stocking up on cheap and effective land-based anti-ship missiles, similar to the Neptunes Ukraine used to sink the Russian cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea in April.\n\n“Taiwan is mass-producing these things. And they’re small, it’s not like (China) can take them all out,” O’Brien said.\n\n“What’s cheap is a surface-to-ship missile, what’s expensive is a ship.”\n\nThe Chinese guided-missile destroyer Changsha returns to a port in Sanya City, China, in March 2017. Zeng Tao/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nStill, China could – given its numerical advantage – simply decide the losses were worth it, pointed out Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine captain and now an analyst at the Center for a New American Security.\n\n“There’s gonna be hundreds if not thousands of (Chinese) vessels there to soak up those (Taiwanese) missiles,” Shugart said.\n\nMissiles aside, China would face massive logistical hurdles in landing enough soldiers. Conventional military wisdom holds that an attacking force should outnumber defenders 3 to 1.\n\n“With a potential defending force of 450,000 Taiwanese today … China would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of more than 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of ships,” Howard Ullman, a former US Navy officer and professor at the US Naval War College, wrote in a February essay for the Atlantic Council.\n\nHe estimated such an operation would take weeks and that despite China’s maritime strength, it “simply lacks the military capability and capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the foreseeable future.”\n\nAircraft carrier killers\n\nSome of the problems that would face China’s navy in Taiwan would also face any US naval force sent to defend the island.\n\nThe US Navy sees its aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, bristling with F-35 and F/A-18 jets, as its spear in the Pacific and would have a numerical advantage in this area. The US has 11 carriers in total, compared to China’s two. However, only about half are combat ready at any one time and even these might be vulnerable.\n\nO’Brien and others point out that the People’s Liberation Army has more than 2,000 conventionally armed missiles, many of which it has developed with the US Navy’s prized aircraft carriers in mind.\n\nOf particular concern would be China’s DF-26 and DF-21D – touted by Beijing’s state-run Global Times tabloid in 2020 as “aircraft carrier killers” and the “world’s first ballistic missiles capable of targeting large and medium-sized vessels.”\n\nAs O’Brien puts it, “The US better be careful thinking about, in any kind of war environment, sending carrier battle groups close to China … If you’re fighting a state-to-state war, you’re going to stay far away from shore.”\n\nOthers are more confident in the US carriers.\n\nRear Adm. Jeffery Anderson, the commander of the US Navy’s Carrier Strike Group Three centered on the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, recently told CNN his ships are more than ready to deal with the kind of missiles that sank the Moskva.\n\n“One thing I do know about our US ships is they’re extremely survivable. Not only are they lethal, but they are extremely survivable,” he said.\n\nA Chinese air force fighter jet takes off during training exercises in 2017.

They learned very carefully from what we did in Desert Storm and Kosovo.”\n\nBut even in the air China would face significant difficulties.\n\nA guided-missile-armed J-20 stealth fighter jet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force performs at Airshow China 2018. Shu ying/Imagine China/Reuters\n\nRussia’s failure to quickly seize control of the skies in Ukraine initially dumbfounded many analysts. Some put the failure down to the cheap antiaircraft missiles Western militaries have supplied to Kyiv.\n\nTaiwan has deals with the United States to supply it with Stinger antiaircraft missiles and Patriot missile defense batteries. And it also has been investing heavily in its own missile production facilities over the past three years in a project, when completed this summer, will see its missile production capabilities triple, according to a Janes report in March.\n\nOn the other hand, China would have an advantage over the US due to its closeness to Taiwan.\n\nA recent war game run by the Center for a New American Security concluded that an aerial conflict between the US and China would likely end in stalemate.\n\nCommenting on the result to Air Force Magazine, Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, US Air Force deputy chief of staff for strategy, integration and requirements, said that while the US was used to dominating the skies some factors weren’t in its favor.\n\nChina had “invested in modern aircraft and weapons to fight us,” he noted, and US forces would also face the “tyranny of distance” – most of the US air power used in the war game operated out of the Philippines, about 500 miles (800 kilometers) away.\n\nThe war game simulated Chinese forces beginning their campaign by trying to take out the nearest US bases in places like Guam and Japan.\n\nHinote likened that move to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, saying China would be motivated by “many of the same reasons.”\n\n“The attack is designed to give Chinese forces the time they need to invade and present the world with a fait accompli,” he told the magazine.\n\nChina has a growing arsenal of short-, medium- and intermediate range ballistic missiles that can reach these far-flung targets.\n\nAs of 2020, the PLA had at least 425 missile launchers capable of hitting those US bases, according to the China Power project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nA Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldier fires an anti-tank rocket during a live-fire military exercise in Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China in 2019. Reuters\n\nThe ground war\n\nEven in a scenario where China was willing to take these risks and managed to get a significant amount of troops ashore, its forces would then face another uphill battle.\n\nTaiwan has about 150,000 troops and 2.5 million reservists – and its entire national defense strategy is based on countering a Chinese invasion.\n\nLike their counterparts in Ukraine the Taiwanese would have the advantage of home turf, knowing the ground and being highly motivated to defend it.\n\nFirst, the PLA would need to find a decent landing spot – ideally close to both the mainland and a strategic city such as Taipei with nearby port and airport facilities. Experts have identified just 14 beaches that would fit the bill and Taiwan is well aware of which ones those are. Its engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers to protect them.\n\nTaiwan’s troops would also be relatively fresh compared to their Chinese counterparts, who would be drained from the journey over and would still need to push through the island’s western mud flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, toward Taipei.\n\nChinese troops could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely.\n\nAnother problem for Chinese troops would be their lack of battlefield experience. The last time the PLA was in active combat was in 1979, when China fought a brief border war with Vietnam.\n\nSoldiers of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) fire a mortar during a live-fire military exercise in Anhui province, China May 22, 2021. cnsphoto/Reuters\n\nIn that effort, China “really got a bloody nose, it was not very successful operation,” said Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n“So China’s military today is not battle tested, and it could suffer great losses, if it indeed attacked Taiwan,” Glaser said.\n\nOthers pointed out that even battle-tested troops could struggle against a well-motivated defensive force – noting that the Russian military was bogged down in Ukraine despite its recent fighting experience in Syria and Georgia.\n\nStill, as with the other scenarios, it is not only Chinese forces that might be handicapped by a lack of experience. Taiwan’s troops have also not been tested, and depending on the scenario, there are holes in even the US’ experience. As Shugart put it: “There is not a single US naval officer who has sunk another ship in combat.”\n\nWhat are the chances China attacks?\n\nGlaser, the German Marshall Fund analyst, thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is unlikely.\n\n“I think that the PLA lacks full confidence that it can seize and control Taiwan. The PLA itself talks about some of the deficiencies in its capability,” she said.\n\n“And obviously, the war in Ukraine highlights some of the challenges that China could face; it is certainly much harder to launch a war 100 miles across a body of water than it is across land borders, (such as those) between Russia and Ukraine,” she said.\n\nShe noted that the strong Ukrainian resistance may be giving Taiwan’s people reason to fight for their land.\n\n“Given how Ukraine has really demonstrated a very high morale and willingness to defend its freedoms … I think that this is likely to change the calculus of not only military leaders in China, but hopefully also of (Chinese leader) Xi Jinping personally,” she said.\n\nO’Brien, the University of St. Andrews professor, wrote in The Spectator this year that any war over Taiwan would lead to devastating losses on all sides, something that should make their leaders tread carefully before committing troops.\n\n“If the Ukrainian war teaches us anything, it is that war is almost always a rash choice. Don’t underestimate your opponent, and don’t assume your systems will all work that well.”\n\nA Chinese amy tank takes part in military drills in 2018. Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAny other option?\n\nOf course, the PLA has options other than a full-blown invasion.\n\nThese include taking outlying Taiwanese islands or imposing a quarantine on the main island, Robert Blackwill and Philip Zelikow wrote last year in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Residents of Taipei on edge about China after Russia invades Ukraine 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPossible PLA targets could be Taiping Island, Taiwan’s most far-flung outpost in the South China Sea; the tiny Pratas Island, a small outpost 170 nautical miles (320 kilometers) southeast of Hong Kong; Kinmen and Matsu islands, tiny territories just a few miles off mainland China’s coast; or Penghu in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nWhile a PLA victory of any of the four is almost assured, it could come at the cost of galvanizing support for Taiwan in the rest of the world – much as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has united the West against it.\n\nBlackwill and Zelikow said the quarantine option might be more effective.\n\n“In a quarantine scenario, the Chinese government would effectively take control of the air and sea borders of Taiwan,” they wrote. “The Chinese government would run effectively a clearance operation offshore or in the air to screen incoming ships and aircraft. The screeners could then wave along what they regarded as innocent traffic.”\n\nAnything regarded as belligerent, such as US military aid for Taiwan, could be blocked or confiscated as a violation of Chinese sovereignty, they say. Meanwhile, China could allow the Taiwan government to function as normal except for foreign affairs.\n\nThis option would have an advantage in China’s eyes: the ball would be in the US’ court as to whether to use force to end the quarantine. Then it would be the US that would have to consider whether to risk a war that could cost countless lives.", "authors": ["Brad Lendon Ivan Watson", "Brad Lendon", "Ivan Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/24/europe/ukraine-russia-attack-timeline-intl/index.html", "title": "Timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine: What we know so far ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia launched an invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, sending troops into the ex-Soviet nation from three fronts and firing missiles on several locations near the capital, Kyiv, in a broad attack that has drawn deep condemnation from world leaders.\n\nAt dawn, troops and armor crossed into eastern Ukraine from the Russian border, as well as from Belarus in the north and from Russia-annexed Crimea to the south.\n\nHere’s how it unfolded.\n\nStirrings in Crimea\n\n3:59 a.m. (8:59 p.m. ET, Wednesday): Livestream video from a border crossing station between Crimea – which was annexed by Russia in 2014 – and parts of southern Ukraine viewed by CNN showed what may have been the first signs of the Russian invasion.\n\nIn the video, a guard at the Kalanchak crossing is seen reacting to something heading towards the Ukrainian border.

Yaccarino released a statement in response to a warning from the European Commission that X could face penalties if it did not take action against \"illegal content and disinformation\" since Hamas' attack on Israel.\n\n\"There is no place on X for terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups and we continue to remove such accounts in real time,\" Yaccarino's statement said.\n\nUS brings 'massive' firepower to region as deterrent\n\nAustin plans to meet with military and civilian leaders to signal the depth of the U.S. commitment to Israel and to assess its requests for security assistance, according to a senior Defense official.\n\nIsrael has received its first shipment of weaponry this week, according to the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. Israel has sought missile interceptors for its Iron Dome air defense system, precision-guided munitions and artillery shells. Shipments from Pentagon supplies are expected to be continuous, the official said.\n\nMeantime, the U.S. military continued to build a “massive amount” of firepower in the Middle East this week as a warning to adversaries not to attack Israel, the official said. The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and the ships in its strike group are operating in the eastern Mediterranean with intelligence and long-range strike capabilities, the official said. In addition, a squadron of A-10 ground-attack aircraft arrived in the region Thursday.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nAcross US, families wait for news about loved ones in Israel\n\nGillian Kaye awoke Saturday to a nightmare: Her stepson was missing.\n\nSagui Dekel-Chen, 35, was last seen by his family early that morning in Israel when Hamas destroyed his home as part of an unprecedented attack on Israeli towns near the border with Gaza. He lived at kibbutz Nir Oz with his wife, two daughters, and 400 others until it was decimated by the militant group, leaving only around 160 people alive and accounted for.\n\n“This is so unfathomable,” said Kaye, a resident of Sarasota, Florida who was traveling when she learned of the assault.\n\nDekel-Chen, who holds dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship, is among an estimated 130 missing Israelis following the attacks.\n\nAccording to his family, he sent his wife and children to the house’s bomb shelter while he confronted the attackers upstairs. Kaye and her family are urging Americans to write to their representatives in Congress to bolster search and rescue efforts. With no information about her stepson's whereabouts, Kaye said spreading the word is the only course of action.\n\n“We do what needs to get done,” Kaye said. “And what needs to get done is to do everything possible to get Sagui home.”\n\n− Heather Bushman, Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nFBI provides expertise in finding hostages\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department has been working with families of missing Americans to locate their loved ones, including those taken hostage. The department offered Israel assistance through the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group, Operational Security Division and Laboratory Division.\n\n“These highly trained hostage rescue specialists and other experts stand ready to advise their Israeli counterparts to help locate and bring home missing U.S. citizens,” said Garland, whose ancestors fled religious persecution in Eastern Europe.\n\n“And, as always, we remain focused on the threat terrorism poses to our country,” Garland added.\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nA summary of Israel-Hamas war\n\nHamas has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for numerous suicide bombings and other deadly attacks since the militant group was formed in 1987. On Saturday, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.\n\nHamas says Saturday's attack was partially a response to Israeli police activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The Jerusalem mosque is located on a holy site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. But Hamas leaders also blame unrelenting Israeli crackdowns and a 16-year blockade in Gaza and the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers illegal − and Israel's tight military control of Gaza.\n\nAlso, the attack came amid thawing relations between some Arab nations and Israel, the blood enemy of Hamas. The attack and Israel's harsh response could slow or derail those diplomatic overtures.\n\nBy land, sea, air and online:How Hamas used the internet to terrorize Israel\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nHow large is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian enclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho controls the Gaza Strip?\n\nHamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.\n\nHow did the hostilities between Israel and Palestinians start?\n\nThe current war is a culmination of decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territory, which has been occupied since Israel was founded in 1948 and where Hamas rules the Gaza Strip. Jewish people and Muslims have some of their holiest sites in Jerusalem. Before Israel’s founding, the land was known as the Palestinian mandate, officially ruled by Great Britain. Prompted by the Holocaust, the UN United Nations adopted a resolution in 1947 that aimed to divide the Palestinian mandate into two states, Arab and Jewish.\n\nWar quickly broke out between Israel and its Arab neighbors, leading to Israeli expansion three-quarters of Palestinian mandate territory. Over half the Palestinian Arab population fled or was expelled, according to the U.N. Several conflicts between Israel and Arab states in the region followed over the next decades, and peace efforts that improved relations with other nations did not solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has since imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians there. These are all territories that had been sought by Palestinians for their future independent state. But Hamas rejects proposals for a two-state solution and believes in the eradication of Israel altogether through violent means.\n\nPalestinian uprisings, or intifadas, brought military clashes and protests against Israeli occupation and led to crackdowns by Israel’s military forces, and many were killed and injured on both sides.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/12"}]}

They were forced to let her skate and Syers earned second place behind Ulrich Salchow.\n\nSoon after, officials banned female athletes, claiming their skirts were too long and the judges couldn’t see their footwork. Syers quickly found a solution: a skirt that ended mid-calf.\n\nShe went on to win the British Nationals in 1903 and 1904 and the women’s World Championships in 1906 and 1907. Figure skating made its debut in the 1908 London Olympics and Syers won gold in the women’s singles and bronze in the mixed pairs, where she skated alongside her husband, making her the first woman to take home two medals in just one Olympic Games.\n\n1988: Modesty and “The Katarina Rule”\n\nAt the 1988 Winter Olympics hosted in Calgary, German figure skater Katerina Witt wore a costume that a male Canadian coach, Peter Dunfield, claimed was “bizarre and indecent … The real provocative side is the back. But in the front, you’ve even got cleavage.”\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Dunfield also suggested that Witt might be trying to win over the judges with a revealing costume.\n\nWitt defended her choice, saying the costume was appropriate for her music, which was from the Broadway show “Jerry’s Girls.”\n\nThe controversy caused the ISU to adopt a new dress code: all women were required to wear skirts that covered their hips and bottom, as well as cover their midriff.\n\nThis strict rule was relaxed in 2003, but the ISU still requires all clothing to be “modest, dignified and appropriate for athletic competition.”\n\nKatarina Witt at the Calgary 1988 Winter Olympics.

Kerrigan’s rival Tonya Harding’s ex-husband Jeff Gillooly was involved in the plot.\n\nGillooly was sentenced to two years in prison for his role in the attack and Harding received three years of probation and was fined $100,000 for conspiring to hinder prosecution.\n\nKerrigan was still selected for the Olympic team despite her injury and went on to earn a silver medal at the 1994 Olympic in Lillehammer.\n\nHarding maintained her innocence throughout the games, but on March 16, just a few weeks after closing ceremonies, she pleaded guilty to hindering the prosecution.\n\nA few months later the US Figure Skating Association revoked her gold medal at the 1994 national championships and banned her from the ice for life.\n\nSubsequently the scandal was immortalized in the 2017 drama, “I, Tonya” starring Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney.\n\nAsked by The Boston Globe if she was bothered by Hollywood’s portrayal of Harding, Kerrigan said “It’s not really part of my life.”\n\n“As you say, I was the victim,” she said. “Like, that’s my role in this whole thing. That’s it.”\n\nUS figure skater Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan take a break during training in 1994. Andreas Altwein/dpa/AP\n\n1998: Surya Bonaly backflips and judges flip out\n\nThe day before Surya Bonaly was set to perform her free skate at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, she pulled a muscle in her right leg, though knowing that these Winter Games were her last, the French star was committed to competing.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Radiolab, Bonaly recounted her performance, saying by the end of the program the pain in her leg was unbearable and she couldn’t perform the two triples she had left in her routine.\n\nBut Bonaly “had a special thing in her back pocket” to wow the crowd, performing an illegal backflip landing on just her left blade.\n\nIt didn’t go down well with judges, who handed Bonaly a score that dropped her from sixth to 11th place.\n\nIn recent years, fans have questioned if race might have played a part in her career, though both Bonaly and former judges deny any bias.\n\n“We are all humans, we all have different styles. And we can create a different personality of character on ice,” Bonaly told CNN’s Amy Woodyatt on Friday.\n\n“You have to find your own style, and you have to save it to give it … When you watch 20 skaters doing the same thing over and over, I mean, what’s about it?\n\n“Skating is called free skating, so supposed to be free, but it’s not really free, entirely free because there’s rules to follow and if you don’t, you’re in big trouble.\n\nBonaly told CNN that her routines were sometimes penalized by judges.\n\n“I remember back in the days I used to like jumps and combos, and if I will do one extra one jump after a combo because I felt like “oh, triple, triple and a double. You actually got in trouble because you did too much of that,” she said.\n\n“I think that judges should be more open minded, to be able to receive and see things coming from different places – a different way of what has been brought on the ice.”\n\nSurya Bonaly performs a backflip in her free skate routine. Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images\n\n1998: Judging scandal exposed\n\nAt the 1998 Olympics, Jean Senft – a Canadian skating judge – surreptitiously recorded a conversation with a fellow Ukrainian judge, Yuri Balkov, where they openly discussed how they would place ice dancers before they had even competed.\n\nSenft had previously approached officials with her concerns about corruption among her colleagues but was told she needed proof.\n\nAfter playing the tape at an ISU hearing, Balkov was banned for one year. Soon after, Senft also suffered a six-month suspension for allegedly favoring a Canadian pair, though she claims the suspension was retaliation against her.\n\n“The athletes are not competing on a fair playing field. This isn’t sport. Somebody had to get proof,” Senft told CBC News in 2000.\n\nAfter the scandal, small reforms were made to judging requirements and deductions.\n\n2002: “Skategate”\n\nAfter Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier produced a flawless free skate at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, the gold medal was awarded to the Russian duo: Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, who had enough technical errors in their performance to call the result into question.\n\nWhen the judges met to defend the results, French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne claimed that the French Skating Federation president, Didier Gailhauguet, had directed her to rank the Russian pair first.\n\nSoon evidence emerged of a quid pro quo between Russian and French votes in the pairs figure skating and ice dancing events.\n\nLe Gougne and Gailhauguet were suspended for three years and there was an overhaul of the judging system in figure skating, with strict protocols eliminating the room for subjective judgment.\n\n“Meddling,” a four-part series was released last month on Peacock chronicling the scandal.\n\nElena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia celebrate gold at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. Robert Laberge/Getty Images\n\n2010: Russian duo’s performance sparks cultural backlash\n\nReigning world champions in ice dancing, the Russian duo Oksana Domnina and Maxim Shabalin performed a dance inspired by Aboriginal culture at both the Russian and European Championships.\n\nThe pair skated to music that was largely chants and didgeridoos while wearing red loin cloths, body suits with white markings and make up that appeared to be brown face.\n\nTheir performance sparked outrage amongst Aboriginal activists in Australia who claimed the routine was culturally exploitative and inauthentic.\n\n“Accurate or not, you have to be sensitive to the people you are representing,” Jef Billings, a renowned designer of skating costumes, told The New York Times in 2010.\n\n“At the turn of the last century, minstrel shows were acceptable. Times have changed.”\n\nThe Russian duo’s coach, Natalia Linichuk ,was shocked at the outrage, denying any wrongdoing or ill-intent and claiming that the dance was not based on any one Aboriginal culture.\n\nBev Manton, chairwoman of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council, expressed her anger in the Sydney Morning Herald: “From an Aboriginal perspective, this performance is offensive. It was clearly not meant to mock Aboriginal culture, but that does not make it acceptable to Aboriginal people.”\n\n2014: US Skating Federation team selection questioned\n\nMirai Nagasu took home the bronze medal at the 2014 US national championships but was passed over for the Sochi Olympic team in favor of fourth place finisher, Ashley Wagner.\n\nThe US Skating Federation had only ignored the national championship results four times until then, in all cases because of injuries that prevented the selected athletes from competing.\n\nThe federation defended its choice, citing Wagner’s higher global rankings and Nagasu’s inconsistent record over the past year.\n\nHowever, Jeff Yang of the Wall Street Journal found it hard to ignore the aesthetics of the choice, calling Wagner a “golden girl” with her blonde hair and blue eyes.\n\nHis claims had a ring of truth for some fans, especially when looking at previous treatment of Asian American skaters; including one media headline claiming, “American beats out Kwan.” Kwan being Michelle Kwan of the US team, who was born in Torrance, California.\n\nFour years later Nagasu won a bronze medal at the Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n\nNagasu also landed a triple axel – one of the most challenging jumps in figure skating. In doing so she accomplished a feat that made her the first female American figure skater to nail the triple axel at the Olympics.\n\nAt the end of her routine, Nagasu triumphantly threw her hands in the air and a bright, exuberant smile spread across her face.\n\nMirai Nagasu (L) and Ashley Wagner (R) on the podium together. Jared Wickerham/Getty Images\n\n2022: Kamila Valieva’s positive drugs test\n\nIn a sample taken in December, prior to the Olympics, 15-year-old Valieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine, a drug commonly used to treat angina and which experts say can enhance endurance by increasing blood flow to the heart.\n\nHowever, the result was only analyzed and reported to Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) in February. Valieva was then suspended the day after she led the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) to gold in the figure skating team event on February 7 when she became the first woman to land a quadruple jump in a Winter Olympic Games.\n\nRUSADA lifted her suspension the next day following a hearing. Subsequently the World Anti-Doping Agency, the International Olympic Committee and the ISU filed an appeal against the lifting of the ban.\n\nHowever, the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared Valieva for competition, saying she would suffer “irreparable harm” if not allowed to compete, citing the “exceptional circumstances” of her being a minor.\n\nValieva finished in fourth place in the women’s individual figure skating event on Thursday, leaving the ice in tears after falling and faltering during jumps in her routine, despite having previously been the favorite to take gold.\n\nBefore being cleared to take part in the women’s individual figure skating competition, Valieva was suspended by the RUSADA on February 8, although the body lifted her suspension the next day following a hearing.", "authors": ["Kikue Higuchi"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/12/27/gypsy-rose-blanchard-release-case-timeline/72038395007/", "title": "Gypsy Rose, Mommy Dead and Dearest subject, released from prison", "text": "Warning: A screenshot from a Facebook page contains a derogatory term.\n\nAnother chapter is coming to an end in perhaps one of the most infamous true-crime cases in the past 15 years.\n\nThe case of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" and Gypsy Rose Blanchard has gone down in American history as one of the most recognized cases of suspected Munchausen by Proxy, a psychological condition that causes a caregiver to engage in attention-seeking behavior by making the person or people under their care ill or making people believe they are ill.\n\nAfter serving 85% of her sentence, Gypsy, now 32, was released from prison on Thursday. On Friday, she posted her first social media post since her release, with the caption 'First selfie of freedom.'\n\nNow known as \"Factitious disorder imposed on another,\" it is suspected this disorder is what caused Dee Dee to lie to friends, family, charities, doctors and even Gypsy herself, convincing everyone her daughter was severely ill and much younger than she was.\n\nDee Dee went as far as to convince Gypsy she was unable to walk, breathe or eat normally, requiring a wheelchair, feeding tube and oxygen. It was later proven Gypsy was capable of walking, eating and breathing unassisted.\n\nDee Dee's medical abuse of Gypsy began when she was just 8 years old, at which time she said her daughter had been diagnosed with leukemia and muscular dystrophy and needed a wheelchair and feeding tube, among other medical accommodations.\n\nHer propensity for reporting her daughter as being sick started even earlier, when Dee Dee insisted Gypsy experienced sleep apnea as an infant soon after birth. Dee Dee also later insisted Gypsy had seizures, asthma, and hearing and visual issues and had doctors prescribe medications and perform surgeries for these conditions.\n\nGypsy and her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, later devised a plan to escape Dee Dee, resulting in her death via stabbing. Following the murder, Gypsy was sentenced to 10 years and has since become a well-known figure, granting interviews about her life and crimes and becoming the subject of documentaries and television shows like \"Mommy Dead and Dearest\" and \"The Act.\"\n\nAfter years of twists and turns in the case, the public has a rapt eye on Blanchard to see what happens once she is freed from incarceration. Need a recap of the complex situation? Brush up on the details with our timeline.\n\nGypsy Rose:Gypsy Rose Blanchard shares selfie on Instagram after release from prison\n\nMarch 2008: Dee Dee and Gypsy move to Springfield, Missouri\n\nWhen the Blanchards arrived in Missouri in September 2005, Dee Dee told neighbors their apartment in Louisiana and Gypsy's medical records had been destroyed in Hurricane Katrina. With no reason not to believe the seemingly devoted mother and her sick daughter (who had a shaved head and missing teeth that were pulled after medication caused them to rot), the local Habitat for Humanity built a pink, accessible home for them in Springfield.\n\nBefore the pink home's completion in March 2008, the pair lived in temporary housing in Aurora, Missouri. The community rallied around the family in other ways, hosting charity events, giving donations and sponsoring Gypsy for trips and medical care.\n\nFebruary 2011: Gypsy tries to escape\n\nWhile multiple doctors expressed concerns about Gypsy's health between 2007 and 2009, with one even noting that he suspected Dee Dee was suffering from Munchausen by Proxy, she remained under the care of her mother.\n\nIn February of 2011, Gypsy attempted her first and seemingly only escape from her mother's home after meeting a 35-year-old man at a science fiction convention and speaking with him online. She followed the man to his hotel room where she was discovered by Dee Dee. The then 19-year-old Gypsy had been told by her mother she was only 15 years old, a claim Dee Dee repeated to the man before bringing her daughter home.\n\nAccording to Gypsy, Dee Dee punished her severely after this attempt at running away, smashing her phone and computer, chaining her to a bed and placing bells on all the doors so she couldn't escape.\n\nGypsy Rose Blanchard book:Here's how Gypsy Rose Blanchard's new book, 'Released,' is being promoted on social media\n\nOctober 2012: Gypsy and Nicholas Godejohn start chatting online\n\nGypsy often snuck onto a Christian dating site when Dee Dee wasn't watching and it was there that she first spoke to Nicholas Godejohn. Godejohn, who lived in Big Bend, Wisconsin and had been diagnosed with autism, took a liking to Gypsy.\n\nThe two began a multi-year relationship maintained through video calls and online messages, all of which were kept secret from the controlling Dee Dee.\n\nOctober 2014: Gypsy confides in a neighbor\n\nGypsy Rose Blanchard release:Gypsy Blanchard's release from prison looms as Nicholas Godejohn fights for new trial\n\nGypsy became friendly with neighbor Aleah Woodmanse, whom she would chat with on a secret Facebook account. In October of 2014, she confided in Woodmanse about her online relationship, saying she was in love with Godejohn and the two were planning out a future together.\n\nShe told Woodmanse the couple planned to run away or elope and had been engaged in a romantic and sexually explicit relationship through their digital communications. Incorrectly believing Gypsy was still a minor, this alarmed Woodmanse.\n\nMarch 2015: Blanchard and Godejohn meet in person\n\nDevising a plan to win Dee Dee over and secure her approval of the relationship, Gypsy and Godejohn agreed to meet in person for the first time in March 2015.\n\nGodejohn made his way to a movie theater in Springfield, Missouri where Dee Dee and Gypsy were planning to see Disney’s \"Cinderella\" movie. The two met at the theater with Gypsy dressed as Cinderella and Godejohn as Prince Charming.\n\nWhile the couple were able to sneak to the bathroom and have sex for the first time, the meeting did not end well, as Dee Dee did not like Godejohgn upon their introduction.\n\nGypsy later said that her mother's punishment after this incident led her to begin pondering escape from Dee Dee via desperate measures. Godejohn and Gypsy began plotting this together.\n\nJune 9, 2015: Murder of Dee Dee Blanchard\n\nOn June 9, 2015, Godejohn again traveled to Missouri to meet up with Gypsy. This time, he checked into a motel room and waited for the cue from Gypsy indicating Dee Dee was asleep.\n\nThat night, he went to the Blanchards’ house and was given a knife, gloves and duct tape by Gypsy, who later told ABC 20/20 news “I honestly thought he would end up not doing it.\"\n\nWhile she hid in the bathroom with hands over her ears, Godejohn stabbed the unsuspecting Dee Dee 17 times, killing her. After this, the couple had sex in Gypsy's bed before fleeing to Godejohn’s motel room via a cab. They then took a bus back to Big Bend after mailing the knife used in the murder from Springfield to Wisconsin.\n\nJune 14, 2015: Dee Dee found dead thanks to Facebook post\n\nAfter a few days of 48-year-old Dee Dee's body remaining undiscovered in her home, Gypsy and Godejohn posted two updates to Dee Dee's Facebook page to draw attention to the crime.\n\nOne read, “That (expletive) is dead!” and the second said “I (expletive) SLASHED THAT FAT PIG AND RAPED HER SWEET INNOCENT DAUGHTER…HER SCREAM WAS SOOOO (expletive) LOUD LOL.”\n\nThe alarming messages quickly caught the attention of friends and neighbors, who called the police. That evening, authorities discovered Dee Dee's body and Gypsy's abandoned wheelchair in the home, prompting speculation she had been injured or kidnapped.\n\nConcerned, Woodmanse told police about Gypsy's relationship with Godejohn, allowing police to find his social media account and track his location via his IP address.\n\nJune 15, 2015: Gypsy and Nicholas are caught\n\nFollowing the information garnered from the Facebook posts, police tracked the couple to Godejohn's home, which they raided on June 15, 2015.\n\nGodejohn surrendered and was taken into custody, and Gypsy was found unharmed and later placed under arrest as well. She initially denied involvement but later confessed after Godejohn told police they had planned the crime together. They were extradited to Missouri, where friends were initially happy to hear Gypsy was alive and unharmed.\n\nThe couple's bond was set at $1 million and the Springfield sheriff later said in a press conference, “Things are not always as they appear,” a precursor to the revelations that Gypsy could not only walk but had never been sick in the first place, shocking all those who knew them.\n\nJuly 5, 2016: Gypsy pleads guilty to murder\n\nGypsy Blanchard agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder as part of a plea agreement on July 5, 2016. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison and garnered some sympathy from the defense, prosecutors and the public alike after the extent of the suffering her mother had inflicted on her was revealed.\n\nGypsy has since said in interviews that she didn't hate her mother, but simply wanted to escape her tyranny. She later took the stand in Godejohn's 2018 trial, reveling more lurid details of her mother's abuse.\n\nNovember 2018: Godejohn found guilty\n\nWhile Godejohn's defense argued he had a diminished capacity and believed he was saving Gypsy by murdering her mother, a jury found him guilty in November of 2018.\n\nFebruary 22, 2019: Godejohn sentenced to life\n\nGodejohn was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in February of 2019. His team has since begun fighting for a retrial.\n\nJuly 2022: Gypsy gets married in prison\n\nGypsy's case proved controversial, with some people believing she didn't deserve jail time in the first place. However, she famously told 20/20 that she felt freer in prison than with her mother.\n\n“The prison that I was living in before, with my mom, it’s, like, I couldn’t walk. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t have friends. I couldn’t go outside, you know, and play with friends or anything,” Gypsy told 20/20. “Over here, I feel like I’m freer in prison than with living with my mom. Because now, I’m allowed to … just live like a normal woman.”\n\nGypsy reportedly picked back up dating in prison, eventually marrying Ryan Scott Anderson in July 2022.\n\nSeptember 2023: Gypsy granted parole\n\nAfter serving 85% of her 10-year sentence, Gypsy, 32, was officially granted parole in September of 2023. Her release date was set as Dec. 28, 2023.\n\nDecember 28, 2023: Gypsy released from prison\n\nGypsy Rose Blanchard is set to be released from prison on Thursday, December 28, at which point she plans to see a Kansas City Chiefs game with her husband and release her e-book “Released: Conversations on the Eve of Freedom” which is set to publish Jan. 9, 2024.\n\nIt is not yet known where she plans to go after her release.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columns/2023/12/19/georgia-football-florida-state-football-politicians-pounce-on-college-football-playoff-controversy/71931674007/", "title": "Politicians pounce on College Football Playoff controversy", "text": "The “Florida Man” meme has become a cultural signifier for bizarre goofiness.

But did he ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nWes Moore, a leading Democratic candidate for governor of Maryland, first became famous for his 2010 bestselling memoir, “The Other Wes Moore,” an inspirational story of two boys with the same name and ties to the rough streets of Baltimore.\n\nWhile the author became a Rhodes scholar, an Army captain and a White House fellow, the other Wes Moore was convicted of killing a police officer in 2000 and is serving a life sentence in prison.\n\nThe book is required reading in many schools in Maryland and across the country, and it fixed Moore in the minds of many as a proud son of Baltimore. It also helped launch his successful career in media and philanthropy. Moore has since written more books, hosted his own TV show on the Oprah Winfrey Network and spent four years as CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, New York City’s largest anti-poverty non-profit.\n\nNow Moore is seen as a potential up-and-comer in Democratic politics. He’s one of the leading primary candidates in a state where the party’s nominee would be heavily favored to win the governor’s race – and, potentially, to rise as a national political figure.\n\nBut as he’s entered politics, Moore’s story has come in for a closer examination.\n\nWhile his book lays out the basic details of his life factually, a less accurate version of his Baltimore roots has taken on a life of its own, fueled by more than a decade of assertions by other people in TV interviews that he is a Baltimore native, born and raised in the city.\n\nAt times, Moore has fed that impression himself. For example, he has repeatedly said that he originally wanted to call his first book “Baltimore Sons.” Other times, he made ambiguous statements about his childhood connections to Baltimore or, in high-profile settings, sat by quietly as others repeated erroneous details.\n\nNow Moore’s story has become the subject of conversation in the race. His campaign last week sent a letter to the Maryland state prosecutor and the state board of elections, alleging that “false and disparaging information” had been spread about Moore in “an orchestrated attempt” to disparage him. The letter goes on to allege that “a rival campaign may be responsible for this smear campaign.”\n\nThe same week, the campaign launched a website, FactsMD.com about Moore’s childhood and connections to Baltimore.\n\nIn checking out those facts, CNN reviewed dozens of Moore’s public appearances and writings of the past 12 years, as well as other records. What that effort reveals is a complicated story of race, identity and the responsibility of public figures to control their own narrative.\n\nAccording to Moore’s website, he wasn’t born in Baltimore but in Washington, DC. As the book lays out, he spent his early childhood in the suburb of Takoma Park, Maryland, some 30 miles from Baltimore. After his father’s sudden death when Moore was 3 years old, he then moved with his family to the Bronx, which at the time was beset by crime, drugs and poverty – much as Baltimore was in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nLate in the summer before he turned 16, Moore’s mother moved to the middle-class enclave of Pasadena, in Maryland’s Anne Arundel County. But by then Moore was away at military school in Pennsylvania. Moore’s campaign says that when he would visit his mother as a kid, he would often go roller-skating and get his hair cut in Baltimore.\n\nIt wasn’t until he was a 20-year-old undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University that Moore first lived in Baltimore. Even then, as a student at Johns Hopkins, the world he inhabited while attending a prestigious private university was nothing like the notorious inner-city housing developments of Baltimore where the 2010 book says the other Wes Moore grew up.\n\nWes Moore's 2010 memoir was a bestseller and helped launch him into high-profile literary and media circles. One World\n\nThough Moore’s book never explicitly asserts he was born in Baltimore, it does allude prominently to his strong association with the city. The book opens with the line, “This is the story of two boys living in Baltimore with similar histories and an identical name.” Later in the same introduction, Moore writes, “We’d grown up at the same time, on the same streets, with the same name.”\n\nMore than one interviewer referred to Moore as born in Baltimore, including Winfrey. A spokesperson for Winfrey told CNN the producers of their 2016 interview had relied on information in the published memoir in crafting her introduction.\n\nNow that the campaign is underway, those closest to Moore describe a genuine connection to Baltimore, where he has lived for about the last decade.\n\n“I’ve never seen anyone connect to a place more than Wes did when he fell in love with Baltimore,” his mother, Joy Moore, said in a statement provided to CNN by the Moore campaign. “My job was in Baltimore City, and I couldn’t keep him out of the city when he was home from military school as a teenager.”\n\n“Baltimore is where Wes came of age,” she said, “and he has built and fostered a community in Baltimore for over 25 years since he was 15 years old.”\n\nIn response to questions from CNN, the Moore campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview and directed CNN instead to answers provided on the FactsMD.com website.\n\n“This attempt to put Wes Moore’s childhood trauma under a microscope neatly aligns with blatant dog whistles and other mischaracterizations of Wes’ childhood that have been circulating for months and that are now the subject of a criminal investigation by the State Prosecutor’s Office,” a Moore campaign spokesperson said in a written statement to CNN.\n\nContacted by CNN, the state prosecutor declined to comment.\n\nAsked about the Moore campaign’s complaint letter, Maryland Board of Elections director of candidacy Jared DeMarinis said, “We review every complaint, and this is no different from any other complaint we receive in the course of an election.”\n\nThe story morphs over time\n\nThe question of where Moore grew up has been complicated by more than a decade of public promotion and hype that has surrounded his up-from-the-streets story.\n\nWithin weeks of the 2010 publication of Moore’s first book, he was on The New York Times nonfiction bestseller list and on a high-profile media book tour that took him through, among others, “The View,” “PBS NewsHour,” “Morning Joe” and “The Colbert Report.”\n\nMoore didn’t object when others asserted that he and the other Wes Moore were from the same part of Baltimore. In a May 2010 PBS interview, Moore walked under umbrellas in the rain with Judy Woodruff, telling her, “These were areas that we knew. These were blocks that we knew.”\n\nThey passed the intersection of Kennedy Avenue and The Alameda, which is about 25 miles from Moore’s mother’s house in Pasadena, and 1.8 miles from the Hopkins campus.\n\nWoodruff introduced him as “Baltimore native Wes Moore,” speaking from the studio to introduce the piece before cutting to footage of them walking down the street together in Baltimore.\n\nAsked about the segment, Woodruff told CNN she’d found the copy of “The Other Wes Moore” that she’d read ahead of the interview and had cited lines like that first sentence, “This is the story of two boys from Baltimore with similar histories and an identical name,” and a headline that is included from The Baltimore Sun, “Local Graduate Named Rhodes Scholar.” (Though not identified as such in the book, the article had run on the front page of the paper’s Anne Arundel County section in December 2000.)\n\nMany of Moore’s interviews featured the same anecdote of how he had first learned about the other Wes Moore: It was his junior year of college and he was studying abroad in South Africa when his mother called with surprising news. “‘There are wanted posters all over your neighborhood for Wes Moore, for the murder of a police officer,’” he said she had told him.\n\n“You were haunted by the fact that a guy with your name, grew up in the same neighborhood, a couple of blocks away, a lot of similarities, but you end up working in the White House, and he ends up in jail,” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough responded, as Moore listened contentedly, making no correction.\n\nA month and a half later, on his old Comedy Central show, Stephen Colbert stopped Moore at one point in his storytelling.\n\n“This is your neighborhood back home?” Colbert asked.\n\n“Yeah. This is the same neighborhood,” Moore said.\n\n“Where was this neighborhood?” Colbert asked.\n\n“It was in Baltimore,” Moore said.\n\nThe Moore campaign declined to answer CNN’s questions about television appearances.\n\nMoore’s origin story drives his rise to celebrity\n\nThe runaway success of “The Other Wes Moore” launched Moore into an elite circuit of influence and paid appearances. He was a regular panelist on “Morning Joe” and HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher.” He was invited to give commencement speeches and was popular on the paid speaker circuit off a bio that introduced him as “raised in Baltimore.”\n\nWes Moore appears on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, March 18, 2012. William B. Plowman/NBC/Getty Images\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Moore was invited to the White House several times, and he received an Obama presidential appointment to a community service board.\n\nBy 2016, Moore was walking arm in arm with Winfrey in a video for her “Super Soul Sunday” series, talking about his second book, “The Work.” Winfrey introduces the segment with a series of voice-overs.\n\n“Born in Baltimore in 1978,” she starts.\n\n“He discovered there was another young man, also named Wes Moore, who grew up just blocks away from his own childhood home,” she says a few seconds later.\n\nThe next year Moore got a high-profile job in philanthropy. In April 2017, he was named CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, a non-profit that raises hundreds of millions from New York’s investment bankers and hedge funders.\n\nRobin Hood sees itself as essentially New York’s community foundation, with all of its programming locally based. People familiar with the search process told CNN that Moore’s roots in the Bronx had helped land him the job. Indeed, the Robin Hood news release announcing his hiring notes that “he spent much of his childhood in the Bronx.” There’s no mention of being from Baltimore at all.\n\nSoon, in the official bios Moore was sending around as CEO for appearances from Princeton’s department of African American studies to the BlackRock investment firm, that shifted again: “Wes grew up in Baltimore and the Bronx,” it reads.\n\nThe brand becomes a campaign\n\nWhen news started spreading in the winter of 2021 that Moore was considering a run for governor, a February 2021 Baltimore Sun headline read, “Baltimore-born author and educator Wes Moore considering running for Maryland governor.”\n\nMoore left the Robin Hood Foundation last spring and announced his campaign for governor a few weeks later.\n\nAs he prepared to launch a political career, there are signs that efforts were made to correct the record. Last June, three days before he entered the race, Moore’s personal website was edited, with changes removing a reference to “back home in Baltimore.” That same day, a Wikipedia user changed Moore’s listed birthplace from Baltimore to Takoma Park, citing the change back to his personal website.\n\nIn his campaign launch video, a young actor plays Moore as a boy, at an age when he was living in the Bronx. Though the street featured in the shoot is not identified, the scene immediately cuts to the Baltimore skyline.\n\nIn the months since announcing his candidacy, Moore has gained traction despite competing in a crowded primary field.\n\nWes Moore opens his campaign office in Prince George's County on March 05, 2022 in Lanham, Maryland. Brian Stukes/Getty Images\n\nOn April 2, Moore overwhelmingly won the backing of the state teachers’ union, a major endorsement in the race. In his speech to members, he talked about how many classes he’d been to with students who had read his book and connected with his story. The Baltimore public school system placed an order for 4,600 copies of “The Other Wes Moore” in 2020 alone.\n\nAmong the defenses the Moore campaign includes on its FactsMD website is that Moore asked his publisher, Random House, for a correction ahead of the book’s publication and again as he was preparing his campaign. “Some versions of the book synopsis of THE OTHER WES MOORE inaccurately identified Wes Moore as born in Baltimore. Flagged by the author at the time, a correction to the copy was missed upon its initial publication,” a statement attributed to Random House on the website states. “When notified again of the error early last year, Random House corrected all subsequent print runs of the book.”\n\nThe publisher confirmed that statement but did not answer follow-up questions from CNN about it.\n\nIn his second book, “The Work,” published in 2015, Moore also referred to spending nights in Baltimore as a child. “As a kid in Baltimore and the Bronx during the homicidal height of the so-called crack era, I would lie in bed on some nights and listen to the pop of low-caliber guns somewhere beyond my window,” he wrote.\n\nThe Moore campaign declined to discuss specific questions about this memory or to make Moore available to talk about it.\n\nJust a few months before launching his campaign, in a video chat with members of his old college back at Oxford in January 2021, Moore sat quietly as two different professors introduced him by mentioning his Baltimore roots, one by saying, “born in Baltimore, well-known by anyone who’s seen ‘The Wire.’ “\n\nBaltimore as a backdrop\n\nFor some in Baltimore, it’s OK for suburban residents to claim the city as home.\n\nCarl Stokes, a former Baltimore city council member, said he had met Moore two decades ago after a college professor introduced them. They met for lunch at the Hopkins Club on campus, Stokes said, and Moore talked about his connections to the wider area back then.\n\n“It’s close enough that I don’t think it’s that unusual to say they’re from the next big place,” said Stokes, who is now supporting state comptroller Peter Franchot in the governor’s race.\n\n“If you dig deeper, they’ll say, ‘Actually, I was out from the suburbs,’ ” he said.\n\nBut other residents see it differently.\n\nHassan Giordano, a Baltimore native and Democratic political media consultant who is not backing a candidate in the governor’s race, said he’s known Moore for a decade and that he’s impressed with Moore’s other qualifications. But he called the account of Baltimore roots “really disingenuous.”\n\nAsked by CNN if he’d consider the time Moore cites during his teen summers as “coming of age” in Baltimore, Giordano said, “Hell, no.”\n\n“That’s not growing up in Baltimore, that’s visiting Baltimore. That’s being here for the summer,” Giordano told CNN.\n\n“I think that most people from Baltimore would tell you that it gets under their skin to hear someone say that they’re from Baltimore, even if they’re from Baltimore County or the Baltimore area,” Giordano said.\n\nMunir Bahar, a longtime community activist in Baltimore who told CNN he doesn’t have a favored candidate in the governor’s race, said that when he had first met Moore after the 2015 riots following the death of Freddie Gray, he had thought the candidate was from the city.\n\nWhen told by CNN that Moore’s campaign describes him as being raised in Baltimore based on his summers visiting from Pasadena, Bahar said, “That’s definitely not being raised in Baltimore. That’s not the Baltimore experience,” adding, “As a young Black boy growing up in Baltimore, you can’t use that as a platform unless it’s really authentic, especially in the ’90s and 2000s. Everybody wants to use Baltimore as a backdrop.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/25/kenneth-eugene-smith-execution-follows-many-capital-punishment-botches/72328311007/", "title": "Alabama executes killer with nitrogen gas in controversial first-of-its ...", "text": "The state of Alabama executed convicted killer Kenneth Eugene Smith on Thursday in a first-of-its-kind execution using nitrogen gas to asphyxiate the inmate.\n\nSmith, 58, was the first person in the U.S. – and likely the world – to be put to death by nitrogen hypoxia after a drawn-out legal battle over Alabama’s methods of execution. He was pronounced dead at 8:25 p.m. at a southern Alabama prison after breathing nitrogen gas through a full-face mask, according to officials.\n\nThe execution took about 22 minutes. Smith appeared to convulse and shake vigorously for about four minutes after the nitrogen gas apparently began flowing through his mask. It was another two to three minutes before he appeared to lose consciousness, all while gasping for air to the extent that the gurney shook several times.\n\nIn a final statement, Smith said: \"Tonight, Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward.\" He thanked those who supported him through this process and his previous execution attempt.\n\nSmith smiled through the mask and made the sign language sign for \"I love you\" toward the witness room. \"Thank you for supporting me. I love all of you,\" he added.\n\nSmith's final appeal was rejected Thursday evening by majority justices in the U.S. Supreme Court, opening the door for a controversial execution method that some experts have criticized as experimental and inhumane.\n\nIn a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the new method of capital punishment “entirely novel,” noting that the state had already failed in its first attempt to execute Smith by lethal injection in 2022.\n\n“Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its ‘guinea pig’ to test a method of execution never attempted before,” Sotomayor wrote. “The world is watching.”\n\nAfter the Supreme Court's ruling, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said she would not exercise her clemency powers and directed the commissioner of the state Department of Corrections to proceed with the execution.\n\n“The execution was lawfully carried out by nitrogen hypoxia, the method previously requested by Mr. Smith as an alternative to lethal injection,\" Ivey said in a statement. \"At long last, Mr. Smith got what he asked for, and this case can finally be put to rest.\"\n\nKilling a prisoner with nitrogen is the latest attempt to effectively and humanely administer capital punishment following an array of botched executions, experts say. Some methods are now considered too gory; others became public spectacles – recent attempts have often simply not worked or inflicted needless suffering.\n\nExperts say the repeated problems often happen because the people and companies who are most qualified to plan a pain-free method of capital punishment won’t do it, due to ethical concerns.\n\nNitrogen hypoxia is the latest capital punishment method of six that the U.S. has introduced, each of the previous methods bringing its own disastrous results, Deborah Denno, a Fordham University law professor and the founding director of the Neuroscience and Law Center at Fordham Law School told USA TODAY.\n\nSmith, who was one of two people to receive the death penalty for the 1988 murder-for-hire plot of a preacher’s wife, chose nitrogen gas for his execution after a previous attempt at killing him by lethal injection failed. In November 2022, Smith suffered for hours as executioners tried to find a vein to administer the lethal drugs before ultimately calling it off.\n\n“How many execution methods do we need in this country?” Denno said.\n\nExperts say concern over Smith’s execution stems from a history of botched attempts, similarities between nitrogen hypoxia’s adoption and previous techniques, and the ethics of trying out a new method for the first time – in essence, experimentation on a human being.\n\nUS keeps changing execution methods\n\nThe death penalty has been part of society in every historical time period, and indeed, there are documented executions in this country dating back to colonial times, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Firing squad and hanging were the earliest methods in the U.S., modeled after established methods in Britain and throughout Europe.\n\nThe six methods the U.S. has officially adopted are hanging, firing squad, electrocution, lethal gas, lethal injection and nitrogen hypoxia.\n\nLethal injection has been the primary method on the books in the 27 states with the death penalty still in place since the 1970s when it was introduced; the first lethal injection was the 1982 execution of Charles Brooks in Texas. After executioners struggled to find a good vein due to Brooks’ drug use, it took him seven minutes to die, and witnesses said he exhibited signs of pain throughout, Denno said.\n\nDespite the challenges with the first lethal injection execution, the method soon was preferred by states and the federal government. In some states, prisoners are able to choose between select methods approved by the state, and in some others, an alternate method can be used if lethal injection is unavailable or rendered unconstitutional.\n\nOver the past few hundred years, the U.S. has adopted the various methods, done away with them, and brought some back as options again in a seemingly endless search for something better.\n\nPart of the reason for the changes over time is due to the growing “discomfort some people were starting to feel with more graphic forms of execution,” said Robin Maher, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nThat included “some pretty graphic executions, where it was clear that the person was experiencing a lot of distress and a lot of pain and suffering when they ultimately died,” Maher said.\n\nStates have continuously sought a more humane, less messy option.\n\nBut Denno argues the reasoning for the myriad execution methods doesn’t stop there. She said states are interested in preserving the institution of the death penalty; any challenge on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment made to any particular type of execution could threaten the penalty as a whole.\n\n“For the most part, most legislators and jurors and even the public want a humane method of execution,” she said.\n\nMedical professionals' involvement in capital punishment is an ethical and legal mess\n\nA major issue with lethal injections, and with other methods tried in the U.S., is that the process is largely concealed from the public. From the introduction and the development of different protocols, to the carrying out of the actual executions, how much medical professionals are involved is unclear.\n\nAccording to Elisabeth Armstrong, a bioethics professor at Colorado Christian University, the overwhelming consensus by the medical community is that doctors are ethically prohibited from being involved in capital punishment. Still, some medical professionals believe that if executions are going to happen, it’s their duty to help reduce as much suffering as possible. She said most states that use the death penalty shield the involvement of doctors or pharmaceutical companies, protect doctors from retribution for their involvement – and some might compel doctors to participate.\n\nMeanwhile, the American Medical Association says “as a member of a profession dedicated to preserving life when there is hope of doing so, a physician must not participate in a legally authorized execution.”\n\nEven so, Armstrong said doctors and other medical professionals might be tasked with assessing a prisoner’s mental competence, examining and monitoring vital signs of a prisoner, certifying their death or even procuring their organs.\n\nEthical issues involved in executions abound, Armstrong said, because of doctors’ duty to avoid unnecessary harm and the violation of the autonomy of people being executed. One of the chief concerns for Armstrong is that “methods that have not been tried pull physicians into experimenting on people.”\n\n“It violates basically every vital ethical principle we have, and every commitment we make as medical professionals to provide hope and healing,” she said.\n\nDoctors’ and pharmaceutical companies’ refusal to go near executions results in underqualified and minimally trained staff being left in charge of carrying out an execution, Denno said.\n\nEthical concerns, botched executions plague capital punishment in US\n\nAnother reason for the seemingly endless search for different ways to put prisoners to death is the high rate of snags experienced during the process, and the outright failures. These botched executions raise concerns about whether the methods are humane, and bring scrutiny to prisons overseeing them.\n\nIn New York, Denno said, hangings became public spectacles, in one case in 1827 drawing such a crowd that a viewing stand collapsed, killing two onlookers. The public’s fascination became troublesome to lawmakers, who eventually took executions out of the public eye, setting the groundwork for a current process shrouded in secrecy.\n\nThe first electrocution in 1890 was botched when executioners struggled to regulate the electric chair, and caused William Kemmler’s hair and skin to burn, an effect repeated in executions as late as the 1990s, Denno wrote. Lethal gas, too, was adopted and eventually fell out of favor because of its torturous effects on prisoners and the likeness to the Holocaust.\n\nExecutions had also been doled out so randomly and unfairly – including with racial bias – that the U.S. Supreme Court put a temporary halt to the practice in 1972 until states could introduce new procedures.\n\nThen came lethal injection a few years later.\n\n“Lethal injection held out the promise that people who were being executed would just be very gently put to sleep and then executed without experiencing any of that graphic pain and suffering as we saw with other methods,” Maher said.\n\nThat didn’t end up always being the case. A three-drug protocol – one to sedate the prisoner, a second to paralyze them and a third to stop the heart – became the accepted lethal injection practice until the late aughts to the early 2010s, Denno said. That’s when supply issues caused a greater incidence of problems.\n\nPharmaceutical companies in the U.S. stopped producing the needed drugs, or refused to sell them to prisons for use in executions, Maher said, causing a “scramble” to find replacement sources.\n\nThe Death Penalty Information Center dubbed 2022 the “Year of the Botched Execution” after 35% of the 20 attempted lethal injections were botched due to the incompetence of executioners, failure of execution protocol or flaws in the protocol design itself. Three in a row were in Alabama, where Smith’s execution ultimately failed.\n\n“Alabama has a really terrible track record of being able to carry out executions without mistakes occurring and without the consequential pain and suffering of the prisoner who's being executed,” Maher said.\n\nExperts say nitrogen hypoxia likely won't fix the problem\n\nStates continue to struggle with accessing lethal injection drugs and growing public horror at botched attempts. In some cases, that means reverting to older techniques.

Or were Carter, then 29 and a well-known boxer, and Artis, 19 and a former high school track star who spent his days driving a delivery truck, unjustly imprisoned for most of two decades?\n\nBACK IN THE NEWS:Revisiting the Hurricane Carter murder case: Son resurrects his detective father's memoir\n\nTo study the original case records now is to walk a path littered with perplexing questions and strands of facts that have been woven into myth. At the same time, such a journey also reveals evidence that has never been challenged – and, yet, still contributes to the mystery.\n\nThat night, there were two gunmen. One carried a 12-gauge shotgun, the other a .32-caliber pistol — probably a 7-shot, German-made revolver, say police ballistics experts. Both were black. Both came in through the front door.\n\nIt was early in the morning of June 17, 1966, a Friday. The 3 a.m. closing time at the Lafayette Grill drew near.\n\nInside were three men and one woman, all white, all of them regulars at the tavern, long known as a quiet watering hole on the border between Paterson's working-class Lithuanian and black neighborhoods. The place had a television above the bar, a pool table in the middle of a checkerboard linoleum floor, and a kitchen that served up burgers and fries.\n\nTwo men nursed drinks as they sat on bar stools. On the wall above the bar and surrounded by musical-note decorations, a framed portrait photo of President John F. Kennedy looked down. Beneath Kennedy's photo sat a clock designed to look like a large pocket watch. Beneath that, crime scene photos show a shelf with three White Rose whiskey bottles nestled amid a cluster of gins, vodkas and other spirits.\n\nTo the right of the two men sat a lone woman, who got off work earlier than usual that night from her waitress job at a country club. The day before, she had managed some free time to go shopping with her pregnant daughter for baby furniture. On this night, she stopped by the bar on the way to her Hawthorne home to drop off a deposit for a trip to Atlantic City later in the summer.\n\n\"It was prom season, so she usually worked later,\" recalls the woman's daughter. \"She thought she was having an easier night, I guess.\"\n\nBehind the counter, by a cash register and a sign that announced Budweiser \"on tap,\" the bartender counted the day's receipts.\n\nPerhaps bartender Jim Oliver recognized the killers when they came through the front door from 18th Street. Maybe he just saw their guns and knew trouble was coming. Whatever his thoughts at that fearsome moment, police say, one of Oliver's last acts of life was to hurl an empty beer bottle at the killers.\n\nThe bottle smashed against the wall by the door. As Oliver turned to run the length of the bar, past an ice cooler and toward the overhead television set, a single shotgun blast from about seven feet away tore into his lower back, the 12-gauge round ripping open a 2-inch by 1-inch hole and severing his spinal column.\n\nOliver died instantly, police say. He was 51 and had volunteered to tend bar that night because his girlfriend — a widow named Betty Panagia, who owned the Lafayette and lived in Saddle Brook — had been putting in long hours as Oliver recovered from a recent hernia operation.\n\nAs Oliver fell, a $10 bill and four $5 bills scattered on the floor. The cash register drawer remained open.\n\nThe next to die was Fred Nauyoks. The killer with the pistol shot him.\n\nNauyoks, a 60-year-old machinist who had stopped by after working at a local factory before heading to his Cedar Grove home, took a .32-caliber bullet just behind his right ear. The lead slug plowed into his brain stem, killing him instantly, autopsy records say.\n\nNauyoks was well-known in the area as a billiard player, and his relatives remember that he went by two nicknames — \"Paterson Bob\" and \"Cedar Grove Bob.\" That night, Nauyoks' wife was in Michigan, visiting relatives. The next day, when she arrived home and was told of her husband's killing, grandson Tom Vicedomini remembers that she walked silently upstairs and donned a black dress.\n\nWith death arriving instantly, Nauyoks slumped on the bar, seemingly asleep, a cigarette still burning between his fingers when police arrived, his shot glass still standing on the bar next to cash to pay for his drink, his right foot still propped on the chrome leg of his bar stool.\n\nSeated two stools away, William \"Willie\" Marins, 42 and also a machinist, had been battling numerous health problems, including tuberculosis, police say. The Lafayette even kept a special glass for Marins to drink from so he would not spread tuberculosis to other customers.\n\nMarins, who lived nearby in Paterson, was also shot in the head by the man with the pistol. But he was lucky. The .32 slug hit him in the left temple and passed through his forehead near his right eye without killing him. He stumbled to the floor, and, he later said, played dead.\n\nHe would lose the use of his right eye, but could still describe the killers to police. He died in 1973 of causes unrelated to the shootings.\n\nThe woman was the killers' final target. And for her, court records indicate, one of the gunmen finally spoke.\n\nAs the others were shot, Hazel Tanis, 56, a waitress at Westmount Country Club in then West Paterson, was trying to hide near the front door.\n\n\"No,\" she cried, according to trial testimony from a witness in an upstairs apartment who heard a woman's scream as the man with the shotgun fired a blast into her upper right arm and shoulder.\n\n\"Finish her off,\" the man with the shotgun reportedly told his partner.\n\nAs Tanis slumped to the floor, the man with the .32-caliber pistol fired five shots at her from as close as 10 inches, hitting her four times — in the right breast, the lower abdomen, the vagina, and the genital area.\n\nMiraculously, Tanis would struggle to live another month before finally succumbing to an embolism. But during that time she would give police a description of the killers and, says her daughter, would tell in detail how she tried to beg for her life.\n\n\"'I'm a mother. I'm a grandmother. Please don't shoot me,'\" Tanis' daughter, Barbara Burns, now 55, recalls her mother telling her later in the hospital. Burns would later insist that her mother picked out mug shots of Carter and Artis, explaining: \"You don't look a man in the eyes and plead for your life and forget what he looks like.\"\n\nBut the police say Tanis chose photos of other men — hence, another thread of mystery.\n\nAt the hub of almost every aspect of the mystery, however, are Carter and Artis. That night, neither was able to provide an ironclad account of their whereabouts at the time of the Lafayette Grill killings.\n\nCarter, now 63 and a prisoners' rights activist in Canada, did not respond to numerous requests for an interview, although he has long proclaimed his innocence. Artis, 53 and a youth counselor in Virginia, reaffirmed his innocence in an interview, adding that \"my heart goes out\" to the victims' families \"but, simply stated: I'm not the one.\"\n\nMany police officers not only disagree with Carter's and Artis' not-guilty claims, but still resent being accused of railroading the two men. \"I would never be involved in framing anyone,\" said retired Paterson Deputy Police Chief Robert Mohl, 66, of Toms River, who was a detective in 1966 and played a key role in the case.\n\nThat night, cops surmise that the killers needed only a minute — maybe less — to unleash their fusillade on all the victims.\n\nLeft behind, according to the original police report, was $72 in Nauyoks' wallet, $51 in Tanis' white purse, $30 on the floor by Oliver's body, and cash in the register that \"appeared to be untouched.\" Police discovered months late that someone — but not the killers — removed cash from the register.\n\nAnd from there, other mysteries would spread like those haphazard mirror cracks — mysteries (and pieces of mysteries) that have endured for 34 years.\n\nNot even the precise time of the shootings is certain. All that's known is that someone — there is no indication whether the voice was male or female — telephoned the Paterson police headquarters at 2:34 a.m. with the message that \"people had been shot\" at the Lafayette Grill.\n\nWho were these two gunmen?\n\nWhat was their motive?\n\nWhy this bar, on this night, and these victims?\n\nIn a house a block away, the phone rang.\n\nFinally home, after a long day, a Paterson police detective with a name that bespoke a humorous irony for his profession picked up the receiver.\n\n\"It was headquarters,\" recalls Jim Lawless, now 72, retired, and living in Fort Pierce, Florida, after rising to the rank of deputy chief in the Paterson Police Department. \"They told me there was a shooting. I grabbed two guns and ran out the door.\"\n\nArmed with his .357 Magnum service revolver and a 9mm semiautomatic pistol, Lawless stepped through the front door of the Lafayette Grill only minutes later, not knowing what he might confront.\n\nThe lights were on, he recalls. Near one end of the bar, he remembers hearing Tanis groan in pain. Gazing across the room, past the pool table, Lawless noticed Nauyoks and Marins. Pools of blood dotted the linoleum. At Nauyoks' feet sat a spent shotgun shell.\n\n\"It was,\" said Lawless, \"like a slaughterhouse.\"\n\nBefore he had time to check behind the bar, Lawless heard the sirens of approaching police cruisers and an ambulance. Indeed, the scene was so gruesome that an ambulance technician would later testify that he slipped on the bloody floor. But the technician's testimony underscores a fact that has since come to hover over the killings: Cops were so lax in securing the crime scene that they were never able to detect whether the killers might have left footprints in the blood as they departed.\n\nWhat's more, police never took fingerprints at the crime scene, never photographed tire skid marks from the getaway car even though witnesses said the car screeched away, never took fingerprints from the spent shotgun shell that was found on the bar's floor.\n\n\"There was something really wrong,\" said Richard Caruso, a former Essex County sheriff's detective who was part of a team of investigators assigned by the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office to reexamine the killings in 1975. \"What's wrong with the physical evidence? How come they didn't take fingerprints?\"\n\nCaruso, now a lawyer in Brick Township and one of several members of the team who raised questions about the original police investigation, said he was eventually reassigned to \"cleaning up a file room.\" In an interview, he said prosecutors and police not only stonewalled attempts to examine the case with a fresh eye but deliberately manipulated evidence.\n\nThat night in June 1966, there was no second-guessing of the police. After Lawless entered the bar, other detectives arrived to take over.\n\nLawless had another important case to resolve — a killing in another bar that night. But at that moment, as he stood on the bloody floor of the Lafayette Grill, he did not know how the two shootings would eventually be linked in the minds of prosecutors.\n\nSix hours earlier and five blocks away from the Lafayette Grill, another bartender had been shot to death.\n\nThe death of Leroy Holloway, 48, the bartender-owner of the Waltz Inn, bore three distinct parallels to the Lafayette Grill shootings. Holloway was killed with a blast from a 12-gauge shotgun. The killer did not steal any money. And — perhaps most significant to prosecutors — Holloway's killer had a different skin color from his.\n\nHolloway was black. His killer was white.\n\nJim Lawless had spent much of the previous six hours collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses at the Waltz Inn. But unlike the Lafayette killings, the Waltz Inn case was relatively easy to wrap up.\n\nThe killer, Frank Conforti, 48, who had recently sold the bar to Holloway, had stormed into the Waltz Inn to confront Holloway about lax payments. Witnesses said Conforti and Holloway argued, and then Conforti left and went to his car.\n\nMinutes later, Conforti returned and without saying a word shot Holloway in the head, killing him instantly.\n\nPolice soon arrived, and escorted the handcuffed Conforti through a gauntlet of black residents to a waiting police car.\n\nConforti was eventually convicted of second-degree murder and spent almost 15 years in prison. \"I've lost track of him,\" said his lawyer, Joseph J. Vanecek of Wayne. \"But when he got out, he came by and thanked me.\"\n\nWhatever the motives, the clientele at the Waltz Inn and Lafayette Grill underscored a well-known fact of life in Paterson. Like much of America in 1966, Paterson was a city divided by color lines. When it came to taverns, whites had their neighborhood bars, like the Lafayette Grill, and blacks had theirs, like the Waltz Inn.\n\nThe Lafayette Grill was on what was considered a border of sorts, a line of streets and frame homes that was slowly being integrated by black and Hispanic residents. Lafayette bartender James Oliver was said to have excluded or discouraged black patrons, according to trial testimony.\n\nBut that may be more of an accident of social customs than an outright act of racism. Paterson police say the Lafayette Grill occasionally had black customers. Bill Panagia, 64 of South Hackensack, the son of owner Betty Panagia and an occasional bartender there, said he doubted there was a whites-only code, but \"every time I went in there, there were only whites.\"\n\nAdds John Artis: \"The Lafayette — the black contingent just didn't go there.\"\n\nTo go back 34 years in Paterson or many other American cities is to return to a time when America's racial crucible boiled with idealistic promise and fiery violence. Congress had passed landmark legislation to expand civil rights and social programs to eradicate poverty. But riots had erupted in Watts, Detroit — even in Paterson. And in Harlem, Malcolm X had been gunned down by three black men, one of whom was from Paterson. Newark's devastating riots were still a year away, the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. two years down the road.\n\nIn Paterson that night, police immediately suspected that the shooting of whites at the Lafayette Grill might have been an act of revenge for Leroy Holloway's killing at the Waltz Inn. Their suspicions were not just based on a hunch, though.\n\nAfter Holloway was pronounced dead, his stepson, Eddie Rawls, went to police headquarters. Speaking to an officer, he wanted to know what was being done on his stepfather's case.\n\nThe officer told Rawls not to worry. But Rawls was not satisfied, according to trial and grand jury testimony. As he left the police station, Rawls reportedly shouted that if police didn't handle the case properly, he would take matters into his own hands.\n\nEddie Rawls was a bartender at the Nite Spot, a tavern just five blocks from the Lafayette Grill, on 18th Street. The Nite Spot was Rubin Carter's favorite hangout. The place even had a special \"champ's corner\" for the popular boxer.\n\nFor John Artis, the Nite Spot also was a favorite place to dance.\n\nFor prosecutors, this mere coming together of Rawls, Carter, and Artis became the basis for what they later called their \"racial revenge theory\" to explain the killings at the Lafayette Grill. For Carter and Artis, the theory would become one of the cornerstones of a decision by a federal judge in 1985 to free them from prison.\n\nIt was party night for Rubin Carter, and time to dance for John Artis.\n\nOn Thursday, June 16, Carter spent the day assembling boxing equipment and packing his rental car, a 1966 white Dodge Polara with blue and gold New York plates. He was scheduled to fight in August in Argentina against Juan \"Rocky\" Rivero, and this would be his last chance to let loose before training camp.\n\nCarter's boxing career had suddenly reached a plateau. After four years of success, Carter lost a 1964 fight for the middleweight title. He would win only seven of his next 14 fights, losing six and tying one.\n\nBy Monday, he planned to be at a former sheep farm in Chatham, where he would begin the harsh physical regimen of running, weight lifting, and boxing that he would need to put his career back on track.\n\nCarter had dinner at his Paterson home with his wife at about 5 p.m., then put on an outfit that surely would attract attention — black pants, red vest, and white sport coat. With his shaved head and bushy goatee, he was one of the most recognizable residents of Paterson.\n\nArtis was also looking to have a good time. Two years earlier — June 17, 1964 — he had graduated from Paterson's Central High School, with an offer of a track scholarship to Adams State College in Colorado. One of his best friends was also heading to Adams to play football.\n\nBut only five weeks after graduation, Artis' mother died of kidney disease. Artis, an only child, remembers being devastated. \"It was pretty difficult,\" he recalls. \"My father and I were trying to regroup.\"\n\nArtis put off college and got a job driving a truck for a local food deliverer. He played semi-pro football with the Paterson Panthers and kept in shape. But most nights, he headed for a club where he could show off his dancing skills. \"My nickname was 'Dancing Boy,'\" said Artis.\n\nBy 1966, he felt he was ready to try college. \"My mom only got to the third grade, and my dad only made it to the ninth grade,\" said Artis. \"I would be the first to go to college.\"\n\nPlus, Artis was worried about being drafted into the Army and being sent to Vietnam. He had recently lost his student deferment and had been reclassified as 1-A for the draft. If he went to college, he wouldn't be drafted.\n\nOn the night of June 16, Artis put on a light blue mohair sweater with his initials monogrammed on the breast, light-blue pants, and gold suede loafers.\n\nWhat happened with Carter and Artis over the next six hours is open to all manner of speculation — even today.\n\nCarter and Artis, a decade apart in age, knew each other — both acknowledge that. But both say they did not know each other well. Prosecutors, however, say the two had spent considerable time together before June 16.\n\nPaterson's current mayor, Marty Barnes, who knew Carter and Artis in the 1960s, said the two \"didn't really hang together.\" Of Artis, Barnes said, \"I always called him a wannabe. He was a little too young.\"\n\nBy 1966, Carter was well known in Paterson — and not just as a boxer. Like many black athletes, he had begun to speak out on race relations.\n\nIn 1963, Carter went to Washington, D.C., to demonstrate for civil rights and to hear Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. In 1965, however, Carter opted not to march with King in Selma, Alabama, because he feared he couldn't adhere to King's strategy of non-violence.\n\nPerhaps most controversial, however, was a 1964 profile of Carter in the Saturday Evening Post just before his middleweight title fight. Among other things, Carter reportedly suggested to a friend that they \"get guns and go up there and get us some of those police.\"\n\nPaterson police would remember that.\n\nCarter was at the Nite Spot tavern, according to trial testimony, when Eddie Rawls arrived with the news of his stepfather's murder.\n\nWhat happened next is open to speculation. Prosecutors insist that Carter started talking about guns that had been stolen from him a year earlier — and that he suddenly wanted to find them. Carter denies this.\n\nCarter notes, however, that after the news of the murder of Rawls' stepfather, many blacks talked of a possible riot or some sort of trouble — \"a shaking,\" as Carter described it in his grand jury testimony.\n\nWhat both sides agree on is that nothing even remotely resembling a riot took place.\n\nSometime between 2 and 2:30 a.m., Carter and Artis found themselves together at the Nite Spot. Artis said he needed a ride home and remembers Carter telling him he had to \"earn\" his ride — meaning that Artis would have to drive Carter home, too.\n\nArtis recalls that he nodded. Carter flipped him the keys to his white Dodge.\n\nWhat emerged next is a tale with two distinct plots — or, as U.S. District Court Judge H. Lee Sarokin said in his landmark 1985 decision overturning Carter's and Artis' convictions, \"two dramatically different versions of events\" with evidence that is \"often conflicting and sometimes murky.\"\n\nWhat is known is that within minutes after Paterson police arrived on the gruesome scene at the Lafayette Grill, they were told by witnesses that the killers had escaped in a white sedan with blue and gold license plates.\n\nA radio call went out to Paterson police cruisers to be on the lookout for a white car. But as with other bits of evidence, this radio call was framed by a simple problem: What time did the call go out?\n\nEven today, no one is entirely sure.\n\nPolice say that just after the 2:34 a.m. call to headquarters about a shooting, a police cruiser heading toward the Lafayette Grill spotted a white car with New York license plates, followed by a black car, speeding along 12th Avenue in a direction that might have been heading toward Route 4.\n\nInstead of turning the corner and chasing the cars, the cruiser took a roundabout route by the Passaic River in what police later explained was an attempt to cut off the white car near the Paterson-Elmwood Park border. When the police cruiser arrived at the border, no car was in sight.\n\nDrifting slowly down Broadway back into the center of Paterson, the cruiser, driven by Sgt. Theodore Captor, again saw a white sedan with New York plates — Carter's car, with Artis at the wheel. Another man, John Royster, who has been described in trial records as something of a local barfly, was in the passenger seat. Carter was in the rear, lying on the seat.\n\nCaptor, who recognized Carter, politely told the three men that there had been a shooting, and then let Artis drive away. Captor then headed to the Lafayette Grill, where witnesses told of a getaway car with blue and gold license plates and a distinctive butterfly design for the rear lights.\n\nCaptor says this description fit Carter's car. He and his partner returned to the streets to try to find it.\n\nAround 3 a.m., Captor found the car — this time, with only Artis and Carter inside — at Broadway and 18th Street. Other police cars pulled up, and Carter and Artis were ordered to follow a police convoy back to the Lafayette Grill, about 10 blocks away.\n\nAgain, here is where the tales by the prosecution and defense split into distinctive sets of facts.\n\nWitnesses, including shooting victim Willie Marins, described the gunmen as light-skinned, thin, black men, both about 6 feet tall, wearing dark clothing, and with one having a pencil-thin mustache.\n\nCarter is 5-foot-7, Artis 6-foot-1. Carter was stocky and muscular, Artis angular, but not thin. Both have dark skin. Neither had a pencil-thin mustache, but Carter had a thick goatee.\n\nAnd both were dressed in light-colored clothing.\n\nBut at the scene, police were interviewing two other witnesses who would play integral — and controversial — roles in the case.\n\nPatricia Graham Valentine, then 23, and a waitress at a delicatessen across town near the courthouse, lived in an apartment one floor above the Lafayette Grill. Valentine says that when she heard gunshots and a woman's voice scream \"no,\" she looked out the window and saw two black men escape in a white car. The other witness, Alfred Bello, also 23, told police he was on the sidewalk outside the bar when two black men left the Lafayette and sped away in a white car.\n\nCarter's car seemed to match Valentine's and Bello's descriptions of the getaway car — right down to the distinctive butterfly description of the taillight chrome that both reportedly gave to police. But, again, there was one important difference.\n\nValentine and Bello said the rear lights lit up across the back of the getaway car. The taillights on Carter's Dodge Polara had a butterfly chrome setting, but they lit up only on the edges, not across the back. Another type of Dodge — the Monaco — had across-the-back butterfly lights.\n\nThis distinction — and a later reference in grand jury testimony by Valentine to a Monaco — later prompted Detective Richard Caruso to wonder if police might have been coaching witnesses on the scene to frame Carter. Caruso even made note of his concerns in a secret file — later dubbed \"The Caruso File\" — that was a subject of a bitter legal fight after Carter and Artis were convicted again for the Lafayette Grill killings in 1976.\n\nThe file was never made public because Judge Sarokin stepped in and set Carter and Artis free. But Caruso agreed to talk about its contents, and The Record obtained affidavits corroborating his findings.\n\nAmong other concerns, Caruso believed Valentine had changed her testimony to the police — \"hardened it,\" in police lingo — to adapt her description of the getaway car to Carter's rented Dodge. What also struck Caruso as being especially odd was that the police never bothered to photograph tire skid marks even though Valentine and another witness told police the getaway car screeched as it sped away. If the police were able to obtain photos of tire tracks, they could have compared them to Carter's car, said Caruso.\n\nWhat's more, even though police said they searched Carter's Dodge, Caruso discovered that they did not test the carpet for possible bloodstains from the killing scene. Caruso also noticed that shooting victim Willie Marins, who failed to identify Carter — even after Carter was brought to the hospital where he was being treated — was, in fact, familiar with Carter's face and should have recognized him.\n\nAnd finally, said Caruso, when he and others tried to question Valentine and other witnesses, they discovered that a Passaic County prosecution detective, Lt. Vincent DeSimone, may have been coaching them in ways that would implicate Carter.\n\n\"There was even a code word that we had to use that would indicate that a witness would be free to talk to us,\" said Caruso. \"The code meant that we had been cleared by DeSimone.\"\n\nDeSimone died in 1979. But his son and others doubt that he engaged in such tactics. \"The people involved in the prosecution are people of the utmost integrity,\" said Passaic's current prosecutor, Ronald Fava. \"They would never do anything unethical, much less participate in a framing.\"\n\nThe questions of police tactics would soon come to dominate almost every syllable of testimony by the other witness police encountered outside the crime scene, Alfred Bello — in part because of what he was doing on Lafayette Street at 2:30 a.m. when he lived several miles away in Clifton.\n\nBello told police he was walking down Lafayette Street to buy a pack of cigarettes when he heard shots and saw two black men with guns leave the bar and jump into the white getaway car with blue and gold plates and butterfly taillights.\n\nActually, Bello later admitted that he was trying to burglarize a nearby warehouse with a partner, Arthur Bradley, when he went for cigarettes and saw the gunmen and getaway car. His actions — to defenders of Carter and Artis, anyway — beg this question: Why would someone interrupt a burglary to buy cigarettes?\n\nAsked in a recent interview, former Paterson Deputy Chief Robert Mohl has an answer: \"Are you a smoker? If you are, you understand when you get the urge.\"\n\nBeyond that, however, Bello's actions seem odd.\n\nAlso odd — or morbid — is what Bello did before police arrived at the Lafayette. Bello stepped over the bleeding bodies and took $62 from the cash register. When police learned of this theft, they would pressure Bello to tell more about what he knew of the gunmen — while also promising him leniency.\n\nIn the minutes after the shootings, Bello told police only that the gunmen were black. Two months later, complaining of threats by friends of Carter, Bello told then-Sergeant Mohl that the man with the shotgun was Carter. Bello also admitted to Mohl that he and Bradley later returned to the warehouse after the Lafayette killings and broke in.\n\n\"My father had no use for Alfred Bello,\" said James DeSimone of Wyckoff, the son of the detective who promised leniency to Bello in exchange for his testimony identifying Carter and Artis as the gunmen. \"Alfred Bello was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n\nBut that night, with Carter and Artis on the scene of the killings, Bello was not identifying anything more than a getaway car that resembled Carter's Dodge. Carter's white jacket had no evidence of blood that might have spurted from the shooting victims. Neither did Artis' clothes. A police search of the Dodge at the scene turned up no guns, no bloodstains — nothing to indicate Carter and Artis were linked to the killings. Police never found the weapons.\n\nNonetheless, police ordered Carter and Artis to headquarters for questioning, this time by then-Lieutenant DeSimone.\n\nLooking back now, both sides in the case are still deeply split over whether police had any reason to be suspicious of Carter and Artis.\n\nCal Deal, a former reporter for The Herald-News of Passaic and Clifton, who covered the 1976 trial and befriended police and victims' families, now runs an anti-Carter website from his office in Fort Lauderdale, where he works as a graphics consultant for trial lawyers.\n\nDeal says he has traced the movements of Carter's car on the night of the shootings and concludes that Carter and Artis were the killers. \"If you study the evidence, it just makes sense,\" says Deal.\n\nOn the other side, Carter biographer James Hirsch says Carter's and Artis' movements actually prove their innocence. \"Rubin's behavior on that night is inconsistent with guilt,\" said Hirsch, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who shares royalties with Carter from his biography, \"Hurricane.\" \"If you believe that Carter did this, you have to believe that he and Artis would manage to get rid of the weapons and their bloody clothes, and casually drive around the streets of Paterson until police picked them up.\"\n\nHirsch contends that the expected behavior of killers would be to speed out of Paterson as quickly as possible — hence, the theory that police missed the real getaway car when they took a roundabout route to chase.\n\nNonsense, says Deal. \"What's the likelihood that there would be two white cars with blue and gold license plates in that part of Paterson at that hour?\"\n\nThe question still rings as lively today as it did 34 years ago.\n\nIt was just after 3 a.m. on June 17 when Carter and Artis arrived at Paterson police headquarters.\n\nBy 4 a.m., the two would be confronted by two pieces of damning evidence. Even though police searched Carter's Dodge at the Lafayette Grill, another search was conducted at police headquarters.\n\nIn the trunk, under some boxing equipment, police say they found an unused 12-gauge shotgun shell. On the floor of the front seat, they said, they found an unused .32-caliber cartridge.\n\nNeither the shotgun shell nor the pistol bullet would match those in the shootings, but the fact that they were the same calibers as the killers' weapons heightened police suspicions of Carter and Artis.\n\nBut Carter's and Artis' defense lawyers became suspicious for their own reasons. Although the police say they found the shotgun shell and bullet the night of the shootings, they did not log the items in as evidence until five days later. In later trials, the defense would suggest that the shotgun shell and bullet were planted by the police. \"Whatever happened to bag and tag?\" asked Fred Hogan, an investigator for the state Public Defender's Office, in referring to common police procedure to log evidence from a crime scene immediately and seal it in a plastic bag.\n\nHogan, who assisted Carter and Artis in their appeals, would later become a controversial figure himself. Prosecutors charged that he offered money to witnesses in exchange for their testimony — a charge that was never proven despite three grand jury investigations. Today, Hogan says he offered no money to witnesses. \"Absolutely not,\" said Hogan, still an investigator for the state Public Defender's Office. \"If I had done anything illegal or immoral or unethical, I would have been given two things — an indictment and a pink slip.\"\n\nBut that night, if police were suspicious of Carter and Artis, it's hard to fathom what happened in the hours after the shootings.\n\nPolice did not conduct paraffin tests to detect traces of burned gunpowder on the hands or clothes of Carter and Artis. Such tests were common in 1966, and in a June 29, 1966, appearance before a grand jury, Lieutenant DeSimone was asked why a test was not conducted.\n\n\"We do not have the facility to take a paraffin test at present,\" said DeSimone, adding that the authorities would have had to bring in an expert fairly fast before gunpowder residue had disappeared. Added DeSimone, \"With the time element, it would have proved naught.\"\n\nBut DeSimone and the police that day decided to bring in an expert to conduct lie detector tests.\n\nCarter and Artis were asked to take lie detector exams — and both agreed. Also, Eddie Rawls was brought to police headquarters for questioning and asked to take a lie detector test.\n\nEach side would later use the lie detector results — and immediate police reaction to them — to try to prove its case.\n\nIn a written report on the tests, obtained by The Record, Artis was said to have \"no knowledge\" of the Lafayette Grill shootings but had \"suspicions as to who was responsible.\"\n\nThe report, written by a polygraph expert brought in from the Elizabeth Police Department, said Carter did not participate in the killings \"but had knowledge as to who was responsible.\"\n\nEddie Rawls was the last to be tested. The report said that \"Rawls had done the shooting and/or had knowledge of it.\"\n\nWith Rawls, however, the report cautioned that the \"short test conducted on Rawls was not conclusive because of the fact that Rawls was in a state of fatigue.\"\n\nFive days later, Rawls was asked to take the test again, but he refused. Later, he would be implicated — but never charged — in trying to help arrange for witnesses to offer false alibis for Carter and Artis. He would also refuse to testify, telling prosecutors through his lawyer that if subpoenaed, he would cite his constitutional right against self-incrimination.\n\nWhat's more — and adding to the controversy — another polygraph report that turned up in 1976 tied Carter and Artis to the killings. Carter's and Artis' lawyers say the 1976 report is a forgery.\n\nRawls was never arrested, but that didn't ease suspicions. In the 1976 trial, Prosecutor Burrell Ives Humphreys said, \"Eddie Rawls is all over this case,\" and he theorized that Carter and Artis hid the weapons at Rawls' house.\n\nHumphreys and DeSimone were so convinced of Rawls' involvement that they obtained a court order in 1976 to dig up the grave of Rawls' murdered stepfather to see if the guns had been hidden in the coffin. No guns were found.\n\n\"He's probably a co-conspirator,\" said former Paterson Deputy Police Chief Robert Mohl, \"but I can't prove it.\"\n\nSaid Carter's biographer: \"Eddie Rawls is definitely the wild card.\"\n\nToday, Eddie Rawls' whereabouts are unknown.\n\nAlfred Bello and Arthur Bradley have also slipped from view.\n\nAfter testifying in 1966 that Carter and Artis were at the Lafayette Grill, Bello and Bradley both recanted their testimony to Fred Hogan in 1974 — thus setting in motion a series of legal steps that led to a new trial.\n\nIn the 1976 retrial, Bello withdrew his recantation and said Carter was at the scene with a shotgun. Bradley refused to testify again for the prosecution. In 1981, Bradley told a court that he had \"no memory\" of what happened that night in 1966 at the Lafayette Grill.\n\nCarter's and Artis' lawyers went on to other cases, including assisting on appeals with the Baby M surrogate mother case. Artis' first lawyer, Arnold Stein, became a judge.\n\nSeveral members of the prosecution teams also became judges — namely Humphreys, Vincent Hull, Ronald Marmo, and Fred Devesa.\n\nH. Lee Sarokin, the federal judge who set Carter and Artis free, retired and is now living in California. He told colleagues he inquired about playing himself in the recent film on the case, but was turned down by the movie producers.\n\nBefore he died in 1979, Vincent DeSimone wrote a memoir of his experiences in the case with a retired Paterson journalist. The memoir, which was never published, was titled \"The Media Meddlers.\"\n\nPatricia Valentine now lives in Florida, and recently released a statement through the anti-Carter website saying that there is \"absolutely no doubt in my mind\" that the car she identified 34 years ago on Lafayette Street was Carter's. \"Rubin Carter is an evil man in love's clothing,\" said Valentine.\n\nThe Lafayette Grill is now called Len's Place. Today, its clientele mostly reflects the neighborhood of Hispanics and other immigrants who have moved into Paterson.\n\nAfter the killings, the Panagia family never reopened the Lafayette Grill. Owner Betty Panagia refused to return, said her son, Bill Panagia. She died in 1984 of liver cancer.\n\nEach Christmas, Bill Panagia says he makes a special trip to a cemetery in Paramus and places a wreath on the grave of Jim Oliver, the bartender who took his mother's place that night at the Lafayette Grill.\n\n\"He was a very nice person,\" said Panagia.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/17"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/society/960790/hmp-bronzefield-and-the-issue-of-pregnant-women-in-prison", "title": "HMP Bronzefield and the ethics of pregnant women in prison | The ...", "text": "An inquiry into the death of baby Aisha Cleary in her mother’s jail cell has intensified the debate over whether prisons are safe for pregnant women.\n\nIn September 2019, a “highly vulnerable” 18-year-old gave birth at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey, without medical assistance, while she was in custody awaiting trial. Although she rang her intercom and cell bell for help, “no nurse or ambulance was called, and no-one checked on her”, said the charity Inquest.\n\nThe teenager then had to bite through the umbilical cord and wrap her baby in a towel, reported The Independent. The birth was only discovered the following morning, and the baby, Aisha Cleary, previously known as “Baby A”, was dead by the time help arrived.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nThe inquest, which is being held at Surrey Coroner’s Court in Woking and is expected to be completed by 1 June, has heard that the mother, known as Ms A, “was a suspected victim of county lines exploitation”, said The Guardian.\n\nThe deputy director of Bronzefield has accepted in evidence that the prison’s response to Aisha’s mother calling for help was “wholly and completely inadequate”, said Inquest.\n\n“This should never have happened,” the 2021 investigation by the independent Prisons & Probation Ombudsman (PPO) into the baby’s death concluded. “The situation for pregnant women in Bronzefield was symptomatic of a national absence of policies and pathways for pregnant women in custody.”\n\nWhat are the issues at Bronzefield?\n\nBronzefield is the UK’s only purpose-built private facility for female inmates, and Europe’s largest prison for women. It is operated by contractor Sodexo Justice Services (SJS), which provides primary healthcare and directly employs nurses and healthcare assistants, with a contract to employ GPs.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n“We were unable to identify with any clarity the commissioning arrangements for the maternity service at Bronzefield,” the PPO report said.\n\nBronzefield, like five other English prisons, has a specialised mother and baby unit (MBU), where women can apply for a place and can keep their baby for the first 18 months, according to government guidelines. Of 88 applications made for a place during 2021-22, 17 were refused, according to Ministry of Justice (MoJ) figures – a rate of almost 20%.\n\n“There was no clear pathway of care at Bronzefield for pregnant women who are ineligible or unsuccessful for placement in the MBU,” the PPO report found, and no system of “healthcare leadership”. The prison had no paediatric or neonatal emergency equipment, or staff with training in neonatal resuscitation.\n\nThe maternity services offered to Ms A were “outdated and inadequate”, the report said, and Bronzefield was “insufficiently resourced”.\n\nMs A “appeared to have been regarded as difficult”, the report said. Research by Laura Abbott, associate professor in midwifery at the University of Hertfordshire, published in 2018 found that “the more pleasant a prisoner was, the more likely she would be to receive appropriate healthcare”. Staff interviewed described babies who survived birth in prison as “lucky”, wrote Abbott in an article for The Conversation.\n\nBefore Aisha Cleary died, three other Bronzefield prisoners had unexpected births: one had a baby in October 2017 who required intensive care in hospital and survived; another had her baby delivered by prison nurses in her cell in March 2019. A third prisoner gave birth to a full-term stillborn baby in an ambulance en route to hospital in December 2017.\n\nWhat are the issues with imprisoning pregnant women?\n\nAccording to United Nations rules (known as the Bangkok Rules), “non-custodial sentences for pregnant women and women with dependent children” are preferred. According to a 2021 report published by Coventry University, 11 countries (including Russia, Italy, Portugal and Brazil) had laws against the imprisonment of pregnant women.\n\n“It is estimated that there are approximately 600 pregnancies in prisons in England each year,” said a 2021 report by the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists.\n\nPregnant prisoners “face multiple barriers to accessing care”, said the report, including prenatal education and nutrition. “Custodial sentences should only be used in the most exceptional circumstances.”\n\nIn 2021-22 there 50 births in women in custody, according to MoJ figures, with 47 in hospital and three in transit to hospital or inside the prison.\n\nWhat is causing the higher numbers of stillbirths?\n\nWomen in prison are seven times more likely to suffer a stillbirth than in the general population, according to an investigation by The Observer in March. Research by the Nuffield Trust previously found female prisoners were almost twice as likely to give birth prematurely.\n\nThis could be partly down to socioeconomic factors, said Kath Abrahams, of the pregnancy charity Tommy’s. Poor mental or physical health, domestic violence and substance abuse can increase the risk of stillbirth, and “women in prison come from some of the most deprived backgrounds so are more probable to experience a high-risk pregnancy”.\n\nBut women are giving birth “without qualified midwifery support and in non-sterile, inappropriate environments”, Abbott told The Observer. In July 2020, Louise Powell gave birth to a baby at HMP Styal in Cheshire alone after a prison nurse failed to respond. The baby, Brooke, died in the prison toilet.\n\nEnglish courts should use alternatives to imprisonment, wrote Rona Epstein, research fellow at Coventry University, for The Guardian, which is “disproportionate, cruel and simply unnecessary”. Community orders, out-of-court disposals and non-punitive residential support should all be considered, she suggested, but “the starting point must be that no pregnant woman should be in custody”.\n\nCampaigners and health experts have called for a review into sentencing. “Even if their baby does not die,” an open letter in September 2022 to the then justice secretary Brandon Lewis said, research found pregnant women in custody faced severe stress, “and that the fear of potential separation from their baby or shame of being made an incarcerated mother was debilitating”.\n\n“Prison is not and cannot ever be a safe place for pregnant women,” the letter said.", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/11"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/959606/pros-and-cons-of-gene-editing-babies", "title": "Pros and cons of gene-editing babies | The Week", "text": "A Chinese scientist who was jailed for creating the world’s first gene-edited babies has said he feels “huge unease” over their future and said they should be allowed to continue living with their families undisturbed.\n\nHe Jiankui was jailed for three years in 2019 after performing “one of the most controversial acts in modern scientific history”, said The Independent. The controversial scientist used cutting-edge Crispr technology to alter the genes of twin girls before they were born, in the hope they would be born immune to HIV.\n\nSpeaking to the South China Morning Post, Jiankui said the children he had genetically altered – twin girls called Lulu and Nana, and a third child born a year later known as Amy – are living “normal, peaceful and undisturbed” lives with their families. Asked by the newspaper whether he worried about their futures he said: “You will have high expectations of them, but you also have huge unease.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nJiankui told the paper that health insurance companies were unwilling to cover the children once they discovered their genes had been altered, and so he now hopes to open a charitable foundation for the children to cover any unexpected health-related expenses.\n\nJiankui’s efforts earned him acclaim among some in the scientific community, but the majority of the medical establishment and, later, the Chinese government, condemned his actions as deeply unethical, and he was jailed for three years after he was found guilty of illegal medical practices.\n\nMany fears stemmed from the implications of manipulating human genes “that could potentially be inherited and passed down through future generations, raising dystopian fears of re-engineering the human race”, said The Times. But some researchers believe the Crispr technology, which allows scientists to edit DNA “far more easily than was previously possible”, will eventually “revolutionise the prevention and treatment of diseases and conditions including cancer”, added the paper.\n\nThe jailed scientist was released from prison in April 2022, and in November launched his own laboratory in Beijing, predicting an imminent “golden decade for gene therapies”. He is scheduled to give talks and visits at a number of acclaimed universities, including a scheduled visit to Oxford University next month to discuss the use of Crispr gene-editing technology in reproductive medicine.\n\n1. Pro: may prevent disease\n\nSince many diseases are caused by a single genetic mutation, those in favour ask why we shouldn’t edit the DNA of an embryo or the sperm and egg to remove the mutation entirely. “In effect this would remove a fault from humanity forever,” said Science editor Tom Whipple in The Times. John Harris, a bioethicist at the University of Manchester told the MIT Technology Review: “The human genome is not perfect. It’s ethically imperative to positively support this technology.”\n\n2. Con: open to misuse\n\nThere is the possibility that people will use gene-editing technology for “enhancements”, rather than fighting disease, American TV host John Oliver said on his show Last Week Tonight, in 2018. “The more control people have over the ability to design their children, the bigger the moral questions that raises - up to and including, who decides what constitutes a genetic problem that needs to be ‘fixed’?”\n\n3. Pro: encourages regulation\n\nThose in favour argue that these scientific advances can be regulated to avert potential doomsday scenarios. “I still think you can try to regulate the technology,” Arthur Caplan, founding head of the Division of Bioethics at New York University, told USA Today. “It would be nice if we had an international group; set out some rules. It would be great if the scientific community - with religious and ethics and legal leaders - would set up some rules for how to operate. It would be nice if journal editors would say, ‘We’re not publishing anything unless these rules are followed.’”\n\nIn the aftermath of Jiankui’s gene-editing experiment, much has changed, said Professor Robin Lovell-Badge, the organiser of the Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing which is due to be held at the Francis Crick Institute next month. “We will be discussing what has happened to the three children whose physiology he may have altered by genome editing,” Lovell-Badge told The Guardian. “We will also have presentations about the changes that have occurred in China in terms of the law and the ethics governing gene editing. There have clearly been quite substantial changes – for the good.”\n\n4. Con: many unknowns\n\nDoctors say that just because we can change a gene does not mean we know what that change will do. “Most diseases are not caused by a single gene but many. Changing lots of genes could have lots of effects elsewhere,” reports The Times.\n\nWhile most scientists and medical ethicists believe gene editing may one day be able to improve the lives of someone with a life-altering disease, they “recoil in horror at the concept of editing the genome of a human embryo” as changes to genes can be passed down through generations of human beings, said Phys.org.\n\n“We do not know enough about human biology to make genetic engineering changes on behalf of the unborn,” said Dr John Leonard, president and CEO of Intellia Therapeutics, who said that almost all conditions which could benefit from gene editing could also be treated or prevented in another way. He also raised issues of consent, noting that the unborn cannot “agree to have these procedures done to them.”\n\n5. Pro: babies could help humanity\n\nIn the US, a poll found that 83% of people thought genetic modification to make a baby more intelligent would be “taking medical advances too far”, according to MIT Technology Review, published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. However, proponents of genetic engineering argue that a higher IQ is exactly what we should be considering. Nick Bostrom, an Oxford philosopher best known for his work on the risks of artificial intelligence, wrote in a 2013 paper that even a small number of “super-enhanced” individuals could “change the world through their creativity and discoveries, and through innovations that everyone else would use”.\n\n6. Con: only for the rich\n\nAny ethical debate “will also naturally run against practicalities like funding”, says The Independent. Many patients are subject already to a postcode lottery in accessing fertility treatment based on their local NHS funding, and “gene editing could initially be out of reach for all but the richest”, adds the newspaper. Acknowledging this problem, panel chair Professor Yeung said that if funding inequalities “were to exacerbate social injustice, in our view that would not be an ethical approach”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Irenie Forshaw", "Devika Rao", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/06/17/joel-osteen-kenneth-copeland-10-televangelists-trouble/1471926001/", "title": "Joel Osteen, Copelands among 10 televangelists who face ...", "text": "In the past year, televangelists – including Kenneth Copeland, who recently went viral for an inflammatory \"Inside Edition\" interview, and Franklin Graham, son of legendary evangelical preacher Billy Graham – have been embroiled in controversy, one way or another.\n\nCopeland, a Texas evangelist, came under fire for a viral \"Inside Edition\" video in which he defended his three private jets. But he's not the only one to make headlines.\n\nFrom buying a $200,000 Lamborghini SUV as an anniversary gift to reportedly turning away hurricane evacuees, these 10 televangelists have caught flak for their actions and sermons.\n\nKenneth Copeland\n\nCopeland justified his jet-setting by saying that he could not evangelize without the aircraft. \"If I flew commercial, I'd have to stop 65% of what I'm doing,\" he told journalist Lisa Guerrero.\n\nGuerrero then pressed Copeland on a statement he made in 2015 in which he compared flying in commercial class to getting \"in a long tube with a bunch of demons\" to fellow televangelist Jesse Duplantis.\n\n\"No, I do not, and don't you ever say that I did,\" he responded, pointing a finger at the journalist.\n\nHe owns an airport close to his Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Fort Worth.\n\nJesse Duplantis\n\nLouisiana minister Jesse Duplantis, who himself was implicated in Copeland's jet scandal, has been in hot water for his own jet-setting lifestyle. He claims God told him he needs a private jet – specifically, a Falcon 7X, capable of carrying 12 to 16 passengers at speeds up to 700 mph.\n\n\"Now, some people believe that preachers shouldn't have jets,\" Duplantis said in a video posted in 2018.\n\n\"I really believe that preachers ought to ... have every available outlet to get this Gospel preached to the world.\"\n\nIn the same video, he showed off a photo of the three planes owned by his ministry that bore the caption \"It's not about possessions, it's about priorities.\"\n\nGloria Copeland\n\nKenneth Copeland's wife, Gloria, is a preacher herself. She co-founded Kenneth Copeland Ministries with her husband and served as one of President Donald Trump's evangelical ministers.\n\nIn a video published on the ministry's Facebook page, she proclaimed that children do not need a flu shot because Jesus had already \"bore our sickness.\"\n\n\"We don't have a flu season,\" she said. \"And don't receive it when somebody's threatening you with 'Everybody's getting the flu.' We've already had our shot. He bore our sicknesses and carried our diseases.\"\n\nUpon drawing widespread criticism, Copeland Ministries shared a list of scriptures on its website with the claim that it would help followers \"stand strong against\" the flu.\n\nFranklin Graham\n\nFranklin Graham, son of famed preacher Billy Graham, was recently the target of criticism after inflammatory comments he made about Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.\n\n\"As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.\" His tweet was in response to remarks Buttigieg made on CNN in which he said, \"God does not have a political party.\"\n\nPat Robertson\n\nAs host of The 700 Club, Pat Robertson is one of the more visible televangelists to emerge on the national stage. In his extensive career, he has drawn controversy for comments regarding everything from the 9/11 attacks to working with Buddhists.\n\nIn recent years, Robertson, 89, defended Trump before the 2016 election after a videotape emerged of Trump making vulgar comments about women. Brushing it off as \"macho\" talk, Robertson compared Trump to a phoenix. \"They think he's dead, he's come back. And he came back strong,\" he said on his show.\n\nMore recently, he called Alabama's abortion ban \"extreme\" and \"ill-considered\" on The 700 Club – though he has been a vocal opponent of abortion in the past.\n\nJim Bakker\n\nTelevangelist Jim Bakker was sentenced to five years in prison in 1989 on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy after misappropriating funds from followers for his own use. More recently, Bakker has attempted to sell properties at his Christian-themed Morningside development southwest of Branson, Missouri.\n\nBakker said his development, located in the Ozark mountains, is the safest place to live when the apocalypse comes. \"Where are you going to go when the world's on fire?\" he said in a 2018 broadcast. \"Where are you going to go? This place is for God's people, and this place, we need some farmers to move here.\"\n\nJoel Osteen\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, preacher Joel Osteen – who helms one of the largest churches in America with 50,000 members and a 600,000-square-foot stadium – was criticized for not welcoming hurricane evacuees into his Lakewood megachurch.\n\nA social media post from the megachurch claimed the building was inaccessible because of \"severe flooding.\" But locals said otherwise, posting photos around the church showing streets that were easy to get to.\n\nRegardless of what happened, it brought negative publicity to the church and Osteen, who has a reported net worth of more than $50 million.\n\n\"We have never closed our doors,\" Osteen said amid the controversy. \"We are prepared to house people once shelters reach capacity. Lakewood will be a value to the community in the aftermath of this storm.\"\n\nJohn Gray\n\nSouth Carolina megachurch pastor John Gray gave his wife a $200,000 Lamborghini SUV for their eighth anniversary in 2018. A flood of negative responses followed.\n\n\"God helped me to make my wife's dream come true,\" he wrote in an Instagram post showing off the luxury automobile.\n\nWithin days of the original post, he defended his purchase online – alleging it was bought with \"not a nickel, not a penny\" of church funds, including his salary, in a tearful video.\n\n\"My wife has pushed for my dreams and my vision, and she has toiled with a man who is still trying to find himself,\" Gray said. \"That carries a weight. I wanted to honor her for how she’s covered me.\"\n\nRobert Jeffress\n\nPastor Robert Jeffress has elicited much controversy for his sentiments toward the LGBT community, Mormons and Muslims, claiming Muslims practice a religion that \"promotes pedophilia.\" The statements resulted in Tim Tebow canceling an appearance at his First Baptist Dallas Church in 2013.\n\nHe was appointed one of President Trump's evangelical advisers and gained national attention when he claimed that \"God has given Trump authority to take out Kim Jong-Un,\" invoking the Bible's book of Romans to do so.\n\nJohn Hagee\n\nThe controversial founder of Texas' Cornerstone Church has been in the news repeatedly for statements connecting natural phenomena to God's plan.\n\nHe said in 2014 that a tetrad – or four consecutive and complete lunar eclipses over the span of two years – of blood moons signaled the End Times.\n\n\"God is literally screaming at the world 'I'm coming soon,'\" he said.\n\nIn 2008, he suggested Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for New Orleans planning a gay pride rally for the LGBT community.\n\nAfter a wave of criticism, he later apologized: \"Ultimately neither I nor any other person can know the mind of God concerning Hurricane Katrina.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/17"}]}

The offseason kicks off with the NHL Draft, where teams attempt to draft players who will play like the ones who just won the Cup. Teams might try and trade for players who fit the mold of the ones who won the best trophy in sports, or they poach a few of those winning players in free agency.\n\nThe winners are usually the trend-setters and the playoffs serve as lessons to learn for how to win in present-day NHL.\n\nBut not this year.\n\nThe St. Louis Blues captured their first championship in the 52-year history of the franchise by defeating the Boston Bruins, an Original Six team, in Game 7 on the road. Home-ice advantage proved meaningless from rounds one through four.\n\nEven more meaningless was the oft-used holiday standings benchmarks. The Blues were as bad as the Ottawa Senators, the league’s worst team, at one point during the season. The Bruins were defeated by the Devils, the third-worst team, in the first game after the Christmas break.\n\nThere isn't much to take away from this edition of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, but here are a few observations.\n\nOfficiating\n\nThere was the hand pass by San Jose’s Tim Meier that led to Erik Karlsson’s overtime goal in Game 3 of the Western Conference Final. The Sharks were no stranger to officiating controversy by that point. They made it out of the first round after a blown call in Game 7 against the Vegas Golden Knights. A five-minute major slapped on Cody Eakin led to a stunning comeback by the Sharks, who rattled off four power play goals to take a lead before eventually winning in overtime.\n\nThe call was so bad the NHL had to apologize to the Golden Knights, calling general manager George McPhee after his team had been eliminated.\n\nAnd there was an egregiously bad non-call in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final when Tyler Bozak took out Noel Acciari right before David Perron scored for the Blues. It was a slew foot and should have been called as such.\n\nBut nothing was called and that’s the problem.\n\nIt’s one thing to swallow a whistle in the final round of the postseason but to call nothing for headshots, bridge hits and slew-footing is irresponsible. There is no standard being enforced and no accountability. It’s as if the NHL called up MLB and asked for Angel Hernandez.\n\nThe argument could be made that the game has sped up on the officials. The NHL Players Association’ and the NHL/NHLPA Competition Committee have recommended expanded video review and coaches challenges. Some want more video and some want less.\n\nI don’t know what the solution is but it has become abundantly clear that changes need to be made.\n\nPhysicality\n\nThe heavy game isn’t quite dead.\n\nTwo years ago, Eastern Conference teams attempted to model themselves after the Pittsburgh Penguins. After winning two track meets in back-to-back seasons, the trend became speed and skill. Boston and St. Louis played a different style of hockey. You could even argue that the Washington Capitals played and won with a heavier game one year prior. Each of the last two Stanley Cup Finals averaged about 70 hits between the two teams per game.\n\nOskar Sundqvist was running guys through walls. Each team possessed big bruisers well over 6-feet. The St. Louis Blue line didn’t feature one defenseman under 6-feet and had seven well over that mark, including 6-4 Robert Bortuzzo, Jay Bouwmeester and Joel Edmundson and 6-6 Colton Parayko.\n\nThis is a stark contrast to the smaller, speedier defensemen teams have been loading up on in recent seasons.\n\nIs there anything to glean from this? Not really. You can’t hit a player you can’t catch. While the Blues might like a big, heavy blue line, that doesn’t necessarily mean every team needs to have a big, heavy blue line to be successful, but inevitably, some teams will overreact to that and go out and find some big bodies in the draft and free agency over the next few months.\n\nSpeed, skill and puck battles are still going to be prioritized over size, but a good team is going to have a mix of everything.\n\nNothing\n\nThere was no overarching trend that was set in this latest edition of the postseason. The officials had the spotlight for the wrong reasons. The best team in the salary cap era, the Tampa Bay Lightning, didn’t have the mental toughness to win.

People say you never know when you're going to go back. I truly believe it was the heartbreak we suffered that brought us here today.\"\n\nLast season's shocker showed that skill alone was not enough to win a Cup, so general manager Julien BriseBois got busy, adding grit in forwards Pat Maroon and Barclay Goodrow and depth in forward Blake Coleman and defensemen Kevin Shattenkirk, Zach Bogosian and Luke Schenn.\n\nThat allowed them to get past the Blue Jackets, Boston Bruins, New York Islanders and Stars despite getting only five shifts from captain Steven Stamkos.\n\nBut in the end, the Lightning won a championship because their stars performed like stars this postseason.\n\nA look at clinching Game 6:\n\nLightning's top line chips in again\n\nBrayden Point gave the Lightning a 1-0 lead with a first-period power-play goal. It was his 14th goal of the postseason to give him the playoff lead.\n\nNikita Kucherov picked up his 27th assist on the play, which ranks fourth best all-time for a single playoff season. Only Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux were ahead of him.\n\nConn Smythe winner\n\nHedman, who edged Point in a close vote for playoff MVP, picked up an assist on the first goal to give him 22 points this postseason.\n\nHis 10 goals ranked third all-time among defensemen for a single playoff year.\n\n\"I thought about it a lot during the break about what I can improve in my game about shooting the puck, and some of them found the net,\" he told reporters. \"At the end of the day, this is not my trophy, this is everyone's trophy.\"\n\nHe's the 11th defenseman to win the award and the first since the Chicago Blackhawks' Duncan Keith in 2015.\n\nNewcomers chip in\n\nMaroon picked off an Alexander Radulov pass in the second period and it led to a Coleman goal for a 2-0 lead.\n\nIt's the second year in a row that Maroon has helped end the Stars' season. He scored the double-overtime goal for the St. Louis Blues that knocked out the Stars in the second round of the 2019 playoffs.\n\nMaroon won back-to-back Stanley Cups with different teams. The last person to do that: Cory Stillman (Tampa Bay, 2004, and Carolina, 2006, after the lockout-canceled season). The last to do it in back-to-back years: Claude Lemieux (New Jersey, 1995, and Colorado, 1996).\n\nVasilevskiy shines\n\nLightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy had a 3.82 goals-against average in the loss to the Blue Jackets. Monday, he made 22 saves to pick up his first shutout of the playoffs.\n\nHe was aided by a superb Lightning defensive game that limited the Stars to four shots in each of the first two periods, though he had to make a big save on Tyler Seguin in the third period.\n\n\"They executed their game plan pretty well,\" Stars defenseman John Klingberg said.\n\nVasilevskiy, last season's Vezina Trophy winner and a finalist this year, played every minute and gave up two or fewer goals 14 times this postseason. He becomes the second Russian starting goalie to win a Stanley Cup. The first was the Lightning's Nikolai Khabibulin in 2004.\n\nCup presentation\n\nThe Lightning, who spent more than two months away from their families, changed the postgame presentation ceremony by first posing around the Stanley Cup as a team.\n\nCommissioner Gary Bettman presented the Cup to Stamkos, who was in uniform for the occasion.\n\nHe handed it first to Hedman, and the Lightning skated around the empty arena with the trophy.\n\nHedman said Stamkos \"rallied the troops\" after the Lightning's Game 5 double-overtime loss to the Stars.\n\n\"For him to do that says a lot about him not just as a leader but as a person,\" Hedman said. \"He's the most unselfish person you'll meet. He's all about the team. There's a reason he's one of the best captains in the world.\"\n\nPositives for Stars\n\nThough the Stars were shut out in the final game, they had plenty of positives in the playoffs.\n\nMiro Heiskanen led all defensemen with 26 points and Joe Pavelski set a record for career playoff goals for a U.S.-born player with 61. Goalie Anton Khudobin, normally a backup, shined in the absence of injured Ben Bishop. Joel Kiviranta and Denis Gurianov had big games in earlier rounds.\n\nSeguin and captain Jamie Benn recorded no goals in the final round, though Seguin totaled five assists in Games 4 and 5.\n\n“The emotions are tough right now,\" Seguin said. \"I’m proud of this organization, all of these guys, the aces coming in when guys have been hurt, different guys stepping up at different times, going into that trainer’s room and having to wait in line to get in because everyone’s got ice bags on them.”\n\nLineup news\n\nThe Stars were down five regulars for the second game in a row: Bishop, Stephen Johns, Radek Faksa, Blake Comeau and Roope Hintz. The first three had yet to play in the series.\n\nThe Lightning brought back Bogosian, and forward Alexander Volkov made his first appearance of the playoffs. Defenseman Jan Rutta and forward Carter Verhaeghe sat out. Volkov's appearance means he can get his name engraved on the Stanley Cup.\n\nSuccessful bubble\n\nThe NHL reported no positive COVID-19 tests for the ninth week in a row.

Cassidy sounded confident the day before the game that his team would play well, and it certainly did, blowing open a one-goal game in the second period to lead 6-1. The nine goals tied the record for the most in a Cup Final.\n\n“Vegas, you certainly know how to throw a party,\" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman told the crowd. “What’s going on inside this arena and outside is incredible and a testament to what a great hockey market this is.”\n\nVegas closed out the series in five games to win the cup before a delirious franchise-record crowd of 19,058 at T-Mobile Arena that drowned out the pregame introductions of forward Jonathan Marchessault and goalie Adin Hill and cheered all the way through the final buzzer.\n\nMarchessault, who ended the postseason with a 10-game points streak, received the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP.\n\n“I couldn’t be more proud of our team, our organization,\" Marchessault said. \"Everybody stepped up at different times and that’s why we’re winners.”\n\nStone's hat trick — with the third into an empty net with 5:54 left — was the first in a Stanley Cup Final since Colorado's Peter Forsberg in 1996, also against the Panthers.\n\nThe Knights got the rest of their scoring from Nic Hague, Alec Martinez, Reilly Smith, Michael Amadio, Ivan Barbashev and Nicolas Roy. Martinez's goal in the second period came nine years to the day after he delivered the double-overtime goal in Game 5 to give the Los Angeles Kings' the cup.\n\nHill came through with another strong performance with 31 saves that has quickly made him a Knights fan favorite, even earning “MVP! MVP!” chants in the third period. Jack Eichel, the eight-year pro playing in his first postseason, had three assists.\n\n“This is what everyone dreams of,\" Eichel said. “You come to an organization like this and the expectation is to win this thing. It’s a special place to play.\"\n\nAs captain, Stone was the first to lift the cup before handing it over to the six Misfits to each get their turn skating with the trophy before handing it down the line to the rest of the team.\n\n“Unbelievable,” Stone said. “The look in my teammates' eyes when I got it, one of the craziest feelings I’ve ever had. I can’t even describe the feelings in my stomach right now. It’s everything you can imagine.”\n\nAaron Ekblad, Sam Reinhart and Sam Bennett scored for Florida, and Sergei Bobrovsky was overwhelmed in another tough performance against Vegas — allowing eight goals on 30 shots on goal — after carrying Florida to the final. Missing from the lineup was star forward Matthew Tkachuk after playing injured in Game 4.\n\n“It was a privilege for me to play with them and fight with them,” Bobrovsky said. “It’s definitely tough to lose that way and end the season that way. But we have done a fantastic job and I want to stick to that.”\n\nThe Knights have set the standard of what an expansion franchise should look like, making the Cup Final in their first season and the playoffs in every year but one. Six players remain from the initial 2017-18 team that lost in five games to the Washington Capitals in the final.\n\nThose players watched the Capitals skate with the Stanley Cup that night, and then they got the chance to do the same Tuesday to fulfill owner Bill Foley’s quest to win the championship in the sixth year.\n\n“We waited a long time for that moment to come back.” Marchessault said. “We wanted to make sure we cash in this time.\"\n\nBy creating such a lofty standard at the outset, the Knights played with high expectations, but repeatedly fell short despite four runs to at least the NHL semifinals – until Game 5 against the Panthers.\n\nThis is Las Vegas’ second pro title in nine months – the Aces claimed the WNBA championship in September – and continues the stunning growth of a sports market that was limited largely to prize fights, UNLV athletics, NASCAR and lots of golf before the Golden Knights took the city by storm. The Raiders began playing here in 2020, the Oakland Athletics appear headed to the desert, Las Vegas will host a Formula One race this year and the Super Bowl will be at Allegiant Stadium in February.\n\nAs for the Knights, their connection to Las Vegas was sealed ever since the shooting Oct. 1, 2017, that took 60 lives. They played an integral role in helping the city heal, reaching out to the community off the ice and winning big on it.\n\nBeating Florida justified the many moves Knights management made to remake the roster over the years. Stone, Eichel and Alex Pietrangelo are the most notable players Vegas has acquired to get to this moment.\n\nAnd Cassidy, hired a week after getting fired by the Boston Bruins last year, proved to be the coach to get them there.\n\n“He came in, brought an intensity to our locker room that maybe we needed,” Stone said. “He wanted to win as badly as anybody else in that locker room.”\n\nCassidy seemingly pushing all the right buttons in helping Vegas become the Western Conference’s top seed and then the NHL’s champion.\n\n“It’s a great story — very, very grateful to get another opportunity,\" Cassidy said. \"I’m just here to do my job and it worked out well.”\n\nThe Knights also won with an unlikely goalie in Hill, who was injured when the playoffs began. Laurent Brossoit was the starter until going out with an injury in Game 3 of the second-round series against the Edmonton Oilers, and then Hill got his chance.\n\n“You dream about it every day growing up as a child.” Hill said. “To be here with this group of guys, in this city, in this building, is a dream come true.”\n\n___\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/cup/2023/06/13/stanley-cup-final-golden-knights-panthers-game-5-title/70318910007/", "title": "Vegas Golden Knights capture first Stanley Cup title with Game 5 ...", "text": "When owner Bill Foley was awarded an NHL expansion team, he said his goal was for the Vegas Golden Knights to win a Stanley Cup by their sixth season.\n\nThat came true on Tuesday night as the Golden Knights routed the Matthew Tkachuk-less Florida Panthers 9-3 to capture the franchise's first NHL championship.\n\nThe Panthers had pulled off upset after upset to reach the Final, but fell to the deep Golden Knights, who went efficiently through the playoffs, winning their title in 22 games.\n\nCaptain Mark Stone scored a hat trick, the first in a Stanley Cup Final since the Colorado Avalanche's Peter Forsberg scored three in a 1996 game, and the Golden Knights pulled away in a dominant second period.\n\nThat allowed Vegas to celebrate on home ice a little more than five years after the Washington Capitals had clinched the 2018 title at Las Vegas' T-Mobile Arena.\n\n“Unbelievable,” Stone said. “The look in my teammates' eyes when I got (the Stanley Cup), one of the craziest feelings I’ve ever had. I can’t even describe the feelings in my stomach right now. It’s everything you can imagine.”\n\nA closer look at Game 5:\n\nHow the Golden Knights beat the Panthers in Game 5\n\nThe Panthers' power play had struggled throughout the Final and it put them behind in Game 5.\n\nVegas goalie Adin Hill stopped Aleksander Barkov in close and soon after, Stone took advantage of a turnover to start a 2-on-1 break with Chandler Stephenson. With the pass taken away, he made a slick move in front of the net and shot the puck past Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky for a short-handed goal.\n\nThe Golden Knights took advantage of another odd-man break less than two minutes later, and defenseman Nicolas Hague finished it off by firing a loose puck into the net.\n\nIn the second period, Florida defenseman Aaron Ekblad cut the deficit to 2-1 with a shot through a screen, then Vegas took over again.\n\nDefenseman Alec Martinez put Vegas back up by two goals nine years after he had scored the Cup-clinching goal for the Los Angeles Kings in the 2014 Final.\n\nShea Theodore and William Karlsson set up fellow original Golden Knight Reilly Smith to make it 4-1 before Stone made it 5-1 on a one-timer. Michael Amadio finished up the dominant period, putting his own rebound past Bobrovsky with 1.2 seconds left.\n\nVegas' Ivan Barbashev made it 7-1 in the third period before Florida's Sam Reinhart and Sam Bennett scored. Stone's third goal was scored into an empty net at 14:06 and Nicolas Roy scored the final goal with just over a minute to play.\n\nAdin Hill shines for Golden Knights\n\nEven though the game was a rout, Hill had to come up with big saves. He stopped Anton Lundell early, made the save on Barkov and robbed Anthony Duclair with a glove save in the third period.\n\nHill was one of five goalies that the Golden Knights used during the regular season. He entered play after Laurent Brossoit was injured in the second round and went 11-4 the rest of the playoffs.\n\nJonathan Marchessault wins Conn Smythe Trophy\n\nMarchessault, who was left unprotected by the Panthers in the expansion draft, won the award for playoff MVP. He finished with 13 goals, tied for the playoff lead, and 25 points, which was second overall.\n\n“He went on a heck of a run,” said Eichel, who led playoff scoring in his first postseason appearance. \"So deserving of the Conn Smythe. I’m so happy for him. He’s been here since the beginning.”\n\nStone, as is tradition for the team captain, got to lift the Stanley Cup first. He handed off to Smith and the remaining original members of the Golden Knights got their turn.\n\nCoach Bruce Cassidy also put out five of the six original players in the starting lineup.\n\nGolden Knights franchise's path to the Stanley Cup\n\nThe Golden Knights' run to the Stanley Cup Final in their first season in 2017-18 pushed them to be aggressive. They traded for Stone in 2019, signed Alex Pietrangelo in 2020 and traded for Jack Eichel in 2021. Last season, cap woes and injuries caused the team to miss the playoffs for the first time, leading to the firing of Peter DeBoer and hiring of coach Bruce Cassidy. Hill was acquired to be a backup goalie in 2022.\n\nThey overcame major injuries this season (Stone, multiple goaltenders) and added physical forward Barbashev at the deadline, clinching the West's best record. With Stone back for the playoffs, Eichel healthy and original Golden Knights players (Marchessault, Karlsson, Theodore, Smith, etc.) producing, Vegas got past Winnipeg, Edmonton, Dallas and Florida to win it all.\n\nThe previous quickest expansion team to win a Cup after the Original Six era was the 1973-74 Philadelphia Flyers in their seventh season. The Edmonton Oilers, who arrived in a merger with the World Hockey Association, won in their fifth season.\n\nMatthew Tkachuk unable to play in Game 5\n\nTkachuk, the Panthers' leading scorer, wasn't able to dress for the game because of a broken sternum. He absorbed a big hit in Game 3 and returned to score the tying goal of Florida's overtime win. But he was limited to four shifts in the third period of Game 4. Russian winger Grigori Denisenko made his playoff debut on the fourth line.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2018/05/18/column-atlanta-hockey-fans-cheering-anybody-but-the-jets/35077657/", "title": "Column: Atlanta hockey fans cheering Anybody But The Jets", "text": "AP\n\nATLANTA (AP) — The playoff run by the Winnipeg Jets has ripped the bandages off some old wounds in their former home.\n\nHockey fans in Atlanta — yes, they actually exist — are still bitter about the way they lost the Thrashers seven years ago , a move that deprived this city of a team for the second time and probably any chance of ever again being a member of the NHL club.\n\nIn the A-T-L, a popular refrain of the postseason seems to be A-B-T-J.\n\nAnybody But The Jets.\n\n\"I won't support the Jets,\" former Thrashers fan Fred Johnson wrote in an email. \"In fact, I'd like to see their fans suffer for a lot longer like we did.\"\n\nInstead of suffering, the Jets and their fans are thriving . Winnipeg reached the Western Conference final against the Vegas Golden Knights — a sort of double-whammy for Atlantans, who have seen what their former team could have been while getting a tantalizing glimpse of what a well-run expansion franchise can do its very first season.\n\nFounded in 1999, the Thrashers managed just 14 wins and 39 points in their debut year, which remains the worst full-schedule total in almost a quarter-century. The Golden Knights piled up 51 wins and 109 points, captured a division title and were just two wins away from playing for the Stanley Cup going into Game 4 of their series against the Jets on Friday night.\n\n\"It's not hard to feel like just yesterday Atlanta was an expansion team,\" said another Thrashers fan, Tiffany Burns. \"I couldn't have imagined how surreal it would have been to be a part of something so successful so quick.\"\n\nIn contrast to the Golden Knights, the Thrashers never really had a chance in Atlanta, doomed by a bickering group of owners who spent more time suing each other than caring about what was happening on the ice, clueless management and inept coaching, and a roster perennially low on talent.\n\nThe lone highlight came in 2007, when the team captured the Southeast Division title and finally made the playoffs for the first (and only) time.\n\nThe euphoria didn't last long.\n\nThe Thrashers were swept in four straight games by the New York Rangers. Atlanta began the following season with six consecutive losses, leading to the firing of coach Bob Hartley, and the dismantling of the franchise commenced a few months later.\n\nIn what became an all-too-familiar scenario, the frugal Thrashers dealt away Marian Hossa rather than lose him as a free agent — one of many horrible deals engineered by general manager Don Waddell, who somehow kept his job throughout the Thrashers' entire existence without ever really demonstrating that he knew what he was doing.\n\nAnyone remember Angelo Esposito, a supposed top prospect who was acquired in the Hossa deal?\n\nAnyone?\n\nBueller? Bueller?\n\nThe Thrashers always seemed to operate under a dark cloud, most tragically exhibited in 2003 when star player Dany Heatley lost control of his Ferrari on a narrow Atlanta street, struck a wall at high speed and killed teammate Dan Snyder . Heatley recovered but was never the same, eventually requesting a trade so he could get a fresh start elsewhere.\n\nThe Thrashers soon followed Heatley's lead. In 2011, after a proposed move of the bankrupt Phoenix franchise to Winnipeg fell apart, the NHL quickly engineered a deal to send Atlanta's team north in place of the Coyotes , collecting a hefty relocation fee and ridding themselves of another troublesome franchise.\n\nWhile it's impossible to deny that the team has been more embraced by hockey-mad Winnipeg than it ever was in Atlanta, this city's fans have long gotten a bum rap that goes all the way back to its first NHL team.\n\nYes, the Flames lasted only eight years in Atlanta before moving to Calgary in 1980. But they averaged more than 10,000 fans every season (not a sure thing in those days) and outdrew the NBA's Hawks every year but their last. That franchise was largely doomed by the economics of the late 1970s.\n\nFor the Thrashers, it was a similar story.\n\nThey averaged more than 17,000 in their debut season despite putting one of the worst teams in modern NHL history on the ice. But the franchise was essentially doomed when it was sold to a group known as Atlanta Spirit (what a malicious example of false advertising that was).\n\nThe new owners wanted only the Hawks and Phillips Arena. Almost immediately, they began trying to pawn off the Thrashers. Not surprisingly, no one was interested in acquiring a team that would have to rent an arena from an increasingly dysfunctional group. As the losses mounted, reportedly in the range of $130 million, Atlanta Spirit began looking for another way out. When the Winnipeg offer came along, there was no real attempt to keep the team in Atlanta.\n\nThrough all the turmoil, the Thrashers never ranked at the bottom of the NHL in attendance. In fact, the average from their gloomy final year would have beaten out three teams this season.\n\nMany Thrashers fans are still upset about being ridiculed for a perceived lack of support after the team moved. And unlike the Flames, who retained their name and some sense of their Atlanta history after moving to Calgary (and were largely cheered by their former fans for winning the Stanley Cup in 1989), the Jets made a clean break with their past.\n\nJohnson, the former Thrashers fan, recalls the vitriol when the move was announced. He said some Jets fans who trolled the Thrashers' message boards belittled Thrashers fans as \"worthless\" and said the team would now win the Stanley Cup in Winnipeg because that's where \"real fans\" were.\n\n\"They had no idea about the dysfunctional management,\" he said.\n\nAtlanta deserves a third chance at making the NHL work, but that's not likely to happen.\n\nAs if closing the door on any chance of getting another team, Philips Arena is finishing up a $192.5 million renovation that will essentially make it a basketball-only facility.\n\nNo thought was given to accommodating hockey.\n\nFor those who still love the game in Atlanta, they'll have to make do with watching games on television and rooting for other teams.\n\nAnybody but the Jets, that is.\n\n___\n\nPaul Newberry is a sports columnist for The Associated Press.

They tied a franchise record with 52 wins and captured the Central Division crown, before bowing out in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nBig things were expected in Year 2 under Roy. No longer a surprise, though, Colorado simply couldn't duplicate that level of success. A slow start hurt early and injuries piled up late, including the loss of teenager Nathan MacKinnon to a broken foot.\n\nStill, they finished up the season 17-9-1, so that's at least something to take into the offseason, right?\n\n\"I'm here to win the Stanley Cup,\" Roy said. \"So it's a disappointment. We're all disappointed about our situation. At the same time, I like to think we'll benefit from it.\"\n\nThat's what they're banking on, anyway. General manager Joe Sakic isn't planning on any major changes to the roster, just some tweaks here and there.\n\nHe likes this youthful nucleus that includes MacKinnon, Matt Duchene, captain Gabriel Landeskog and Ryan O'Reilly, a player Sakic hopes to work out a long-term deal with in the offseason.\n\nSakic knew that replicating the 2013-14 season would be a challenge after amassing 112 points. Still, he thinks they're better than the 90 points they accrued this season.\n\n\"Is next year a test? You better believe it,\" Sakic said. \"We went through the learning process this year. It's time for them to step up with consistency and become that team. Expectation level has to be there right from the start.\"\n\nThis is the takeaway for the Avs — a slow start will doom a team. With goaltender Semyon Varlamov dealing with a nagging groin injury early in the season, the Avalanche struggled. They were 12-13-8 through mid-December.\n\n\"You can't dig yourself a hole,\" Alex Tanguay said. \"It's very rare, the team that comes back after digging yourself that tough of hole. We'll reflect on that.\n\n\"I mean, this team took a great stride last year. This year, although it doesn't look like it now, in the long run, it might be beneficial to realize how much it (stinks) to miss the playoffs.\"\n\nNo team wants to use injuries as an excuse, convenient as it may be. But Colorado finished with 495 man-games lost due to injury, the most in franchise history.\n\nThe previous high was 474 in 2010-11. Those sidelined included key contributors, too, such as MacKinnon, who went out in early March, and top defenseman Erik Johnson, who made his first All-Star team but couldn't play because of a knee injury that sidelined him for the rest of the season.\n\n\"That is a part of hockey,\" said defenseman Jan Hejda, whose contract expires this summer, but hopes to be back next season. \"Not too many hockey players that have never had injuries. We have a team that is good enough to play without some key guys.\n\n\"This year, we played the whole season under pressure. Last year, we didn't.\"\n\nThe bright spot of the season had to be the play of 37-year-old Jarome Iginla, who scored 29 goals this season. He's the oldest player in franchise history to lead the team in goals, nine days older than when Sakic accomplished the feat in 2006-07.\n\n\"The ultimate goal is to win the Stanley Cup, but first you have to get to the playoffs and have that chance to play for it,\" said Iginla, who signed a three-year, $16 million deal last summer. \"It's the best time of year to play, to be an NHL hockey player.\n\n\"As tough as it is this year being out, I'm still very excited about this group. I think we've learned a lot. We've grown a lot.\"\n\nSakic couldn't agree more.\n\n\"I know as a player firsthand, when you're going through tough times, it's tough. But they've overcome it,\" Sakic said. \"Going through that, I believe 100 percent that by overcoming that, it will make them better players.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/2015/05/22/gm-of-the-year-bob-murray-glen-sather-steve-yzerman-nhl/27815039/", "title": "Bob Murray, Glen Sather and Steve Yzerman nominated for GM of ...", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nBob Murray of the Anaheim Ducks, Glen Sather of the New York Rangers and Steve Yzerman of the Tampa Bay Lightning were announced Friday as the nominees for the NHL's 2014-15 General Manager of the Year award.\n\nThey were the finalists after a vote by all 30 NHL teams, as well as a panel of league executives and various media members following the conclusion of the second round of the playoffs.\n\nThis is the third consecutive season Murray has been nominated for the award.

They are currently playing in the franchise's first Western Conference final since their Stanley Cup win in 2007.\n\nSather's Rangers had a tremendous regular season, setting franchise records in wins (53) and points (113).

You could hear Washington fans chant: \"We want the Cup.\"\n\nNothing came easy in this playoff run, and that was true in the clinching Game 5. They erased a 3-2 third period deficit to post a 4-3 win against the Vegas Golden Knights. Devante Smith-Pelly, one of Washington’s unsung heroes, was falling to the ice as he drove home the tying goal at 9:52 of the third period. Lars Eller put the Capitals ahead for good at 12:23 of the period.\n\n“Fans never quit on us and we never quit on each other,” Washington defenseman John Carlson said.\n\nThe kid-like enthusiasm was also appropriate for the veteran Washington players who had been previously linked to several failed attempts to win the Cup. The team had never been beyond the second round in the Alex Ovechkin era before this season.\n\n“This is like a dream,” said Ovechkin, named MVP after scoring his 15th goal of the playoffs.\n\nThis was the season in which the Capitals were supposed to take a half-step back. Salary cap issues forced MacLellan to change up his roster, bringing in less-expensive and less-proven players.

John Carlson played like a Norris Trophy-caliber defenseman and Brooks Orpik was a rock on defense.\n\nMost players agreed the Capitals wouldn’t have thrived without the contributions of rugged forward Tom Wilson, who contributed both with his physical playing style and offensive production.\n\n“On paper, we are not as good as we were the last two years, but there is something special about this group,” Niskanen said. “We just started to click in mid-March. We worked for each other. We won battles. We were committed to do whatever it takes.\"\n\nThe Capitals were a resilient bunch.

(AP) — From the moment Stephane Robidas was traded from the Dallas Stars to the Anaheim Ducks last month, he realized he might end up facing his former teammates in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nAlthough the veteran defenseman is giving up everything he knows about the wild-card Stars, Robidas realizes his postseason fate rests on the powerhouse Ducks' will, not any special knowledge of an upstart opponent that had Anaheim's number in the regular season.\n\n\"There's things that I know, but it's up to the players on the ice,\" Robidas said. \"They really did me a favor to give me a chance to play for a Stanley Cup when they didn't know if they were going to make the playoffs. There's no hard feelings, but they know I really want to beat them.\"\n\nAnaheim hosts the Stars in Game 1 on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Ducks earned the Western Conference's top record and another Pacific Division title, setting records for wins (54), points (116), goals (263) and comeback victories (26) while finishing one point behind Boston for the Presidents' Trophy. None of it means anything to captain Ryan Getzlaf unless Anaheim gets past Dallas, which squeaked into its first postseason since 2008.\n\nGetzlaf, Corey Perry and Teemu Selanne have won just one playoff round together since the Ducks captured their only Stanley Cup title in 2007. Coach Bruce Boudreau has led Anaheim back to the top of the standings, but the Ducks haven't advanced in the postseason since 2009, losing in the first round to seventh-seeded Detroit last year.\n\n\"Nobody remembers the team that had the best regular season in franchise history,\" Getzlaf said. \"It's all about winning in the playoffs. I've been here nine years, and the only year we ever talk about is the year we won the Cup.\"\n\nAfter five seasons out of the playoffs, the Stars are happy to be playing still, but they've also got ample reason to think they can beat Anaheim. Dallas won two of three against the Ducks this season, and its speed is a challenge for Anaheim's defense and goaltending.\n\n\"A big thing with the playoffs is you've got to hate the other team, so that's what we're going to be doing right from the puck-drop,\" Dallas forward Tyler Seguin said.\n\nFive more things to watch in this Western Conference matchup:\n\nDYNAMIC DUOS: The hockey world knows all about Getzlaf's partnership with Perry, but Seguin and Jamie Benn have formed their own formidable tandem in Dallas. All four players finished in the top eight in NHL scoring: Getzlaf was second with 87 points, while Seguin was fourth with 84 points, Perry fifth with 82 and Benn in an eighth-place tie with 79. They're all carrying considerable weight on their shoulders in this series, with Getzlaf and Perry determined to shake off the Ducks' recent postseason woes while Seguin and Benn look to become star playoff performers.\n\nGOALIE GLUT: Boudreau hasn't named the Ducks' starting goalie, and there's a good chance he'll choose a rookie. Frederik Andersen and John Gibson have never played in an NHL postseason, but they took over the crease from veteran Jonas Hiller late in the regular season. Dallas will have a golden opportunity to rattle a rookie netminder, but the Ducks are confident Andersen and Gibson are both ready for the pressure.\n\nSEGUIN'S REDEMPTION: The gifted center and Stanley Cup champion reaffirmed his stardom in his first season in Dallas, racking up monster offensive numbers on his line with Benn and Russian rookie Valeri Nichushkin. Yet Seguin's postseason performance will be scrutinized after he managed just one goal in 22 games last summer for Boston, a performance that likely contributed to his departure from the Bruins. A big playoff run cements Seguin among the NHL's top handful of centers.\n\nCOACH'S CHALLENGE: There's little doubt Boudreau is a remarkable regular-season coach after revitalizing the Capitals and the Ducks in rapid succession, winning six division titles in seven finished seasons. But his teams have won just two playoff rounds, and he's under pressure to produce a long postseason run.\n\nEASY PICKINGS?: Even Boudreau realizes his team is a popular upset pick in the first round, what with its recent playoff results, its lack of a clear-cut starting goalie and a defense likely featuring two rookies. Boudreau doesn't mind lowering expectations, but the upstart Stars aren't expecting an easy time against a heavy, fast opponent. \"It's a fun time of year,\" first-year Dallas coach Lindy Ruff said. \"I want to see a lot of our guys who have never been in it and how they react. That's going to be the exciting part.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/15"}]}
