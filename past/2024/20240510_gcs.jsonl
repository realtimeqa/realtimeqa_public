Although the government is considering a number of green alternatives to heat homes, including the use of hydrogen boilers, the most “viable” alternative for the majority of households will be electric-powered heat pumps.\n\nWhile climate change is a key consideration behind the move away from gas boilers, the worsening cost-of-living crisis driven by soaring oil and gas prices has provided added impetus for many to take the plunge and switch over. They have been encouraged by a new government scheme offering subsidies to cover some of the cost of installing heat pumps, although for many households they will still be “prohibitively expensive” said the Daily Express.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The number of heat pumps being installed in UK homes will have to be scaled up considerably, with the government’s climate advisers recommending that “by 2030 there should be 5.5 million heat pumps in British homes”.\n\nHeat pumps work even when outside temperatures are very low, even near freezing. They are also “much more efficient than a gas boiler” as they are able to produce “around three times the energy they use”, said the i news site.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n“Crucially, heat pumps are also clean”, The Times added. Gas-reliant boilers produce masses of carbon dioxide: the gas boilers in British homes “produce twice as much CO2 as the nation’s gas-fired power stations”. But if we can ensure the electricity used to power heat pumps comes from “truly green sources” then “water is the only byproduct” of using a heat pump.\n\nHow much do heat pumps cost to install?\n\nThe cost of installing a heat pump can be significant and depends on the type installed and the size of a property, the BBC said. The installation can also prove to be “difficult and expensive”. For example, you may need to install “bigger radiators or dig into floors”.\n\nHeat pump prices are “usually high, taking into account the installation”, said GreenMatch.co.uk. The typical price range for a complete installation is “between £8,000 and £45,000, to which the running costs have to be considered”. The cost for an air source heat pump ranges from £8,000 to £18,000, while ground source heat pumps can cost up to £40,000. “The running costs of heat pumps depend on your household, its insulation properties and size.”\n\nWhat grants are available and who is eligible?\n\nLast October, during the run-up to the Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow, the UK government announced plans to subsidise the introduction of low-carbon heat pumps in order to cut reliance on fossil-fuel heating.\n\nAs part of what The Guardian described as a “home heating revolution” in Britain, the government Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) offers grants that “will help property owners overcome the upfront cost of low-carbon heating technologies”, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy explained. The BUS scheme to help 90,000 households install home heat pumps is open to domestic and small non-domestic properties in England and Wales and runs until 2025.\n\nEntitlements include:\n\n£5,000 off the cost and installation of an air source heat pump\n\n£5,000 off the cost and installation of a biomass boiler\n\n£6,000 off the cost and installation of a ground source heat pump\n\nAre there any other financial incentives available?\n\nIn his Spring Statement earlier this year, then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak also announced that households will now pay 0% VAT on energy-saving equipment such as heat pumps and solar panels, for five years.\n\nThe influential Conservative think tank Onward has gone further, calling on the government to offer home buyers a 50% stamp duty rebate if they install heat pumps and other energy-efficiency measures.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, a similar scheme in Finland has helped the country reach one of the highest rates of heat pump sales in Europe.\n\nWith Britons set to face soaring bills as a result of the wholesale cost of gas, “such energy efficiency measures could also help save money in the long run”, said the Daily Express.\n\nWhat are the advantages of heat pumps?\n\nHeat pumps are “normally three times more efficient than gas boilers but they use electricity to run, and electricity prices are typically more expensive than gas”, the BBC said. However, given the current high price of gas, “heat pumps could still be cheaper”. The government has said it will look at ways to ensure heat pumps are “no more expensive to run than a gas boiler in the long run”.\n\nThere are seven main advantages of heat pumps, according to GreenMatch.co.uk. These are:\n\nLower running costs\n\nLess maintenance\n\nBetter safety\n\nReduces carbon emissions\n\nProvides cooling\n\nLong life-span\n\nEligible for RHI scheme\n\nWhich?, the consumer rights magazine, said that because heat pumps use electric power, they are not zero carbon unless the electricity comes from renewable sources like solar or wind, “but they are being seen as part of the answer to the energy crisis and the journey to net zero,” said The World Economic Forum.\n\n“It’s a home comfort issue. It’s a climate issue. It’s a security issue,” Alexander Gard-Murray, a climate change researcher and economist at Brown University, told The Washington Post. “Any one of them would be enough to move aggressively on heat pumps, but taken together I think the evidence is insurmountable.”\n\nWhat are the disadvantages?\n\nAlthough the government is setting aside £450m for the new subsidies, this will only cover the cost of replacing around 90,000 boilers. Homes also need to be well insulated to stay warm with the use of a heat pump, which not only adds to costs but the “high levels of insulation needed” is not “always possible in older, solid-walled homes common across the UK”, the BBC said.\n\nThe Independent reported that “energy experts estimate that nearly a fifth of homes, some 4.8 million, are suitable for a heat pump today while another 30%, or 8.4 million, need minimal changes such as loft and cavity wall insulation, which will also cut bills”.\n\nInstalling a heat pump “might not be the best option for your home, and the cost could be prohibitive”, said The Telegraph. “Although the technology is evolving, and is likely to improve significantly and fall in cost over the coming years, heat pumps are currently slower at heating cold homes than traditional boilers.”\n\nSpace could also be an issue because you’ll “need a place outside your home where a unit can be fitted to a wall or placed on the ground,” said the Energy Saving Trust. “It must have some space around it to allow a good flow of air.”\n\nSeven main disadvantages of heat pumps are, according to GreenMatch.co.uk:\n\nHigh upfront cost\n\nDifficult to install\n\nQuestionable sustainability\n\nRequires significant work\n\nIssues in cold weather\n\nNot entirely carbon neutral\n\nPlanning permissions required\n\nKevin McCloud, presenter of TV show Grand Designs, believes spending millions on heat pumps is a “classic pratfall”, The Telegraph reported. In an interview with the paper, McCloud said while heat pumps are “wonderful machines”, and he’s a “big fan”, Britain should be focusing on insulation, ventilation and shutters instead.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Rebecca Messina", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Devika Rao", "Harriet Marsden", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet"], "publish_date": "2021/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/25/uk/warm-banks-cost-of-living-crisis-intl-gbr-cmd/index.html", "title": "UK winter: As Britons buckle under the cost of living crisis, many ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nIn a community center in central London, a young child plays in a makeshift area as her caregiver rocks her stroller and chats to a friend.\n\nThe Oasis Centre in Waterloo sits in a four-story building that has a warm, inviting feeling, with plush chairs and lots of potted plants.\n\nBut it’s not your regular high street hangout. This is a haven for families and local people to escape the bitter squeeze of Britain’s cost-of-living crisis – if only for the afternoon.\n\nThe Oasis Centre in Waterloo, London, on December 1. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nThousands of warm banks have opened their doors across the UK this winter, as household budgets are squeezed even further by spiking energy bills and inflation reaches a 40-year high, leaving many scrambling to pay for basic necessities. There are more than 3,000 registered organizations running warm banks in Britain, according to the Warm Welcome Campaign, an initiative that signposts community-led responses to the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n“A lot of people are struggling,” Charlotte, a community and families worker at the center, tells CNN. Her full name is not being disclosed for privacy reasons.\n\n“We haven’t even really got to the peak of the living crisis yet,” the 33-year-old mother-of-four adds. “No one should be choosing whether to put food on the table or to put the heating on.”\n\nThe hub is funded by donations from individuals and local businesses, as well as grant incomes from charitable trusts.\n\nThe cost of living has risen sharply since early 2021, according to data from the UK government. From October 2021 to October 2022, domestic gas and electricity prices increased by 129% and 66% respectively, the same research found.\n\nThe average annual energy bill surged 96% from last autumn to £2,500 (roughly $3,000), with the UK government intervening to cap the unit cost of gas and electricity bills at that level until April 2023. However, the total amount consumers pay for their energy depends on their consumption habits, where they live, how they pay for energy and what type of meter they use, according to the UK’s regulator, Ofgem.\n\nA welcoming sign outside the Oasis Centre, an open to all communal area which acts as a 'warm bank', in London, on December 12. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nCharlotte, who works at and uses the warm space in Waterloo, says she limits her gas and electricity use in her flat. Instead of turning on the heating in the evening, she and her partner sit under quilts and use hot water bottles to stay warm, she says.\n\nShe also anticipates her household energy costs increasing over Christmas, as her children, who are between 4 and 17 years old, spend more time at home during the school holidays. At the moment, Charlotte spends most days at the hub and said this habit will continue over the holidays to help alleviate her costs at home.\n\n‘I had to cry out for help’\n\nGrace Richardson is an adult services manager at Future Projects in Norwich, in eastern England, an organization that offers health, housing and financial support to residents. She says her team started planning over the summer to provide a warm space in the organization’s Baseline Centre, located in an area with significant poverty.\n\n“This winter in particular, it’s extremely important that we’re offering a space that people can turn everything off at home and they can save money,” she tells CNN.\n\n“We’ve got people here working full time and they cannot make ends meet. That’s where the real difference is.”\n\nFrom young parents to pensioners to students in their 20s, Richardson says that people from all walks of life use the warm space, with about 25 attending each day. The warm bank, where staff serve meals, is subsidized by grant funding from the local council and private or corporate foundations, as well as donations from individuals.\n\nThe café space at Future Projects' Baseline Centre in Norwich. The Centre, which serves as a community space, is currently undergoing renovation. Courtesy Eddie Daniels\n\nMichael John Edward Easter, 57, says the service at the Baseline Centre has been a lifeline for him this winter.\n\nEaster, who has lymphedema in both legs and arthritis in one knee, is unable to work. Speaking to CNN earlier this month, he said he’d turned the heating on in his one-bedroom flat just twice so far this year to avoid spiking energy costs and compensate for a 50% increase in his weekly supermarket bill.\n\nHe says he “was in a mess” when he first reached out to the Baseline Centre in January for welfare advice, as he was dealing with mobility challenges and craved a sense of community.\n\n“I was so ashamed and embarrassed, but I had to cry out for help,” he says. “I needed help and I just didn’t know where to turn to. If I’m totally honest, I’m very lonely.”\n\nRichardson suggests the need for warm banks is a result of government inaction.\n\n“I think that it highlights just how far removed our government is right now from the reality of real life. I think it screams … the divide between us and them, it’s only getting wider,” she says. “We keep referring to this as a cost of living crisis, as though it’s a period of time we’re going to go through and we will come out the other side. Will we? It’s life or death.”\n\nA legacy of austerity\n\nEnergy prices have soared across Europe since fall 2021, driven in part by Russia’s war in Ukraine. But UK energy prices rose more sharply than in comparable economies such as France and Italy, analysts told CNN Business this summer.\n\nIn November, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt announced higher taxes and reduced public spending in an effort to heave the country out of a recession forecast to last just over a year and shrink its economy by just over 2%, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. The UK is the only G7 economy that remains smaller than it was before the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nSnow-covered roofs on terraced houses in Aldershot, UK, on December 12.

Jason Alden/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe UK government also announced an Energy Bill Support Scheme worth £400 per eligible household, which will partially subsidize domestic energy bills from winter 2022 to 2023, as well as providing extra financial support to help pensioners pay their heating costs this winter under the Winter Fuel Payment scheme.\n\nIn December more than one million households with prepayment meters did not redeem their monthly energy support vouchers – included in the government’s Energy Bill Support Scheme – the BBC reported.\n\nBut Michael Marmot, a lead researcher in epidemiology and health inequalities, says years of austerity, paltry government support, cuts to spending on social welfare and infrastructure, and a lack of regulation in the UK’s energy market have plunged millions into fuel poverty.\n\n“Poverty has been building up over the last dozen years and getting worse,” says Marmot, director of University College London’s Institute of Health Equity.\n\n“We look the worst in G7 countries, we’re the only one in terms of recovery … that hasn’t gone back to where we were pre-pandemic. This is mismanagement on a colossal scale.”\n\nAn estimated 3.69 million households in the UK were in fuel poverty as of December 2020 compared with 6.99 million households in December 2022, Simon Francis, who coordinates the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, told CNN.\n\nThis figure is set to steadily increase, with more than three-quarters of UK households – 53 million people – forecast to be in fuel poverty by the new year, according to research by the University of York in northern England.\n\nThe human rights organization Save the Children has distributed 2,344 direct grants to low-income families in the UK in the past year, the Guardian reported. The head of the charity also called on the government to provide more support for families, as it predicts acute financial hardship for millions in January.\n\n“What do you want a well-functioning society to do? At the minimum, people should be able to eat, to feed their families, have a safe dwelling … and a safe dwelling includes one that’s warm enough,” Marmot adds.\n\nFlyers advertising the warm spaces service alongside complimentary refreshments for visitors, at the Ashburton Hall community hub, operated by Greenwich Leisure Ltd., in Croydon, UK, on December 15. Jose Sarmento Matos/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nSusan Aitken, leader of Glasgow City Council in Scotland, says warm banks are “not a solution” to the cost of living crisis but rather “an emergency service.” The council has established more than 30 warm banks across the city in spaces including church halls, libraries, sports venues and cafes, and that number is expected to increase, according to Aitken. The service runs on council budgets and charitable donations.\n\n“The solution is for people to be able to stay in their own homes,” she says.\n\n“It’s bad enough that food banks have become a permanent fixture of communities across the UK now. To have places that people have to go to because they can’t afford to heat their own home is an absolute indictment (of government policy).”\n\nCNN has reached out to the UK government for comment, but it did not respond.\n\n‘Hidden form of poverty’\n\nBack at the Oasis Centre, locals show up for anything from knitting circles to after-school clubs offering free hot meals.\n\nSteve Chalke, the hub’s founder, says about 200 people use the facility daily for warmth. He says that he does not advertise the service as a warm bank because it is “dehumanizing.” Instead, he coordinates community-led events that are held in warm venues across the city.\n\n“The idea is to not inquire and to not ask,” he says. “It’s stigmatizing and it’s traumatizing, you know, so you end up feeling a non-person. So we want to take away that stigma in every way we can.”\n\nSteve Chalke, founder of the Oasis Centre, at the hub in Waterloo, London, on December 1. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nFrancis, the End Fuel Poverty Coalition coordinator, says one of the most significant challenges to curbing fuel poverty is removing the taboo that people may feel when asking for support.\n\n“I think one of the problems with fuel poverty … is it is quite a hidden form of poverty. People kind of … try and cover it up and try and get by,” he says. “We’re not going to know the full extent of the pain that people are suffering this winter, because there will be ways that people will disguise what it is that they’re doing.”\n\nThe mental health costs of fuel poverty are far-reaching, according to a 2020 report from the UCL Institute of Health Equity. The report said that young people living in cold homes are seven times more likely to have symptoms of poor mental health compared with those living in warm homes.\n\n“There’s surprisingly lots of people that do have work, but yet it’s not enough to keep afloat, at least without needing some help,” says Bintu Tijani, a mother-of-four who goes to the Oasis Centre at least three times a week to warm up. “It’s having a significant impact on people’s wellbeing, mental health and wellbeing.”\n\nA bleak Christmas\n\nLooking ahead to Christmas and the New Year, Francis says he is also concerned about the strain that treatment needed for medical conditions exacerbated or caused by cold weather will have on Britain’s National Health Service (NHS).\n\n“We’re still calling for the government to realize that if it doesn’t take action to support those who are the most vulnerable … it is going to see a huge increase in the number of people turning up at the NHS’ door to seek help because of the fact that they are now living in a cold, damp home and it is making them sick,” he says.\n\nBritain’s NHS is already under pressure amid staff shortages, historic nurses’ strikes over poor pay and working conditions, and a backlog of treatments resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAitken, the councilor in Glasgow, believes this Christmas will “be a pretty miserable time” for many.\n\n“A Christmas where you have to ration how long you can put your heating on in your home is not a good Christmas for anyone.”", "authors": ["Sana Noor Haq"], "publish_date": "2022/12/25"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/environment/956056/octoculture-world-first-octopus-farm-controversial", "title": "Octoculture: why is the world's first octopus farm so controversial ...", "text": "Octopus is eaten as a delicacy, mainly in the Mediterranean, the US and Asia.

In the Mediterranean, recent studies suggest that stocks are in a critical condition.\n\nBut now the Spanish company Nueva Pescanova is opening the world’s first commercial octopus farm at an inland site at Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. It aims to bring octopus meat to market by this summer, and to produce 3,000 tonnes by 2026 (10% of the amount landed by Spanish fishermen).\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The main one is sustaining its delicate larvae, which only eat live food and need a carefully controlled environment. As a result, “octoculture” has hitherto mostly involved “ranching”: growing wild-caught octopuses to market size in aquatic pens.\n\nPhysically, they aren’t well suited to being kept in confined spaces. Their boneless, eight-legged bodies have no fixed shape: the largest species, the Giant Pacific, can reach an arm span of six metres and a weight of 100 pounds, but can fit through openings an inch wide. Some have been known to lift their aquarium tank lids to escape, in some cases travelling over dry floors to the nearest drain.\n\nNueva Pescanova now thinks it has won the race to overcome these problems – beating competitors in Australia, Mexico and Japan. However, the firm’s plans have met with fierce resistance from campaigners and scientists.\n\nWhat are the objections?\n\nMany cite long-standing criticisms of factory farming and aquaculture: the stress and monotony of confinement; the high disease and mortality rates; the excessive use of antibiotics and pesticides.\n\nHowever, many concerns focus specifically on the octopuses themselves – which are “particularly ill-suited to a life in captivity and mass-production, for reasons both ethical and ecological”, according to “The Case Against Octopus Farming”, a much-cited 2019 paper in the journal Issues in Science and Technology.\n\nThe creatures consume about three times their weight in food a day, and are fed on mussels, prawns, crab and fish which could less wastefully be eaten by humans. They are highly territorial and anti-social by nature: they live in solitary dens, eat rival octopuses, and even mate from a distance (males extend a single arm with a sperm packet towards females). But perhaps the biggest criticism of farming them centres on their unique brains.\n\nWhat’s unusual about their brains?\n\nThere is no clear distinction between the octopus’s brain and its body. They have half a billion neurons – about as many as a dog (humans have one hundred billion) – two-thirds of which are in their arms. Each arm can intelligently act on its own, is capable of taste and smell, and exhibits short-term memory. Even a surgically detached arm can reach and grasp, avoid painful stimuli and, like fully formed octopuses, change colour; yet the central brain retains executive control of the arms.\n\nLast year, a UK government-commissioned review by the London School of Economics concluded that octopuses and squid are fully sentient, like vertebrates – i.e. they have the capacity to have feelings, such as pleasure, pain, distress or harm. The new Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill reflects this. The review also suggested a pre-emptive ban on farming octopus.\n\nHow intelligent are octopuses?\n\nThey’re amazingly bright: in the lab, they’ve been shown to be able to navigate mazes and unscrew jars and child-proof bottles to get food. They can solve problems, learn, use tools, and even show a capacity for mimicry, deception and – possibly – humour.\n\nOne study showed that once they’ve solved a novel problem – unscrewing a jar, say – they can retain a memory of the solution for at least five months. Research has also shown they can recognise individual humans and will respond differently to different people, greeting some with a caress of the arms, and spraying others with ink through their siphons.\n\nWhat do advocates of farming say?\n\nThey point to soaring demand: between 2010 and 2019, the global trade rose in value from $1.30bn to $2.72bn – though landings only rose by 9% in that time. “If we want to continue consuming octopus we have to look for an alternative... because fisheries have already reached their limit,” said Eduardo Almansa of Spain’s Oceanography Institute, which developed technology used by Nueva Pescanova.\n\nAnd octopuses do have some characteristics that make them attractive for aquaculture: their lifespans are short (usually one or two years), and they grow quickly.\n\nWhat’s the likely upshot?\n\nPlans for the farm are going ahead, but activists are pushing hard against it. “These animals are amazing,” said Dr Elena Lara of Compassion in World Farming. “So to put them in barren tanks... it’s wrong for them.” Popular awareness of octopuses’ intelligence and curiosity has been raised thanks to documentaries such as My Octopus Teacher.\n\n“People have this weird love affair with octopuses,” says biologist Rich Ross at the California Academy of Sciences, in San Francisco, who suggests double standards are at work. “I know those who would never eat them but have no qualms about eating pigs, and there’s abundant evidence that pigs are highly intelligent.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Richard Windsor", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Devika Rao", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/02/29/facebook-scam-imposters-use-facebook-messenger-lure-you-into-fraud/4891992002/", "title": "Friend or foe? Be on the alert for imposters and scammers on ...", "text": "Marc Saltzman\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nFacebook Messenger is a great way to keep up with friends and family, but it can also be a method for scammers to defraud you, so be aware.\n\nHere's a likely scenario from a recent real-life case: A note arrives over Facebook Messenger that appears to be from a friend – right down to their name and photo – so you have no reason to question otherwise, at least at first.\n\n“Hey Marc, how are ya?”\n\n“I’m well, thanks. You?” I replied, while sipping a coffee at a local café.\n\n“Good, thanks. In fact, really good. Did you hear about the money I received from the International Financial Corporation Grant?”\n\nAs this was the first time I received such a message, my response was sincere: “Wow, that’s great, congrats!” I figured it was something tied to my friend’s work, as he’s an educator who publishes reports on teaching techniques for those who have special needs.\n\nBut my “Spidey sense” started tingling with what came next: “You should apply, too, as they’re granting a lot of money before the end of their fiscal year end, coming up. Let me send you a link about it.”\n\nAt this point, I knew this was a scam. I blocked the person and reported the incident to Facebook, and I sent a note to my friend to let him know his account was comprised and cloned by a cybercriminal.\n\nHow to get a better night's sleep?:Keep your tech out of the bedroom\n\nBefore Nintendo and Atari:How a black engineer changed the video game industry forever\n\nSniffing out Facebook fraudsters\n\nSuch a fraudulent exchange – had it gone further – would send you to a phony website to type in your personal information, and you’d be contacted shortly thereafter with the good news: You’ve been approved for a $80,000 grant (the exact amount varies between reports). After a short while you’ll be approached to pay a small fee, such as $1,200, to release the funds into your account.\n\nUnfortunately, many fall for it. Even if the scammers are unsuccessful in defrauding you, you’ve just filled out a form with valuable personal information, which can be used for identity theft.\n\nFacebook is acutely aware of these scams and has removed more than 3.2 billion fake accounts between April and September 2019, compared with more than 1.5 billion during the same period last year, according to the company’s last Community Standards Enforcement Report published in November.\n\nTo sniff out phony accounts, the social media giant says it’s employing more artificial intelligence measures and other technologies, along with better reporting tools, and human review as an additional layer of defense.\n\nPlaying defense against cyberscams\n\nBut there are a few precautions you can take to prevent and thwart scammers:\n\n•Never accept an invitation from someone you don’t recognize – or worse, it just says “Facebook User” and there’s no photo.\n\n• Even if you do recognize the person, or if they’re already a Facebook friend, be suspicious when receiving these kinds of messages over Facebook Messenger. If you aren’t sure if it’s really your friend, contact them in another fashion – like a phone call, email or text message -- and confirm it was sent by them. Chances are, it won’t be.\n\n• Block the person who sent you the message and report them to Facebook right away from within Facebook Messenger. On the app, tap the little “i” tab, select “Block” and then tap “Something’s Wrong” to report it. On the desktop version, tap the Options (an icon of a small gear) to do the same. You can also send a message to Facebook at phish@fb.com.\n\n• Use common sense. Never pay for a “free” grant. If you must pay something to receive a grant, it’s a scam. And it’s not just grants; similar scams involve fake lotteries, loans, and requests for charitable donations.\n\n• Watch out for “distress scams,” too. This is where you get a message that appears to be from one of your Facebook friends, saying they need money because of a situation they got themselves into. When in doubt, contact them in another fashion.\n\n• Be suspicious of attachments, whether they are sent over Facebook Messenger or in an email or text. They may contain malware (malicious software). Be equally as cautious with links to a website. If you accidentally fall for it and land on a page that is supposed to look like Facebook – it may have a similar blue logo and familiar layout – you’ll see the URL will be different.\n\n• Scammers are getting increasingly sophisticated, as evidenced by cloning a friend’s page, and their spelling and grammar is getting better, too. (In the past, misspelled words and awkward phrasings were giveaways of fraudulent efforts.) Some friend requests are A.I. ‘bots, too, which can be difficult to tell.\n\n• Change your password. Often. Many of us are guilty of not regularly changing passwords or using the same password for most or all online activity.

At about 5 million tons, corn byproducts from ethanol plants represent the largest ingredient source in animal feeds.\n\nDeere buys California company that uses artificial intelligence to kill weeds, fertilize plants\n\nDeere will spend $305 million to buy a California tech company that uses “deep-learning algorithms” – similar to facial recognition programs – to better identify weeds that should be sprayed with herbicides and plants that need fertilizer.\n\nThe Moline, Ill.-manufacturer of tractors, combines and sprayers said Wednesday it entered into an agreement to buy Sunnyvale-based Blue River Technology.\n\nDeere said the company's 60 employees will remain in California. The sale is expected to close in September.\n\nBlue River Technology says on its Web site it uses cameras, computers and artificial intelligence, along with deep-learning algorithms that are similar to facial recognition programs, “to see every plant in the field.”\n\nThe companies said the technology will help growers save chemical costs by spraying individual plants instead of whole fields.\n\n“Blue River is advancing precision agriculture by moving farm management decisions from the field level to the plant level,” said Jorge Heraud, CEO of Blue River Technology, in a statement.\n\nU.S. farm income expected to climb 3.1 percent, after three years of decline\n\nAfter three years of decline, U.S. farm income is expected to climb to $63.4 billion this year, a 3.1 percent hike over 2016, a U.S. Department of Agriculture report last month shows.\n\nThe increase is thanks in part to improved prices for pigs, cattle and poultry, USDA said.\n\n\"Corn receipts are expected to decline for the fifth consecutive year,\" USDA said. \"Expected weakening of calendar-year corn prices more than offsets an expected increase in quantity sold, leading 2017 corn cash receipts to fall.\"\n\n\"Higher soybean receipts ... reflect higher soybean prices and an increase in quantities sold,\" the report said.\n\nIowa farm income tumbled nearly 50 percent to $2.6 billion last year from 2015, USDA said.\n\nIt's a 73 percent decline from 2011, when farm income in Iowa hit a high of $9.6 billion, following widespread drought.\n\nUniversity of Iowa insurance program earns national honor\n\nThe University of Iowa's Vaughan Institute of Risk Management is among 20 programs being honored nationally for offering an outstanding insurance education.\n\nThe university was the only Iowa school honored by the International Insurance Society, an organization that advocates for the insurance and risk management industry around the world.\n\nIn a news release, Thomas Berry-Stoelzle, associate professor of finance in the university's Tippie College of Business and faculty director of the institute, said the designation is particularly important in Iowa, where risk management and insurance is the second-largest segment of the state’s economy.\n\nThe designation recognized the Vaughan Institute’s \"rigorous and comprehensive risk management and insurance curriculum to prepare students for careers in the profession,\" according to the news release.\n\nThe Vaughan Institute program is available to any student of any major at the University of Iowa and helps those students by arranging internships, professional mentors and experiential consulting projects as part of the coursework. Students who successfully complete the program are awarded a risk management and insurance certificate.\n\nFarmers, environmentalists to has over how best to clean Iowa water\n\nDiscussions about how best to improve Iowa's water quality continues next week in Des Moines with two events:\n\n► The Environmental Defense Fund joins the Iowa Corn Growers and Iowa Soybean associations from 1-3 p.m. Monday at the Greater Des Moines Botanical Center.\n\nBill Northey, Iowa's agriculture secretary, will help kick off the event looking at \"collaborative conservation\" and agriculture’s role in land and water stewardship.\n\nA panel discussion will include northwest Iowa farmer Dean Meyer, who is a Corn Growers board member, and Dave Coppess, executive vice president of sales at Heartland Co-op. It will be moderated by Josette Lewis, an Environmental Defense Fund vice president.\n\nThe event is free, but RSVPs are required.\n\n► The Greater Des Moines Partnership will host a public policy forum discussion looking at water quality issues from 8-9:30 a.m. Thursday at the economic development group's office at 700 Locust St., Suite 100.\n\nDustin Miller, an attorney at Nyemaster Goode law firm, will moderate a panel featuring Roger Wolf, environmental programs director at the Iowa Soybean Association, Mike Naig, Iowa's Deputy Agriculture Secretary, and Jan Glendening, state director of The Nature Conservancy in Iowa.\n\nGo here to register for the free event.\n\nState Bank to acquire Peoples Trust & Savings Bank\n\nNew Hampton-based State Bank has announced an agreement to acquire Clive-based Peoples Trust & Savings Bank and its parent company, Green Circle Investments Inc.\n\nThe purchase price has not been released.\n\nPeoples Trust & Savings Bank has nine locations in central and western Iowa, including Adel, Clive, Grand Junction, Guthrie Center, Jefferson, Ogden, Rippey, Scranton and Waukee.\n\nState Bank President and CEO John Rigler said there were no immediate changes to rebranding planned at the Peoples Trust locations.\n\n\"This acquisition will give the organization locations in two of the most desirable parts of Iowa,\" a State Bank news release reads.\n\nRigler Investment Co., the parent company of State Bank, will acquire Green Circle's $325 million in assets. Once the acquisition is complete, the company will have more than $700 million in assets, making it one of the 25 largest community banking companies in Iowa, according to the news release.\n\nState Bank has eight locations in northeast Iowa, including Calmar, Charles City, Dike, Janesville, New Hampton, Ossian and two locations in Waverly.\n\n“Peoples Bank is very similar to State Bank in terms of shared customer values, size, focus on agricultural and commercial finance,” State Bank President and CEO John Rigler said in the news release.\n\nThe all-cash acquisition is subject to regulatory approval which is expected to happen in fall 2017.\n\nMuch-needed rain may be 'too little and too late' for some Iowa farmers\n\nIowa crops received much-needed rain last week, but \"unfortunately, it may be too little and too late for parts of south central and southeast Iowa,\" said Bill Northey, Iowa's secretary of agriculture.\n\nNorthey said southern Iowa had already \"seen significant crop damage due to drought.\"\n\nTopsoil moisture levels in south central and southeast Iowa remained over 90 percent short to very short, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Monday that looked at crop conditions through Sunday.\n\n\"Hopefully, the rains and cool weather are helping boost corn and bean yields in other parts of the state,” Northey said.\n\nStatewide, topsoil moisture levels improved to 50 percent short or very short, The remainder of the state had either adequate or surplus moisture.\n\nSixty-one percent of Iowa's corn crop was rated in good to excellent condition; soybean conditions improved slightly to 58 percent good to excellent.\n\nLivestock conditions have been ideal with the cooler temperatures. However, available water supplies in ponds and creeks remains an issue for some producers and supplemental feeding has been required, the report said.\n\nIowa's unemployment taxes will go down in 2018\n\nUnemployment insurance taxes for Iowa employers will decrease an average of 25 percent on 2018 wages, Iowa Workforce Development announced Friday.\n\nIn a news release, the agency credited the strength of Iowa's unemployment insurance trust fund, unemployment contributory wages and target levels of the unemployment insurance contributory wages for bringing taxes down. Annual rates paid by employers are determined by a formula.\n\n“This shift is a clear signal that the integrity of our unemployment insurance trust fund is solvent and strong,” IWD Director Beth Townsend said in the news release. “A decrease in taxes to employers is a positive factor that can contribute to economic growth in the state.”\n\nIn 2018, IWD says Iowa employers will fall in the second-most favorable tax table of eight possible options.\n\nDelta Dental grants support Iowa oral health projects\n\nThe Delta Dental of Iowa Foundation awarded $112,800 to four groups that work to improve the oral health of Iowans.\n\nThe recipients included:\n\nIowa Dental Foundation in Johnston received $25,000 to support the Iowa Mission of Mercy, a two-day free dental clinic for people who face challenges receiving dental care.

The company must also hire a technology officer to monitor and manage software and application security updates.\n\n“Companies that collect or store personal data must understand that they need to protect it,” the attorney general said in a news release. “Data breaches like this expose consumers to identity theft, financial harm, a loss of privacy, and added stress.”\n\nGoogle resources to aid small businesses at the Iowa State Fair\n\nGoogle and the Iowa Small Business Development Centers will offer free assistance to small businesses looking to grow their online presence throughout the duration of the Iowa State Fair.\n\nBusiness owners can visit Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate's booth inside the Varied Industries Building. There, SBDC staff will help verify business information and create a website in less than 10 minutes, Pates said in a news release.\n\nThe secretary of state's office, which processes all new business filings, is an official partner of Google’s “Get Your Business Online” program that helps new and existing businesses increase their digital footprint.\n\n“Small businesses using advanced digital tools are nearly three times as likely to reach more customers, reach new markets, and create jobs,” Whitney Cox, manager with Small Business Outreach at Google, said in the news release. “Yet, less than one in five small businesses in Iowa have a listing on a search engine. Our goal is to help Iowa businesses tap into this growth.\"\n\nDes Moines crop insurance startup snags $8 million investment\n\nCrop Pro Insurance, a Des Moines insurance and technology firm, snagged $8 million in financing from Finistere Ventures, Seed 2 Growth Ventures and GuideOne Insurance, a West Des Moines insurer.\n\nCrop Pro says it will use the investment to expand its team and speed product and service development that bridges \"the gap between agricultural and financial technologies.\"\n\nCrop Pro says it's the first \"ag venture-funded insurance provider\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture has given a green-light to provide crop insurance products to farmers.\n\nCrop Pro Chairman Billy Rose co-founded the company with President Joe Young.\n\nThe team has extensive experience in both the agriculture industry as a whole and the Federal Crop Insurance Program specifically, with experience in insurance operations at The Climate Corp., Crop 1 Insurance and John Deere Insurance Co.\n\nFinistere Ventures is a California-based agricultural technology and life sciences venture capital investor. Chicago-based Seed 2 Growth Ventures is a multi-stage venture fund investing in U.S. food and agriculture.\n\nDuPont-Dow plan to close $150 billion merger Aug. 31\n\nDuPont and Dow Chemical, saying they've cleared all the necessary regulatory hurdles, plan to close their merger after markets close Aug. 31.\n\nDuPont is the parent of Pioneer, the Johnston-based seed company.\n\nDow and DuPont shares will cease trading Aug. 31, the companies said Friday. Shares of DowDuPont, under the stock ticker symbol \"DWDP,\" will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange Sept. 1.\n\nThe companies plan to spinoff three companies ― focused on agriculture, material science and specialty products ― within 18 months of closing.\n\nFour activist investors are threatening to join forces to thwart the spinoff plans.\n\nIf successful, the activist investors — including longtime DuPont foe Nelson Peltz — could force the united DowDuPont to split into as many as six separate businesses.\n\nThe coalition is pushing for DowDuPont to create more spinoffs that will be leaner and more focused.\n\nAlliant Energy's doubles down on wind, pushing investment to $1.8 billion\n\nAlliant Energy said its Iowa company wants to invest $890 million to add 500 megawatts of wind energy, generating enough juice to power 215,000 homes.\n\nThe company received approval last year to build 500 megawatts in Iowa. Combined, the two projects would total $1.8 billion, said Interstate Power & Light, Alliant's Iowa company.\n\nThe Cedar Rapids utility seeks approval for the project from the Iowa Utilities Board.\n\n“Iowa is a renewable energy powerhouse because of companies like Alliant Energy plugging into our state,\" said Gov. Kim Reynolds in a statement.\n\nAlliant said the \"fuel cost-savings and tax credits more than offset the cost of project, resulting in net benefits to our Iowa customers.\"\n\nThe utility said it expects to get more than one-third of its Iowa energy mix from wind by 2020.\n\nIowa received 36.6 percent of its total energy generation power from wind last year, more than any other state in the nation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\n“Iowa has seen tremendous benefits from the expansion of the wind energy industry in our state,\" said Bill Northey, Iowa's agriculture secretary.\n\nAlliant said the two wind projects will create hundreds of jobs and generate \"tens of millions of dollars in additional property taxes and payments to landowners.\"\n\nIowa business filings set new record\n\nNew business filings in Iowa reached record levels during the most recent fiscal year, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate reported in a news release Thursday.\n\nPate's office received filings for 21,240 new businesses between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017.\n\nThe state's previous record, set during the prior fiscal year, was 20,155 filings. Twenty years ago during his prior term as secretary of state, Pate said the state handled about 9,000 new business filings annually.\n\n“This shows the entrepreneurial spirit of Iowans continues to thrive, and that is good news for the state,” Pate said in the news release. “Small business is the backbone of our economy. This data shows more entrepreneurs are taking chances with their capital and investing in startups across the state.”\n\nReynolds argues for stronger federal support for advanced biofuels\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds and other renewable fuels advocates said the federal mandate requiring ethanol and biodiesel to be blended into the nation's fuel supply has helped farmers at a time when they're struggling to post profits.\n\n\"As the current ag economy experiences a downturn, sustainable and predictable renewable fuels markets are incredibly impactful to the bottom line of farmers and rural Iowa,\" said Reynolds, among several state and national leaders testifying in Washington, D.C., Tuesday, on the Renewable Fuel Standard.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency held the hearing on its proposed renewable fuel levels for 2018.\n\nSeveral leaders, holding a news conference Tuesday, said the proposed levels for cellulosic ethanol, considered the next generation of renewable fuel, are too low and could curtail future investment.\n\nIowa is home to two large plants — in Emmetsburg and Nevada — that use corn husks, stalks and other residue to make advanced ethanol.\n\nAnd a western Iowa plant makes cellulosic ethanol using corn kernel fiber.\n\n\"It creates opportunity in the Heartland for farmers, but also for researchers, investors and for creation of new jobs in production facilities,\" said Jan Koninckx, global business director of advanced biofuels at DuPont, which owns the Nevada cellulosic plant.\n\nThe proposed standard drops cellulosic ethanol levels 73 million gallons to 238 million gallons in 2018.\n\nLeaders also criticized the proposed biomass-based diesel requirements that left the 2019 mandate at the 2018 level of 2.1 billion gallons.\n\n\"In 2016, the U.S. diesel market consumed 2.8 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel,\" Reynolds said. \"I therefore question the proposed 2.1 billion gallon level.\"\n\n\"There is simply no question that there are ample American feedstocks and U.S. capacity to justify a much larger biodiesel number under the law,\" she said.\n\nReynolds said 3.5 percent — or $4.6 billion — of Iowa’s economy was tied to the renewable fuels industry in 2015.\n\nDry conditions deepen in Iowa, with half of state in need of rain\n\nDry conditions continued in Iowa last week, with half the topsoil moisture in the state short or very short, a report Monday shows.\n\nThe state received only scattered reports of rainfall last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The report looks at crop conditions through Sunday.\n\nParts of south central Iowa were considered under severe drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, released last week.\n\nNinety-eight percent of topsoil moisture in south central Iowa was short to very short; 89 percent in the southeast; and 83 percent in the northwest.\n\n“Much of the state remains very dry with farmers looking for a good soaking rain, especially as we enter August, a critically important time for soybeans,” said Bill Northey, Iowa's secretary of agriculture.\n\nSoybean conditions decreased slightly with 12 percent poor to very poor; 28 percent fair; 51 percent good and 9 percent excellent.\n\nCorn conditions also declined to 10 percent poor to very poor; 25 percent fair; 52 percent good and 13 percent excellent.\n\nFinancial stress, isolation contribute to high U.S. farmer suicide rate\n\nU.S. farmers and farm workers are more likely to commit suicide than workers in other industries, with financial stress, isolation and poor access to health-care contributing to the problem, a new University of Iowa study shows.\n\nThe study examined suicides and homicides among farmers and agricultural workers across the country from 1992 to 2010 and found 230 farmers committed suicide during that time, an annual suicide rate that ranged from 0.36 per 100,000 farmers to 0.95 per 100,000.\n\nThe rate was well above that of workers in all other occupations, which never exceeded 0.19 per 100,000 during the same time period, said study co-author Corinne Peek-Asa, professor of occupational and environmental health in the UI College of Public Health.\n\nStill, the number of suicides remain lower than the 1980s farm crisis, when more than 1,000 farmers took their own lives because they were losing their farms to foreclosure.\n\nThe survey found farmers in the West were more likely to commit suicide, at 43 percent of total farmer suicides, followed by the Midwest, 37 percent; South, 13 percent; and Northeast, 6 percent.\n\nPeek-Asa says farmers are different from workers in most other fields in that their work is a significant part of their identity, not just a job.\n\nWhen the farm faces difficulties, many see it as a sign of personal failure.\n\n“They struggle with their ability to carve out the role they see for themselves as farmers. They can’t take care of their family; they feel like they have fewer and fewer options and can’t dig themselves out,” Peek-Asa says. “Eventually, suicide becomes an option.”\n\nIn addition to financial issues, especially during economic crises or periods of extreme weather, farmers face an array of other stresses that put them at high risk for suicide: physical isolation from a social network, leading to loneliness; physical pain from the arduous work of farming; and lack of available health care resources in rural areas, especially mental health care.\n\nPeek-Asa said other research also suggests that exposure to chemical insecticides causes depression in some people.\n\nIowa awards $2.6 million to Hy-Vee's Ankeny project\n\nThe Iowa Economic Development Authority board on Friday awarded more than $2.6 million in tax credits and refunds to Hy-Vee Inc. and its subsidiary, Perishable Distributors of Iowa.\n\nThe money, paired with about $3.6 million in expected support from Ankeny, will help fund an $86 million expansion of Hy-Vee's behind-the-scenes operation near the intersection of SE Oralabor Road and SE Delaware Avenue.\n\nThat includes a new $64 million facility that will house the grocer's central bakery and produce prepared foods and meal kits and a $21.6 million expansion of PDI's existing warehouse space at the site.\n\nHy-Vee's new facility is expected to create 209 new jobs. But only nine positions qualified for state incentives, meaning they must pay at least $27.92 per hour. PDI's expansion is expected to create one new job.\n\nAll told, the Hy-Vee companies will receive about $6.3 million taxpayer funds from state and local sources. The Ankeny City Council will consider its portion of the incentives at a special hearing at 5:30 p.m. July 31.\n\nTrump nominates Clovis to lead USDA research agency\n\nSam Clovis, a conservative activist in Iowa, has been nominated as under secretary for research, education and economics at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nClovis has worked in USDA on President Trump's transition team and served as chief policy adviser to the Trump campaign.\n\nThe college economics professor was a 2014 candidate for state treasurer and was a one-time radio talk-show host.\n\nClovis' nomination has generated debate, given his skepticism over climate change.\n\nHe told Iowa Public Radio in 2014 that \"I've looked at the science and I have enough of a science background to know when I’m being 'boofed.'\n\n\"I think a lot of what we see is ‘junk science’, so I’m a skeptic,” he said.\n\nU.S. Ag Secretary Sonny Perdue said Clovis was \"one of the first people through the door at USDA\" in January and has become a \"trusted adviser and steady hand.\"\n\n\"He looks at every problem with a critical eye, relying on sound science and data, and will be the facilitator and integrator we need,\" Perdue said in a statement.\n\nTrump also nominated Ted McKinney, director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture, as under secretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, a newly created position.\n\nDrought fears mount for Iowa farmers with little rain\n\nFarmers need rain, given mounting concerns about drought, especially in southeast Iowa, says Ag Secretary Bill Northey.\n\nOver half of southeast Iowa’s topsoil — and a third of its subsoil — rated very short of moisture, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report that looked at growing conditions through Sunday.\n\nParts of south-central, southeast and northwest Iowa are considered in a moderate drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, released Thursday.\n\nAbout half the state is considered abnormally dry, it shows.\n\n“We have seen continued dry weather throughout much of the state and many producers\" need moisture, Northey said Monday.\n\nStatewide, about 40 percent of Iowa's topsoil moisture levels rated short to very short; 58 percent adequate and 2 percent surplus. Twenty-nine percent of subsoil moisture levels rated short to very short, 69 percent adequate and 2 percent surplus.\n\nSeven percent of Iowa’s corn crop has reached the silking stage, six days behind the five-year average. Seventy-seven percent of the corn crop was rated good to excellent condition.\n\nOne-third of the soybean crop was blooming, with 5 percent of soybeans setting pods, three days ahead of average. Soybean condition rated 67 percent good to excellent.\n\nRain fell late Sunday into Monday morning from about Mason City to Burlington, providing 1 to 2 inches of precipitation, said Iowa Climatologist Harry Hillaker.\n\nThe rain, however, came too late to be included in Monday's USDA report.\n\nAmes biotech symposium looks at preventing animal disease\n\nA symposium will be held in Ames July 19 looking at the role of biotechnology in preventing animal diseases such as bird flu.\n\nThe \"Animal Health In the Heartland: Ensuring A Safe Food Supply\" symposium will explore issues ranging from wildlife threats to livestock herds to the effectiveness of vaccines.\n\nThe Iowa Biotechnology Association and Bio Nebraska are sponsoring the event, which will be held at the Scheman Building at Iowa State University.\n\nActivities begin July 18 with a tour of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Centers for Animal Health in Ames.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor the first time, chimpanzees were spotted capturing insects and applying them to their own wounds, as well as the wounds of others, possibly as a form of medication.\n\nThis behavior of one animal applying medication to the wounds of another has never been observed before, and it may be a sign of helpful tendencies in chimpanzees similar to empathy in humans, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers witnessed multiple instances of this behavior within a community of about 45 chimpanzees at the Loango National Park in Gabon, as part of the Ozouga Chimpanzee Project.\n\nThe goal of the project, led by primatologist Tobias Deschner and cognitive biologist Simone Pika, is to study the relationships and interactions between the chimps as well as how they hunt, use tools, communicate and flex their cognitive skills. The findings published Monday in the journal Current Biology.\n\nBears, elephants and even bees have been known to self-medicate against parasites and illness.\n\n“Self-medication — where individuals use plant parts or non-nutritional substances to combat pathogens or parasites — has been observed across multiple animal species including insects, reptiles, birds and mammals,” said Pika, study author and professor of comparative biocognition, at the University of Osnabrück’s Institute of Cognitive Science in Germany, in a statement.\n\n“Our two closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, for instance, swallow leaves of plants with anthelmintic (antiparasitic) properties and chew bitter leaves that have chemical properties to kill intestinal parasites.”\n\nBut this is the first recorded instance of animals applying other animal matter – the insects – to open wounds.\n\n“Chimpanzees eat insects but we did not know that they catch and use them to treat their wounds,” Pika said. “Hence, they not only have an understanding of their food species (plants, insects, monkeys, birds, reptiles) but probably also about characteristics of other animal species that help to act against injuries.”\n\nCare in a chimpanzee community\n\nThe discovery was initially made when project volunteer Alessandra Mascaro watched an interaction between a mother chimp, Suzee, and her son Sia, in 2019. Sia had an injured foot, and Suzee appeared to be tending to it.\n\n“I noticed that she appeared to have something between her lips that she then applied to the wound on Sia’s foot,” Mascaro said in a statement. “Later that evening, I re-watched my videos and saw that Suzee had first reached out to catch something which she put between her lips and then directly onto the open wound on Sia’s foot.”\n\nAbout a week later, it happened again when doctoral student Lara Southern watched adult male chimp Freddy doing something similar. The team surmised that the chimps were capturing tiny flying insects from the air.\n\nOver the next year, the researchers closely watched and filmed all of the chimps that showed signs of injury and recorded 22 chimps applying insects to their own wounds.\n\nThen, Southern witnessed chimps tending to each other.\n\n“An adult male, Littlegrey, had a deep open wound on his shin, and Carol, an adult female, who had been grooming him, suddenly reached out to catch an insect,” Southern said in a statement. “What struck me most was that she handed it to Littlegrey, he applied it to his wound and subsequently Carol and two other adult chimpanzees also touched the wound and moved the insect on it. The three unrelated chimpanzees seemed to perform these behaviours solely for the benefit of their group member.”\n\nThis happened again when another adult male also tended to Littlegrey’s thumb about four months later.\n\nThe team cataloged 76 cases of chimps using insects on their wounds and the wounds of others over 15 months, from November 2019 to February 2021.\n\nHelping one another\n\nTending to others is prosocial, or positive behavior that is in the interest of helping others – something that isn’t often observed in animals.\n\n“This is, for me, especially breathtaking because so many people doubt prosocial abilities in other animals,” Pika said. “Suddenly we have a species where we really see individuals caring for others.”\n\n“Prosocial behaviours have long posed a problem for evolutionary theory, because it was not immediately clear why organisms might help others in the face of selection operating in the interest of self,” the authors wrote in the study.\n\nIt’s difficult to say if what the chimps are doing is motivated by empathy, but the researchers were surprised to see that the chimps recognized that how they treat their own wounds can be applied to others and helped one another even if they weren’t related.\n\n“We do not know whether the observed behavior involves empathy,” Pika said. “We know that it may qualify as prosocial behaviour, meaning it may increase the welfare of another animal – feeling better via the social attention and caring, or via substances in the saliva-insect mix that may be soothing or anti-inflammatory. There are examples of chimpanzees adopting and rescuing other chimpanzees, which may involve empathy.”\n\nChimpanzees have long shown that they benefit from cooperation when taking on activities like territorial patrols or hunting, but researchers remain divided on if chimpanzees can be considered proscial or empathetic.\n\n“Our observations may add another facet to the ongoing debate on prosocial behaviors and inspire future studies investigating the behaviours surrounding wound care and the potential medicative function of insect-application,” the authors wrote in the study.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nIt’s possible that the insects the chimps are using have antiseptic or anti-inflammatory properties to soothe the pain of their injuries and promote healing. There is a long history of humans using insects for these same purposes dating back to 1,400 BC, the researchers said. They also can’t rule out that this is potentially more of a placebo effect.\n\nPrevious research has shown that some behaviors in chimpanzees, like using tools, is a learned behavior. Perhaps medicating and helping others is one of those practices passed among the group, too.\n\nNext, the Ozouga researchers wants to identify the insects the chimps are using and closely follow which of the animals seem motivated to help others in their community. They also want to study the insects to see if they have any pharmaceutical properties and determine if the use of the insects helped heal the wounds.\n\n“It is just fascinating to see that after decades of research on wild chimpanzees they still surprise us with unexpected new behaviours,” Deschner said in a statement. “Our study shows that there is still a lot to explore and discover about our closest living relatives, and we therefore need to still put much more effort into protecting them in their natural habitat.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/business/elon-musk-neuralink-animal-cruelty-intl-scli/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk's Neuralink confirms monkeys died in project, denies ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nElon Musk’s implant company Neuralink, which aims to enable brains to connect and communicate with computers, has acknowledged that monkeys died as part of its testing procedures, but denies allegations of animal cruelty.\n\nIn a blog post on its website, ​Neuralink addressed the “recent articles” that have “raised questions around Neuralink’s use of research animals at the University of California, Davis Primate Center” (UC Davis) and said that “all novel medical devices and treatments must be tested in animals before they can be ethically trialed in humans.”\n\nMacaque monkeys have been used in testing by Neuralink as the company has been developing Bluetooth-enabled implantable chips – inserted into the monkey’s brains – that ​the company says can communicate with computers via a small receiver.\n\nIn April last year, Neuralink claimed monkeys can play Pong – a computer game - using just their minds when it released a video of Pager, a male macaque, moving a cursor onscreen without using a joystick to do so.\n\n​The company said this was achieved after the Neuralink chip fed the information from the monkey’s neurons into a decoder, which was then used to predict Pager’s intended hand movements – allowing the output from the decoder to be used to move the cursor, instead of Pager manipulating the joystick.\n\nThe statement by Neuralink comes after the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine – a US non-profit ​that advocates alternatives to animal testing – sent a letter to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) referencing violations and requesting an investigation into what it called “apparent egregious violations of the Animal Welfare Act related to the treatment of monkeys used in invasive brain experiments.”\n\nThe document says the experiments were carried out pursuant to contractual agreements between UC Davis and Neuralink. In the letter, which spans more than 700 pages, the Physicians Committee said records it obtained for the 23 monkeys used in the experiments reflect a “pattern of extreme suffering and staff negligence.” The committee said that the letter to the USDA is based on nearly 600 pages of what it calls “disturbing” documents released after the committee filed an initial public records lawsuit in 2021.\n\nThe Physicians Committee said in a press release on February 10 that UC Davis received more than $1.4 million in funding from Neuralink to carry out the experiments on the macaque monkeys.\n\nCNN has contacted UC Davis and the Board of Regents for comment. In a statement to KCRA 3, UC Davis spokesperson Andy Fell said: “The research protocols were thoroughly reviewed and approved by the campus’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).” Fell added: “The work was conducted by Neuralink researchers in facilities at the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis. UC Davis staff provided veterinary care including round-the-clock monitoring of experimental animals. When an incident occurred, it was reported to the IACUC, which mandated training and protocol changes as needed.”\n\nElon Musk's company, Neuralink, denies accusations of animal cruelty in its testing procedures. Action Press/Shutterstock\n\nOn February 10, the Physicians Committee ​says they filed a second public records lawsuit to compel the university to release videos and photographs of the monkeys. Neuralink is not part of the lawsuit.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the committee alleges that staff at the university “removed pieces of the skulls of rhesus macaque monkeys and inserted electrodes into the animals’ brains.”\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that monkeys were not provided with adequate veterinary care and that an “unapproved substance” known as BioGlue “killed monkeys by destroying portions of their brains.”\n\nIn Neuralink’s blog, the company said there was “one surgical complication involving the use of the FDA-approved product (BioGlue),” and the monkey was euthanized.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the committee further alleges that the University of California has ​declined to release photos and videos ​of the experiments, saying the records belong to Neuralink, a private company not subject to California’s Public Records Act.\n\nIn ​a statement posted to Neuralink’s website, Neuralink said the company is “absolutely committed to working with animals in the most humane and ethical way possible.”\n\nIt also said that its “central mission is to design an animal care program prioritizing the needs of the animals, rather than the typical strategy of building for human convenience alone.”\n\nNeuralink said “the use of every animal was extensively planned and considered to balance scientific discovery with the ethical use of animals.” In reference to the claims of ​euthanasia by the Physicians Committee, Neuralink stated that “two animals were euthanized at planned end dates to gather important histological data, and six animals were euthanized at the medical advice of the veterinary staff at UC Davis.”\n\nNeuralink said it ​made the decision to partner with UC Davis in 2017 to conduct animal-based research. In 2020, Musk’s company opened an in-house 6,000-square-foot vivarium to house farm animals and rhesus macaques​, according to Neuralink’s statement.\n\nNeuralink said in the statement that it is “never satisfied with the current standards for animal well being and we will always push ourselves to do more for the animals that are contributing so much to humanity.”\n\nJeremy Beckham, research advocacy coordinator with the Physicians Committee, said in the press release that documents used by the committee in its letter to the USDA “reveal that monkeys had their brains mutilated in shoddy experiments and were left to suffer and die.”\n\nNeuralink has previously said that the goal of their research was to enable a person with paralysis to be able to use a device like a computer or phone using only brain activity.", "authors": ["Hannah Ryan"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/10/animation-behind-bars-elliott-elk-beagle-bill-news-around-states/40105781/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A free music festival held in the city’s downtown the past four years is being canceled. A statement from DMG Productions Inc. says the TenSixty festival won’t be held next month as expected. The statement blames a lack of sponsor money for the decision and says organizers hope to resume the festival in the future. TenSixtyFive began in October 2015 after the abrupt cancellation of the BayFest festival in Mobile. Organizers pulled the replacement event together in just a few weeks, and it’s been held annually since. Acts last year included Big Boi, Walker Hayes and Wet Willie. The statement says more than 100,000 people attended over four years.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Russian adventurer Anatoly Kazakevich sailed into town on a double-hulled inflatable sailboat last week, completing the last leg of an 8,000-mile journey from the Siberian city of Irkutsk. Kazakevich and his crew, which ranged between two and six members along the route, sailed the inflatable catamaran Iskatel across the North Pacific Ocean to Homer, Alaska, last year. After wintering in south-central waters, the Iskatel (which means “searcher”) brought Kazakevich to Sitka last week to mark the completion of his Baikal-Alaska Expedition. Kazakevich described his journey as a “historical geography expedition” and said that “before us, nobody did this (route) for 150 years.” Colonial-era journeys of Russian explorers in the 18th and 19th centuries were the inspiration for Kazakevich’s expedition. Many places in Alaska still bear the names of those Russians.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Unfortunately for Wildcats and Sun Devils, neither school can claim bragging rights this year over which sits above the other in the most high-profile college rankings. Arizona State University and University of Arizona tied for 117th place in the 2020 list of Best National Universities from U.S. News & World Report, which compiles annual lists assessing universities across the country. But ASU did achieve one distinction: The school was again named the most innovative university in the country, for the fifth year running. U.S. News ranks colleges on a variety of factors, including student outcomes, faculty resources, expert opinions on the schools, financial resources, student excellence and alumni donations.\n\nArkansas\n\nRussellville: The City Council is forming a committee to evaluate applications for a new casino, even though Pope County has already made its pick on an applicant. Arkansas voters in 2018 authorized four casinos in the state: two at racetracks in Hot Springs and West Memphis and two in Jefferson and Pope counties. The Jefferson County casino is already under construction, but the process in Pope County has been slowed by challenges. Last month, the Pope County Quorum Court endorsed a proposal from the Cherokee National Businesses, but leaders in Russellville say they want a say in the process. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the council voted Thursday to establish a seven-member committee to review proposals. The state Racing Commission has set a Nov. 18 deadline to receive casino license applications.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Thousands of tourists could soon be forced to make reservations and pay to drive the famously crooked Lombard Street. California lawmakers approved a bill last week granting San Francisco the power to establish a toll and reservation system for Lombard Street. The bill still needs Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature. The San Francisco County Transportation Authority has recommended $5 per car on weekdays and $10 on weekends and holidays. Residents say the scenic street has become more like an overcrowded amusement park than a neighborhood street. They have been calling for years for officials to address traffic jams, trash and trespassing. Tourism officials estimate 6,000 people daily visit the 600-foot-long street in the summer, creating lines of cars stretching for blocks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A utility company is moving ahead with plans for a wind energy project on the eastern Colorado plains. Xcel Energy-Colorado plans to complete the 500-megawatt Cheyenne Ridge Wind Project in December 2020. The $743 million project will cover some 150 square miles in Cheyenne and Kit Carson counties. The Denver Post reports Xcel has selected Minneapolis-based development company Mortenson to build the wind farm. Mortenson previously built the 600-megawatt Rush Creek Wind Project in eastern Colorado. Denmark-based Vestas will supply 229 wind turbines for Cheyenne Ridge. Xcel Energy proposes to eliminate all of its carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Colorado officials seek to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 90% of 2005 levels by 2050.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: Highway signs listing attractions in southeastern Connecticut have remained blank for about a year. The Day newspaper reports state plans show there are 17 large blue signs in both directions on Interstate 95 between North Stonington and New London, plus smaller signs on the exit ramps. The Connecticut Department of Transportation first held signage meetings in Stonington and Groton in 2016. Blank attractions signs were installed last year. The DOT says the designs for the panels were not ready before the signs were installed, and it had to approve custom logos. Residents asked the newspaper about the blank signs earlier this year. The firm hired by the state to install the signs, Quaker Corporation, says it hopes the panels listing the attractions will be up in the next month.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes Beach: Hurricane Dorian has come and gone, but some animals are still feeling its impact. Ferocious winds and crashing waves stirred by the hurricane swept a higher-than-average number of animals ashore along the Delaware coast, according to the Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute. “Whenever we get a large storm like that, the wave energy and the wind direction can push animals in that are either deceased or debilitated,” says Suzanne Thurman, executive director of MERR. Among the stranded animals were six loggerhead sea turtles, five of which were found dead. However, a female loggerhead weighing about 275 pounds was discovered alive at Lewes Beach. The animal had what was thought to be a pre-existing shell injury caused by a boat propeller, according to Thurman.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A black-owned funeral parlor was handling up to 140 funerals per year during its peak from the 1950s through the 1980s. The Washington Post reports the Hall Brothers Funeral Home only handled four funerals last year, the number driven low by clientele who either died or were driven out by gentrification. The parlor’s owner, 77-year-old Richard Ables, says of the neighborhood: “If we saw a white person, we’d ask, ‘What are you doing here?’ Now it’s the opposite.” Ables sold the property housing the dying business Wednesday, nearly 80 years after it was founded by his uncles. The newspaper notes the parlor was the last of its kind along its corridor, which is now home to an increasing number of young, white professionals.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiramar Beach: A bottle containing four $1 bills, a couple of notes and a man’s ashes is back on its journey, returning to the sea after making a brief stop at a coastal community in the Panhandle. The bottle carries the ashes of a 39-year-old Florida man who died earlier this year and whose family wanted to give him an adventure. The bottle began drifting off the shore of Destin before washing ashore 20 miles down the coast. It was turned in to the Walton County Sheriff’s Office. That’s when Sgt. Paula Pendleton got a hold of it and read the notes in the bottle, from the man’s mother and his daughter. Pendleton lost her husband last year and was touched. On Friday, a friend with a boat took the bottle far into the Gulf to let it continue its journey.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State lawmakers are again exploring the idea of new legalized gambling to help fund the HOPE scholarship program. If gambling in the state is expanded, the type of activity allowed will greatly determine how much money can be raised. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that casino gambling brought in record numbers last year, but the thoroughbred horse racing industry is shrinking. Experts say sports betting’s impact would be minimal. State lawmakers are studying the potential for economic benefits with expanded gambling. Adding horse racing or casino gambling in the state would require Georgians to approve a constitutional amendment allowing the expansion.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Scientists say lava from the Kilauea volcanic eruption has triggered an algae bloom seen from outer space. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports satellite images of the Big Island eruption showed green water around where the lava was entering the ocean. Scientists from the University of Hawaii and the University of Southern California say their research on the event was published in Thursday’s edition of the journal Science. They say they conducted water chemistry tests to record the biological response to lava flowing into the ocean within days of the 2018 eruption. The tests signaled large amounts of chlorophyll, the green pigment in algae and other plants responsible for converting light into energy. Scientists say the lava fueled microscopic life, formed land and was just as creative as destructive.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An elk named Elliott who befriended archery elk hunters at a campground has been captured by state officials who are looking for a permanent home for him. Idaho Department of Fish and Game spokesman Evin Oneale tells the Idaho Statesman that Elliott was captured last week. Officials say someone bottle-fed Elliott as a calf earlier this year near the central Idaho town of Sweet, and he became habituated to humans. Fish and Game captured and relocated Elliott to central Idaho hoping he would join an elk herd in the area, but he instead chose to be with people. Hunter Trevor Chadwick says Elliott greeted him and other elk hunters at their campsite. Chadwick says hunters didn’t want to shoot Elliott because he was tame, and it wouldn’t be ethical.\n\nIllinois\n\nMount Pulaski: The Mount Pulaski Courthouse State Historic Site will celebrate the city’s annual fall festival next weekend. The courthouse is one of two buildings still standing where Abraham Lincoln practiced law as a circuit-riding attorney before he became president. Many festival activities will be held near the courthouse square. The courthouse will be open from noon to 6 p.m. Friday and all day Saturday except during the festival parade, which begins at 4 p.m. The festival will feature vintage games, wheat weaving and spinning, a hand-quilting demonstration and a discussion on mid-19th century currency. Abraham Lincoln presenter Randy Duncan of Carlinville will appear Saturday. Duncan will deliver Lincoln’s 1858 “House Divided” speech at 11 a.m. Saturday at the courthouse. Electronic devices will be offered as raffle prizes.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: A new heritage trail has been dedicated that traces the history of African Americans in the city. The new African American Heritage Trail opened Wednesday. WEHT-TV reports the trail provides a walking tour past Lincoln School, Liberty Baptist Church and the area’s business district, with stops that include stories and landmarks. The trail was dedicated by the Evansville African American Museum and Evansville’s metropolitan development department. Museum founder Sondra Matthews says that “history is just not a part of our education process” but also something that should be available “at home, in the churches and in the community.” Brochures for the walking tour are available at the trailhead at the Evansville African American Museum.\n\nIowa\n\nWest Des Moines: To celebrate 50 years of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Iowa, CEO Renee Hardman, 58, is looking 25 years ahead. The program sealed a time capsule Sunday afternoon that will preserve mementos for the next 25 years at the group’s yearly Big Little Picnic at Legion Park in West Des Moines. Hardman joined the program as a mentor a couple of days after finishing her education at Drake University. She was a “big” to the same “little” from age 6 to her high school graduation. Now that “little” is in her 40s. “She’s the daughter I never had,” Hardman says. In the program’s 50 years, mentors have touched the lives of more than 20,000 Iowan youths. The capsule will preserve letters from Hardman and the current and past board presidents, Sunday’s paper and a picture of the current staff, among other documents.\n\nKansas\n\nOlathe: Panic broke out at a suburban Kansas City festival that celebrates pioneer history after festivalgoers falsely believed shots had been fired. The Kansas City Star reports it was unclear what led some attendees to begin running and taking cover Saturday night at the Johnson County Old Settlers event in Olathe. Police said Sunday that reports of gunfire weren’t substantiated. Amid the chaos, one woman fell and was hurt. Sixteen-year-old Mel Hipsher says she was with her friends getting tokens for games when she saw a group push through the crowd, running. The teen says she and her friends also started running. She says she heard someone yell about a shooter. Word was quickly spread on social media about a purported shooting at the event that includes music and rides.\n\nKentucky\n\nMadisonville: Transportation officials are offering a historic bridge for adoption. A statement from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet says it is trying to find an acceptable reuse for the Blackford Creek Bridge at the Hancock-Daviess County line, which is scheduled to be replaced next year. The span was built around 1919 and has been determined as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Engineer Deneatra Henderson says good uses for the 60-foot long steel Pratt pony truss bridge include adding it to a hiking and biking trail or as part of a golf course cart path. Those interested in adopting the bridge can submit letters of interest and proposals before Dec. 1. Officials say if no one adopts the span, it will be demolished.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Visitors can now see the baby orangutan born less than two months ago at the city’s zoo, but only when her mother decides to come outdoors. Bulan was born July 17 to longtime Audubon Zoo resident Feliz and to Jambi, a male Sumatran orangutan brought from Germany last fall. Zoo spokeswoman Lauren Messina Conrad says her name means “Moon” in Indonesia’s official language. Conrad says Bulan will spend many months clinging to Feliz – something she can do even when asleep. She says Jambi; Bulan’s 10-year-old half-sister, Menari; and another 10-year-old female named Reese have been bonding with Bulan behind the scenes, and all are getting along well. The shaggy, red-haired great apes are critically endangered. Hunting and habitat destruction have drastically cut numbers of Sumatran orangutans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A new campaign aims to keep college students from leaving the state once they graduate. The Portland Press Herald reports the pilot program is launching this October through the University of Maine, Husson University in Bangor, Thomas College in Waterville and the University of Southern Maine. Student interns at each campus will hand out fliers, stickers and T-shirts to inform students about small and midsize employers in Maine. Interns will also coordinate events where students can meet employers. Industry-funded workforce development groups Live + Work in Maine and Educate Maine are behind the campaign, which also is partnering with a startup ride service to reach out to students. The groups hope to encourage more college students to stay after graduation in light of Maine’s escalating labor shortage.\n\nMaryland\n\nCumberland: The Highway Administration has removed several road signs for “Negro Mountain” over concerns about racial insensitivity in the name. Agency spokeswoman Lora Rakowski confirmed to news outlets Sunday that four signs along Interstate 68 and U.S. Alternate Route 40 were removed in April. Rakowski told the Cumberland Times-News the agency is working with the Association for the Study of African American Life and History and community members going forward. Historian Lynn Bowman told the newspaper the origin of the mountain’s name is unknown, but some accounts refer to it being named after a black man who died in a battle with Native Americans. Lynchings were also said to have taken place on the mountain. The mountain’s ridge runs 30 miles through the Allegheny range and peaks in Pennsylvania.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bill aimed at giving cats and dogs that have been subjects in research institutions and product testing facilities a second shot at life is set to come up at a public hearing. The bill would require that research labs spare animals from automatic euthanasia and instead use animal rescue organizations to help get the dogs and cats adopted. The bill was approved by the Massachusetts Senate last session but failed to become law. It’s set for a public hearing Tuesday at the Statehouse. Animals that pose a risk to public health are exempted. Tens of thousands of cats and dogs are used for research and experimentation in the U.S. each year. Many of them are beagles. Activists say nine states have approved similar bills.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The CEO and founder of MeToo Kit, a company that is bringing to market a do-it-yourself sexual assault test kit, says she got death threats after Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel accused her company of trying to profit from the #MeToo movement. “We’ve had people saying, ‘I hope you get hit by a (expletive) bus,’ excuse my French,” Madison Campbell says. “If the attorney general wanted to hurt a pair of 23-year-old and 24-year-old women running a small company trying to help sexual assault survivors, she won.” Nessel’s office sent a cease-and-desist letter to MeToo Kit on Aug. 29, alleging the company is in violation of several sections of Michigan’s Consumer Protection Act by “luring victims into thinking that an at-home-do-it-yourself sexual assault kit will stand up in court,” Nessel said in a news release.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Fire officials say a blaze has gutted a historic synagogue. Firefighters responded to the conflagration at the Adas Israel Congregation in downtown Duluth about 2 a.m. Monday. All that is left among the charred remains are the remnants of some structural walls. Duluth Assistant Fire Chief Brent Consie says it “is pretty much a total loss.” Officials haven’t provided information on the cause of the blaze. Authorities say one firefighter who was struck by falling debris was taken to a hospital, treated and released. According to its website, the Adas Israel Congregation is an Orthodox/High Conservative Jewish congregation with a membership of 75 people. Construction of the synagogue was completed in 1902.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A group advocating for medical marijuana legalization has turned in more than 105,000 signatures to get the initiative on the ballot next year. News outlets report Mississippians for Compassionate Care submitted the signatures Wednesday to the secretary of state’s office, which now must review and certify the signatures. The group and activist Ashley Durval registered the Medical Marijuana 2020 initiative last year. Durval’s daughter, Harper Grace, hasn’t been able to receive marijuana extract oil for treatment of her rare form of epilepsy. A 2014 law named for Harper Grace nixed the oil from the state’s banned substances list. The group is confident voters will support the measure. Others, including Gov. Phil Bryant, say there’s a lack of scientific evidence proving the benefits of marijuana treatment outweigh any risks.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The Department of Conservation is considering changing state regulations to help landowners combat damage from wildlife and feral hogs. The department said in a news release that the proposals would allow a conservation agent to authorize actions such as thermal imaging to take wildlife causing damage to private property. Landowners would have to obtain written authorization to use thermal imaging or night vision equipment for wildlife. Another change would allow a landowner’s representative to use thermal imagery or night vision equipment to eliminate feral hogs from the landowner’s property, with the permission of a conservation agent. The agency is seeking public comment through Oct. 31 and will make a final decision Dec. 13.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State officials propose to pay $3.4 million to ensure public access to a large area on the Yellowstone River. The proposed conservation easement purchase by Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks would cover 15 square miles in Treasure County in southeastern Montana. State officials say that besides ensuring access, the easement would conserve habitat for big game, waterfowl, upland game birds and nongame wildlife. The DeCock Ranch Co. owns the land linking a wildlife management area, state lands and a U.S. Bureau of Land Management recreational area. The Billings Gazette reports federal funds would cover 75% of the purchase cost. Under the proposal, the ranch might require members of the public to request permission to access the property. Cattle grazing could continue.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Plans by Mutual of Omaha to replace its headquarters have been put on hold. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the insurance company recently decided to put a pin in the idea of a new home base and instead focus on other priorities. Spokesman Jim Nolan says those other priorities include bolstering technology to support Mutual’s growing insurance business. The news comes after a more than yearlong study of a possible $200 million-plus project to replace Mutual’s current headquarters in midtown Omaha. The plan had been to erect a new headquarters fairly close by.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An adult video and bookstore that operated the Las Vegas area’s lone peep show has closed, marking the end of an era. The Las Vegas Sun reports Showgirl Video shuttered last month, and the building it occupied will soon be torn down to make way for a marijuana dispensary. Showgirl Video was believed to be the last place in Las Vegas with a peep show – a place where dancers perform behind a window, which opened when a patron placed $1 into a machine, for tips. In 1992, the city passed an ordinance barring sexually oriented businesses along Las Vegas Boulevard, but Showgirl Video was grandfathered under old code and continued doing business.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Visitors are expected to spend more than $1.5 billion in the state this fall. The New Hampshire Division of Travel and Tourism Development projects more than 3 million out-of-state, overnight visitors will spend time in the Granite State this fall season. Fall is New Hampshire’s second-largest travel season, behind summer. The division’s fall marketing campaign highlights activities such as hiking, leaf peeping, agritourism, dining and shopping.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Volunteers went door-to-door over the weekend to help sign up thousands of residents to have their corroding lead service lines replaced. Volunteers began the effort Saturday, passing out free bottled water and beginning to register the estimated 18,000 homes at risk due to old supply lines. Mayor Ras Baraka said the city is “working aggressively” to solve the water issue by replacing all lead service lines. About 250 people previously attended a meeting at City Hall to get involved with registering residents. City, state and county officials earlier announced a plan to borrow $120 million to dramatically cut the time it will take to replace pipes causing the problem. City officials estimate more than 800 lines have been replaced so far.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state is pushing forward with a multimillion-dollar effort to encourage participation in the U.S. census to preserve federal funding for schools, health care and various public benefits. The state launched its “I Count New Mexico” website Friday that includes a video message from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham encouraging residents to participate in the national population count next year. The state is offering $2.4 million in grant money to county governments that can encourage traditionally undercounted communities to participate in the first census with online access. The state website estimates New Mexico would lose about $3,750 in annual federal spending for each person that goes uncounted. The state estimates a 1% undercount would reduce annual federal Medicaid spending by $32 million and undercut health care services.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Sept. 11 memorial at ground zero has been evolving as the 18th anniversary of the attacks approaches. This year, when nearly 3,000 victims’ names are read aloud there Wednesday, a half-dozen stacks of stone will quietly salute an untold number of people who aren’t on that list. The granite slabs installed on the memorial plaza this spring recognize an initially unseen toll of the 2001 terror attacks: firefighters, police and others who died or fell ill after exposure to toxins unleashed in the wreckage. Caryn Pfeifer’s husband, firefighter Ray Pfeifer, died in 2017 of cancer that developed after he spent months searching the rubble for remains. She says the new 9/11 Memorial Glade gives families like hers a place to “think about everybody.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A Republican legislator says rewriting dozens of General Assembly districts that judges found to be illegal political gerrymanders will be “unprecedented” in state history because partisan data can’t be considered in redrawing them. The House and Senate held redistricting committee meetings Monday, nearly a week since a state court declared Republican mapmakers manipulated voting districts created in 2017 to help elect a maximum number of GOP candidates. The judges told legislators to enact new boundaries by Sept. 18. GOP Sen. Paul Newton of Cabarrus County says Democrats and Republicans have used partisanship in their map drawing for generations. The judges also told legislators that all mapmaking must be done in public meetings.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The leaders of four American Indian tribes have signed an agreement with the state that includes allowing tribes to license foster care parents on and off reservations. The Bismarck Tribune reports the tribes attended a ceremonial signing Friday at the state Capitol. The agreement involves funding that gives money to states and tribes for foster care, transitional independent living programs, and guardianship and adoption programs and services. Tribes can access the funding through an agreement with states. State foster care administrator Dean Sturn says until the new agreement, tribes could license foster care parents only on tribal lands. Sturn says Native American children represent more than 35% of children in North Dakota’s foster care system.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A permanent, 200-foot-high SkyStar observation wheel is coming to the city’s downtown next year. A release from Game Day Communications says the current 150-foot-high portable wheel is scheduled to be replaced in early 2020. The Hamilton County Commissioners unanimously voted for the permanent structure Thursday. SkyStar managing partner Todd Schneider says his team has been “overwhelmed with requests to stay part of Cincinnati’s skyline.” The new wheel is contracted to stand for 10 years. SkyStar will be able to renew the contract in five-year installations twice. The permanent wheel will be in the same location. The release says a portion of SkyStar’s revenue will be donated to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center and ArtsWaves, a community arts fund.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Officials with the pension system for retired Oklahoma Highway Patrol troopers and other state law enforcement officers say the FBI is investigating after computer hackers stole $4.2 million in funds. A notice posted on the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System website Friday said no pension benefits of any members are at risk. Gov. Kevin Stitt’s spokeswoman Donelle Harder says the theft is believed to have resulted from a hack of the agency’s email system, but the investigation is ongoing. The OLERS email system is managed by the state Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The theft was first reported by The Oklahoman. The executive director of OLERS, Duane Michael, didn’t immediately respond to a request by the Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nOregon\n\nTrail: Workers at Cole Rivers Hatchery have put in new plastic water piping as a temporary fix to prevent another massive die-off of Rogue River spring chinook salmon eggs. The Mail Tribune reports the work is intended to prevent a repeat of a fungal outbreak in December that killed 1.2 million spring chinook eggs and young fish called fry. The work is a stop-gap effort until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fixes the water system and worn-out elements at the 46-year-old facility. Officials say the die-off in December was caused by rusting metal pipes and bacteria in sediment that accumulated for years in the piping. The hatchery is intended to make up for the loss of wild spring chinook production due to the building of Lost Creek Dam.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: An art exhibit at a former prison-turned-museum is showcasing animated short films created by currently incarcerated inmates. “Hidden Lives Illuminated” showcases 20 short films and projects them on an outside wall, offering a glimpse into the lives of these inmates to passersby and museum visitors alike. Sean Kelley, the director of interpretation at Eastern State Penitentiary, got the idea for the project after seeing a similar exhibit in Chicago called “Freedom/Time” and secured a $297,000 grant from the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage to bring it to fruition. Men at Chester State Correctional Institution and women at the Riverside Correctional Facility worked about nine months on the project, taking what amounted to two semesters of a college-level film production class. “Hidden Lives Illuminated” runs through Thursday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: A law school is dedicating a classroom to the state’s first black female lawyer Tuesday. Roger Williams University School of Law in Bristol says it will honor Dorothy Russell Crockett Bartleson, who was admitted to the bar in 1932 as the state’s seventh female lawyer. She was 21 years old at the time. The school says research indicates she was the only black woman admitted to the state bar until the 1970s. RWU Law Dean Michael Yelnosky says dedicating the classroom helps all Rhode Island lawyers learn more about the history of the profession in the state. Crockett Bartleson died in 1955. Her daughter, Dianne Bartleson of Surprise, Arizona, will cut the ribbon for the classroom. First Circuit Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson will deliver an address.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state prison system has added a psychological test to the drug screenings for new guards and other employees. Department of Corrections Director Bryan Stirling says the tests were implemented to try to weed out bad matches for employment that have increased the turnover rate to nearly 30% annually. Stirling told The Post and Courier of Charleston the test asks applicants what they would do in certain scenarios. The answers can single out people who might be more tempted to bring in contraband or make a bad decision like mistreating an inmate while in a stressful situation. The new test has been in place for about five months, and officials say 12% of applicants have scored so low they aren’t considered for a job.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: State regulators say Rapid City Regional Airport did not cause contamination when it dumped sewage on its property last month. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources says tests of the airport’s septic lagoon found its contents would have been safe to spread on land had airport officials sought permission to do so. A department spokesman tells the Rapid City Journal regulators also determined there was “no evidence of runoff or impacts to surface water bodies” in places where wastewater was dumped. Those results were corroborated by a private firm that also conducted tests. The airport dumped about 74,000 gallons of sewage on its property without a permit. The airport’s executive director said the open-air lagoon was at risk of overflowing following weeks of heavy rainfall.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city’s first Catholic bishop no longer appears on a mural of Memphians who stood up for others. Instead, Bishop Carroll T. Dozier has been painted over, replaced by Jose Guerrero, a founder of Latino Memphis. Facing History and Ourselves made the change Saturday after the publication of a Commercial Appeal article highlighting the fact that Dozier had appeared on a list of clergy “credibly accused” of the sexual abuse of a child. “We wish to extend our sincerest wishes of comfort, healing and strength to the victims and families touched by the scourge of clergy sex abuse,” Facing History and Ourselves said in a statement. The mural, intended to honor people who helped others, is on a wall across from the National Civil Rights Museum.\n\nTexas\n\nPort Isabel: The operations of the Port Isabel Lighthouse officially changed hands this month, with the Texas Historical Commission now taking the reins from the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department. The Brownsville Herald reports the iconic lighthouse, which is the only one along the Texas coast open to the public, was built on the grounds of Fort Polk in 1852 and decommissioned in 1905. It’s part of Port Isabel’s branding. The lighthouse is where the city holds its summer movie series and market days and will continue to do so under the agreement with THC, City Manager Jared Hockema says. The city bought the land on which the lighthouse sits and donated it to the state. The city will continue to operate the lighthouse.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: A man who has battled alcoholism and homelessness is now a local celebrity, regularly performing music on the streets of downtown Orem. The Daily Herald reports 35-year-old Scott Schwarz is often found riding his bike and playing the drums on a single construction bucket. Schwarz says he picked up the hobby about two years ago while transitioning out of rehab. He said he hit rock-bottom about a decade ago after losing his house and breaking up with his girlfriend. After trying to take his own life, Schwarz checked himself into a rehab facility. The street performer calls his drumming hobby therapeutic and says it brings people joy. “One of the beautiful things about it is it taught me to be OK with failing in public with great regularity,” Schwarz says.\n\nVermont\n\nHinesburg: State and local officials plan to host a tour of the town forest. The Hinesburg Town Forest Committee and the Chittenden County forester will lead a public walk on the LaPlatte Headwaters Town Forest. The purpose of the Sept. 28 event is to seek input on an upcoming management plan for the forest and to raise awareness of current restoration and management efforts. The 301-acre conserved municipal forest has been owned by the town of Hinesburg since 2007. A major focus of a new 10-year plan is expected to be the control of invasive exotic plants and the restoration of flood plain and wetland natural communities. The goal is to improve wildlife habitat, water quality and ecosystem health.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The governor embroiled in a blackface scandal earlier this year is appointing a new top aide whose job will be to make government more inclusive. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday that he’s appointing Janice Underwood to a newly created senior position whose duties will include formulating a strategic plan to “address systemic inequities” in state government. Underwood is the former director of diversity initiatives at Old Dominion University. Northam faced intense pressure to resign after it became public knowledge that a photo of someone wearing blackface appears on his 1984 medical school yearbook page. The governor denied being in the picture but admitted to wearing blackface as a young man while portraying Michael Jackson at a dance party in the 1980s.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A federal judge has blocked the government from imposing a 50% wage hike for blueberry pickers. The Olympian reports U.S. District Court Judge Salvador Mendoza Jr. temporarily stopped the Department of Labor from implementing a July order raising wages for pickers. Zirkle Fruit southeast of Seattle sued to prevent the government from starting the new wage structure. The government notified Zirkle of the new pay rate July 24, a day after the increase actually took effect. Zirkle said it was blindsided by the mid-harvest pay hike. The blueberry harvest began in June and continues through September. The injunction will remain in effect until it is lifted or the case is resolved at trial. In the interim, Zirkle is required to deposit the difference between the old and new wages, as well as taxes, into a trust account.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Organizers of the State Fair of West Virginia say attendees spent record amounts of money on food and carnival rides this year. WCHS-TV reports that state fair organizers said $2.5 million was spent on food, and more than $1.1 million went to carnival ride gross sales this year. Kelly Collins, chief executive officer of the fair, said in a news release that overall attendance was more than 160,000 at the 95th annual fair, which was held Aug. 8 to Aug. 17 in Greenbrier County. Collins said attendance at the fair was about average.\n\nWisconsin\n\nHolcombe: Students at a rural school district are getting access to mental health services with a new video-conferencing system to address a shortage of options nearby. Wisconsin Public Radio reports the closest mental health clinic available to students at the Lake Holcombe School District is about a 20-minute drive away. The district is about 40 miles northeast of Eau Claire. Prevea Health counselors will be connecting with students by video. Prevea clinic manager Nicole Califf says getting mental health services has been challenging for students who don’t have a means of transportation. Officials hope to have the program available in October. Students who seek treatment will enter a private room where they’ll connect with a therapist on a television screen.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A proposal to boost state revenue by storing spent nuclear fuel in the state would only raise about $10 million a year. The Casper Star-Tribune reports a panel of state lawmakers heard about the proposal last week and will consider whether that amount is worth the political battle to make it a reality. The discussion of the Spent Fuel Rods Subcommittee focused largely on potential environmental and health risks of having a nuclear waste storage facility in the state. Committee chairman Jim Anderson, a Republican senator from Casper, says if the revenue isn’t there, there won’t be any interest in the plan. The idea was introduced in July as a way to boost state revenue with the coal industry waning. A similar plan was vetoed by then-Gov. Mike Sullivan in the early 1990s.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/02/momoa-mauna-kea-confederate-context-guthrie-garbage-tribute-news-around-states/39882483/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: National party officials are expressing concern that the Alabama Democratic Party isn’t doing enough to attract more nonblack minorities. The Democratic National Committee’s Rules and Bylaws Committee on Tuesday rejected the state party’s proposed bylaws. The national party in February ordered the Alabama party to hold new elections for party leaders and to revise bylaws and encourage participation by more minorities. The directive came amid challenges over the re-election of Nancy Worley as chair of the state party. Committee member Harold Ickes says the party’s proposal did not comply with the DNC directive, and internal elections last year made the “Keystone Cops look organized.” Worley told the panel that people unhappy with her election are “refighting the civil war” with the challenges.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A group that includes a coal company chairman and a framer of the state’s constitution is launching an effort aimed at recalling Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, weeks after his far-reaching budget vetoes prompted public outrage. In late June, Dunleavy announced vetoes of more than $400 million, affecting health, social-service and other programs and prompting the university system to begin making plans for a transition to a single institution. Lawmakers, unable to muster sufficient votes to override the vetoes amid a dispute over the special session’s proper meeting location, this week passed legislation restoring many of the cuts, including $110 million of the $130 million Dunleavy vetoed for the university. He still can cut any spending with which he doesn’t agree.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A federal judge has overturned the U.S. Forest Service’s approval of plans for a new copper mine. The judge ruled late Wednesday that the agency improperly evaluated and considered water use issues associated with the Rosemont Mine project in the Santa Rita Mountains in the Coronado National Forest. Conservation and tribal groups on Thursday praised the ruling, saying it recognized that the Forest Service failed to protect public land and resources in mountains that are home to endangered jaguars and cougars, black bears and deer. The mountain range is also home to the Madera Canyon, one of the premier U.S. bird-watching spots. The $1.9 billion Rosemont Mine was expected to leave a waste pile the height of skyscraper. Plans called for it to be built along a scenic highway near Arizona wine country and the small community of Sonoita.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Little Rock Zoo says a Northwest Bornean orangutan has given birth to her first baby. Zoo spokesman Lamor Williams says mother Berani delivered the baby Sunday. The newborn orangutan, which is not yet named, is the fifth born to father Bandar. Williams says the baby is part of the Orangutan Species Survival Plan, which manages orangutans in Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited zoos. The World Wildlife Fund lists Bornean orangutans as critically endangered, one step below extinct in the wild. According to the WWF, their populations have declined by more than 50% over the past 60 years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Heterosexual couples now have a legal alternative to marriage in the Golden State. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law Tuesday that lets straight couples register as domestic partners. California has recognized domestic partnerships since 2000. But the law only applied to same-sex couples who, at the time, were not allowed to get married. The law’s goal was to give same-sex couples the same legal protections as marriage. In 2015, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling effectively legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The ruling had no effect on the state’s domestic partnership law, giving same-sex couples the choice of getting married or filing as a domestic partnership. Same-sex couples – except for those older than 62 – still had just one option: marriage.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A citizens’ campaign turned in thousands of voter signatures Thursday in hopes of repealing a new law that would pledge the state’s presidential electoral votes to the national popular vote winner. The group Coloradans Vote said it submitted more than 227,000 signatures to the secretary of state’s office – well above the 124,000 valid signatures needed to get the question on the November 2020 ballot. The secretary of state has 30 days to certify there are enough signatures to require a referendum. A vote next year could mark the first time a state has joined the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, only to have the move challenged at the ballot box.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: About 1,500 nonunion state employees will be receiving raises in line with their union colleagues. The Hartford Courant reports that Gov. Ned Lamont signed off on the 3.5% raises that apply to managers, appointees and others. The raises are consistent with recent pay increases for union members and those working for the legislative and judicial branches. The raises are expected to cost about $4.4 million a year. A 2017 agreement with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition calls for annual 3.5% cost-of-living increases for all union employees. The Democratic governor says his senior staff hired in the last six months won’t be getting a raise.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s environmental authority says it has found a new species of tick for the first time in the state. The Asian longhorned tick, also known as the cattle tick or bush tick, was found in northern New Castle County in late June, according to a Wednesday press release from the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. There have been no reports of Asian longhorned tick-borne illness in the U.S., the release said. But in other countries, these tick bites have made people and animals “seriously ill” with fevers and other viruses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The species is known to swarm livestock and horses in great numbers, leading to substantial loss of blood and possible death of the animals, the release said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In unusually forceful language, the leadership of the Washington National Cathedral has condemned what it called the “racialized rhetoric” of President Donald Trump and directly compared him to 1950s anti-Communist demagogue Sen. Joseph McCarthy. The statement, released Tuesday, isn’t so much an appeal for Trump to retract or soften his statements as a call for the nation as a whole to reject them. It asks: “After two years of President Trump’s words and actions, when will Americans have enough?” The statement, issued in the name of three of the cathedral’s top leaders – Revs. Mariann Budde, Randolph Hollerith and Kelly Douglas – makes multiple direct references to the Communist witch-hunts of the 1950s led by McCarthy. It accuses Trump of deliberately fanning racial divisions for political gain the same way McCarthy used fears of Communist infiltration.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Universal Orlando officials say the resort is doubling in size with plans for a fourth theme park, but they are offering almost no information on when it will open, what it will hold or how much they’re spending. Despite the lack of details, officials with the theme park resort promised Thursday that it would be epic. To that end, they’re calling the new park Universal’s Epic Universe. The CEO of Universal’s parent company, Comcast NBCUniversal, said the fourth park will be the biggest investment the company has made in its theme park business. The resort already operates Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure, as well as the Volcano Bay water park, in Orlando. Universal recently had been acquiring hundreds of acres of land near Orlando’s convention center.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city will soon add some lessons about the South’s racist history on markers next to four historic monuments. The first of the panels could be installed as early as Friday, officials say. In Piedmont Park, the 1911 Peace Monument commemorating post-Civil War reconciliation will get context noting that its inscription promotes a narrative centered on white veterans, while ignoring African Americans. Many white Southerners retroactively viewed the Civil War through “the lens of Lost Cause mythology” reframing the history. “That mythology claimed that despite defeat, the Confederate cause was morally just,” states the marker to be placed near the Peace Monument. “This monument should no longer stand as a memorial to white brotherhood; rather, it should be seen as an artifact representing a shared history in which millions of Americans were denied civil and human rights.” Georgia law bars the removal of such monuments.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: “Aquaman” star Jason Momoa on Wednesday visited Native Hawaiian protesters blocking the construction of a giant telescope on Hawaii’s tallest mountain. The Native Hawaiian actor wore a green leaf lei around his neck and the crown of his head as he attended a ceremony at the protest site. Honolulu television stations livestreamed dancers in jeans and windbreakers performing hula in chilly weather. Momoa stooped low to present an offering wrapped in green ti leaves. He said he was honored to be there, drawing cheers after saying, “We are not going anywhere.” Protesters have blocked the road to the summit for 17 days. Some Native Hawaiians believe Mauna Kea’s summit is sacred. The summit also has the best conditions for astronomy in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little says the state’s economy is strong, but additional work is needed to shore up transportation infrastructure, education and health care. Little also told some 400 business community members attending his speech at the Boise Metro Chamber event on Wednesday that Idaho’s prison incarceration rate is far too high. The Republican governor hit familiar themes in touting his efforts to make the state a place where children and grandchildren will want to remain or return to live. Little gave his speech at J.R. Simplot Company’s Jack’s Urban Meeting Place. Little called J.R. Simplot, who died in 2008, a mentor and said Idaho must continue on the path exemplified by Simplot of innovation and hard work to remain competitive.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A sometimes overlooked Chicago River museum has reached the mark of 250,000 visitors. A Monday statement from the McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum says a suburban Chicago woman, Deb Lawrence, was the weekend visitor to put the facility at that mark. Friends of the Chicago River opened the museum in a 99-year-old bridge house on the Michigan Avenue bridge in 2006. The mission was to promote a better understanding of the role the river played in city history. There are exhibits depicting the time when Native Americans and early European settlers both lived along the river. Visitors can also see how Chicago’s movable bridges work. Friends’ executive director, Margaret Frisbie, says the museum also shows how a waterway “once primarily thought of as part of the sewage system” is again a valuable asset.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Federal court officials in the city are warning that scammers are using the court’s main phone number to scam and intimidate people. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana says its clerk’s office recently began receiving calls from people reporting that someone claiming to be with the “court” had called them hoping to scam them. The would-be victims’ caller ID made it appear as if the culprits were calling from the court’s main phone number, 317-229-3700, when they actually were not. The would-be scammers told several stories, including telling the calls’ recipients that their Social Security benefits had been “hacked” and asking for their Social Security number. Many of those being targeted have Latino heritage. Court officials say government employees would never request personal information over the phone.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The State Board of Education has adopted new rules that would require lap-shoulder seat belts on all new buses bought by school districts and state-accredited nonpublic schools. The administrative rules adopted Thursday are still subject to legislative review. Other safety equipment required would include one additional stop arm per bus, hand rails, exterior boarding lights, and fire-resistant crash barriers between the front bus seats and the bus drivers. Districts wouldn’t have to retrofit their current fleets. The rules would apply to new buses manufactured on or after Oct. 2, the date the new rules are scheduled to take effect. Iowa Education Department spokeswoman Staci Hupp says the new rules would apply equally to contracted service providers.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Some teens on probation in Sedgwick County receive high-priced items such as iPads, Xboxes and Amazon gift cards as rewards in an after-school program meant to keep them from reoffending. The Wichita Eagle reports that the incentives are funded with public dollars and are not in line with state recommendations that call for incentives of limited financial value. The incentives are part of a system that encourages youth to make positive choices. County and state officials say their cost is small compared to the cost of locking up young lawbreakers. It’s part of a national trend toward emphasizing rewards for good behavior over punishment for bad. Kansas changed its juvenile justice approach in 2016 to focus on keeping youths out of detention when possible.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund says it has acquired about 2,000 acres of forestland in Bell County for the Pine Mountain State Scenic Trail. The state Energy and Environment Cabinet says the purchase enables recreation options including hiking and birding and will conserve habitat for rare species including the northern long-eared bat. Kentucky State Parks Commissioner Donnie Holland says the land purchase will add about 4 miles to the Pine Mountain trail. Conservation fund Director Zeb Weese says the trail will be the access point closest to Pineville and Pine Mountain State Resort Park. The organization has funded thousands of acres on Pine Mountain and says all the sites have management plans to keep them focused on conservation and compatible recreation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Two Louisiana State University researchers have a four-year, $500,000 grant to figure out whether one natural form of DNA regulation affects cattle embryos’ ability to survive. LSU AgCenter researchers Zongliang “Carl” Jiang and Ken Bondioli are studying DNA methylization, a chemical attachment that acts like an on-off switch for individual genes. This form was known in other organisms but wasn’t found in mammals until 2016. Jiang says he recently found it in cattle embryos. Jiang says their work could eventually help livestock production and even human fertility treatments, but that’s years in the future. Right now, he says, the researchers are just investigating how it works. The grant is from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.\n\nMaine\n\nKennebunk: A Victorian-era train depot that later housed a macrame bead shop, a bike business and the headquarters of Tom’s of Maine is up for sale. The Boston Globe reports the 4,125-square-foot, wood-frame building is listed at $939,000 and is currently the home of Dietz Associates Inc., a creative design and marketing firm. Tim Dietz and his wife, Kathy, bought the depot in 2004 and restored the building, which opened in the 1870s for the Boston and Maine Railroad. It closed in the 1960s. A variety of businesses have occupied the building, including Tom’s of Maine, known for its natural toothpaste and personal care products. Dietz said because he and his wife are in their mid-60s, “it’s time to downsize.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Prosecutors in the case of a man accused of killing five people at the Capital Gazette newspaper can review records relating to his mental health since he has been incarcerated, a judge ruled Wednesday. Judge Laura Ripken’s ruling comes as attorneys in the case have been battling over information they need to share before the November trial of Jarrod Ramos, who is charged with first-degree murder in the shooting at the newsroom. William Davis, Ramos’ lawyer, contended the information is privileged and wouldn’t be relevant until a second phase of the trial, if a jury finds Ramos guilty. But Ripken ruled the privilege doesn’t apply in the case of an insanity plea, which she said “is actively being pursued.” Anne Arundel County State’s Attorney Anne Leitess said Ramos’ mental health is “highly relevant.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGreat Barrington: Whoever dumped trash at the building made famous in Arlo Guthrie’s 1967 Thanksgiving protest anthem “Alice’s Restaurant Massacree” has a sense of humor. The director of what’s now the Guthrie Center in Great Barrington discovered Tuesday that someone had filled the dumpster with garbage and left a grubby sofa nearby. They also left a sign that said: “Officer Obie told me to do it.” The sign was a reference to former Stockbridge Police Chief William Obanhein, the Officer Obie of the song who arrested Guthrie for illegally dumping trash. Guthrie, who was traveling Tuesday, said in a note to The Berkshire Eagle through a family member, “I hope they left an envelope with some money in it.” According to the song, an envelope with a name on it led to Guthrie’s arrest.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A nonprofit community mobilization coalition wants local businesses, groups and individuals to take part in its annual Neighborhoods Day this weekend. ARISE Detroit! says volunteers are needed to help beautify, clean up and remove blight from city neighborhoods. Neighborhoods Day is Saturday, and more than 200 organizations already have registered for community service projects. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan has committed with more than 250 employees to beautify and spruce up 16 public schools buildings and participate in six other community service projects. ARISE Detroit! Executive Director Luther Keith says that “there are many neighborhood groups that are stretched for resources, and a few volunteers can make a big difference for them on Neighborhoods Day.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nWorthington: State agriculture officials are placing Nobles County under emergency quarantine after emerald ash borers were discovered in the city. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that it’s the first time emerald ash borers have been identified in the county. The quarantine is aimed at limiting movement of firewood and ash products out of the area, reducing the risk of spreading the tree-killing insect. A total of 19 Minnesota counties are now under a full or partial quarantine to prevent spreading emerald ash borers. The pest was found along Interstate 90. An open house for Nobles County residents to learn more about emerald ash borer will be held Sept. 4 in Worthington. The state Agriculture Department plans to impose the quarantine Oct. 1.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s new lottery is seeking advertising to help sell tickets. The Lottery Corp. says it’s looking for advertising and marketing companies to help build its brand, make advertisements and buy ad space. The deadline for companies to submit proposals is Aug. 22. The corporation announced in June that it wants to start selling scratch-off tickets by Dec. 1. Sales of tickets for multistate games such as Powerball could begin in 2020, lottery President Tom Shaheen has said. Mississippi had been one of six states without a lottery, and churches were longtime opponents of creating one. But as the state faced increasing problems with crumbling highways and bridges, lawmakers last year voted to start a lottery to generate money for transportation.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: Property owners near a cattle farm are suing to stop a major expansion of the operation. A lawsuit filed Tuesday by 141 property owners contends the Valley Oaks Steak Co.’s farm already has brought noise, odors and pests to the area near Lone Jack, about 25 miles east of Kansas City. The lawsuit contends the problems will only get worse if Valley Oaks’ proposal to expand from fewer than 999 cattle to 6,999 cattle is granted. The landowners and Powell Gardens, a botanical garden about 3 miles from Valley Oaks, have opposed the expansion. In January, a Jackson County judge granted a preliminary injunction that put the expansion plans on hold. Valley Oaks officials have said the operation will be among the most environmentally friendly concentrated animal feeding operations in the country.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The Northern Cheyenne Tribe has been awarded $2 million in federal funding to build a solar farm. The Billings Gazette reports the tribe will put in matching funding for the construction of the White River Solar Project near Busby. Officials expect the 26-acre solar farm to generate 2.6 megawatts, enough electricity for about 100 homes. Project director Kyle Atwood says the solar farm has 18 months to be built. He says officials are still working out details for how the power will be delivered. The tribe is discussing selling the power to the Tongue River Electric Cooperative. The project aims to lower electricity prices for residents of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, where Atwood says monthly electric bills range from $250 to $450.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State business and education leaders have unveiled a plan designed to create 25,000 jobs while adding $15,000 to the annual income of every resident by 2030. The plan from the group Blueprint Nebraska also seeks to bring 43,000 new young adults into the state and attract $200 million in annual research and development initiatives. The group also hopes to make Nebraska a top-ranked state for its quality of life. Blueprint Nebraska identified 15 high-priority initiatives to achieve the goal. The list includes public-private partnerships to provide more internships and apprenticeships, increasing broadband access and an initiative to promote entrepreneurship. Blueprint Nebraska includes top business groups including the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry, state officials, and leaders of the University of Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: A mobile command vehicle has been assigned to emergency planning personnel in northeast Nevada to better handle crisis situations. The Elko Daily Free Press reports the Nevada Division of Emergency Management are giving Elko County authorities the vehicle free of charge. The 2004 Freightliner Major Incident Response Vehicle was little used due to its cost of operation and other factors. The Elko County Sheriff’s Office says the 10-seat vehicle was financed through grant funds. The vehicle will be used for emergency operations as a command post and a communications center. Officials say the sheriff’s office will house the vehicle and fulfill associated costs. Officials say the vehicle originally cost $340,000 and has more than 10,000 miles on it.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A federal judge says a challenge to the state’s new voter residency law can continue. Judge Joseph Laplante refused this week to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two Dartmouth College students. The new law ends the state’s distinction between “domicile” and “residency” for voting purposes, which means out-of-state college students who vote in New Hampshire would also be subject to residency requirements, such as getting New Hampshire driver’s licenses or registering their cars. Laplante heard about two hours of arguments on the state’s requests to dismiss the case and to remove Secretary of State William Gardner as a defendant. After denying both motions, Laplante said while he agrees the students have standing to sue, he isn’t saying they have a particularly strong case.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state now allows terminally ill patients to seek life-ending drugs after a new law went into effect Thursday. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy had signed the bill in April, making New Jersey the seventh with such a measure. Maine enacted a similar law in June, becoming the eighth. The Medical Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act allows only patients who are terminally ill and have a prognosis of six months or less to live to acquire medication to end their lives. Lawmakers tried for years going back to at least 2012 to advance the legislation. The legislation has several measures that legislators called “safeguards.” They include requiring patients to make two requests and allowing them a chance to rescind the request.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDexter: A park has been closed after a swarm of killer bees attacked two people. Dexter Fire and Rescue Chief Justin Powell told the Roswell Daily Record two internet service provider workers were stung over 100 times Tuesday in Dexter. Powell says the workers were repairing equipment on top of an unused water tower at the park when they were attacked. He says the bees chased the workers, who climbed from the tower and run away screaming. Powell says two police officers, three firefighters and emergency medical personnel who responded also were stung. Firefighters later doused foam onto a bee’s nest in the park. Officials say the town will let the bees calm down and seek a bee expert to remove them.\n\nNew York\n\nMount Vernon: A three-week standoff that left this suburban community with two men claiming to be mayor has been resolved after a judge ruled that the former mayor’s guilty plea to stealing campaign funds meant he had forfeited his office. Former Mayor Richard Thomas was seen cleaning out his City Hall office Wednesday night, and a U-Haul truck delivered several items to Thomas’ house. State Supreme Court Justice Lawrence Ecker ruled earlier Wednesday that Thomas had vacated his office by pleading guilty July 8 to misusing 2015 campaign funds. Mount Vernon’s city council appointed its president, Andre Wallace, as acting mayor July 11, but Thomas initially argued that his plea agreement had given him until Sept. 30 to step down.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s elections board is deadlocked over whether to require that voting machines produce a paper printout that lets voters read and confirm their ballot. The state’s Board of Elections on Thursday decided to debate the issue again in three weeks. By then, it’s likely a fifth member will be appointed to replace the chairman who resigned this week. The board is deciding whether voting machines offered by three companies will be cleared for sale to the state’s 100 counties for years to come. One third of the counties are under pressure because a state law says they can’t use their current touch-screen devices after this year. The elections board’s decision comes amid new warnings of Russia and other foreign rivals trying to sabotage U.S. elections.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Two new abortion laws in the state aren’t being enforced because of legal challenges. The state’s sole abortion clinic in Fargo sued in June over a measure requiring physicians to tell women that they may reverse a so-called medication abortion if they have second thoughts. That law was to go into effect Thursday, but the state has agreed to not enforce it until a federal judge rules. The other makes it a crime for a doctor performing a second-trimester abortion to use instruments such as clamps, scissors and forceps to remove the fetus from the womb. The law becomes effective if a federal court allows its enforcement. Tammi Kromenaker, director of the Red River Valley Women’s Clinic, says that “basically nothing has changed” at the Fargo facility.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As students prepare to head back to class, buyers get a bit of a break on certain school supplies and clothing during the state’s annual sales tax holiday this Friday through Sunday. The tax exemption applies to clothing items priced at $75 or less, certain school supplies priced at $20 or less, and school instructional materials priced at $20 or less. The list of eligible items includes purchases such as textbooks, reference books, markers, calculators, lunch boxes, shoes, uniforms, coats, diapers and even formal wear if the items are under the $75 threshold. Materials bought for use in a business or trade aren’t eligible. The Department of Taxation says as long as the individual items are eligible, there is no limit on the amount of the total tax-exempt transaction.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A court on Thursday upheld the rape and sexual assault convictions and 263-year prison sentence of a former police officer whose case has been watched closely by the Black Lives Matter movement and some conservatives. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously rejected appeals by Daniel Holtzclaw that included a lack of evidence, excessive sentence, prosecutorial misconduct, a “circus atmosphere” during his trial, and a failure by the defense attorney to present an expert to offer an alternative explanation to how DNA of one victim wound up on Holtzclaw’s pants. Holtzclaw’s family said in a statement that it is devastated by the ruling, but not surprised. Prosecutors alleged Holtzclaw, 32, targeted black women and girls while on duty. He was convicted in 2015 on 18 charges involving seven women and one girl that occurred in 2013 and 2014.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A state senator’s threats against the Senate president and the Oregon State Police on the eve of a walkout by Senate Republicans in June sent a shock wave of fear through the Capitol. Some who work in the domed building wept, expressing fear of returning to the job, emails obtained by the Associated Press show. Among protective measures that were considered: escorting employees from their parking spaces to their desks, creating secured work areas and even having state police at the dais in the Senate chamber. Republican Sen. Brian Boquist warned June 19 if the state police were sent to force him to return during the walkout, they should “send bachelors and come heavily armed.” The GOP senators staged a walkout June 20, preventing majority Democrats from voting on the bill that would have reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nFrackville: A man who spent more than two decades behind bars for a murder he didn’t commit is a free man. John Miller was released from prison Wednesday after 22 years. Surrounded by family outside a state prison 100 miles north of Philadelphia, he said it felt “surreal.” A jury in 1998 found Miller guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of a man in a train station parking lot, even though there was no physical evidence of his involvement. The key witness against him confessed multiple times to being the real shooter and even sent a letter to Miller’s mother apologizing for lying. Miller, now 44, contacted the Pennsylvania Innocence Project about eight years ago to help with an appeal. On Wednesday morning, a judge set Miller free.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Portraits of late Mayor Buddy Cianci that were removed from a city hotel in response to a complaint about his criminal past are now for sale. WLNE-TV reports that the portraits that hung throughout The Graduate Providence hotel have been donated to the Cianci Educational Foundation, which is selling them to raise money for scholarships. The Graduate is located in the same building as the former Biltmore Hotel, where Cianci once lived. The hotel removed the portraits that hung in every guestroom in June after Kath Connolly wrote a letter to management to remind them of “the corruption, crime, fear, and dishonesty” during Cianci’s years in office. Cianci was sentenced to 4 1/ 2 years in prison after a corruption conviction in 2002. He died in 2016.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: A woman says a porch pirate may have stolen a package containing nine tarantulas from her front porch. News outlets report the woman says she received a notification Friday morning that the FedEx shipment had been delivered. When she went to get the package, she says it wasn’t there. The Spartanburg County sheriff’s office says the spiders are valued at $1,000. The responding deputy listed the case as a “possible larceny of mail.” The report says there’s no surveillance video from the home, and there are no suspects at this time.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Rangers in Wind Cave National Park have noticed an increase in the number of bison-vehicle crashes, with six such crashes this year. Half resulted in fatal injuries to the bison. Park officials say there were no bison crashes last year, and in 2017 two were hit but did not die. Park spokesman Tom Farrell says the latest crash happened late Saturday night when a local woman driving a car on Highway 385 struck and killed a bison. Farrell tells the Rapid City Journal says he’s not sure what’s behind the increase this year, but he says drivers need to watch their speeds and look out for the animals, especially at night when they’re hard to see. Bison can often weigh as much as a ton.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Jewelry, clothing, contractual documents and a signed guitar are among more than 400 items available at an auction of Elvis Presley-related memorabilia at Graceland. Elvis Presley Enterprises says online bidding is now open for The Auction at Graceland, part of the Elvis Week celebration this month. The celebration of the late singer and actor’s life and career draws fans each year to Memphis and Graceland, Presley’s former home-turned-museum. Elvis Week coincides with the anniversary of Presley’s death Aug. 16, 1977. The Aug. 13 auction will include a black tuxedo made for Presley’s 1969 Film, “The Trouble with Girls,” a 14-karat diamond ring he gave to musician JD Sumner, and an agreement signed in 1955 by Presley giving Col. Tom Parker part of Presley’s publishing rights.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: A new mural of slain Tejano star Selena now graces a neighborhood where she lived. The mural unveiled Tuesday in Corpus Christi’s Molina neighborhood has three watercolor images of the Grammy-winning singer who was shot in 1995. A former president of Selena’s fan club is serving life in prison for killing her. The original mural had Selena’s portrait and the words “Always in our Hearts.” That work was done by some students and art teacher Dicky Valdez shortly after Selena’s death. But the mural showed signs of wear by last year. Selena’s relatives paid for the new mural, by New York artist San Singuenza. It says: “The goal isn’t to live Forever but to create something that will.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Salt Lake County intends to launch a program prioritizing rehabilitation over prison for low-level offenders. The Deseret News reports the county’s criminal justice diversion program is expected to reduce the county prison population. The program intended to prevent individuals from entering the criminal justice system is scheduled to begin Monday and be phased in over the next 12 to 18 months. Officials say the program is expected to divert between 750 and 1,000 individuals per year. Diversion will be offered to those facing new charges and individuals already in the system. The program will intervene at four levels of the process and be based on offender risk assessments. Officials say individuals at all risk levels will qualify for a rehabilitative drug program.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: The University of Vermont has upgraded its super computer, and it’s now 200 times faster. The South Burlington computer dubbed “DeepGreen” can achieve the speed of what’s known as a petaflop – equal to one thousand million million computations per second – or the equivalent of 20,000 laptop computers working in tandem. Using a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation, the upgrade was completed over the winter and spring. Associate physics professor Adrian Del Maestro says the extra processing speed will enable faculty to take on new research projects they could not explore prior to the upgrade. UVM Vice President for Research Richard Galbraith says the additional processing power is “absolutely essential for our faculty to stay at the cutting edge of their disciplines.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: William & Mary has received a $1 million grant to help fund research into the legacy of slavery and racism at the school as well as at the estate of the nation’s fifth president, James Monroe. The university in Williamsburg said in a statement Wednesday that the grant comes from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. William & Mary said the five-year grant will fund several initiatives, including genealogy work and an oral history project documenting stories of descendants of enslaved men and women. The project will be executed in part by the school’s Lemon Project, which aims to rectify past wrongs by the school against African Americans. Also involved is Highland, Monroe’s former estate in Charlottesville, which is part of William & Mary.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The state has announced plans to kill another member of a pack of wolves that is repeatedly preying on cattle in Ferry County. But conservation groups contend it may be time to consider moving the cattle off public lands. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife said Wednesday that it planned to kill another member of the Old Profanity Territory wolf pack. The agency killed one member of the pack last month in an effort to change the pack’s behavior. But since then the pack is blamed for killing two cattle and injuring five. The pack is credited with a total of 27 depredations since last September. The Lands Council sent the agency a letter last week saying it may be time to move the cattle instead.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice’s companies owe almost $2 million in delinquent taxes in Virginia, according to records obtained by WDBJ-TV. The Roanoke-based station reports companies owned by the Republican governor owe $1.9 million in taxes to several counties in the neighboring state. Justice lists more than 100 businesses in his most recent financial disclosure statement, including coal, timber and agriculture companies. He has an estimated net worth of $1.5 billion. A representative for the Justice companies issued a statement to the Associated Press saying the businesses “are completely committed and actively working to resolve all tax disputes and liabilities.” The station says it first obtained documents showing more than $2 million in debts, but some of the delinquencies were paid off after it reached out to the companies for comment.\n\nWisconsin\n\nDodgeville: As worries grow over contamination of rural drinking water, a new study of private wells in southwestern Wisconsin has found the overwhelming majority were contaminated with fecal matter. Results from the independent study released Thursday show 32 of 35 wells – or 91% – contained fecal matter from humans or livestock. Also detected in some of the wells during April testing were illness-causing pathogens such as salmonella, rotavirus and cryptosporidium. The results from Grant, Iowa and Lafayette counties are the latest in a series of tests showing an array of problems with well water in the three counties. About one-quarter of the state’s residents get their water from more than 800,000 private wells, according to state figures.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: People can now apply for permits to snowmobile in Yellowstone National Park without a commercial guide during the next winter season. Under a special lottery program, the park allows one group of up to five snowmobiles to enter Yellowstone from each of its four winter entrances per day. This year’s lottery will be open on the recreation.gov website until Aug. 31. Successful applicants will be notified in mid-September. Trips can be for a maximum of three days in length, and permits cost $40 per day with a $6 application fee.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/02"}]}

The work ahead of us is bigger than a plan written down on paper. Rather, we must respond as an institution, now and from this point forward, to be a community that stands against racism and that embraces people as their authentic selves.\"\n\nRupp's recruitment of Black players has long been a point of contention among college basketball fans.\n\nRupp did not sign a Black player at Kentucky until Shawnee star Tom Payne in 1969, six years after the university moved to integrate its athletic teams and four years after the UK football program signed Nate Northington and Greg Page as its first Black recruits. Rupp was the coach of the all-white Kentucky team that lost to the all-Black starting five of Texas Western in the 1966 NCAA Tournament championship game and was cast as the villain in the movie Glory Road based on the book written about that game.\n\nSupporters of Rupp, including the crew behind the documentary \"Adolph Rupp: Myth, Legend and Fact,\" note that Rupp led a team with a Black player as a high school coach before he was hired by Kentucky, announced he would begin to recruit Black players before the Southeastern Conference integrated its sports teams and recruited Black Louisville stars Wes Unseld and Butch Beard in the 1960s.\n\nIn January, the Lexington Center Corporation and UK announced naming rights to the convention center surrounding Rupp Arena, which is undergoing a $275 million renovation and expansion, had been sold to Central Bank but that the name of Rupp Arena would not change.\n\n\"It has to be Rupp Arena,\" UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart said at the news conference announcing the naming of the Central Bank Center. \"When you’re recruiting, when you’re having teams come in here to play and people come in here, this is Rupp Arena. It’s set apart from all other places. … This one’s been this way for almost 50 years, and it can’t change.\"\n\nOn Politics:Black women are fed up, and want more than justice for Breonna Taylor\n\nUK and the Lexington Center Corporation agreed not to change Rupp Arena's name while leaving opening the possibility of selling naming rights for the convention center in a lease agreement signed in February 2018.

The public process, yet to be fully defined, will include 70 to 80 birds in the U.S. and Canada, the society stated.\n\nFollowing years of controversy over bird names linked to people with racist and genocidal histories, the society's decision thrills ornithologists and scientists who supported a campaign to name birds for themselves.\n\n\"I'm really excited about this change,\" said Corina Newsome, an ornithologist who was among a group of dozens of Black outdoor enthusiasts that launched the first Black Birders Week in May 2020.\n\n\"It’s a major change in how we think about bird names,\" said Sushma Reddy, secretary of the society and the Breckenridge Chair of Ornithology at the University of Minnesota. \"We came to the decision that we really want bird names to be about birds.\"\n\nThe society wants new bird-watchers hearing bird names for the first time to \"feel this is a welcoming environment for people from different backgrounds and just enjoy nature for what it is,\" Reddy said. \"Birds are for everybody. Science is for everybody.\"\n\nAlthough the project was initiated in part \"to address past wrongs\" over links to historical figures known for their support of slavery or genocide of Indigenous peoples, the Society plans to remove all honorific human names. A committee that considered the recommendations noted the blanket removal would avoid potentially contentious value judgments about the character and morality of individuals from the past.\n\nNew bird names will favor more descriptive names like the blue-footed booby or red-headed woodpecker rather than nebulous names like Ross' goose or Bachman's sparrow that give no clues about how to identify the bird.\n\n\"We’re hoping to be imaginative about this,\" said noted naturalist and author Kenn Kaufman. \"It’s a great chance to come up with beautiful and evocative ways of describing the visual appearance, song, or habitat they live in.\"\n\nThe committee also proposes to change names considered derogatory or culturally inappropriate for three other birds: the flesh-footed shearwater; Eskimo curlew, and Inca dove.\n\nA welcome announcement\n\n\"I was honestly very surprised they came to this decision,\" Newsome told USA TODAY. \"It fosters a more equitable approach to learning about the living world.\"\n\nShe first started noticing \"bizarre names\" associated with species' names when she began memorizing names in college.\n\n\"I noticed names that described how the species looked or how it acted in some way were easier to remember than species with an honorific name,\" she said. Later in college, she became uncomfortable with the general practice of naming other living things after people, she said. When she began to learn more about the people behind some of the names, she found it \"even more upsetting.\"\n\nSeveral events helped kick off the society’s multiyear deliberations over bird renaming.\n\nIn 2018, college student Robert Driver proposed renaming McCown's longspur. The small bird that lives on shortgrass prairies in the Central United States was named for John P. McCown, who first collected a specimen of the species in 1851. That was before he fought in the Seminole Indian War in Florida in 1856 and 1857, before he participated in an expedition against Mormons in Utah in 1858 and before he became a general in the Confederate Army in 1861, according to the Central Arkansas Library System. Driver's renaming proposal was rejected, to the dismay of many birders.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, major events sparked a national outcry, protests over racism and police brutality, and a renewed focus on racism in the U.S. Two of those occurred on May 25. A white woman in Central Park called the police and falsely accused Black birder Christian Cooper of threatening her after he asked her to put her dog on a leash. Then in Minneapolis, police killed George Floyd.\n\nBy August of 2020, the society was looking at things differently. It accepted a rewritten proposal from Driver and a co-author and the longspur was renamed the thick-billed longspur. Other birders and ornithologists also were calling for the removal of names associated with past racism. The society apologized for derogatory remarks by a member about Hawaiian bird names distributed in 2011 documents and began some of the initial steps that led to Wednesday's announcement.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nKaufman, who has been in the bird business nearly his entire life, was among those initially reluctant to support changing dozens of bird names.\n\n\"It’s easy to get set in your ways,\" he said. \"I believed in the value of stability. Having stable names makes it easier for people to communicate.\" He's also seen the mass confusion among bird-watchers when species have been split or combined for taxonomic purposes.\n\nBut after the 2020 rejection of Driver's proposal, Kaufman was struck by the \"vocal outcry, mostly from younger ornithologists and bird conservationists.\" He began to be persuaded during a conversation with two of those ornithologists, Jordan Rutter and Gabriel Foley, who launched their Bird Names for Birds campaign in 2020.\n\nRutter and Foley argued some of the bird names were essentially verbal Confederate monuments, he said. \"At a time when the bird community was trying to become more inclusive, it seems like that maybe would be a barrier.\"\n\nAfter talking to dozens of fellow birders of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, he said he was convinced renaming was the best option.\n\nWhile researching a book on the history of ornithology in early America, Kaufman started \"coming across more names of people with birds named after them that would be unsavory by modern standards,\" he said. \"A few of these names are really genuinely offensive to people of color.\"\n\n\"If you have a bird named for a person who was an avowed white supremacist, who preached the inferiority of Black people and it’s found mainly in the South, if people research the history, they’re going to find it offensive,” he said. One example often cited is the Scott’s oriole, named for Winfield Scott, a military general responsible for the Trail of Tears.\n\nAmerica's birds are under siege.These are among the most at risk for extinction.\n\nHow renaming will work\n\nA pilot project will begin in 2024, starting with an initial group from among the 70-80 birds that will be renamed in the U.S. and Canada, the Society said. In total over time, up to 260 birds with people's names could be reviewed across the Americas and associated islands.\n\nThe society, which now has two naming committees, one each for North and South America, will appoint a third committee specifically for the review of English common names. Reddy said the group will include not only experts in taxonomy but also experts in social science and communication.\n\nThe public will be invited to suggest names, which Reddy hopes will build more excitement to learn about birds.\n\n\"It’s going to be a slow and deliberative process,\" Kaufman said, with \"lots of opportunities for public input.\"\n\nAddressing past wrongs in the scientific world\n\nThese aren't the first birds to be renamed, and similar events have occurred as other science groups wrestle with the past. The society's predecessor, the American Ornithologist's Union, changed the name of the Oldsquaw duck to the long-tailed duck in 2000, according to a July 2000 update in the organization's magazine.\n\nIn 2001, the American Fisheries Society changed the name of a fish once known as jewfish to Goliath grouper.\n\nThe Entomological Society of America revamped its guidelines in 2021, barring insect names that referenced ethnic or racial groups.\n\nThe National Audubon Society also has struggled with the controversial past of its namesake, John James Audubon. Earlier this year, the society announced it had considered but rejected adopting a new name.\n\nThe decision prompted several local and state chapters to drop the Audubon name. Among the renamed chapters are the Golden Gate Bird Alliance in California and the Badgerland Bird Alliance in Madison, Wisconsin.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/01/university-of-florida-fires-diversity-equity-inclusion-employees/72809013007/", "title": "Diversity, Equity and Inclusion employees will no longer have a job ...", "text": "The University of Florida announced Friday that it is eliminating all Diversity, Equity and Inclusion employee positions.\n\nThis change, announced through an emailed administrative memo, comes after the Florida Board of Governors labeled expenditures related to DEI programs as prohibited expenditures.\n\nThe memo explains that \"to comply with the Florida Board of Governor’s regulation 9.016 on prohibited expenditures, the University of Florida has closed the Office of the Chief Diversity Officer, eliminated DEI positions and administrative appointments, and halted DEI-focused contracts with outside vendors.\"\n\nThe Board of Governors defines DEI as \"any program, campus activity, or policy that classifies individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, gender identity, or sexual orientation and promotes differential or preferential treatment of individuals on the basis of such classification.\"\n\nThe regulation says a state university \"may not expend any state or federal funds to promote, support, or maintain any programs or campus activities\" that violate section 1000.05 of Florida Statutes, advocate for what it defines as diversity, equity, and inclusion, or promote or engage in what it defines as political or social activism.\n\nFlorida Statute section 1000.05, named the Florida Educational Equity Act, requires equality of access and prohibits discrimination \"on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or marital status\" against students and employees in the Florida K-20 public education system.\n\nFriday afternoon, Gov.

This form of affirmative action, which is common at the country’s several hundred highly selective institutions, is no longer allowed.\n\nStudents of color say the decision is devastating and sharply changes their outlook on the admissions process. “It made me wonder immediately, how is this going to affect my senior year?” said Rikka Dimalanta, 17, who will be a senior this fall in Los Angeles. “If our identity as students isn’t going to be taken into account, what else am I supposed to put on my application?”\n\nThere are other ways for colleges to pursue diversity goals, however, and for students of color to access those institutions, including in some cases by bringing race into the conversation.\n\nHere’s an early look at how college admissions could change.\n\nFor most colleges, business as usual\n\nThough Thursday's decision is historic, it’s important to note it won't mean much for many colleges. Of the more than 1,000 institutions that use the Common Application, just 70 admit fewer than 25% of their applicants, CEO Jenny Rickard has said.\n\nAnd plenty of schools are in one of the states that banned affirmative action in college admissions before this week's ruling, including Arizona, California, Florida and Michigan. Arizona State University quickly declared Thursday that it was one of those institutions that won’t be affected. It “will have no impact on the diversity of the Arizona State University student body or ASU’s commitment to having a student body which reflects the population of the State of Arizona,” the university said.\n\nWill affirmative action ruling matter?Thousands of college and universities already accept almost everyone\n\nHow the decision affects college admissions tests, essays\n\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of highly selective colleges began making standardized test scores an optional part of applications. One of the hopes was that it would lead to a more diverse student population. Then when the pandemic hit, test-optional policies became the default for logistical reasons: As of this past spring, submitting SAT or ACT scores was still optional at most schools.\n\nAlthough studies have shown the shift from these tests has meant only small changes in what the student body looks like at small, private institutions, experts predict the court's affirmative action decision will cement those policies. And that could mean more emphasis on personal statements and essays – an area where race often comes up.\n\nObservers have focused on one line in particular from the ruling: “Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.”\n\nBut the justices also wrote – directly challenging the dissent – “universities may not simply establish through application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful today.”\n\n“For any students my age – myself included – this decision doesn’t prevent us from talking about the way that race has impacted us,\" said Aina Marzia, 17, a rising senior in El Paso, Texas, who was infuriated by the court's decision. \"It’s just that we don’t have a box to check for our application this fall.”\n\nAnurima Bhargava, a civil rights lawyer who formerly served with the U.S. Department of Justice, urged future applicants not to shy away from highlighting their racial identity when applying to colleges.\n\n“It’s not that diversity isn’t something that universities can pursue. It’s not that you can’t tell your own stories, stories of your racial experiences, about your identity or your background,” she said in a discussion Thursday hosted by Whiteboard Advisors, a research and consulting firm. “How universities are going to take account of that is still going to be a question for them, but it’s not that students can’t tell those kinds of stories.”\n\nJeff Selingo, a higher education journalist who spent a year behind the scenes with college admissions officers, said one next step for those gatekeepers is to deliberate what to make of students whose essays deal with race.\n\nWhat to know:A breakdown of the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision\n\nWhat does this mean for legacy admissions?\n\nAnother item for college officials to deliberate: legacy admissions, the practice of giving preference to applicants whose family members attended the institution.\n\nRichard Kahlenberg, a progressive scholar who served as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the Harvard and UNC cases, said he believes at least some elite colleges will abandon the practice now that they can no longer consider race in admissions.\n\n“If our identity as students isn’t going to be taken into account, what else am I supposed to put on my application?” Rikka Dimalanta, who will be a high school senior this fall in Los Angeles\n\nBefore, he said, affirmative action allowed them to achieve some racial diversity without necessarily ensuring their campuses were socioeconomically diverse as well. One study found more than half of Harvard’s students, however racially diverse, for example, came from the top 10% of the country’s income distribution. Another analysis found that 43% of Harvard’s white admits in 2019 were legacy students, recruited athletes, children of faculty and staff or on applicants affiliated with donors.\n\nBefore, he said, affirmative action allowed them to achieve racial diversity without necessarily ensuring their campuses were socioeconomically diverse as well.

Another analysis found that 43% of Harvard’s white admissions in 2019 were legacy students, recruited athletes, children of faculty and staff or on applicants affiliated with donors.\n\nSome highly selective universities, including in states that banned affirmative action, already had stopped practicing legacy admissions. They include the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, Los Angeles. Elsewhere, Texas A&M University and the University of Georgia also have ended the practice.\n\nIn remarks denouncing the court's ruling, President Joe Biden also said he is asking the federal Education Department \"to analyze what practices help build a more inclusive and diverse student bodies and what practices hold that back, practices like legacy admissions and other systems that expand privilege instead of opportunity.\"\n\nA shift to using affirmative action – in recruitment\n\nThe onus will be on colleges to recruit from a wide range of communities at the front end of the admissions process, said Forrest Stuart, the vice president of enrollment management at Lafayette College.\n\n“This is really about building a diverse applicant pool,” Stuart said. “There’s nothing in the decision that I’ve seen that says you cannot ensure that the applicant pool is representative of all backgrounds.” Lafayette, a small private college in Pennsylvania where about a quarter of students are people of color, has under Stuart’s leadership partnered with community-based organizations to ensure students from underrepresented backgrounds put their names in the hat as well.\n\n“It really helps because you’re then choosing from a broader base,” said Stuart, who expects this affirmative action-esque approach to recruitment to gain more popularity as colleges work to ensure diversity on campus without considering race in the actual admissions process. “If your net is cast wide enough and broad enough on the building of your applicant pool, I don’t think it’s going to be as difficult for us – at least at Lafayette.”\n\nBiden also encouraged colleges to build a diverse class by factoring in applicants' family’s income and where they grew up and to consider students’ experiences with hardship or discrimination, including racial discrimination.\n\nCounselors: Colleges need to send a new message to students\n\nWithout proactive measures like diversifying applicant pools, educators worry, many students who would’ve applied in an affirmative action world will decide it’s not worth it.\n\nAt the American School Counselors Association, Executive Director Jill Cook has been fielding lots of questions. Many counselors are worried students of color will decide against applying to their reach or dream schools because they don’t think they’ll get in. What if some students choose not to apply at all, perceiving higher education to no longer be a welcoming place? (Legislation seeking to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs at colleges can make the campuses seem even less inviting.)\n\nThere are also high school counselors who worry about the reverse – students overexerting themselves and applying to too many schools because they fear their chances of getting in are reduced after the court’s ruling.\n\nDavid Hawkins, chief education and policy officer for the National Association for College Admission Counseling, said his group will continue to urge high school counselors to push students to meet with admissions officers at their schools of interest.\n\n“Colleges are looking for a diverse group of students, and the decision should not discourage students at all from applying,” Hawkins said. “We will be swimming against the tide, and it can be discouraging. But we also want to ensure that students know it won’t change the fact that colleges are looking for them.”\n\nSome students may take that message to the extreme.\n\nAllen Koh, founder/CEO of Cardinal Education, an educational consulting firm in California catering to the very affluent, said he has seen mostly white clients move to states like Montana and Wyoming to pursue a perceived geographic advantage based on what they see as a desire on the part of elite universities to boast student enrollment from all 50 states.\n\n“Harvard calls these states ‘sparse country,’ and different universities call them different things,” he said. “But if you think about the sparse population that ‘sparse country’ implies, the pool of students you’re going after isn’t very large. So they actually get a significant advantage.”\n\nCan anything really replace what the court struck down?\n\nProbably not.\n\nEducation experts say universities will likely become less diverse as a result of the ruling, and while the court nonetheless acknowledged the importance of diversity in higher education and left the door open for schools to achieve it through other measures, such efforts could take years to see results – if at all.\n\n“Those measures will be expensive and take years to bear fruit,” said Jennifer McAward, an associate professor of law at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. “In the meantime, we are likely to see a substantial drop in racial diversity at highly selective universities.”\n\nSome point to California, where voters in 1996 passed a proposition prohibiting race-conscious college admissions. Despite numerous outreach efforts, University of California system officials have been unable to restore enrollment to levels of diversity representative of the state.\n\nMore:Ahead of Supreme Court affirmative action case ruling: Do Harvard, UNC discriminate?\n\n“The shortfall is especially apparent at UC’s most selective campuses,” they wrote in an amicus brief filed to the Supreme Court last summer, “where African American, Native American and Latinx students are underrepresented and widely report struggling with feelings of racial isolation.”\n\nAnd even with race conscious admissions for years, Black enrollment in college has dropped nationwide over time.\n\nAt elite colleges, admissions will always feel 'arbitrary'\n\nAccording to Mitchell Chang, a UCLA chancellor and professor of higher education and organizational change and Asian American studies, the decision will do little to make college admissions seem more equitable.\n\n“There’s always going to be this sense that it’s unfair,” he said, pointing to the Ivy League and other elite schools that admit fewer than 10% of their students and enroll classes of just a few hundred people. “If we remove race-conscious admissions, it’s not like these institutions are going to accept more students. The numbers and percentages of winners will remain the same.\n\n“Someone’s always going to be upset that they didn’t get admitted yet were highly qualified, because in many ways, when you’re trying to select between hyper-qualified people, the difference between getting in and rejected is almost arbitrary.”\n\nContact Alia Wong at (202) 507-2256 or awong@usatoday.com.

UT-Austin President Jay Hartzell emailed students in June and December to say the school was preparing for SB 17 and working to understand its complex impact on every part of the institution.\n\nThe American-Statesman has reported extensively on the changes made at the public institutions and the reactions from students, faculty members and rights groups. At UT, officials have cut programs and scholarships; forced student and faculty groups sponsored by the school to comply with the law or risk losing their funding; and closed the Multicultural Engagement Center, which housed six UT-sponsored student groups — Afrikan American Affairs, the Asian Desi Pacific Islander American Collective, the Latino Leadership Council, the Native American and Indigenous Collective, Queer People of Color and Allies, and Students for Equity and Diversity — and provided a gathering place for them.\n\nThe university declined to comment to the Statesman on the specific changes it has made to comply with SB 17, but it has continuously said that the school will make all necessary changes to stay within the law.\n\nSB 17 requires public universities and colleges to provide proof of their compliance to receive state funding for the next fiscal year.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHere is the Statesman's guide to what we know has changed at UT as well as a summary of our coverage, which will be updated as we learn more:\n\nUT divisions and centers\n\nThe Division of Diversity and Community Engagement is now the Division of Campus and Community Engagement, the vice president of campus and community engagement, LaToya Smith, announced Dec. 14.\n\nThe Gender and Sexuality Center closed, and the Women's Community Center now takes its place. At a staff council meeting Jan. 19, Smith said no LGBTQ+ programming will be offered by the center. The center will serve people of all genders.\n\n\"All of the programs that we have done and will continue to do are open to everyone, all students, and so they're not designed or implemented or executed and related to a particular race or gender identity orientations,\" Smith told staffers at a staff council meeting Thursday.\n\nThe Office for Institutional Equity has changed its name to the Center for Access and Restorative Engagement. The center's focus will be on restorative approaches to address conflict. The diversity training will no longer exist, and the office will now offer education around \"intergroup dialogue\" and \"dynamics of leadership and dialogue.\"\n\nThe center will continue to ensure the university is in compliance with federal equal employment opportunity law and provide opportunities for faculty members and students to report concerns about school climate, which the center will track and report every semester. This is now under Initiatives for Campus Support ― not Inclusive Campus Support.\n\nThe Multicultural Engagement Center closed Jan. 1. Student leaders were alerted to the change Dec. 31. The university said the Powers Student Activity Center will determine how to best use the space.\n\nTexas SB 17 bans DEI in colleges.So why did UT end a program for undocumented students?\n\nUT student groups\n\nSponsored student organizations have to comply with SB 17 or become registered ― including student organizations previously under the MEC. A statement from UT Student Government's student executive and assembly board leaders on Instagram said that \"with profound disappointment\" the organization, which receives funding and support from the university, complied with the law as well.\n\n\"These attacks on DEI are part of a larger effort to undermine academic freedom and uphold white supremacy,\" said the statement, which was not endorsed by UT Student Government. \"It is disheartening to have changed years of progress for many underserved students because legislators negatively perceived DEI.\"\n\nThe statement also recorded several changes to Student Government:\n\nThe removal of the terms \"diversity, equity, inclusion, race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, age, and disability\" from social media accounts, descriptions and bios.\n\nThe Queer and Trans Student Alliance Agency is dissolved under Student Government and is now a registered student organization.\n\nThe Diversity Inclusion Agency has evolved to become the Community Engagement and Advocacy Agency.\n\n\"Minority-focused mental health resource\" was removed from the Student Government health resources guide.\n\nMore:Texas women's basketball's Aaliyah Moore speaks out against effects of DEI ban\n\nUT staff and faculty groups\n\nStaff and faculty resource groups, previously housed and \"administratively supported\" under the division, must now also become registered independently and function separately from the university, Smith told staffers at the Jan. 19 staff council meeting.\n\n\"What I mean by that is they will have to host their websites independently. The university used to host their sites. They will have to fundraise independently. They will not be able to receive institutional funding for respective events or things that they were doing,\" Smith said.\n\nThese groups included the Pride and Equity Faculty Staff Association, the Hispanic Faculty Staff Association, the Asian/Asian American Faculty and Staff Association, and the Black Faculty and Staff Association. They were often open to all, were service and community-based, and offered professional development opportunities.\n\nSmith said the division is looking into whether it can offer an \"administrative toolkit\" to help the staff adapt to becoming independent. The university can host information about the groups on its site, but not host its actual websites.\n\nWhen UT students return,'a home away from home' will have been shuttered due to DEI ban\n\nUT student graduations\n\nThrough the MEC, student organizations previously worked with other groups to organize cultural graduations. This included Lavender Graduation for LGBTQ+ students, Black graduation and Latinx graduation, a bilingual ceremony.\n\nThe university will no longer be able to continue these graduations, but Smith told staff members that student groups can work with the Texas Exes, the alumni organization, to continue to host them \"in some format.\"\n\nUT gender-focused programs\n\nThe Heman Sweatt Center for Black Males, open to all but initially designed to specifically address obstacles Black male students face, will broaden to become the Heman Sweatt Center for Collegiate Males. Programs will be redesigned to provide opportunities for all college men on campus.\n\nThis center is the counterpart to the Women's Community Center. Both are open to all genders.\n\nThe Fearless Leadership Institute, initially designed to provide leadership and professional development for Black women, will be under the Women's Community Center and is expanding to offer development for all women.\n\nnew year rings in new Texas laws.Here's a look at some rules going into effect\n\nOther UT programs\n\nThe Monarch Student Program, which supports undocumented students at UT, was shuttered due to SB 17, Smith confirmed to the staff. The Dallas Morning News reported that UT also cut an annual scholarship that ranged from $500 to $1,000 for students without documentation that was part of Monarch.\n\nFaculty members told the Statesman in November that UT's Public Voices Fellowship — a program focused on helping faculty members from underrepresented groups, specifically women and people of color, publish op-eds — was also closed.\n\nA previous Listserv listing individual staff and faculty members who had proclaimed themselves allies of the LGBTQ+ community was taken down, Smith said. Faculty and staff members may display their ally card or Pride flags in their office.\n\nThe Latinx and Indigenous Leadership Institute, previously housed in the division, will become a student organization instead, students announced on Instagram.

And in the modern era, those ties are increasingly seen as problematic.\n\nAt some schools, students and faculty are holding their universities accountable for their racial history by demanding their universities change the names of the buildings that honor those who advocated for and benefited from systems of white supremacy, slavery and systemic racism.\n\nThe newest example: Yale University. After a renewed push in 2015 by students to have a building name changed, Yale University announced Friday it is renaming one of its residential colleges named in honor of former U.S. vice president and white supremacist John C. Calhoun, who was a prominent proponent of slavery.\n\nNick Girard, a Yale sophomore, pointed out that the Calhoun name change \"is the result of decades of activism and action\" by students and faculty. \"It is excellent to see the university finally recognize this continued activism and listen to the students, alumni and professors who have protested Yale's honoring a renowned supporter of slavery,\" Girard told USA TODAY College.\n\nGirard explained the tireless work it took for the change to happen. \"So many invested academic, emotional, and mental labor in fighting to make a better, more inclusive Yale,\" he said.\n\nThe decision to rename Calhoun College was not always on the table. As recently as last April, Yale president Peter Salovey said the name of the building would not be changed. But by August, he had announced a committee to explore renaming the building. The committee developed a set of principles to use when considering name changes, and the board voted to rename Calhoun College on Friday.\n\n\"John C. Calhoun’s legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a 'positive good' fundamentally conflicts with Yale’s mission and values,” Salovey said in a post on the Yale website.\n\nThe post also mentions that it followed guidance from schools like Georgetown that have recently changed building names on their campus.\n\nIn 2015, Georgetown president John DeGioia announced that the university would be renaming two buildings on campus that were named for two university presidents who had authorized and advised the sale of slaves to pay off campus debts. Mulledy and McSherry halls were both renamed at the suggestion of the working group on slavery, memory and reconciliation, a panel of Georgetown students, administrators and faculty. Students had lobbied the university for the building name changes.\n\nRelated: Student protesters see victory in Georgetown addressing historical ties to slavery\n\nWhile schools like Yale and Georgetown have taken steps to address their ties with slavery, there is still an uphill battle being fought at others.\n\nRelated: Beyond Yale: These other university buildings have ties to slavery and white supremacy\n\nAt Clemson and Winthrop universities in South Carolina, students and faculty have called for buildings on their campuses named Tillman Hall to be changed and have been at the center of contentious debates over the renaming efforts.\n\nThe buildings' names honor Benjamin Ryan Tillman, a former governor of the state and an avowed white supremacist. Tillman was a vocal proponent of lynching.\n\nRelated: Columbia University's ties to slavery should be taught, students say\n\nLast fall, Winthrop students held a sit-in to enter talks with administration about the renaming efforts and to remind the campus who Tillman was.\n\nMany students believe having Tillman's name being attached to a prominent building on campus doesn't reflect the university they attend today.\n\n\"It sort of invalidates and nullifies all of the student activities and engagement that happen in this building because most of the activities in this building are headed by students of color,\" Winthrop student Candace Livingston told USA TODAY College. Livingston pointed to events hosted at Tillman Hall as one example of how off-putting it can be for students of color \"to be in a building named after a man that could care less about our bodies.\"\n\nIn 2015, Clemson's faculty senate and the graduate student government both voted to rename Tillman Hall -- a symbolic gesture, because only Clemson's board of trustees can officially change the name of a building on campus.\n\nIn February 2015, Clemson University board of trustees chair David H. Wilkins announced in a statement that they would not rename the building, citing that whether the name of the building was changed Tillman would still remain a part of Clemson's history:\n\n\"Every great institution is built by imperfect craftsmen. Stone by stone they add to the foundation so that over many, many generations, we get a variety of stones. And so it is with Clemson. Some of our historical stones are rough and even unpleasant to look at. But they are ours and denying them as part of our history does not make them any less so. For that reason, we will not change the name of our historical buildings. Part of knowledge is to know and understand history so you learn from it.\"\n\nOngoing efforts to change the names of both Tillman Halls face strenuous challenges. South Carolina's Heritage Act says that any street, park or plaque named for a historical figure in the state cannot be renamed without a two-thirds vote from the state General Assembly.\n\nBut Winthrop students aren't backing down from the fight to have the building's name changed on their campus. They've begun planning a letter-writing campaign and have engaged in other conversations with university officials to advance their fight to change the name of Tillman Hall.\n\nRyan Brooks is a Winthrop University student and a USA TODAY College correspondent.\n\nThis story originally appeared on the USA TODAY College blog, a news source produced for college students by student journalists.

People with roots in the Middle East will no longer be classified as \"white\" by the federal government under the changes. Up until now, Arab Americans and Chaldeans were grouped along with people of European descent as \"white\" by government agencies, a policy that community advocates said erased their identity and ignored how they have often faced discrimination.\n\nArab American groups applauded the changes, but said more needs to be done to make demographic forms more inclusive across all government agencies and in the private sector. Armenian Americans, for example, are not included under the new MENA category, even though many of them have roots in the Middle East.\n\nIn a 15-page publication released March 29, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued revisions to the agency's policies for federal data on race and ethnicity, last revised in 1997. The new category and check box will be called \"Middle Eastern or North African,\" known as MENA. Underneath the category are six check boxes next to nationalities that respondents can fill in to provide further details: Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Syrian, Iraqi or Israeli. Under that, respondents can write in an ethnicity that is not one of those six options; the instructions read: \"Enter, for example, Moroccan, Yemeni, Kurdish, etc.\" Chaldeans, who are Iraqi Catholics and make up a sizable part of Michigan's Middle Eastern communities, will also be grouped under the MENA category.\n\nMENA will be one of seven racial and ethnic categories Americans can choose from.\n\n“This is a long-awaited day,\" Abed Ayoub, a Dearborn native who is national executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), said of the changes in a statement.\n\nThe changes could lead to \"programming designed to uplift our businesses,\" such as helping Arab Americans obtain contracts for minority-owned companies, and \"addressing health disparities\" that affect people of Middle Eastern descent, Ayoub said.\n\n\"The revision of the standards is a major accomplishment,\" said Maya Berry, a Dearborn native who is executive director of the Arab American Institute (AAI). \"For the first time, Arab Americans will be made visible — not just on the decennial census, but in all federal data that collects race and ethnicity and that is historic.\"\n\nBiden touted the changes when the White House issued its proclamation for Arab American Heritage Month, which is observed throughout April.\n\n\"To ensure Arab Americans are fully represented, my administration finalized the addition of a new Middle Eastern and North African option for the 2030 census and other forms that ask for people’s race and ethnicity — a vital step to ensure that Arab Americans are seen, counted, and valued as new policy is being made,\" Biden said.\n\nThe changes come as Biden faces widespread criticism from Arab Americans and others over his handling of the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Trump administration in 2018 blocked attempts to make the MENA changes for the 2020 census.\n\nIt's unclear how the changes will affect tabulation of race by state and local governments. In order to qualify for federal programs, they may have to abide by the new classifications.\n\nThe changes mark the first time since the 1970s that the U.S. government has created a new racial category on census forms. The changes will also include the addition of a \"Hispanic or Latino\" category under the race question on the census forms; previously, there was a separate question that asked whether someone was Hispanic/Latino and then asked about their race, which OMB said confused some respondents. After checking the box, Latinos can check another box further specifying their ethnicity/race such as Mexican or Cuban, or writing it in. The changes combine race and ethnicity into one area.\n\nIn the past, the number of Arab Americans was estimated based on a census question about ancestry that was sent to a smaller sample of people with the American Community Survey.\n\nIn addition to MENA and Hispanic or Latino, there are five other racial/ethnic categories available: American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and white. Under each of these categories, there are additional boxes respondents can check to further specify their identity, or they can write in their identity.\n\nThe changes and the debate around them illustrate the complexity of racial and ethnic identity. In 1997, a Detroit man of Egyptian descent with brown skin and curly hair, Mostafa Hefny, filed a lawsuit against the Office of Management and Budget for classifying Egyptian Americans like him as white.\n\n\"As a Black man and as an African, I am proud of this heritage,\" Hefny told The Detroit News at the time. \"My classification as a white man takes away my Black pride, my Black heritage and my strong Black identity.\"\n\nHefny, who said he looked more Black than Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, alleged he was passed over for a job at Wayne State University because he was not a minority. Filed in federal court in Detroit, the lawsuit was dismissed in 1998 by U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood. Hefny still fought to not be classified as white, starting a petition to convince the OMB to change its classification system, asserting his Nubian heritage.\n\nIn other cases, some Arab Americans in metro Detroit have lighter skin and other features that may make them perceived as white.\n\nAyoub said that while the changes are a positive first step, \"more work needs to be done to ensure there is full and accurate representation of the Arab American community\" by including groups such as Armenians. Berry also voiced concerns about some groups being excluded, saying it should have included \"members from the Black diaspora community\" such as people with roots in Somalia and Sudan.\n\nThe OMB said in their announcement that based on their research, Armenians tend to identify more as White while Somalian and Sudanese Americans often chose Black or African American as their identity, which is why those three groups will not be grouped under the MENA category. Berry also said that Assyrians and Chaldeans, Iraqi Christians who are a sizable community in metro Detroit, should have been listed on the census form as one of the check boxes or suggestions to write in, given they outnumber some of other options listed, such as Kurdish and Israeli. Berry said the MENA category is more of an ethnic category since Arabs can also be seen as white, Black or Latino. Some Mexicans, for example, have roots in Arab nations such as Lebanon. Arab Americans, as well as other groups, are free to check whatever box they wish on the census forms that they feel best fits with how they identify.\n\nUnder the new forms, a person like Hefny could check the box for MENA, but also could check the box for Black of African American. Berry said that Arab Americans could check more than one box. The OMB said people can check as many boxes as they want, something that could also apply to people who identity as multiracial. For example, a Michigan resident who is part Irish and part Lebanese could check the box for white, then check the Irish box underneath, and then also check the MENA box, and check the Lebanese box underneath.\n\nThe ADC said some have raised concerns about the phrase \"Middle Eastern,\" which was created by the West during colonial rule more than 100 years ago. The civil rights group hopes the word \"Arab\" can later be added to the MENA phrase. Another concern raised by some is that Israeli Americans will be included in the MENA category, which raises the possibility they could be classified as minorities.\n\nIn September, the U.S. Census released for the first time census data for MENA people, by tabulating responses under the \"white\" category that allowed Arab Americans to write in their specific ethnicity. The 2020 census form suggested Lebanese and Egyptian as two options along with some European ethnicities under the \"white\" category.\n\nThe new changes will apply to the 2030 census forms and other federal forms. Over the past half-century, Americans of Arab descent have often faced bias from a range of institutions, from stereotyping in Hollywood movies and TV shows to profiling and targeted law enforcement actions by federal agencies and environmental racism in areas like the south end of Dearborn, a predominantly Arab area that faces pollution problems. Advocates hope that by being classified as a minority group, Middle Eastern people can get greater attention to their struggles.\n\nIn addition to Michigan having the highest percentage of MENA residents, the 2020 census showed Wayne County has the highest percentage of MENA residents among all counties in the United States, and Dearborn has the highest percentage among all cities.\n\n“Inaccurate classification has had profound impacts on our communities' political representation, our access to necessary government services, the ability of our business communities to grow and develop and the medical community's understanding of the unique health issues we face,\" said Chris Habiby, ADC's national government affairs and advocacy director. \"Throughout America’s history, our government has never considered that Arab Americans are a unique piece of the American fabric, and (last week's) announcement finally takes steps to change that.”\n\nContact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com or X @nwarikoo.\n\nBelow are the revisions that change how federal data on race and ethnicity will be collected and presented by the White House Office of Management and Budget.

The Episcopal Church adjusted language to allow women to serve in leadership positions. And, after a push from local resident Linda Hogoboom, the town of Boonton, New Jersey, updated the title of its representatives from aldermen to Town Council members.\n\n\"What started as this whole gender-neutral push for Board of Aldermen soon became this notion of representation on a whole other level,\" Hogoboom said.\n\nFormal communications like \"welcome, ladies and gentleman\" can alienate people who do not identify as men or women, said Deena Fidas, the managing director for Out & Equal Workplace Advocates, a nonprofit that educates businesses to foster inclusive workplaces for LGBTQ employees.\n\n\"There's a host of ways people can convey that sense of respect and enthusiasm without relying on gender tropes,\" Fidas said.\n\nBut English speakers learn systems and patterns that, for many, are difficult to unlearn and require an \"intervention\" to change, said William Leap, a professor emeritus at American University who studies queer theory, language and anthropology.\n\nIt may be simpler for nonbinary people who use \"they\" pronouns and their allies because they have a personal investment, or for younger people who \"don't have the baggage that older folks do, and they also don't think about gender and sexuality the way that some older folks do,\" Leap said.\n\nDid you see? Pandemic lockdowns gave young people freedom to explore gender identities\n\n'Imperative to evolve' to neutral language\n\nLanguage stereotyping can be difficult to overcome, according to a study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. People are accustomed to gendered language — words that have bias toward a particular gender, like \"waitress\" — and linguistic bias appears at a young age, the study found.\n\nEven when told that masculine pronouns, \"he\" and \"him,\" were meant to be generic and include all genders, readers in the study still pictured men.\n\nIn recent years, awareness has grown around personal pronouns. People wear pins that read \"she/her\" or \"he/him,\" or include pronouns in email signatures. People who identify outside binary male and female gender molds often use \"they\" pronouns, though there are several other neutral pronouns people may use, such as \"ze\" and \"xe.\"\n\nSweden officially added a third, gender-neutral pronoun — \"hen\" — to its vocabulary in 2015 as an alternative to \"hon\" (she) or \"han\" (he). It's become one of the leading countries in the world for LGBTQ equality, according to Rainbow Europe.\n\nResearchers Margit Tavits and Efrén O. Pérez studied gender-neutral pronouns in Sweden and found improvement in people's attitudes toward gender equality, women and LGBTQ people.\n\nThey found people had less bias in favor of gender roles and categories, and the mental prominence of males decreased, according to an article published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nAnother to check out:Many women ditch beauty routines for good\n\nAdopting gender-neutral language has been a \"bottom-up movement\" in the U.S., Tavits said. She chairs the political science department at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nIf changes are going to be accepted at large, she said, capitalism could provide an incentive.\n\n\"Businesses have incentive to be inclusive,\" Tavits said. \"They want to sell to as many people as they can, and if using gender-neutral language pulls in more customers, that’s what they will adopt.\"\n\nMaking religion gender-neutral\n\nGender-neutral language has roots in the feminist movement, Fidas said. Feminist theologians advocated for women to be ordained as priests in the Episcopal Church, and they won that fight in 1976.\n\nThe rules of the Episcopal Church, called canons, used masculine pronouns and implied that only men should be ordained, said the Rev. Dr. Ruth Meyers, the dean of academic affairs for Church Divinity School of the Pacific.\n\n\"In other situations one might argue 'he' is meant to be generic and include all people, [but] there's this duplicity where those in power can decide when 'he' means male and when 'he' is intended to mean all people,\" Meyers said.\n\nWhen the church considered allowing women to hold leadership positions, leaders looked at revising the Book of Common Prayer, the text congregations use for worship. That involved creating a committee focused on linguistic sensitivity related to women.\n\nEpiscopal Church leaders added a new canon that said all the rules \"would be equally applicable to men and women.\" They found ways to reword the text in a way that did not call attention to inclusive language, but eliminated masculine-specific language, and offered alternative worship texts, Meyers said.\n\nThe impacts of words used in church trickle down to how congregants are treated both in worship services and outside. By using masculine language when referring to God, which causes people to envision God as male, the church \"allows for this legitimation of a patriarchal society,\" said the Rev. Dr. Kelly Brown Douglas, the dean of Episcopal Divinity School at Union Theological Seminary.\n\n\"We make God into a male and we raise males to the level of the divine and they become gods. We affirm the dominance of men, that they were meant to rule because they are the only ones created in God's image,\" Douglas said.\n\nIncorporating gender-neutral language, in church and elsewhere, won't be easy for everyone. It's difficult to separate language and grammar from \"the social context in which it is used,\" said Lex Konnelly, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Toronto who studies sociocultural linguistics.\n\n\"A lot of times the resistance that is being expressed to these kinds of language changes, the language change is really just the tip of the iceberg,\" Konnelly said. \"What's being objected to is not entirely language, but the social changes underneath. Oftentimes, grammar is used as a shield to resist the inclusion of particular communities in public spaces.\"\n\nHistory shows changes happen because \"so much visible discourse put it in front of people and said 'this is the way this needs to be,' \" said Leap, the professor emeritus at American University.\n\nThat's how \"queer\" became part of national vernacular. ACT UP members chanted, \"We're here, we're queer,\" at demonstrations during the AIDS crisis, and that \"momentum disrupted deeply embedded habits\" in the English language.\n\nIt takes the courage of outspoken people to \"make the point that there are alternative[s],\" Leap said.\n\nInclusive names, diverse faces\n\nIn a small New Jersey town, one woman spent nearly a year speaking out about the need to incorporate gender-neutral language in her local government.\n\nLinda Hogoboom wrote letters and spoke at numerous meetings to urge her local leaders in Boonton to implement gender-inclusive language. Specifically, she wanted the town's Board of Aldermen to become the Town Council, and to label leaders \"council members\" rather than \"aldermen.\"\n\nHogoboom's efforts started out as an ask for more inclusive language to keep up with the global awareness of gender bias and equality. But she felt the council ignored her requests for a vote on the matter — a letter she submitted was entered into the official record, but the council never acknowledged it out loud. She felt silenced, but that only led her mission to evolve.\n\n\"You need more inclusive language in order to bring in more diversity in order to make sure that … filtering out that which [council members] don't feel is important does not happen again,\" Hogoboom said.\n\nBoonton leaders voted 7-2 in early 2021 to change its title to Town Council. That leaves Dover as the only New Jersey municipality led by a Board of Aldermen.\n\nBoonton joined other governments across the nation in considering a switch to gender-neutral language. Two weeks after the New Jersey town's Board of Aldermen became the Town Council, the City Council of North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, voted to change gender-specific language in city ordinances.\n\nMany municipalities in Massachusetts have adopted new terms for their leadership. All but one of the state’s more than 40 cities use the title “city council,\" reported Wicked Local, another USA TODAY Network affiliate.\n\nAlso, a bill making its way through the Minnesota Legislature would, if passed, include gender-neutral language in the state constitution.\n\nInteresting:Many are more comfortable in their bodies during the pandemic. For some LGBTQ people, it's the opposite.\n\nDiscomfort leads to change\n\nLanguage changes, and will continue to evolve, Konnelly said.\n\nSince the Episcopal Church made language changes, Douglas, the Episcopal Divinity School dean, has noticed more women in the House of Bishops, and with that came \"an entirely different culture and style of leadership,\" she said.\n\nOut & Equal continues work with up to 150 partners to change leadership styles in the business sector as well. But Fidas, its managing director, recognizes that making language adjustments won't come easily for everyone, much as it wasn't easy for the Boonton Town Council to change its name. But that discomfort leads to inclusive, equal and diverse work and life spaces.\n\n\"We always have to remember the discomfort someone feels in evolving their own language or behavior to make room for somebody else is often minuscule in comparison to the discomfort that someone who's more marginalized feels in an organization that won't include them,\" Fidas said. \"[We give] people perspective that 'Hey, in this particular way, you are in the majority. How can you cultivate empathy and compassion for those who are not?' \"\n\nContact Sammy Gibbons at (920) 737-6895 or sgibbons@gannett.com.

Industry leaders fear the probe could also have a devastating impact on the solar workforce.\n\nThe Commerce Department has defended it as a transparent and necessary process, but several solar industry experts and executives told CNN it has also essentially frozen most solar imports into the US because of the threat of steep, retroactive tariffs.\n\n“With this administration and this much support, we’re in a position where we’re going to be laying off people in the renewables industry,” George Hershman, CEO of utility solar contractor SOLV Energy, told CNN. “While you say all those things we agree with, we’re getting crushed because we literally can’t buy a module today. It’s so frustrating.”\n\nThe investigation was launched after one small US-based company, Auxin Solar, filed a complaint in February. Auxin CEO Mamun Rashid told CNN that the complaint “was existential” for his company.\n\n“When prices of finished panels from Southeast Asia come in below our bill of materials cost, American manufacturers cannot compete,” Rashid said, adding that “if foreign producers are circumventing U.S. law and causing harm to U.S. producers like Auxin Solar, it needs to be addressed.”\n\nRashid told CNN it’s “lamentable” that frustration is aimed at his company, rather than the “foreign suppliers” that he says are circumventing US law. Rashid also noted that Auxin is “here and can quickly scale up to meet needs of utilities within 2 to 3 quarters if we have the purchase order today.”\n\nSolar industry leaders have been communicating with the Commerce Department and have also communicated their concerns about the probe to Biden’s top climate officials – including McCarthy and US Climate Envoy John Kerry – a person familiar with the conversations said.\n\n“The administration has been in touch with and is engaging with all kinds of solar stakeholders including the trade associations but also labor, communities, and NGOs,” a White House official told CNN.\n\n‘The worst moment’\n\nThe Commerce probe comes on the heels of last year’s ban on solar panels and parts that were suspected of having links to forced labor in China’s Xinjiang Province.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security directed US Customs and Border Protection to issue a Withhold Release Order, which banned imports made by Chinese company Hoshine Silicon Industry Co., after the government alleged the company uses forced Uyghur labor.\n\n“Obviously, the industry absolutely needed to address any concerns about forced labor, but the implementation of that [order] was far from smooth,” Solar Energy Industries Association President Abigail Ross Hopper told CNN.\n\nAt ports around the country, CBP agents seized and detained any solar products they suspected had links to Hoshine, unless companies could prove they did not.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection statistics provided to CNN note the agency detained 734 shipments valued at $246 million, which the agency said is just 1.86% of the total value of all solar imports into the United States. But Hershman said the order ultimately led to a chilling effect across the industry, where companies withheld shipments for fear of being caught in an overly broad net at US ports.\n\n“If you have materials detained, you don’t want to ship more,” Hershman said.\n\nElectricians with IBEW Local 3 install solar panels on top of the Terminal B garage at LaGuardia Airport in November 2021. Mary Altaffer/AP\n\nSolar CEOs and industry analysts told CNN that while the CBP order was eventually resolved with a good outcome for the industry, the impact of the Commerce investigation is like whiplash.\n\n“Solar is a big mess right now,” said Marcelo Ortega, an analyst for Rystad. “This seems to be the worst moment for this to happen.”\n\nThis year was supposed to be a banner year for US solar growth. Independent energy research firm Rystad estimated the US would add another 27 gigawatts of solar energy this year.\n\nNow – between the Commerce Department probe, the border seizures, the high cost of solar components and no new legislation in Congress to grease the wheels for more renewable energy – Rystad estimates the US might only add around 10 gigawatts in 2022.\n\nOrtega said the backslide threatens Biden’s own climate goal to slash planet-warming emissions in half by 2030. The US would have to install around 50 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic capacity each year from 2022 to 2030 to keep Biden’s goal on-track, according to Ortega’s analysis.\n\nRoss Hopper told CNN that the industry is looking for certainty from the markets and from governments, but that it’s getting none of that right now.\n\n“There’s certainly been this steady cadence of challenges that keep getting thrown our way right at these moments of opportunity,” Ross Hopper told CNN.\n\nCommerce defends the probe\n\nAt a recent hearing on Capitol Hill, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo told lawmakers that strict trade laws required her department to initiate and complete an investigation. The department is expected to issue a preliminary finding on the investigation by late August, but a final determination could take as long as January 2023, a Commerce Department official told CNN.\n\n“My hands are very tied here,” Raimondo said at the hearing. “I’m required by statute to investigate a claim that companies operating in other countries are trying to circumvent the duties, and I’m required by statute to have a fulsome investigation.”\n\nThe 6 megawatt Stanton Solar Farm outside of Orlando, Florida. Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe Commerce official stressed to CNN that circumvention laws are “completely removed from political considerations.”\n\n“We’re committed to holding foreign producers accountable to playing by the rules,” the official told CNN.\n\nNevertheless, Raimondo has been questioned and criticized by politicians in both parties. A bipartisan group of 19 senators wrote to Biden this week asking for an expedited preliminary decision on the investigation.\n\nAnd at a recent hearing, Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat, pressed Raimondo on her “very serious concerns” about the investigation.\n\n“This will jeopardize tens of thousands of good-paying American solar jobs,” Rosen said. “If we lose these jobs, they won’t come back.”\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Republican Gov.

Last year, China banned imports of pineapples from the island followed by some types of apples later in the year citing “pest control.” Earlier this year, it also banned Taiwanese grouper fish, a high-value seafood product from Taiwan, citing detection of some banned drugs.\n\nBeijing’s recent announcements coincide with Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan, the first visit by a sitting speaker in 25 years, and after Beijing issued stern warnings that it would take countermeasures in retaliation.\n\nThe country’s military said after Pelosi’s visit that it was launching a series of “targeted military operations to counteract the situation.”\n\nAt a press briefing on Wednesday, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that “the US and Taiwan separatist forces must take the responsibility and pay the price for the mistakes they made.” Her comments came after she was asked whether the latest export suspension are intended to punish Taiwan for Pelosi’s visit, which she declined to answer directly, saying “please ask relevant department in charge.”\n\nPelosi’s visit comes at a tense moment for China.\n\nThe Communist Party will undergo a leadership reshuffle at its 20th party congress this fall. President Xi Jinping is expected to seek a historic third term in power at the meeting.\n\nDomestic tensions are high as the country’s economy has slipped to the lowest growth in more than two years amid rigid Covid lockdowns and a slumping property market. Youth unemployment has soared to the highest on record. Social protests are rising because of a nationwide mortgage crisis and a series of rural bank scandals.\n\nImpact on global supply chains\n\nTraders and analysts are worried about an escalation in China-Taiwan tensions and their impact on the global supply chain and inflation outlook.\n\nGlobal markets tumbled Tuesday, with major stock indexes closing in the red and safe-haven currencies surging. On Wednesday morning, Asian markets rebounded a bit, but risk sentiment remains muted.\n\n“China’s response to Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan could have an impact on supply chains and demand, which could keep the inflationary pressures going strong,” said Edward Moya, senior market strategist for Oanda, on Wednesday.\n\nGlobal supply chains have already been rattled by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The World Bank said recently that many countries are experiencing double-digit inflation.\n\nAny conflict in Taiwan, which is key in supplying the world with semiconductors, could exacerbated the global chip shortage that has already strained the global auto industry.

Earlier in the week, Germany halted certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline following Moscow’s actions.\n\nThe European Union, United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Switzerland, Australia and Taiwan all hit Moscow with new injunctions over the weekend, condemning the military incursion that unfolded over the past 24 hours.\n\nRussia is already paying a price for its aggression.

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the measures will paralyze Russia’s central bank assets and freeze its transactions, making it impossible to liquidate its assets.\n\n“We will stop Putin from using his war chest,” von der Leyen said in a statement.\n\nThe statement said it will limit the sale of “golden passports,” which allow wealthy Russians to gain citizenship in another country in exchange for an investment. This move would clamp down on wealthy Russians with connections to the government becoming citizens of other countries and “gaining access to our financial systems.”\n\nVon der Leyen and French president Emmanuel Macron announced other measures early Friday, vowing to inflict “maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite.”\n\n“We will hold the Kremlin accountable,” said von der Leyen.\n\nThe sanctions are aimed to hit Russia’s financial, energy and transport sectors, and include export controls and trade financing bans.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nEven historically neutral Switzerland is adopting the EU’s sanctions against Russia, President Ignazio Cassis announced Monday.

Instead of using the reserves to buffer a plummeting ruble, Russia will no longer be able to access the funds it keeps in US dollars.\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled another set of harsh measures against Russia, saying: “Putin chose this war.”\n\nThose sanctions include export blocks on technology, a centerpiece of Biden’s approach that he said would severely limit Russia’s ability to advance its military and aerospace sector.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said “this includes Russia-wide restrictions on semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics and maritime technologies.”\n\nWashington also put sanctions on people it described as “corrupt billionaires” and their families who are close to the Kremlin.\n\nIt said it would cut off 13 major state-owned companies from raising money in the United States, including energy giant Gazprom and Sberbank, Russia’s largest financial institution.\n\nThe White House also vowed to sanction two dozen Belarusian individuals and companies, which include “two significant Belarusian state-owned banks, nine defense firms, and seven regime-connected officials and elites.”\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom imposed fresh sanctions on Russian banks Monday and said it had a “hit list” of oligarchs to be sanctioned, according to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.\n\nThe country will prevent Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, from clearing payments in Sterling.

Despite how Trump and others have made it sound, it does not mean the US was ever going it alone.\n\n“A ridiculous term,” said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\n“A horrible term,” said Jeff Colgan, professor and director of the Climate Solutions Lab at Brown University and an expert on the geopolitics of oil.\n\n“This stupid term,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert and a research professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University.\n\nThe term has various non-literal definitions. And the US did satisfy some of these definitions under Trump in 2020 — as it did again in the 11 months of 2021, mostly under Biden, for which we have complete data.\n\nFor example, in both periods, the US exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported. It also produced more primary energy than it consumed.\n\nBut none of that means that the Trump-era US did no energy importing at all. From the beginning of Trump’s term to the end, the US very much relied on oil and gas from abroad.\n\nIn 2020, Trump’s last full year in office, the US imported about 7.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products. That was down from prior years – the US imported more than 10 million barrels per day in 2016, President Barack Obama’s last full year – but still a whole lot of foreign energy.\n\nIn fact, contrary to prominent Republicans’ suggestions over the last month that the US had just recently started consuming Russian energy under Biden, US energy imports from Russia spiked during the Trump presidency.\n\nAnd that isn’t the only thing Republicans have gotten wrong.\n\nContrary to claims from Trump and other Republicans, Biden has not “shut down” American energy: US crude oil production in Biden’s first year was higher than in each of Trump’s first two years and just narrowly shy of production in Trump’s last year, though substantially lower than production in Trump’s record-setting third year. And experts say it is economic factors and cautionary pressures from Wall Street, not anything Biden has done, that has made US oil companies reluctant to dramatically ramp up production from current levels.\n\nMultiple reasons for foreign imports\n\nAmid the US boom in oil and gas production from hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, the quantity of US imports of crude oil and petroleum products has been trending downward since early in the second term of President George W. Bush. But there are numerous reasons why the US doesn’t just stop importing entirely.\n\nOne key reason is that there is a mismatch between many of the refineries in the US, which were designed to handle heavy crude oil, and the lighter crude that is produced in the US through fracking.\n\nAnother reason is that domestic energy production isn’t sufficient to fulfill the needs of all US refineries – for which it can be profitable to buy low-cost unfinished energy from abroad, turn it into higher-value petroleum products, and then export some of those products. Colgan noted in an email that even at moments when the US is a net exporter of oil, “it remains tightly integrated into the world market for oil, constantly exporting some grades of oil to foreign customers while importing other grades of oil into the United States. Same for oil products like gasoline and diesel.”\n\nGeographic factors are also at play. For example, refineries in California have relied on imports, some from Russia, because importing has been cheaper than getting oil shipped from various parts of the US, such as the Permian Basin in the Southwest, to which California has no pipeline connection.\n\nUnless the US shifts completely to renewable or nuclear energy, Krane said in an interview, “we are going to be tethered to supply lines that stretch halfway around the world whether we like it or not.”\n\nRussian imports never ceased under Trump\n\nBefore Biden announced a ban on imports of Russian energy last Tuesday, some Republicans suggested that the US had suddenly started importing Russian oil under Biden.\n\nFor example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at an event in late February: “We were, before Biden took office, for the first time in any of our lifetimes, actually energy independent. Putin didn’t matter. Now, they’re importing millions of barrels of oil from Russia.”\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst said on Fox News on March 6 that Biden’s choices when he first came into office “put us in this tenuous position with energy independence in the United States. Instead of being an exporter of energy, we became a consumer of Russian oil.”\n\nThe truth is that the US was importing a significant quantity of oil and petroleum products from Russia under Trump: over 137 million barrels in 2018, then 189.8 million barrels in 2019 and 197.7 million barrels in 2020.\n\nImports from Russia did increase again, to 245.2 million barrels, in 2021.\n\nAnalysts have attributed part of the spike in energy imports from Russia since 2018 to the sanctions Trump imposed on Venezuelan oil in 2019, which left US refiners looking for an alternative supplier. Regardless of the cause, it’s just not true that “Putin didn’t matter” to the US energy supply before Biden took office or that the US “became a consumer of Russian oil” under Biden.\n\nWhat is true is that, under both Trump and Biden, imports from Russia made up a fraction of total US petroleum imports – about 8 percent in 2021, just about tied with Mexico for second place.\n\nThe US reliance on foreign energy is in large part a reliance on close ally Canada, which provided 51 percent of US imports in 2021.\n\nBiden’s impact has been overstated\n\nRepublicans have portrayed Biden as an all-powerful enemy of the US oil and gas industry.\n\nTrump claimed in a speech in late February that Biden “shut down American energy.” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a Wednesday suggestion that Biden was stopping oil companies from increasing production, writing: “If Biden would let America get back to 2019 production we won’t need a single drop of oil from #Venezuela or #Iran or anyone else.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Biden’s attitude toward the US oil and gas industry is less friendly than Trump’s was. But the truth is that Biden isn’t stopping US energy companies from increasing production and certainly never “shut down” US energy production.\n\n“President Biden hasn’t done anything yet – no offense – because he can’t get anything passed through the Congress,” Jaffe said in an interview.\n\nRather, US oil companies themselves have been reluctant to dramatically ramp up production. While the oil lobby has cast blame on Biden policies, experts cite various other reasons – including supply chain problems, challenges finding workers, and, critically, the current insistence from Wall Street that energy companies restrain spending and return cash to investors.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, told CNN Business for an article in early March, before Biden announced the Russia ban. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nKrane, the energy studies fellow from Rice University, concurred in an interview after Biden announced the ban.\n\n“It’s not a lack of leasing that’s holding back US crude. It’s Wall Street,” he said. “The federal government is like a third-tier player in the US oil market. Market signals themselves are the main driver of energy production and decision-making in the US.”\n\nEven still, US field production of crude oil in 2021, about 11.2 million barrels per day, was only slightly lower than US production under Trump in 2020, when it was about 11.3 million barrels per day – and 2021 production was higher than production in 2017 and 2018, Trump’s first two years in office, though well below the record 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019.\n\nNumerous Republicans have castigated Biden’s decision to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried crude oil from Canada’s oil sands to the US. But the long-delayed pipeline would almost certainly not have been ready this year even if Biden had allowed construction to proceed.\n\nThe federal Energy Information Administration projected this month that US crude oil production will hit 12 million barrels per day again in 2022, then set a new record of 13 million barrels per day in 2023.\n\nMoratorium put on hold\n\nBiden has called for a shift away from fossil fuel production and toward renewable energy sources, and he has put forward policies toward that end. Those policies have included an attempted temporary moratorium on new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands and offshore waters.\n\nBut the Biden moratorium wouldn’t have stopped drilling on existing leases. A judge put the Biden moratorium on hold in June. And the moratorium was intended to be in place only until the completion of a review by Biden’s interior department – which ended up recommending an increase to leasing fees but not a long-term halt to new leasing.\n\nAs CNN’s Ella Nilsen reported last week, the Biden administration approved more drilling permits in its first year than the Trump administration approved in 2017, 2018 and 2019, though fewer than it approved in 2020.\n\nSince late February of this year, there has been a pause on the issuance of new leases and permits on federal territory. That pause, however, was prompted by a judge’s injunction in a lawsuit filed by Republican state attorneys general.\n\nIn addition, it’s important to note that more than three-quarters of US drilling occurs on non-federal territory.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/business/china-russia-sanctions-friction-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "4 ways China is quietly making life harder for Russia | CNN Business", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nChina is quietly distancing itself from Russia’s sanction-hit economy.\n\nThe two states proclaimed last month that their friendship had “no limits.” That was before Russia launched its war in Ukraine.\n\nNow, with Russia’s economy being slammed with sanctions from all over the world, there is growing evidence that China’s willingness and ability to aid its northern neighbor may be limited. Beijing has refused to condemn Russia’s attack on Ukraine but wants to avoid being impacted by the sanctions it has repeatedly denounced as an ineffective way of resolving the crisis.\n\n“China is not a party to the [Ukraine] crisis, and doesn’t want the sanctions to affect China,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Tuesday during a phone call with his Spanish counterpart.\n\nBeijing also gave its full backing Wednesday to comments made earlier this week by China’s ambassador to Ukraine. “China will never attack Ukraine. We will help, especially economically,” Fan Xianrong was quoted as saying in a press release from the Lviv regional government.\n\nFears that Chinese companies could face US sanctions over ties with Russia had contributed to an epic sell-off in Chinese stocks recent days. That slump was reversed Wednesday when Beijing promised it would pursue policies to boost its sputtering economy and keep financial markets stable.\n\nUS officials told CNN on Monday that they have information suggesting China has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance. China dismissed that as “disinformation.”\n\nAnalysts say that China is attempting to strike “a delicate balance” between supporting Russia rhetorically but without further antagonizing the United States.\n\nBeijing and Moscow share a strategic interest in challenging the West. However, Chinese banks cannot afford to lose access to US dollars, and many Chinese industries cannot afford to be deprived of US technology.\n\nWhile China is Russia’s No. 1 trading partner, Beijing has other priorities. Trade between the two countries made up just 2% of China’s total trade volume. The European Union and the United States have much larger shares, according to Chinese customs statistics from last year.\n\nHere are some measures Beijing has taken in the last few weeks to distance itself from the isolated and crumbling Russian economy.\n\nLetting the ruble drop\n\nChina’s currency, the yuan, doesn’t trade completely freely, moving instead within bands set by officials at the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). Last week, they doubled the size of the ruble trading range, allowing the Russian currency to fall faster.\n\nThe ruble has already lost more than 20% of its value against both the dollar and euro since the start of the war in Ukraine. By allowing the Russian currency to fall against the yuan, Beijing isn’t doing Moscow any favors.\n\nRussians will have to pay more in rubles for Chinese imports such as smartphones and cars. Chinese phone brands like Xiaomi and Huawei are hugely popular in Russia, and were vying with Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (SSNLF) for market leadership before the war.\n\nChinese car makers, such as Great Wall Motor and Geely Auto, occupy 7% of Russia’s market, selling more than 115,000 vehicles last year. Great Wall Motor has stopped supplying new cars to dealers in Russia because of the exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nExpanding the trading band would allow the yuan to keep up with the ruble’s wild swings, so that Chinese companies can “better grasp the magnitude or trend of future exchange rate fluctuations and reduce exchange risks by using hedging methods, such as derivatives,” state-owned China Business Network reported last week.\n\nCurrently, about $25 billion of China-Russia trade is conducted in yuan, Chinese state media reported.\n\nSitting on reserves\n\nThe most significant help China could offer Russia is through the $90 billion worth of reserves Moscow holds in yuan, wrote Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, in a research report on Tuesday.\n\nSanctions have frozen about $315 billion worth of Russia’s reserves — or roughly half the total — as Western countries have banned dealing with the Russian central bank.\n\nRussia’s finance minister Anton Siluanov said this week that the country wanted to use yuan reserves after Moscow was blocked from accessing US dollars and euros, according to Russia’s state media.\n\nThe PBOC has so far not made any comment about its position regarding these reserves.\n\nIf China allowed Moscow to convert its yuan reserves into US dollars or euros, “that would clearly help Russia’s current impasse,” García-Herrero noted. However, “the reputational risk of potentially breaching Western sanctions would be a huge step for the PBOC to take and therefore makes it highly unlikely,” she said.\n\n“The long-term gains of moving closer to Russia might not match the impact of Western investors suddenly losing interest in China,” she added.\n\nWithholding aircraft parts\n\nSanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union mean that the world’s two major aircraft makers, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSF), are no longer able to supply spare parts or provide maintenance support for Russian airlines. The same is true of jet engine makers.\n\nThat means Russian airlines could run out of parts within a matter of weeks, or fly planes without having equipment replaced as frequently as recommended to operate safely.\n\nEarlier this month, a top Russian official said that China has refused to send aircraft parts to Russia as Moscow looks for alternative supplies.\n\nValery Kudinov, head of aircraft airworthiness at Russia’s air transport agency, was quoted by Russian state news agency Tass as saying that Russia would look for opportunities to source parts from countries including Turkey and India after a failed attempt to obtain them from China.\n\n“As far as I know … China refused,” Kudinov was quoted as saying.\n\nIn response to CNN’s request for comment, China’s foreign ministry reiterated Beijing’s opposition to sanctions adding that China and Russia will maintain “normal economic and trade cooperation.”\n\nChina and Russia set up a civil aviation joint venture in 2017 to build a new long-haul, widebody passenger plane, seeking to rival the duopoly of Boeing and Airbus. Production of the CR929 has begun, but disagreements over suppliers have caused delays. The plane was initially expected to be offered to customers in 2024. But Russia postponed the timeline to 2028 to 2029.\n\nFreezing infrastructure investment\n\nThe World Bank has halted all its programs in Russia and Belarus following the invasion of Ukraine. It hadn’t approved any new loans or investments to Russia since 2014, and none to Belarus since 2020.\n\nMore surprisingly, perhaps, is the decision by the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to do the same. In a statement earlier this month, it said it was suspending all its activities related to Russia and Belarus “as the war in Ukraine unfolds.” The move was “in the best interests” of the bank, it added.\n\nFrustrated by a relative lack of influence at the World Bank (based in Washington, D.C.) and the Asian Development Bank (where Japan is a major force), China launched the AIIB in 2016. In addition to hosting the headquarters, China provides the president of the bank and has 26.5% of the votes. India and Russia have 7.6% and 6% respectively.\n\nThe AIIB’s decision to suspend activities in Russia means $1.1 billion of approved or proposed lending aimed at improving the country’s road and rail networks is now on hold.\n\n— CNN’s Beijing bureau and Hannah Ritchie in Sydney contributed to this article.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/28/business/gm-stop-russia-exports/index.html", "title": "GM stops exporting cars to Russia | CNN Business", "text": "1.

Europeans can count on our full support,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement.\n\nPGNiG confirmed Wednesday that it was no longer receiving Russian gas through the Yamal pipeline and accused Gazprom of a breach of contract. It said that it was able to meet its customers’ demand for gas, despite the “cessation of deliveries.”\n\nBulgaria’s energy ministry said in a statement that paying in rubles was unacceptable and that Bulgargaz had “fully fulfilled its obligations and has made all payments required under this contract in a timely manner, diligently and in accordance with its provisions.”\n\nThe news sent US natural gas futures up about 3% Tuesday. European gas prices jumped more than 20% on Wednesday morning before dropping back.\n\nRussia delivered an ultimatum last month to “unfriendly” nations that they must pay for their energy in rubles starting April 1 or risk being cut off from vital supplies. But the flow of gas had continued until Wednesday.\n\nThe Kremlin said payments for gas being delivered at the time of its announcement would be due toward the end of April or the beginning of May, which is why Russia didn’t immediately shut off the flow of gas to Europe.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin’s high-stakes threat sent shockwaves through Europe, which cannot keep its economy running for long without Russian energy. Moscow sent a clear signal that it could at some point reduce natural gas flows.\n\n“The announcement by Gazprom that it is unilaterally stopping delivery of gas to customers in Europe is yet another attempt by Russia to use gas as an instrument of blackmail,” von der Leyen said. “This is unjustified and unacceptable.”\n\nEU member states met Wednesday to coordinate their response. Von der Leyen said after the meeting that Poland and Bulgaria were now receiving gas from their EU neighbors. The European Union would continue its work to secure sufficient supplies and storage in the medium term, including liquified natural gas from the United States and other partners, she added.\n\n“Today, the Kremlin failed once again in this attempt to sow division between Europeans. The era of Russian fossil fuels in Europe will come to an end,” she said.\n\nNo shortages yet\n\nPoland and Bulgaria said they had been preparing for the possibility of Russian action, and that supplies to businesses and households were unaffected.\n\n“At present, no restrictive measures have been imposed on gas consumption in Bulgaria,” the energy ministry added.\n\nPGNiG said it had made preparations to obtain gas from various sources, including through gas connections on its western and southern borders and an LNG terminal in the northwest port city of Swinoujscie.\n\nIt also said its underground gas storage facilities were almost 80% full.\n\n“The balance sheet is supplemented by domestic gas production and fuel reserves accumulated in underground gas storage facilities. Currently, the warehouse filling level is around 80 percent and is significantly higher than in the corresponding period in previous years,” it added.\n\nPoland’s Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said Tuesday that there would be no shortage of gas in Poland despite the Russian halt of exports.\n\n“Poland has the necessary gas reserves and sources of supply that protect our security — we have been effectively independent of Russia for years,” she said in a tweet.\n\n“There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes,” the minister wrote.\n\n— CNN’s Anna Odzeniak, Amy Cassidy, James Frater, Uliana Pavlova, Josh Pennington and Angela Dewan contributed to this report", "authors": ["Sugam Pokharel Mark Thompson", "Sugam Pokharel", "Mark Thompson"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/04/15/israel-war-updates-iran-attack/73325137007/", "title": "Israel war updates: Pro-Palestine protests snarl traffic in US cities", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Iran attack and the Israel-Hamas war for Monday, April 15. For the latest news, view our story for Tuesday, April 16.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in Gaza blocked bridge traffic in San Francisco and New York and prompted some air travelers in Chicago to ditch their rides and reach the airport on foot as coordinated protests caused disruptions across several cities in the U.S. and internationally Monday\n\nThe organizing A15 Action group said on its website that the \"the global economy is complicit in genocide and together we will coordinate to disrupt and blockade economic logistical hubs and the flow of capital.''\n\nThat meant shutting down the Golden Gate Bridge during the morning commute, snarling traffic into and out of San Francisco for hours. A group carrying a banner that read “Stop the world for Gaza” was eventually cleared off. Across the bay in Oakland, protesters forced the closure of two sections of Interstate 880, using weighted barrels to block the road.\n\nIn New York, hundreds of demonstrators halted afternoon traffic by clogging the Brooklyn Bridge, bringing on a large police response. And in Chicago, the highway that goes into O'Hare Airport was jammed by a protest, leading several passengers to walk to the terminal with their luggage.\n\n“I support the idea that people should express their First Amendment rights and protest if they would like to,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a statement. “I do not think that they should be disruptive of the traffic of people trying to get from one place to another.''\n\nRoad blockages from protests were also reported in Philadelphia, San Antonio, Texas, and Eugene, Oregon − where 52 demonstrators were arrested − in addition to Ottawa, Canada.\n\nNew allies:Israel's critics became allies over Iran attack. But they're still pushing a Gaza cease-fire\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Oil prices fell Monday, and analysts credited the limited damage from Iran's strike.\n\n∎ Humanitarian aid getting into the Gaza Strip has increased by a large amount in the last few days, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Monday.\n\n∎ The U.S. Central Command said Monday that its forces destroyed four unmanned aerial vehicles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen as an act of self-defense. Since the Israel-Hamas war, Iran-linked Houthi rebels have conducted dozens of missile and drone attacks on ships traveling in the Red Sea commercial waterway, a key trade route.\n\n∎ British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Monday that the G7 industrialized nations are working on a package of coordinated measures against Iran. “I spoke to my fellow G7 leaders,'' he said. \"We are united in our condemnation of this attack.”\n\nWhat's next?Israel's long-simmering conflict with Iran moves out of the shadows\n\nIsrael weighs Iran response amid global concerns\n\nIsrael's War Cabinet met Monday as the nation weighs a response to Iran's missile and drone blitz amid global concerns that the Middle East could be careening toward a wider war.\n\nCabinet members huddled Sunday and were united in backing some form of retaliation for the Saturday strike − the first time Iran targeted Israel directly from its own territory − but were divided on the timing and scale of the next steps.\n\nNo decision has been announced, but speaking at the Nevatim air force base in southern Israel, military Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said Monday: “This launch of so many missiles, cruise missiles, and UAVs (drones) into the territory of the state of Israeli territory will be met with a response.”\n\nAll eyes were on Israel as world leaders urged restraint. \"We’re on the edge of the cliff and we have to move away from it,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. \"We have to step on the brakes and reverse gear.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. will defend its longtime ally but would not be part of any response to Saturday's attack.\n\nIran launched the assault over a suspected Israeli airstrike on its embassy compound in Syria on April 1 that killed seven Iranian military officers. A U.S.-led coalition of warplanes and naval assets helped intercept the more than 300 missiles and drones fired Saturday, and damage was limited in Israel.\n\nBiden says US 'committed to Israel's security'\n\nBiden said Monday that the U.S. is “committed to Israel’s security” following Iran’s attack on Israel over the weekend, as he reaffirmed his support for a hostage deal between Israel and Hamas.\n\n“We're committed to a cease-fire that will bring the hostages home and prevent the conflict from spreading beyond where it already has,” Biden said.\n\nBiden made the comments ahead of a bilateral meeting at the White House with Iraq Prime Minister Mohammed Shyaa Al-Sudani. \"We're also committed to the security of our personnel and partners in the region, including Iraq,\" Biden said.\n\n“Together with our partners, we defeated that attack,” Biden said of the 300 missiles and drones targeting Israel that a U.S.-led coalition of warplanes and naval assets helped intercept.\n\nAt the start of his meeting with Biden, Sudani joined the chorus of international voices urging restraint from Israel. “We encourage all the efforts of stopping the expansion of the area of conflict, especially the latest development,” Sudani said.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nThwarted attack not foretold but an 'embarrassing failure' for Iran\n\nAt a White House news conference Monday, Kirby pushed back on reports the Iranian attacks were meant to fail and that Iran warned about them ahead of time so they would be thwarted. Kirby called the claims \"categorically false'' and \"malarkey,'' underscoring that Israeli defenses along with U.S. help fended off the assault.\n\n\"It was an embarrassing failure'' for Iran, Kirby said.\n\nAt the same time, he urged the House of Representatives to \"urgently\" vote on a bipartisan national security bill that has already passed the Senate, which also includes funding for Ukraine. Speaker Mike Johnson said Monday the House will consider the aid packages separately this week.\n\nDespite the U.S. intervention against the Iranian attack Saturday, Kirby said a response to it is \"an Israeli decision to make,'' Kirby said. \"We're going to leave it squarely with them. We're not involved in their decision-making process about a potential response.''\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nWhen will Israel respond to Iran's attack?\n\nTwo top Israeli officials have stressed that while retaliation may not be imminent, a response would be carefully orchestrated − and Iran would face the consequences.\n\n“We will build a regional coalition and exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us,” Minister Benny Gantz said.\n\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel would look to create a strategic alliance “against this grave threat by Iran.”\n\nWorld leaders urge Israel to use restraint\n\nIsrael's allies in Europe pressed the nation Monday to move cautiously.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron urged Israel to make isolating Iran the goal. \"We will do all we can to avoid things flaring up,\" he said.\n\n\"Israel has won defensively thanks to its strong air defense and the efforts of the U.S., Britain and Arabic states,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said. “Now we must prevent an escalation in the region.”\n\nRussia, which has refrained from criticizing its ally Iran, weighed in as well. “We are extremely concerned about the escalation of tensions in the region,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “We call on all countries in the region to exercise restraint.”\n\nWhy did Iran strike Israel?\n\nIran's missile and drone barrage was retaliation for Israel's suspected strike on Iran's embassy in Damascus, which killed seven Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers, including two top commanders, on April 1.\n\nBut the strike followed months of clashes between Israel and Iran’s regional allies and was triggered by the war in Gaza, which has spread to fronts with Iran-aligned groups in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war began Oct. 7, when Hamas militants brutally attacked Israeli border communities, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages. A subsequent bombardment of Gaza by Israel has left over 33,000 Palestinians dead and triggered a humanitarian crisis in the gutted enclave.\n\nStrike may have delayed Rafah invasion\n\nIsrael's long-anticipated ground invasion of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip may be on hold because of the Iran strike, CNN and Israeli media reported. Netanyahu said last week that he had set a date for the invasion, which Israel sees as key to crushing Hamas, but he did not disclose the timing or details.\n\n\"This victory requires entry into Rafah and the elimination of the terrorist battalions there. It will happen − there is a date,\" Netanyahu said. Israel has been bombing Rafah for weeks, but Biden and other world leaders have urged Israel not to invade the city, fearing massive civilian death tolls because almost 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering there.\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, Tom Vanden Brook; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}]}

Austin said the US would pursue a diplomatic solution “until the very last minute, until it’s not possible.”\n\nBiden plans to spend the weekend monitoring the ongoing Ukraine crisis from the White House as he meets with his national security team and remains in close contact with world leaders, multiple officials say. Biden had considered traveling to Delaware, as he typically does, but decided to remain in Washington.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris was in Munich, Germany, where she warned of “swift, severe and united” consequences for Russia in the event of an invasion.\n\nThroughout recent days, the Biden administration has publicly disclosed several intelligence details on Russian movements – a marked shift in how US national security officials typically operate. The administration’s decision to discuss their movements “loudly and repeatedly,” Biden said Friday inside the Roosevelt Room, was made “to remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving.”\n\n“Make no mistake. If Russia pursues its plans, it will be responsible for a catastrophic and needless war of choice,” he added.\n\nThe President’s assertion on Friday that he’s “convinced” Putin has “made the decision” to invade Ukraine is a significant change in his position. Biden previously stated he did not believe the Russian leader had made up his mind, but acknowledged his insights into Putin’s thinking were limited. He did note that he hoped diplomacy could de-escalate the situation, saying on Friday that “diplomacy is always a possibility.”\n\nQuestioned on why he believed Putin is considering diplomacy at all, Biden said only: “We have a significant intelligence capability.”\n\nBiden said Friday that Russian misinformation is building up to a false justification for Putin to invade Ukraine, accusing Russia of ceasefire violations in the “rapidly escalating crisis.”\n\n“Over the last few days, we’ve seen reports of a major uptick in violations of the ceasefire by Russian-backed fighters attempting to provoke Ukraine in the Donbas,” Biden said, pointing to multiple examples of disinformation that he said have been spread by Russian state media, including a “phony” claim of genocide in the Donbas region.\n\nSurprise revelation\n\nBiden had not initially been planning to announce during his speech Friday that he believed Putin made up his mind, and the revelation was not included in his prepared remarks. He only made his view known afterward when questioned by a reporter, answering at first only in the affirmative and declining to expand.\n\nHe also made clear there is a diplomatic path to resolve the crisis, even as US officials believe it is growing narrower as signs mount of an imminent invasion.\n\nThe determination that Putin has decided to invade Ukraine was made in part based on the latest intelligence assessments showing nearly half of Russian forces massed on the borders have moved into attack position, administration officials and people familiar with the matter said.\n\nDefense officials said Friday the number of battalion tactical groups had swelled to approximately 120-125, and that Russian forces were continuing to move toward the border.\n\nBiden’s view of Putin’s decision-making reflected those developments and the broader assessments of the intelligence community, an administration official said. The President cited “a significant intelligence capability” for his view of Putin’s thinking, which he’d previously said was something of a mystery.\n\nRussian response\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova responded to Biden’s comments, saying on her Telegram, “The most monstrous thing is that there’s not a word about the true state of affairs of the civilian population in the Donbas. No people, no problems?”\n\nBut the claims by the Russians simply don’t make sense, Biden argued earlier Friday, saying, “It defies basic logic to believe the Ukrainians would choose this moment – with well over 150,000 troops arranged on its borders – to escalate a year-long conflict.”\n\nIn reporting Zakharova’s comments, Russia’s state news agency RIA-Novosti also said, “The American president repeated the unsubstantiated thesis about Russia’s alleged attempts to ‘attack’ Ukraine, threatening Moscow with sanctions in the event of an escalation. The Russian Federation categorically denies such statements and escalation plans attributed to it.”\n\nWhite House officials have warned that Russia could face extensive sanctions if it invades Ukraine, calling them “the most severe measures we’ve ever contemplated against Russia.”\n\nDespite the US’ assessment of an imminent invasion of Ukraine, Biden said that it’s up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to decide whether he will attend this weekend’s security conference in Germany. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to meet with Zelensky during the conference on Saturday.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the White House blamed Russia for a massive cyberattack on Ukraine earlier in the week.\n\n“We believe that the Russian government is responsible for widescale cyberattacks on Ukrainian banks this week. We have technical information that links the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, as known GRU infrastructure was seen transmitting high volumes of communication to Ukraine based IP addresses and domains,” said Anne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology.\n\nThe attribution for the attack was unusually fast for the US government, and Neuberger noted that Russia has previously benefited from US delays in attributing Russian hacking operations.\n\n“Russia likes to move in the shadows and counts on a long process of attribution so it can continue its malicious behavior against Ukraine in cyberspace, including pre-positioning for its potential invasion,” Neuberger told reporters in the White House briefing room.\n\nBiden’s speech on Friday comes amid escalating tensions in the region.\n\nNearly half of Russian forces surrounding Ukraine are in attack position, according to a defense official familiar with the latest assessment. The number of battalion tactical groups has swelled to approximately 120 to 125.\n\nThe official said the Russian military has continued to move forces toward the border, and within the last 48 hours, the number of forces in attack position has reached 40% to 50%.\n\nUS Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Michael Carpenter warned earlier Friday that the US has assessed a significant Russian military buildup near Ukraine just in the last two weeks.\n\n“Russia probably has massed between 169,000-190,000 personnel in and near Ukraine as compared with about 100,000 on January 30,” he said in a statement at the OSCE meeting. That includes Russian troops on the borders of Ukraine as well as the Russian-led forces in eastern Ukraine, which have not been included in previous US assessments of Russia’s strength in the area.\n\nShortly before his remarks, Biden spoke with allies in North America and Europe. He will hold a phone call with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, the European Union and NATO to discuss the ongoing crisis.\n\nDuring the call, the leaders “expressed deep concern” about the situation and reiterated their support for Ukraine and discussed further economic assistance to the country, according to a White House statement.\n\n“They pledged to continue pursuing diplomacy to de-escalate tensions while ensuring readiness to impose swift, coordinated economic costs on Russia should it choose further conflict. The leaders also discussed efforts to ensure the defense and security of NATO’s eastern flank,” the statement said.\n\nThe President on Friday also called into a meeting the vice president was holding with members of Congress, who are all attending the Munich Security Conference in Germany and, according to a person in the room, he reiterated the work the US and allies have been doing to try to prevent a Russian invasion of Ukraine. He also updated the members on the situation at Ukraine’s borders.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misattributed a Russian response to Biden’s remarks.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kevin Liptak Betsy Klein Sam Fossum", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kevin Liptak", "Betsy Klein", "Sam Fossum"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}]}

On Friday, she was hailed as a hero after the Legislature passed a bill prohibiting marriage for anyone under 17.\n\nState lawmakers have repeatedly cited Sherry Johnson as an inspiration to change the law. She watched in the House gallery as the bill passed the House on a 109-1 vote, then stood as representatives turned to face her and applauded.\n\n“My heart is happy,” she said afterward. “My goal was to protect our children and I feel like my mission has been accomplished.

I survived.”\n\nRead more:House Republicans effectively kill anti-child marriage bill, cite possible case against gay marriage\n\nRead more:Child brides in India: Sex with minors now considered rape but enacting verdict isn't easy\n\nThe bill was a compromise between the House and Senate. The Senate originally passed a bill that banned the marriage of anyone under 18, but the House had wanted to carve out exceptions for some 16- and 17-year-olds when there’s a pregnancy.\n\nThe bill going to Republican Gov. Rick Scott would set limits on the marriage of 17-year-olds. While pregnancy won’t be a factor, anyone marrying a 17-year-old couldn’t be more than two years older and minors would need parental consent. Scott’s office said he will sign the bill.\n\nCurrently, 16- and 17-year-olds can marry with the consent of both sets of parents. If a pregnancy is involved, there’s no minimum age for marriage if a judge approves. A legislative staff analysis showed that between 2012 and 2016, 1,828 marriage licenses were issued in Florida to couples when at least one party was a minor. That includes a 13-year-old, seven 14-year-olds and 29 15-year-olds.\n\nRead more:Elementary school teacher arrested for coaching boys to perform sexual acts, take photos\n\nRead more:Justice Department moves to outlaw bump stocks, making them illegal to own or sell\n\nIn one case, a 14-year-old married a 15-year-old and in another, a man over the age of 90 was able to marry a girl who was 16 or 17 years old. In some cases, girls were allowed to marry men more than twice their age.\n\nSupporters say changing the law will make sure no child is forced to marry a man who raped her, even if she becomes pregnant. Still, Republican Rep. George Moraitis voted against the bill. While he didn’t say anything during floor debate Friday, he did say last month when he opposed the bill in committee that the current law is “very good, in my opinion, a very carefully crafted balance.”\n\n“There’s literally only a handful of cases that would fall under what I would say are potentially abusive,” said Moraitis, who also is chairman of the Broward County Republican Party. “To focus on a 10-year-old or an 11-year-old or something like that when we’re talking about the hundreds and hundreds of people that could get married. I’m particularly focused on the pregnancy aspect of it. I don’t want the message to be that it’s better to not get married.”\n\nAfter the vote, Republican bill sponsors Rep. Jeanette Nunez and Sen. Lizbeth Benacquisto emerged from their chambers’ floors and greeted Johnson with long, emotional hugs in the rotunda between the chambers.\n\n“She’s the star,” Benacquisto said to reporters before rushing back to the Senate floor.\n\nRead more:NRA sues Florida over gun bill same day Gov. Rick Scott signs it into law\n\nJohnson was 9 when she was raped by a church deacon, 10 when she gave birth and 11 when she married the man. Johnson said her church pressured her mother to consent to the marriage and a judge approved it. That was 47 years ago.\n\nShe ended up giving birth to five more children with the man before breaking free from the marriage several years later.

Teens under 16 can marry with a judge's permission in case of a pregnancy, though critics say if a girl under 16 is pregnant, it is evidence of a sex crime because she would have been too young to consent to a sexual relationship.\n\nAnd despite an uproar on social media after a vote on the bill was twice delayed, Westerfield said it was never the intent to permit marriages to children as young as 13, as state records show have occurred in past years.\n\nMore:If Kentucky parents are too stupid to stop child marriage, judges must step in\n\n\"That was never, never, never the intent of anybody,\" Westerfield said.\n\nAmong critics of the original version was the Kentucky Family Foundation, a socially conservative group.\n\nIts main concern was its belief that parents' opinions of underage marriages should be considered before the judge makes a decision, said Martin Cothran, a senior policy analyst for the group. He said he believes the revised version addresses the concerns of his organization.\n\nAnd he said Family Foundation does not support marriages of girls as young as 13.\n\n\"The only thing we're looking for is for parents to be involved,\" Cothran said.\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Sen. Julie Raque Adams, a Louisville Republican.\n\nThe measure was first heard in Westerfield's committee Feb. 15 after supporters testified such legislation is needed to protect girls who may have been sexually abused or exploited from being pushed into marriages with older men.\n\nAmong witnesses in support of SB 48 was Donna Pollard, a Louisville woman who testified she had been pushed into marriage at 16 to an older man who began sexually abusing her at 14. Her mother, who married at 13, supported the marriage, she said.\n\nPollard said she hopes the revised version will pass in a state that now has the nation's third highest rate of marriages involving a spouse under age 18.\n\n\"The nation has eyes on Kentucky right now, eager to see our leaders do the right thing and pass this legislation to prevent child sexual abuse through child marriage,\" she said. \"Despite the delay, I have seen the genuine efforts by Chairman Westerfield to ensure children are protected.\"\n\nAfter the initial hearing last month, the committee didn't vote on the measure. An uproar on social media ensued after Courier Journal reported it had been passed over for a vote in two subsequent meetings.\n\nWesterfield said the bill was delayed to address concerns of the Family Foundation and some members of the committee that it didn't include a role for parents in deciding whether to permit a marriage of someone under 18.\n\nCothran said his group believes the judge should at least consider the opinion of a parent in such cases. Further, he said, the wording of the previous version of the bill would have allowed a judge to approve a marriage involving a minor even in cases where a parent opposed it.\n\nAlso:Child marriage is still legal in Kentucky. A former bride wants to put an end to it.\n\nUnder the revised version of SB 48, parents may submit an affidavit expressing their consent to the marriage.\n\nA family or district court judge may not approve the marriage in cases where the age difference is more than four years between the 17-year-old and and the other party.\n\nThe judge must also consider why the 17-year-old seeks to marry, his or her maturity and whether the person has completed high school or a GED.\n\nThe judge also must consider any criminal records of either party and any history of domestic violence or sex offenses. SB 48 also calls for the judge to question the 17-year-old privately \"in camera\" to ensure the teen is not being pressured or coerced into the marriage.\n\nPregnancy of the underage party is not sufficient evidence to approve a marriage, according to the bill.\n\nWesterfield said he expects the bill to win committee approval Tuesday and head to the full Senate.\n\n\"I'm going to get the bill out of there,\" he said.\n\nDeborah Yetter: 502-582-4228; dyetter@courier-journal.com.

Doctors who attempted to help patients conceive through in-vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment used by millions of Americans, could also be locked up for destroying embryos, and certain contraception such as Plan B would be banned.\n\n“The taking of a life is murder, and it is illegal,” state Rep. Danny McCormick told a committee of state lawmakers who considered the bill in May, right after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked.\n\n“No compromises, no more waiting,” Brian Gunter, the pastor who suggested McCormick be the one to introduce the legislation, told the committee.\n\nLouisiana State Rep. Danny McCormick, pastor Brian Gunter and attorney Bradley Pierce (right to left) urged state lawmakers to move their bill, HB 813, out of committee earlier this year. Louisiana House of Representatives\n\nOnly four people spoke against the bill during the committee meeting— all women. They pleaded with the lawmakers to grasp the gravity of the proposed restrictions, which went farther than any state abortion law currently on the books, and warned of unintended consequences.\n\n“We need to take a deep breath,” said Melissa Flournoy, a former state representative who runs the progressive advocacy group 10,000 Women Louisiana. She said the bill would only punish women and that there wasn’t enough responsibility being placed on men.\n\nBut in the end, only one man and one woman, an Independent and a Democrat, voted against it in committee. Seven men on the committee, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill, moving it one step closer to becoming law.\n\nMen at the helm\n\nA faction of self-proclaimed “abolitionists” are seeking to make abortion laws more restrictive and the consequences of having the procedure more punitive than ever before.\n\nEmboldened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they say they will not be satisfied until fetuses are given the same protections as all US citizens — meaning that if abortion is illegal, then criminal statutes should be applied accordingly. While major national anti-abortion groups say they do not support criminalizing women, the idea is gaining traction with certain conservative lawmakers. And the activists and politicians leading the charge are nearly always men, CNN found.\n\nThis year, three male lawmakers from Indiana attempted to wipe out existing abortion regulations and change the state’s criminal statutes to apply at the time of fertilization. In Texas, five male lawmakers authored a bill last year that would have made getting an abortion punishable by the death penalty if it had gone into law. A state representative in Arizona introduced legislation that included homicide charges — saying in a Facebook video that anyone who undergoes an abortion deserves to “spend some time” in the Arizona “penal system.” And a male Kansas lawmaker proposed a bill that would amend the state’s constitution to allow abortion laws to pass without an exception for the life of the mother.\n\nWhile most in the anti-abortion movement believe that human life begins at conception, “abolitionists” are particularly uncompromising in how they act on their beliefs — comparing abortion to the Holocaust and using inflammatory terms such as “slaughter” and “murder” to describe a medical procedure that most Americans believe should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas 03:50 - Source: CNN\n\nBradley Pierce, the attorney who helped draft the Louisiana bill, said his organization has been involved with many of the “abolition” bills that have been introduced in more than a dozen states. All of this proposed legislation would make it possible for women seeking abortions to face criminal charges.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Americans said in a Pew Research Center poll they don’t believe men should have a greater say on abortion policy, but that is what is happening. Experts told CNN that the male dominance fits within the anti-abortion movement’s current framing as being focused on “fetal personhood” and “fetal rights” as opposed to maternal rights.\n\nEric Swank, an Arizona State University professor who has studied gender differences in anti-abortion activists, said his research found that while men aren’t necessarily more likely to consider themselves to be “pro-life” than women, they “are more willing to take the adamant stance of no abortion under any conditions.”\n\nThe most restrictive bills, which don’t include explicit “life of the mother” exceptions and would charge those who receive abortions with homicide, have failed to make it to the full vote needed for passage. But others that prohibit abortions even in cases of rape and incest have taken hold in around a dozen states, including Missouri, Alabama and Tennessee, according to Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThose laws, CNN found, were also overwhelmingly passed into law by male legislators. While female Republicans almost always voted in favor of the legislation, gender imbalances within state legislatures, as well as the fact that female lawmakers were more likely to be Democrats, fueled the voting gap. And male Democratic lawmakers were far more likely than female Democrats to cross the aisle to vote in favor of the abortion bans, according to CNN’s analysis.\n\nThe Texas Heartbeat Act, for example, outlawed nearly all abortions in the state when it criminalized the procedure as soon as a heartbeat could be detected — as early as six weeks of pregnancy. While men made up nearly three quarters of the 177 lawmakers who voted, nearly 90% of those who voted in favor of the bill were men.\n\nEncouraging ‘sacrificial behavior’\n\nScott Herndon, a bearded Idaho man and father of eight, once believed abortion was an issue that should be discussed “between a woman and her physician.”\n\nHe remembers watching the classic 80s movie, “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” and being relatively ambivalent about the fact that one of the characters received an abortion. He didn’t become a Christian until 1996, the same year he drove his pregnant girlfriend along the streets of San Francisco on his motorcycle. The pregnancy was unexpected, but that life development, along with a newfound religious practice, led Herndon to spend a lot of thinking about “the miraculous nature of life.” Over the years he began to feel compelled to get involved with the anti-abortion movement.\n\nHis daughter is now 25, and he and his wife went on to have seven more children. A longtime member of the Idaho Republicans, he told CNN he decided to run for state Senate this year with a mission of fighting government encroachment. Herndon, who touts his competitive shooting experience in high school and college, is a staunch supporter of the right to bear arms and strongly opposes vaccine mandates. He describes himself as a “true family-values conservative,” noting that his sons help him with his home-building business while his five daughters live on the family farm, milking cows, and raising chickens and pigs.\n\nOne of his longterm goals if elected, he said, is to abolish abortion in the state.\n\n“Success depends on changing hearts and minds,” he said. “I liken the effort to Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights movement for desegregation and equal treatment of African Americans.”\n\nThis comparison is one that abortion rights activists take serious issue with. “Let’s be clear: appropriating the word ‘abolition’ is particularly contemptuous,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement to CNN. “That word is a symbol of freedom and this group wants to put people behind bars for exercising their right to bodily autonomy.”\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gathered outside the US Supreme Court after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHerndon, however, says women should embrace their instinctual “sacrificial behavior.”\n\n“If a mother is in a life raft with a child and there’s only enough food and water to save one, I’m guessing most mothers would not throw their child overboard and drown them,” he said in an interview with CNN when asked about medical circumstances where a doctor may deem an abortion necessary to save a woman’s life, such as a cancer diagnosis that requires aggressive treatment.\n\nAs part of their efforts to abolish abortion, which is generally defined as the termination of a pregnancy, Herndon and others in the anti-abortion movement are attempting to redefine the term to the “intentional killing” of a fetus.\n\nThat way, they claim, the lives of mothers could still be saved as long as doctors make an equal attempt to save the fetus.\n\nGunter, meanwhile, said he disagrees with the medical establishment and does not believe abortion is ever medically necessary.\n\nDoctors point to a variety of medical situations where an abortion may be needed to protect a pregnant person's life. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nMedical and legal experts told CNN this is a dangerous and inaccurate claim, saying there are plenty of situations that could result in women dying or being put through unnecessary bodily harm if explicit exceptions for the health and life of the mother are not included in the laws regulating abortion.\n\nLouise King, a gynecologic surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the claims are “disingenuous at best and intentional dissemination of misinformation at worst” and questioned why they “can’t simply trust medical professionals to do their job.”\n\n“Most of these ‘arguments’ are attempts to impose a minority religious view on the majority of our citizens,” she said. “This is not a matter of belief or opinion. This is a highly inappropriate way to use our legislative system.”\n\nAn immediate abortion may be needed if a pregnant person’s water breaks before 20 weeks, King said, or when patients have pre-existing conditions that could lead to heart or liver failure or they need aggressive treatment for a disease like cancer that would severely harm — if not destroy — the fetus. An “equal attempt to save the fetus” would require putting the life of the pregnant person at risk,” she said, adding that it is also not the well established standard of care.\n\nDoctors also note that abortion bans take away a patient’s ability to make decisions about their own health and pregnancy, sometimes forcing them to endure pregnancies and deliveries of fetuses that will not survive.\n\nStories like this are already making headlines as laws become increasingly restrictive. In some cases, doctors are already afraid to perform abortions in cases where a mother’s health is at risk, even with so called “life of the mother” exceptions in place. In Texas, one woman learned that her baby had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. At the same time, doctors warned her that carrying the baby to term threatened her own life, but she says she was still refused an abortion by doctors who said it could run afoul of the state’s strict six-week abortion ban. She ultimately drove 10 hours to a New Mexico abortion clinic to undergo the procedure. “I’m still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,” she wrote on Facebook the next day.\n\nAnother Texas woman spoke out about being forced to carry her dead fetus for weeks after suffering a miscarriage. In Louisiana, a woman carrying a fetus without a skull was reportedly not allowed to get an abortion, while another was reportedly denied an abortion and instead forced into hours of labor when her water broke at 16 weeks, long before the fetus was viable.\n\nIdaho State Senate candidate Scott Herndon supports a total abortion ban in the state. Brook Joyner/CNN\n\nHerndon agreed that the health of the pregnant woman should be considered, but he worries that the medical community automatically prioritizes the mother’s life and does not treat the fetus as a person until birth, saying this needs to change. And he said that while locking up women is not his objective, it only makes sense for homicide charges to apply to a woman who chooses to undergo an abortion if fetuses are given equal protections under the law.\n\nAs chair of his county’s Republican Party, he attended the Idaho Republican convention in July and proposed an official change to the party platform in support of an amendment to the state constitution that would “strengthen” the rights of fetuses.\n\nAfter it easily passed the vote, a fellow Republican delegate took the floor with a proposal that was not met with the same support. She wanted to make sure an exception was included in the party platform for abortions needed for a woman’s physical and mental health, Herndon recounted.\n\nA heated debate ensued, with Herndon describing the proposal as not carefully crafted and unnecessary. The proposal was ultimately rejected by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, according to news reports. The Idaho Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNo exceptions\n\nBack in 2019, a bill that would criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest was placed in front of Alabama’s legislature — a move so extreme that a number of high-profile Republicans initially said it went too far.\n\nWhen the bill reached the state Senate, 25 male legislators voted on party lines to enact it, and the state’s female governor signed it into law.\n\nA federal judge blocked it from taking effect, but it had an immediate domino effect as other states followed suit. Most of the laws, including near-total abortion bans known as “trigger” laws and six-week “heartbeat” bills, weren’t able to take effect at the time either, but they are being implemented across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned.\n\nThis wave of unprecedented restrictions shows the power of the anti-abortion movement and how the Republican Party has shifted to appeal to a small but fervent group of voters, experts said.\n\n“The idea that a fully human life with full moral worth begins at conception is not an extreme view in the pro-life movement,” said Ziad Munson, a sociology professor at Lehigh University who has researched the movements on both sides of the abortion debate. “The real issue is the degree of power the movement has over the Republican Party in the political arena, where such viewpoints have – at least until recently – been outside the mainstream.”\n\nAnti-abortion protesters gathered at the Indiana State Capitol this summer. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nAnd in recent years, a particular brand of Republican candidate has become more prominent — one that touts the “Big Lie” that the 2020 election was stolen, doesn’t trust science and consider themselves to be Christian Nationalists, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n“Even a more moderate candidate may feel that they have to toe the line in what the anti-abortion movement is saying, and what (the movement) wants is changing,” said Ziegler, who has studied the anti-abortion movement’s influence on US politics. “So who you are catering to if you’re the Republican Party is changing.”\n\nAs a result, she said, what would have previously been considered a disqualifying stance on abortion for most voters is one of the issues now being used by a growing number of Republican candidates for state and federal office in the hopes of securing their party’s nomination.\n\nDuring the primary season earlier this year, two of the leading Republican candidates for governor of Pennsylvania said in a debate that they support banning abortion under any circumstances, including if the mother’s life is at risk. “I don’t give way to exceptions,” said Doug Mastriano, who will be on the ticket in November to succeed incumbent Democratic governor Tom Wolf, who has vetoed a number of abortion bans passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature.\n\nMen running for a number of statewide offices in Georgia have also vocalized their support of total abortion bans. “There’s no exception in my mind,” former football star Herschel Walker, a Republican who is running for the US Senate, told reporters.\n\nMastriano and Walker have not expressed support for prosecuting women who have abortions. They did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nWhile an overwhelming majority of Americans support legalized abortion when a woman’s life or health is at risk, Ziegler said the disappearing “life of the mother” exception stems from a deep distrust of both women, science and the medical establishment. The new focus on punishing women for undergoing abortions — as seen in several bills recently proposed — is also only likely to intensify, she said. As abortion providers close up shop in states with bans, it is going to become increasingly difficult to charge doctors if women travel to other states for the procedure.\n\n“That’s going to make it more appealing to punish women,” Ziegler said.\n\n‘Abolitionist, not pro-life’\n\nFor pastor Gunter in Lousiana, the “pro-life establishment” is not taking a hard enough stand against abortion.\n\nHe told CNN he doesn’t think someone can be truly “pro-life” while also believing that abortion is acceptable in certain circumstances. He said he will support nothing short of an all-out abortion ban with homicide charges and that unlike some of his peers, he refuses to sacrifice his principles for political reasons.\n\nGunter, who “grew up in church in diapers” and is now in his 30s, said in a recent speech that he once believed that opposing abortion simply meant voting for “pro-life” candidates. But when a seminary professor invited him and other men to spread the gospel outside an abortion clinic in 2008, he said everything changed.\n\nPastor Brian Gunter said he approached Rep. Danny McCormick about the Louisiana bill that included homicide charges for women who receive abortions. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThat day, he said he watched 15 women go inside the clinic and “murder their children.” One of them, Gunter said, couldn’t have been older than 13 and he believed she was being forced to undergo the procedure by her mother.\n\n“She’s a child, and her mother pulled her into that clinic,” said Gunter. “That day changed my life. I went home, and I was newly married… (my wife) was pregnant with our first child. I’d been seeing ultrasound pictures of my son and I thought to myself ‘My God, someone killed a child just like my son, same age as my son, looks like my son. How can they do that?”\n\nAfter that, he says he began confronting women as they entered abortion clinics every week. And in an attempt to create more sweeping change, he decided to get involved politically. He said he approached Rep. McCormick, who did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, earlier this year about the Louisiana bill that ended up making waves across the country. It even sparked outrage from the largest anti-abortion group in the state — one that Gunter said he had worked for but recently parted ways with because he felt it wasn’t doing enough to outlaw abortion.\n\nGunter’s impassioned plea at the committee hearing in May was met with applause, and the vote in favor of moving the bill to the full House ultimately came down to a group of state lawmakers that included a former law enforcement officer, a criminal defense and personal injury attorney and an entrepreneur who makes a living designing “man caves” and selling game room furniture.\n\nAnti-abortion \"abolitionists\" gathered at the Louisiana State Capitol in support of a bill that would charge pregnant people who receive abortions with murder. Chris Graythen/Getty Images/File\n\nLawmakers then gathered on the House floor to debate the bill while dozens of supporters gathered outside the chambers in what resembled a church service, reciting Bible passages and swaying together while singing hymns such as “Amazing Grace.” Jeff Durbin, an Arizona-based pastor and head of a Christian production company Apologia Studios, which has more than 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, emceed and live-streamed the event. Durbin, who once played Michelangelo and Donatello in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise and became fervently religious after overdosing on ecstasy, is now “unapologetically seeking to criminalize and eliminate all forms of abortion without exception.” He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHe and five other men addressed the crowd at the state capitol, citing proverbs and describing women who get abortions as murderers.\n\n“We have… a righteous bill that punishes those who choose to murder their children,” T. Russell Hunter, the founder of anti-abortion group Free the States, yelled into the microphone, saying that any truly “pro-life” law should hold pregnant women accountable for their decisions — not just the medical providers. “Abortionists do not wake up and go out into the culture looking for children to kill; mothers bring their babies to them to be murdered. They are guilty…they have murdered their children under the color of law and the Lord God hates it.”\n\nHunter’s group describes itself as “abolitionist, not pro-life” — echoing Gunter’s argument that many in the movement are compromising on their values. “While many who call themselves pro-life agree with us that abortion is murder,” Free the States writes on its website, “abortion has not been opposed by the pro-life political establishment in a manner consistent with its being murder.” Hunter told CNN this movement is not “about wanting to punish women or something silly like that,” and that anyone involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy should face criminal charges — including fathers.\n\n“Pray for the legislators here,” Durbin, who also runs End Abortion Now, said at the capitol rally.\n\nBut this time, the prayers went unfulfilled.\n\nInside the House chamber, one of seven men to initially vote in favor of the proposed legislation, Rep. Alan Seabaugh, a Republican who describes himself as “pro-life,” apologized for his vote. He said he believed the bill was unconstitutional, “makes criminals out of women.” Other Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates in the state also came out hard against the bill, saying it went too far — including a state representative who said her grandson wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nThe bill never went to a full vote.\n\nIt was the first time such an extreme anti-abortion measure made it out of any state committee, however, and the vocal opposition has not deterred Gunter. He plans to work with McCormick, the Louisiana lawmaker, to introduce a similar bill next year.\n\nMomentum, he told CNN, is only building in the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent decision.\n\nWhat should we investigate next?

Debra Altschiller, D-Stratham, the bill would raise the minimum age of marriage to 18. It passed the Senate unanimously in March and the House 192-174 on Thursday.\n\nIt would be the second time the age of marriage has been raised in the past six years. In 2018, Gov. Chris Sununu signed a bill to raise the minimum age of marriage to 16. For over 100 years before that, the law had allowed 13-year-old girls and 14-year-old boys to get married with parent and court approval.\n\nRep. Cassandra Levesque, D-Barrington, was still a senior at Dover High School and a Girl Scout when she championed the bill in 2018. Now, she is one of the seven co-sponsors of the legislation and spoke in favor of the bill on the House floor.\n\n“For the past ten years, I have researched child marriage,” Levesque said. “Through my research, I’ve learned about the devastating effects of child marriage.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThose effects, she continued, include human trafficking, domestic violence, worse economic health outcomes, and abuse. They also suffer academically: she said that girls who marry before 18 are 50% more likely than their unmarried peers to drop out of high school and four times less likely to graduate from college.\n\nMore:Tennessee bill without age requirement for marriage was amended, didn't pass | Fact check\n\nThe 2018 bill originally intended to set the marriage at 18, but lawmakers compromised for age 16. Since then, Levesque and others have tried and failed to raise the age to 18 in at least four legislative sessions.\n\nDuring the session, two amendments were proposed to allow exceptions for those under 18 to marry if they’ve been legally emancipated.\n\nRep. Margaret Drye, R-Plainfield, said she opposes the bill without exceptions.\n\n“Exceptions can be life-changing in a good way,” said Drye. “I also realize that young people need some support. Sometimes, it’s given by their family. Sometimes, it’s given by marriage. Sometimes, it’s given by both. I think that they need to have those options open when they make a life-changing decision.”\n\nMore:Yes, children are still legally able to get married in the United States\n\nRep. Tony Lekas, R-Hudson, said he married at 16 and did not need any “outside input.”\n\nUltimately, both amendments were defeated, and the legislation was passed without change.\n\n“Child marriage under any circumstance is not in the best interest of the child,” Levesque said. “Just because something has been done for centuries does not mean we are the same society. We grow, we adapt, we change, we evolve as a society, and so do our laws.”\n\nHaving passed the House and Senate, the legislation is en route to Sununu’s desk. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he strongly supported the legislation in 2018.\n\nEditor’s note: State Sen.

Fifty one percent of those surveyed in a USA Today/Suffolk University poll taken April 8 to 13 said it is no longer practical to ban same-sex marriages because so many states have legalized them. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in early March showed 59 percent of respondents favor marriage equality. And that poll showed that support from millennials 18 to 34 was at 74 percent.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling is expected in June.\n\nJan Moore first met Emily Sonnessa in the 1960s. Her former husband worked for the same company as Sonnessa, and the women would see each other at various social functions. Bowling was big then, and the two were pretty competitive, they said.\n\nMoore started having feelings for Sonnessa around 1968, but it was not until she, her husband and their three children moved to Greensboro, N.C., in 1969, that Moore realized she was in love. She legally separated from her husband and moved back to New Jersey with her three children.\n\nShortly after, the women were living together in Rutherford, raising Moore's children together.\n\nBut Moore never told her children — who were 5, 8 and 11 at the time — that Sonnessa was more than just a friend. She was too scared.\n\n\"... In the '70s, it was a whole different world,\" Moore said.\n\nIt was not until the children were in their 20s that they revealed the truth.\n\n\"We lived such a closeted life,\" Moore said. \"We assumed adults knew. We assumed people knew. But it was totally an unsaid thing.\"\n\nWith all the talk of same-sex marriage in New Jersey and throughout the U.S., Moore has been thinking about those early years.\n\n\" ... I had three children. I was in fear of losing my children. And I think with the marriage act, that intimidation is eradicated. And that's the necessity of marriage. It's the quiet shadow we lived in for so long that is now not going to exist anymore.\"\n\nThat's why their marriage — in front of 50 friends during happy hour at the popular Asbury Park restaurant Moonstruck — meant so much more to her than their civil union.\n\n\"Marriage to me meant we are no longer a subculture,\" Moore said. \"Gay people ... by always not wanting to get caught, you went to New York, you went to Provincetown, you went where there were other gay people. And if you associated with gay people, you did it so privately. And in doing so you developed your own subculture. And when you get legally married, you no longer are that.\n\n\"It has nothing to do with religion,\" she continued. \"It has to do with the Constitution of the United States. I would defend every religious right-wing person in the world to have their religion because that's the First Amendment. And my rights are the First Amendment. And I want them equally recognized, and now they are. The subculture is gone, the intimidation, the fear — more than just getting the benefits and the rights, those were the big things.\"\n\nAnd it will make things easier for future generations, Moore said.\n\n\"(Children and teens) may be worried how their parents will react (if they were to come out as gay or lesbian),\" she said. \"I was worried whether my children would love me if they knew I was gay. And it's just as frightening as a child (worried) about being rejected by their parents. Marriage legalizes us. And we become legitimate.\"\n\nJohn Tomicki, president of the New Jersey Coalition to Preserve and Protect Marriage, says \"marriage is a union of two complementary individuals, male and female.\"\n\nThe gay community, he says, wants to redefine marriage \"based on desire.\"\n\n\"The movement for 'marriage equality' (is not) just about same-sex marriage,\" said Tomicki, who has been fighting to preserve traditional marriage since the 1990s. \"It (is) a stategy that would attack the laws of nature and nature's God, redefine America's culture and erase the Judeo-Christian foundation of our nation.\"\n\nThese laws of nature should be reflected in legislative laws, he said, \"and our courts have gone away from that.\"\n\nThe Rev. Bradford Winship of Harbor Bible Fellowship Church in Laurence Harbor agrees.\n\n\"Either the world will listen or the world will not,\" said Winship, who hosts a weekly radio talk show on The Bridge, a Christian radio station based in Old Bridge. \"But we're pretty convinced that in the end, the historical doctrine of Christian faith, the morals held by God's people through the ages, cannot be overthrown.\n\n\"It's not about hate speech,\" he continued. \"That's the game that's played to get the emotional points with the audience. It's just a different understanding of the basis for morality.\"\n\nHayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director for Lambda Legal, a national organization committed to achieving civil rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, was lead counsel in the case that brought same-sex marriage to New Jersey.\n\n\"We have top-flight arguments,\" she said about the cases before the Supreme Court. \"The law is on our side. Thirty-seven states have it and the sky hasn't fallen.\n\n\"But legally,\" she continued, \"the courts are there in this kind of situation to stand up if needed to support (minority) rights regardless of whether they are favored by the majority or not.\"\n\nGorenberg said Lambda Legal litigated the marriage case in New Jersey for more than a decade. Some of the couples in the case, she said, \"had been married in other jurisdictions, but when they came back to New Jersey their marriages were disrespected and disregarded under the law.\n\n\"All the things that come along with marriage, my clients didn't have it,\" she continued. \" ... They had the love and the commitment and the years and everything that they built together. ... they just did not have the ability to convey that in a way that people understood it.\"\n\nSome of these couples had children, she said. And everywhere they went, they had to take documents with them, and copies of the documents, in case something were to happen and they had to prove their relationship, or prove that they were the parent of a child.\n\n\"(They were) consistently disrespected in all walks of life,\" Gorenberg said. \" ... They (were) all carrying around these papers to prove themselves.\"\n\nWhat was happening in New Jersey for years is still happening in other states, Gorenberg said, which makes the Supreme Court decision so critical.\n\n\"Families were denied the option that everybody else has to be married, and to have access to the family structure that they felt suited them and their family,\" she said.\n\nWinship, however, says the marriage-equality argument goes beyond homosexuality.\n\n\"It's a whole new philosophy of gender,\" he said. \"And that's produced by your world view concerning man and God. We as a church say ... there are certain rules.\n\n\"... Let's wait 20 years,\" he continued. \"Let's see what happens ... The church has a responsibility to speak on behalf of God's word. What we're saying is that the social damage to families, to children — we don't believe sin takes place in a vacuum.\"\n\nHe added: \"Societies don't survive well if they don't have traditional families. There is a law of God. There is a law of nature. When you break it, it's like trying to define the laws of gravity. You get hurt in the fall.\"\n\nNicole and Denise DePresca of Freehold, who have been together since 2003, don't believe they are breaking the law of nature. In fact, they say they believe in family values and see themselves as very traditional.\n\n\"We're probably more conservative than most people think,\" Denise said, \"and what I mean by that is our values. We believe in family.\"\n\n\"We believe in monogamy,\" Nicole added.\n\nThe women, both 37 and popular teachers, were married in 2013 and have been together almost 12 years. The two are also musicians and perform around the Shore as Nicole and Denise, playing everything from Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan to Donna Summer and Melissa Etheridge.\n\nThey are raising Adrian, their energetic 4-year-old daughter.\n\n\"I am her parent,\" Denise said. \"Nicole is her parent. We are her parents. … If people want to come in here and … look for the bogeyman, they're not going to find it. There's no bubbling cauldron.\"\n\n\"We're as boring as any other couple,\" Nicole added.\n\n\"We have the same struggles, we have the same issues,\" Denise said. \"We celebrate the same victories together. We pay the same mortgage. It's very much the same. And I think that people who are trying to find a problem with it, they're coming at it from … a religious angle.\n\n\"Our marriage does not add nor detract from anyone else's,\" Denise said.\n\n\"We're not trying to change anybody's faith,\" Nicole added. \"We just want to be recognized by the government.\"\n\nWhile the federal government does recognize their relationship now, it was not always that way.\n\nBefore they were legally married, the couple entered into a domestic partnership in 2004, had their own private ceremony in 2006 and then entered into a civil union in 2007.\n\n\"I had marital fatigue,\" Denise said, joking.\n\n\"It was, for lack of a better word, annoying that it didn't count,\" Nicole said. \"And we had to keep waiting and waiting and hoping and hoping that the laws changed so that we could get to where we should have been when it was right for us, when we had our big wedding (referring to the private ceremony they had in 2005).\"\n\nThe couple also had to carry their civil union, living will, power of attorney and other documents whenever they traveled. Federal law offers far more protections for married partners — some 1,138 rights, benefits and privileges, according to a 2004 tally by the U.S. General Accounting Office.\n\n\"The file folders were so big it was an issue carrying them around in a backpack on trains, trolleys, cabs, planes, etc.,\" Nicole said. \"It also brought a lot of anxiety to us, fearing the thousands of dollars we spent drawing up the documents would be ignored in a state that didn't honor our rights.\"\n\nThe adoption process was also frustrating.\n\n\"We really felt that it was completely unfair,\" Nicole wrote in an email. \"Denise and I were fully committed (in a civil union at the time) and decided to bring Adrian into the world together. We did every step together from deciding what route we wanted to take (adoption vs. pregnancy), to saving up money together, to all doctor's visits, to donor selection, etc. ... To finally get pregnant and then learn that Denise had to adopt her own daughter felt like a slap in the face.\n\n\"When Denise came back from her mandated fingerprints and psych evaluation, she commented that she felt like a criminal ... and how very unnecessary this all was. My heart ached for her. She even had to sign her name under \"father\" under some official forms instead of the forms reading 'Parent 1' and 'Parent 2.' \"\n\nThe DePrescas are now focused on the Supreme Court case and other same-sex couples around the country. They expect the court to grant marriage equality throughout the country.\n\n\"As citizens of this country, we should all have the option,\" Nicole said, \"… to have (our) commitment recognized and have it be called marriage because that's what it is.\"\n\n\"You have to use common language,\" Denise said. \"And that's why I think the word matters so much.\"\n\nIf a couple is married in one state but then they are not married if they move to another state, it creates confusion, they said.\n\n\"It makes people feel like second-class citizens,\" Denise said. \"And I think it fosters bigotry.\n\n\"I never want to change someone's beliefs, their faith,\" Denise continue, \" … because that's what this country is about — freedom of religion and freedom from religion. But what I do want is for them to realize that it's the law. We have the same rights legally.\"\n\n\"When the law is on your side,\" Nicole said, \"it's a very powerful thing.\"\n\nSame-sex marriage began in New Jersey on Oct. 21, 2013, but the fight started more than 10 years before.\n\nIn 2002, Lambda Legal, the LGBT rights group, filed Lewis v. Harris on behalf of seven New Jersey same-sex couples. They claimed that denying them access to marriage violated the liberty and equal protection guarantees of the New Jersey Constitution.\n\nAs the case was making its way through the court system, the Garden State became one of the first in the country to implement domestic partnerships, which granted financial and legal benefits to same-sex couples. The legislation was passed in 2003 and Gov. Jim McGreevey signed it in 2004.\n\nA few months later, Massachusetts would become the first state in the country to grant same-sex marriage.\n\nAlso in 2004, Garden State Equality, New Jersey's advocacy and education organization for the LGBT community, was founded. From the beginning, it was a force, providing leadership and helping to bring the LGBT community together. The group hosted town hall meetings all over the state, often attracting hundreds of people.\n\nThe organization raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and motivated people to get involved, far more than any other gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender organization in the state.\n\nIn October 2006, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in the Harris case that same-sex couples are entitled to all of the benefits of their heterosexual counterparts. But the court left it up to the Legislature to decide what to call these unions.\n\nIn December of that year, New Jersey became the third state to allow same-sex couples to form civil unions. The law went into effect in February 2007. While the state's LGBT activist community believed civil unions were a step in the right direction, they made it clear that they were seeking full marriage equality.\n\nIn January 2010, with same-sex marriage legal in five states and Washington, D.C., the New Jersey Senate voted down a bill to legalize gay marriage. In June 2011, six same-sex couples filed suit, demanding their relationships be called marriage. In February 2012, the Legislature passed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage, but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed it.\n\nIn June 2013, the U.S, Supreme Court struck down the core of the Defense of Marriage Act (which President Clinton signed into law in 1996). The decision granted same-sex married couples the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples. Shortly after, Lambda Legal filed a motion for summary judgment in the New Jersey case.\n\nIn September 2013, citing the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson said same-sex marriage should be legal and ordered the state to begin allowing same-sex weddings on Oct. 21. One month later, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage could begin on that date.\n\nAs same-sex marriages were performed around the state, Gov. Christie's administration dropped the legal challenge.\n\nAbout 250 people attended the April 2014 wedding of Jonathan Petro and Ken Malagiere at Christ Episcopal Church in Toms River. While Bruce Springsteen was not among the guests, his presence was felt.\n\nAt the end of the ceremony, the Garden State Philharmonic played an orchestral rendition of \"Born to Run.\"\n\n\"It's a call to arms,\" said Malagiere of Toms River. \"It's a clear message. It goes around the idea of being free and what it means to be able to be married. We're born free, we are born to run and we're born to actually have this right. And I think it was very important. It wasn't a mistake that we chose that song.\"\n\nPetro, 37, a divorce attorney, and Malagiere, 31, a wedding and event florist, have been together for about six years. They are extremely active in the Toms River community. While being interviewed for this story at a popular restaurant in Toms River, the couple ran into three other parties through their various connections.\n\nWhen they were engaged in April 2013, they were not sure whether marriage would be legal in New Jersey. Either way, they were going to have a church ceremony.\n\nBut calling it a marriage is important, they say.\n\n\"I like having the word,\" Malagiere said. \" ... The universal truth of being married — it's universally understood,\" Malagiere continued. It crosses cultures … It's a statement that is so strong not just to each other but to everyone you come in contact with — your friends, your family. ... And I think that's what's so important about the outward sign of being married. It means so much to those around you as it does to the couple themselves.\"\n\nIt's also very American, Malagiere said.\n\n\"That wasn't a joke that all are created equal,\" he said. \"As a Republican, I almost find it laughable that the far right of our party are some of those that are holding this up the most when it has been our party who has been the champion of equal rights throughout history.\n\n\" … There is nothing more Republican or conservative than saying that we should be able to live our lives separate from the rule of government and what government demands us to be. That's why I believe it is so important, for not only gay rights but just the whole equal rights movement across the board.\"\n\nPetro said this is a \"civil rights issue,\" adding that they expect the court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage.\n\n\"The court has traditionally had to lead in civil rights issues because there are different factions, there are different areas of the United States where there are significantly different opinions on things,\" he said. \"Unfortunately the court has to be the one to lead. The court had to be the one to lead when it came to inter-racial couples marrying (Loving v. Virginia, 1967). It had to happen.\"\n\nBefore Petro and Malagiere became a couple, they knew of each other but were not friends. After a wedding they both attended, Petro sent Malagiere a message on MySpace since he did not have a lot of gay friends. The two hit it off and have been together ever since. They say they hope to raise a family.\n\nWhile they are well liked and respected in their neighborhood and community, Petro and Malagiere had heard that the church had received some letters saying there would be protests at their wedding.\n\nSo precautions were taken. The church required the couple to have a police officer present, although not everyone knew that was the case.\n\n\"We pulled in (to the church) and one of the people in our wedding party who was in the limo said, 'Oh, no protestors,' \" Petro said.\n\n\"And my nephew who is 10 and very precocious said, 'Protesters? What do you mean, \"Protesters?\" '\n\n\"And I said, 'Well, buddy, some people aren't happy that we're getting married.'\n\n\"And (my nephew) said, 'Why would anyone protest a wedding?' It made no sense to him, and he thought we were crazy for even talking about it,\" Petro said. \"… It was pretty cool and it does put things into perspective.\"\n\nProponents of marriage equality may have reason to be optimistic about the outcome of the pending cases before the high court, not the least being the number of court rulings in their favor over the past couple of years.\n\nNotably, in February, the Supreme Court refused to stay a federal judge's order that invalidated Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage. Seven justices agreed, without comment, that the federal district court's decision should prevail, not the state court's ban. Slate said of the court's inaction: \"That is not what a court that planned to rule against marriage equality would do.\"\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas seemed to agree, writing in a dissent joined by Justice Antonin Scalia that the court's \"acquiescence\" to gay marriage in Alabama \"may well be seen as a signal of the Court's intended resolution\" of the same-sex marriage cases.\n\nNonetheless, Hayley Gorenberg, the Lambda Legal attorney, is hesitant to make a prediction on how the Supreme Court will vote.\n\n\"Despite long years of practice, nobody's given me a crystal ball,\" she said.\n\nBut if same-sex marriage proponents prevail, Gorenberg expects some states will be hesitant to implement marriage equality. And others will try to pass laws that would allow people not to serve the LGBT community based on religious reasons.\n\nIn late March, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was roundly criticized by civil rights advocates, who argued the measure gave businesses cover for discriminating against gays and lesbians. Business leaders criticized the bill, and some organizations threatened to postpone upcoming conventions in the state.\n\nPence and others defended the bill as necessary to protect business owners who do not want to be forced to act against their religious beliefs. A few days later, on April 2, Pence and the Legislature amended the law in an effort to alleviate fears that the act would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians.\n\nJohn Tomicki, the president of the New Jersey Coalition to Preserve and Protect Marriage, is worried that people with deep moral convictions will be persecuted if the Supreme Court makes marriage equality the law of the land.\n\nAlready he is seeing \"a constant attack on matters of conscience in our culture and our society.\"\n\n\"We see more attacks on religious freedom, religious liberty and religious truths,\" he said. \"Will clergyman now be chastised?\"\n\nThe Rev. Bradford Winship of Harbor Bible Fellowship Church in Laurence Harbor expects the Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage, \"but do it in such a way that they can have their hands off of it.\n\n\"They are going to require reciprocity between the states,\" he continued. \"Everyone has to accept gay marriage, and we're only following what the states want. More or less saying, 'We're not really legalizing it. We're doing what the states are doing.' \"\n\nBut for him, the battle will continue.\n\n\"What the majority wants has nothing to do with what we still need to teach people,\" Winship said. \"We don't argue based on the majority's right.\"\n\nAbout 27 years ago, Don Tower placed a classified ad in the Asbury Park Press, looking for a man to date.\n\nBefore the Internet, and as an alternative to meeting people in bars, many gay men, lesbians (and plenty of heterosexuals, too) met people through advertising.\n\nHe met Michael Smith — and the two have been together ever since. The Toms River couple had a domestic partnership in 2004, a civil union in 2007 and then, shortly after, a ceremony on a cruise ship. They were legally married in 2013.\n\nLike the other same-sex couples interviewed for this story, the two expect the Supreme Court to rule for marriage equality.\n\n\"I think it's going to be a ruling in our favor,\" Smith said. \"I think with the amount of states that have already passed marriage (equality), the Supreme Court has to do something and they have to make the right decision which would be to put marriage in place for everybody. It's going to happen.\"\n\nThe interview with Smith and Tower happened a few days after the Indiana governor signed revisions to the state's \"religious freedom\" law. But the controversy and the public's reaction says a lot about where this country is on gay rights, Smith said.\n\n\"The more hate that they spew the better it does for marriage,\" he said. \"I think the Indiana thing, as horrible as it was, was probably one of the best things that could have happened. People were dumbfounded that something like that in 2015 could actually get through and signed. In a sense it was actually a good thing.\"\n\nWhile both grew up Catholic, Smith passionately believes that marriage is a legal, not a religious, institution.\n\n\"Usually people have a religious ceremony, but that religious ceremony is not legal,\" he said. \"You have to get a civil license. ... You have to get a license from the government to be married. You don't need to have a religious ceremony.\n\n\" ... Until we were married, legally married, we did four or five tax returns since we've been together,\" Smith continued. \"We had to do individual state returns, then we had to do a joint state return. ... and then we had to do individual federal returns. That was just one thing. When we sold our home, even though the home was in both our names. ... they had to split the money that we got from the sale of the house. They had to split the check in half.\"\n\n\"And they taxed both halves, so we lost money,\" Tower said.\n\nPeople understand the word \"marriage,\" Smith said.\n\n\"I didn't understand civil unions,\" he said. \"If you're going to have a legal document protecting your rights, it has to be called the same thing universally, It has to be called marriage.\"\n\nSmith and Tower live in a retirement community. Tower is retired and Smith works at the Ocean County Library. They are respected and treated well in Toms River as they were in Waretown, where they lived for five years. Their marriage did not change that one bit.\n\nAnd that's true across the country, they say. The world has not ended since same-sex marriage became legal in so many states.\n\n\"In the beginning, they thought it was going to make horrendous changes to what marriage is,\" Tower said.\n\n\"And it hasn't done that at all,\" Smith said.\n\n\"It hasn't changed one person in any way, shape or form,\" Tower continued. \"And I think that's what scared a lot of people. (They thought) the ground was going to open and children were going to be mauled in the streets. And they found that it didn't change a single thing.\"\n\nBill Canacci: 732-643-4218; bcanacci@gannettnj.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/04/13/tennessee-marriage-bill-no-age-limit-not-advance-year-after-backlash-child-bride-concerns/7303147001/", "title": "Tennessee marriage laws: No age limit bill will not advance in 2022", "text": "A Tennessee General Assembly bill to create a legal marriage pathway available only to straight couples will not advance this year following public outcry over the initial version of the legislation.\n\nThe legislation sparked widespread condemnation after early versions failed to include an explicit minimum age requirement, which opponents argued could open minors up to abuse and underage marriages.\n\nMore:Tennessee legislator files amendment to anti-LGBT marriage bill amid age limit backlash\n\nThe bill's sponsors, including Rep.

They will hear 2 1/2 hours of oral arguments in April and issue a ruling before the current term ends in late June.\n\nThe new challenge to states' gay marriage bans is destined to become even more of a landmark than the two cases decided by the court in 2013 — United States v. Windsor, which forced the federal government to recognize gay marriages, and Hollingsworth v. Perry, which made California the 13th state to allow them.\n\nThose rulings, while historic, did not resolve the threshold questions in the debate: whether gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry, or whether states have the right to ban the practice. This spring's case will answer those questions.\n\n\"This is the beginning of the end game on the freedom to marry,\" said James Esseks, who leads the effort for the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe justices' hands were forced by a split among federal appellate courts, created when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld four states' marriage bans in November. While gays and lesbians can marry in 36 states, most recently including Florida, the practice is banned in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, along with 10 other states.\n\nThe court had sidestepped the issue in October, when it let stand appeals court rulings striking down gay marriage bans in Virginia, Indiana, Wisconsin, Oklahoma and Utah. Those rulings and a later appeals court decision affecting Idaho and Nevada drew in neighboring states as well. As a result, more than 70% of Americans live in states where gay marriages are legal, and thousands of couples have tied the knot.\n\nThe high court's long-awaited decision to intervene pleases both sides in the debate. National gay-rights groups have been pressing for a 50-state solution. The National Organization for Marriage and others that oppose gay and lesbian unions also wanted the court to step in.\n\n\"We've reached the moment of truth — the facts are clear, the arguments have been heard by dozens of courts, and now the nine justices of the Supreme Court have an urgent opportunity to guarantee fairness for countless families, once and for all,\" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization.\n\n\"The U.S. Supreme Court now has the opportunity to issue a long-overdue ruling to restore the freedom of the people to uphold marriage in their state laws as the union of a man and a woman,\" said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. \"Lower court judges have robbed millions of people of their voice and vote on society's most fundamental relationship – marriage.\"\n\nThe justices will consider two questions — whether the 14th Amendment to the Constitution requires states to license marriages between same-sex couples, and whether it requires states to recognize such marriages when licensed by other states. The Michigan case involves the first question, the Ohio and Tennessee cases involve the second, and the Kentucky case includes both.\n\n\"I can't wait to walk up those steps and have the Supreme Court understand that we're just like everyone else,\" said James Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the Ohio case. Because of the order in which the court listed the four cases, it appears likely the combined case will be named Obergefell v. Hodges. Richard Hodges directs the Ohio Health Department.\n\nJUSTICES REMAIN DIVIDED\n\nSince the gay marriage movement gained steam in the 1990s from Hawaii to Vermont, 30 states have passed constitutional bans. Eleven states and the District of Columbia legalized same-sex marriage by legislative action or voter initiatives. In 33 more states, judges have made the same call, though some of those decisions were delayed or overruled.\n\nMost of the progress by gay-rights groups has come in the last two years: The number of states where gays and lesbians can marry has nearly doubled since October alone, and tripled since the court's 2013 rulings.\n\nThe justices appear as split today as they were then, when Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the 5-4 decision striking down a key part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia seethed that it would lead to exactly what has happened since — a flurry of court rulings using the high court's equal protection reasoning to strike down state bans.\n\nBut while divided, the justices have made a series of procedural moves that allowed same-sex marriage to proliferate, particularly by refusing to hear five states' appeals in October. They even refused to halt gay and lesbian marriages in Idaho while the state challenges the verdict of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — something they had done last year in Utah and Virginia.\n\nThe swing vote remains Kennedy, who has authored the last three major rulings advancing the cause of gay rights. On one hand, he has defended voter-approved constitutional amendments, most recently in a Michigan case last year that upheld the state's ban against racial preferences in university admissions. But he struck down the federal same-sex marriage ban as an affront to the constitutional rights of gays and lesbians.\n\nSince then, dozens of federal and state court judges have toppled marriage bans for the same reason the Supreme Court ruled against DOMA, mostly citing gay and lesbian couples' right to equal protection or due process under the Constitution. Since September, however, three federal courts have gone the other way -- in Louisiana, Puerto Rico and the four-state 6th Circuit.\n\nCircuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton, once considered a potential Supreme Court nominee for a Republican president, issued that 42-page appellate decision, with fellow GOP nominee Deborah Cook concurring. He said lower court judges' hands are tied by a one-sentence Supreme Court ruling in 1972 that \"upheld the right of the people of a state to define marriage as they see it.\"\n\nIn response, couples in all four states asked the Supreme Court to hear their appeals. State officials in Michigan, Ohio and Kentucky, though victorious, agreed that the justices should weigh in. Gay couples and state officials in Louisiana sought to have their case considered before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rules, but the justices denied that request.\n\nThe Obama administration is certain to enter the case on the side of the gay and lesbian plaintiffs.\n\n\"It is time for our nation to take another critical step forward to ensure the fundamental equality of all Americans — no matter who they are, where they come from, or whom they love,\" Attorney General Eric Holder said.\n\nSTATES MAKE THEIR CASE\n\nThe Michigan case is the simplest of the four that the court considered. April DeBoer, 43, and Jayne Rowse, 50, are nurses and foster parents who have separately adopted four children, including two with special needs. They seek the right to marry and to joint adoptions; currently, each child has only one legal parent.\n\n\"This is a monumental thing,\" Rowse said. \"In my lifetime, I never thought that this would ever happen -- not even in my kids' lifetime.\"\n\nTheir case is unique because it included a two-week trial with \"expert testimony presented in the fields of sociology, psychology, demography, history, and law,\" their brief said. \"Issues relating uniquely to the children were examined thoroughly in the crucible of the trial process.\"\n\nThe state echoed Judge Sutton in its response brief. \"This case comes down to two words: Who decides?\" it said. \"The history of our democracy demonstrates the wisdom of allowing the people to decide important issues at the ballot box, rather than ceding those decisions to unelected judges.\"\n\nThe Ohio case was brought by four same-sex couples with children, one adopted child and two men whose partners died. All were married in other states and are seeking to have the marriages recognized in Ohio through birth and death certificates.\n\nPam Yorksmith, one of the clients, pronounced herself \"over the moon\" with excitement about the Supreme Court's agreement to hear her case.\n\n\"Petitioners have been denied the full dignity and financial and emotional benefits Ohio provides to different-sex spouses, including, most urgently, the recognition of their marriages on critical family identification documents such as birth and death certificates,\" the challengers' brief says.\n\n\"These cases are about love, from birth to death. The relationships at the heart of each case involve the love spouses share, with each other and with the children they jointly raise, and the love that survives the death of a spouse.\"\n\nThe Kentucky case combines two gay couples seeking to marry and four other couples who want their marriages, performed from Connecticut to California, recognized in their home state.\n\nOne couple is raising four children. Another has been together 47 years. A third left the country to marry in Canada a decade ago.\n\nGreg Bourke, the lead plaintiff who has been together with his partner Michael De Leon for more than three decades, said, \"I feel like we've been waiting 32 years to have this day arrive.\"\n\nAfter losing at the district court level, the state's Democratic attorney general, Jack Conway, refused to participate in the appeal. Gov. Steve Beshear, also a Democrat, named outside counsel to handle the case.\n\nThe Tennessee case features three couples married in New York and California. One lesbian partner had a child while the lawsuit was pending. A gay partner was deployed and has returned from Afghanistan. A third couple has two adopted children.\n\n\"We live in fear for ourselves and our little girl because we don't have the same legal protections in Tennessee as other families,\" said Valeria Tanco, the lead plaintiff in the case.\n\n\"The court of appeals' holding not only denies recognition to petitioners' own marriages and families, but also establishes a 'checkerboard' nation in which same-sex couples' marriages are dissolved and re-established as they travel across the country,\" their brief says. \"That is the antithesis of the stability that marriage is supposed to afford.\"\n\nTennessee was the only state that asked the Supreme Court to let the appeals court ruling stand. The state's marriage law is \"a proper exercise of its own sovereign authority within our federal system,\" it said.\n\nThe four states are among 14 where gay marriage remains against the law. The others are Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Texas.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-michigan-abortion-rights-reaction/7722363001/", "title": "Roe v.

However we personally feel about abortion, health — not politics — should drive important medical decisions.\n\n“With today's decision, Michigan's antiquated 1931 law banning abortion without exceptions for rape or incest and criminalizing doctors and nurses who provide reproductive care takes effect.

Millions of Americans are celebrating today’s ruling and a pro-life movement that has worked tirelessly for decades. For a half century unelected judges have dictated America’s abortion laws.

My heart breaks for them and everyone going through these tragic, real-life experiences that happen each and every day.\n\n“Today, the Supreme Court has opened the door wide open for politics to interfere in private health care decisions between women and families and their doctors — and worse yet, may open the door to making abortion outright illegal without exceptions for rape, incest or life of the woman.\"\n\nMore:Michigan GOP lawmakers propose 10-year prison sentence for abortion providers\n\nMore:Rep.

To millions of Michiganders, this isn’t some abstract fight about social issues. These are kitchen table concerns that impact our ability to be economically stable, continue our education, and plan for our future. We all have our own personal beliefs about abortion; the decision of whether to terminate a pregnancy is a deeply personal one that should not be controlled by the state.

Wade, our country draws closer to a society that recognizes the God-given right of life for all persons, at any stage or in any condition.\n\n\"The pro-life movement must redouble its efforts to ensure every woman has the support she needs throughout her pregnancy and beyond, whether she chooses to parent or create an adoption plan. We affirm that the Church must prioritize this work, through our Catholic Charities and parish-based support networks, to meet the physical needs of mothers and children as well as offer the emotional support and love new mothers need. We also implore men to be respectful of women and responsible when they father a child. \"\n\nU.S. Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Flint\n\n“Overturning Roe v.

John Moolenaar, R-Midland\n\n\"I have always believed that future generations will look back on permissive abortion as a moral stain on our country’s history and today’s decision will begin healing the errors of the past.

In my district, many women in the past few months have told me that, while they would never personally have an abortion, they would also never dictate to other women what they must do in their own lives. That sentiment is precisely the standard that Roe has preserved for the last 50 years in our country — the freedom for women to make their own choices, based on their own circumstances. It’s also why Congress must act to codify Roe into law. There is a bill in the U.S. Senate, led by two Republican senators, that does just that, and I will continue pushing Democratic leadership to quickly move it forward.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit\n\n“Today is an extremely dark day for our country. With this corrupt, unjustifiable decision by six unelected, conservative fundamentalist Republican Justices on the United States Supreme Court, the lives of millions of people across the nation who need access to abortion are in danger. The right to abortion care has been recognized for nearly 50 years and today this court is taking away the power to control our own bodies, our lives, and personal medical decisions — and handing it to lawmakers and judges.

The average refund to date is $3,011, compared with $2,878 last year at the same time.\n\nHere's a recap of USA TODAY's live coverage of Tax Day 2024:\n\nTax deadline 2024 countdown\n\nWhen is the deadline if I file an extension?\n\nIf you file an extension (which you'll need to do by April 15), you'll have until Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024 to file taxes.\n\nIn years where Oct. 15 falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the deadline will take place the next business day, the IRS states.\n\nEmily DeLetter\n\nHow should we file in 2025 if we get married this year?\n\nIf you're married, you can choose whether you want to file a joint return or file two individual returns.\n\nFiling a joint tax return means your income and your spouse's income get combined together. The joint income is subject to different tax brackets than single filers.\n\nImportantly, filing jointly means you're both on the hook for the money you and your spouse owe to the IRS prior to your marriage.\n\n\"When you file jointly, that is typically how you get the largest legitimate refund,\" says Scott Curley, co-CEO of FinishLine Tax Solutions, a tax consulting firm based in Houston.\n\nThat's because there are more tax deductions and credits married couples filing jointly are eligible for.\n\nThere are instances where filing separately makes more sense.\n\nThe tax code allows you to deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, meaning if one half of the relationship has experienced significant health issues it may make sense to prepare separate returns.\n\nAnother situation where it may not make sense to file a joint return is if one spouse has a significantly lower income, Speiss says. That's because the lower-income spouse may be eligible for more itemized deductions by filing individually.\n\nElisabeth Buchwald\n\nHow much might I pay in taxes during my life?\n\nThe average American pays $524,625 in taxes in their lifetime, according to personal finance site Self Financial.\n\nNew Jersey residents pay $987,117 in lifetime taxes, the analysis found, the highest tab in the nation. Washington, D.C., comes second, with a lifetime tax burden of $884,820. Connecticut and Massachusetts are third and fourth, at $855,307 and $816,700.\n\nThe lowest-tax state is West Virginia, with a lifetime cost of $358,407.\n\nThe lifetime tax figure, $524,625, works out to about one-third of the average American's lifetime earnings, which add up to roughly $1.5 million.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nUSA TODAY Fact-Check: Three false tax claims to avoid\n\nThe complexity of the filing process and various government financial initiatives has made the topic a popular source of misinformation.\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact-Check Team has debunked an array of such claims, here are three of them.\n\nThe claim: There are no laws requiring American citizens to pay income taxes\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe 16th Amendment gives Congress the power to collect federal income taxes.

For individual tax returns, 93.8% were filed electronically.\n\nOf course, you can always double-check with your local post office to see if by chance they are staying open late. Some post offices may extend their hours.\n\nIf you file by mail, your return must be postmarked by April 15, so get it in before the last collection time.\n\nCeleste E.

Connecticut, New York, New Hampshire and Massachusetts rounded out the top five states with the most expensive median property tax bill. Homeowners in West Virginia paid the smallest amount in property taxes on average, about $694 per year.\n\nA separate analysis from CoreLogic found that the average homeowner in Westchester County, New York paid the most in property taxes last year, with a median value of $15,373.\n\nIn 2023, 13 of the 15 top counties with the most expensive property tax bills were in the greater New York City area, including surrounding cities and suburbs.\n\nSara Chernikoff\n\nHow are lottery winners taxed?\n\nIf you were one of the lucky people to win either a Powerball or Mega Millions prizes in 2023, you are certainly not out of the taxman’s reach.\n\nFederal lottery taxes are determined by the income bracket the winnings fall into.\n\nCurrently the two highest income brackets are taxed at 37% for incomes over $578,125 and 35% for incomes over $231,250.\n\nNew York levies the highest state tax on wins at 10.9%, followed by Maryland (8.9%) and the District of Columbia (8.5%), according to Lottery USA.\n\nThere are ten states and territories that do not tax lottery winners. They are:\n\nCalifornia\n\nDelaware\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nTennessee\n\nTexas\n\nWashington\n\nWyoming\n\nJames Powel\n\nDon't forget state taxes\n\nIf your state has income tax, you may not be done yet. State tax deadlines can vary but most follow federal deadlines, so your state tax return is likely also due April 15.\n\nMake sure to file your federal return first and it is accepted because you’ll likely need income information off that for your state return.\n\nH&R Block resolves issues with electronic filing on tax deadline day\n\nTax software giant H&R Block said earlier issues with its electronic filing on Monday were resolved this afternoon.\n\n\"The issue affecting a small number of our downloadable desktop software users has been resolved,\" it said in a statement to USA Today. \"We have notified our clients via an in-product message and as they reach out to customer service that they can now efile their return.\"\n\nThe statement also noted that most people who file taxes themselves with H&R Block use hrblock.com (its DIY Online edition), and that has been operational all day.\n\nAccording to Downdetector.com, H&R Block's issues began on Sunday evening and spilled over into today.\n\nMedora Lee\n\nHow many people will file for an extension?\n\nThe IRS estimates 19 million taxpayers will file for an automatic extension. The extension gives taxpayers until October 15 to file their taxes.\n\nThe IRS reminds people an extension to file is not an extension to pay. If you think you’ll owe money, then you must submit a payment to ensure you don’t incur an underpayment penalty or late fee.\n\nTaxpayers in Maine and Massachusetts have until April 17 to file and pay taxes due this year. This is because these states observe the Patriots’ Day holiday on April 15 this year, and April 16 is the Emancipation Day holiday in the District of Columbia, the IRS says.\n\nThere are also automatic extensions for some taxpayers impacted by natural disasters.\n\nMedora Lee\n\nIRS tax brackets for 2024\n\nAfter preparing your return for 2023, you may be wondering whether to change your withholding for 2024. One factor to consider is the new tax brackets.\n\nFor the top individual tax bracket, the 2024 income threshold was raised from $578,126 to $609,351. This means that more than $30,000 in individual income will be taxed at 35%, instead of 37%.\n\nHere are the other 2024 tax brackets for individual filers:\n\n35% for incomes over $243,725.\n\n32% for incomes over $191,950.\n\n24% for incomes over $100,525.\n\n22% for incomes over $47,150.\n\n12% for incomes over $11,600.\n\n10% for income below $11,600.\n\nAnd here are the 2024 tax brackets for married couples filing joint returns:\n\n37% for income greater than $731,200.\n\n35% for incomes over $487,450.\n\n32% for incomes over $383,900.\n\n24% for incomes over $201,050.\n\n22% for incomes over $94,300.\n\n12% for incomes over $23,200.\n\n10% for income below $23,200.\n\nElisabeth Buchwald\n\nHow will the Child Tax Credit change in 2024?\n\nA much-heralded bill in Congress aims to boost the child tax credit, delivering more aid to families. Long story short: It may not happen.\n\nThe bipartisan proposal would phase in an increase to the amount of the child tax credit that is refundable, meaning that you can get the money even if you owe no tax.\n\nThe maximum credit is $2,000 per child, and the refundable portion is currently $1,600. The legislation would increase the refundable portion to $1,800 for 2023, $1,900 for 2024 and $2,000 in 2025.But the bill has yet to pass the Senate, if indeed it ever will. “It’s on life support,” Sen. Josh Hawley, the Missouri Republican, told NBC News.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nWhat is the tax underpayment penalty?\n\nThe IRS expects you to pay taxes on your income at regular intervals, either through withholding from your paycheck or estimated payments.\n\nIf you don’t, you may be charged an underpayment penalty.\n\nThe penalty could be triggered if you don’t pay enough tax or don’t pay it on time, either through withholding or estimated tax payments. In other words, don’t wait until December to send in a $10,000 check for estimated taxes.\n\nTo avoid the penalty, try to pay your estimated taxes on time. You may be able to skirt the penalty if you paid at least 90% of the tax you owe for the current year, or 100% of the tax you owed last year, whichever is less, or if you owe less than $1,000.\n\nThe underpayment penalty is calculated based on the underpaid amount, the period in which you underpaid, and interest rates set by the IRS.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nMore than $1 billion in tax refunds remain unclaimed\n\nMore than $1 billion in tax refunds have yet to be claimed, and the clock is ticking.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service recently announced that around 940,000 people still haven’t submitted tax returns for the 2020 tax year, with many awaiting refunds. They have until May 17.\n\n\"There’s money remaining on the table for hundreds of thousands of people who haven’t filed 2020 tax returns,\" IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a release.\n\nThe federal tax collector urges taxpayers to act ahead of the deadline.\n\nAnthony Robledo\n\nWhy is my refund taking so long?\n\nAre you wondering why your refund check hasn’t arrived? Here’s what to do.\n\nFirst, check the calendar. Most refunds are issued within 21 days of being received, the IRS says.\n\nNext, check with the IRS. Its \"Where's my Refund\" tool can help you track your refund.\n\nThe agency is processing returns at a slightly slower pace this year than last: 88.8 million vs. 89.7 million, as of late March.\n\nIf your refund is delayed, the IRS lists several possible reasons:\n\n- It was sent by mail\n\n- It contains errors or is incomplete\n\n- It needs further review\n\n- It is affected by identity theft or fraud\n\n- It was referred to the IRS by the bank due to suspicious activity\n\n- It includes an Injured Spouse Allocation form, which could take up to 14 weeks to process\n\nJames Powel\n\nWhat is a W-4 form?\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service, you should complete a Form W-4 so that your employer can withhold the correct federal income tax from your pay.\n\nAccurately filling out this form can help you avoid a tax payment when you file your return.\n\nThe IRS says you should \"consider completing a new Form W-4 each year and when your personal or financial situation changes.\"\n\nThe IRS' latest version of the W-4 form is available on its website.\n\nGabe Hauari\n\nToday is your last chance to contribute to an IRA for 2023\n\nBelieve it or not, there’s still time – one more day, to be precise – to contribute to your Individual Retirement Account and take the tax break for 2023.\n\nYou can contribute to an IRA up to April 15 and have the money count toward your 2023 savings. The contribution limit for 2023 is $6,500 if you’re under 50, $7,500 if you’re older.\n\n\"There is a 15-month window to make IRA contributions for any given year,\" said Mary Ryan, a certified financial planner at Vanguard.\n\nIf you haven’t maxed out your contributions, you have until the end of the day.\n\nYou'll get an answer faster if you call the IRS\n\nThe IRS answered 1 million additional calls, up roughly 17% from 2023, through April 6. And in what could be a surprising development to many, the IRS has reduced wait times on its phone lines to 3 minutes, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury's release Monday. Just two years ago, taxpayers were stuck waiting on hold an average of 28 minutes, according to Treasury.\n\nPhone service improved as call volume rose roughly 13%. What's helped pare the wait time? The IRS has a call back option now that's available to 97% of eligible taxpayers at the start of the call, according to Treasury, if the expected wait time is longer than 15 minutes.\n\nThe IRS phone number is 800-829-1040.\n\nSusan Tompor\n\nWhat is net pay? How is it different from gross pay?\n\nHere's what you should know about net pay: what it is, how to calculate it, and the difference between gross pay vs. net pay.\n\nIn simple terms, gross pay is an employee's total earned wages before payroll deductions. Net pay is the money you take home from your paycheck after the deductions. The deductions include taxes and benefits.\n\nFor example, if someone gets paid $1,200 per week but $160 is taken away in deductions, the person's net pay will be $1,040 per week.\n\nOlivia Munson\n\nAre IRS tax refunds bigger or smaller in 2024?\n\nAs of April 5, the average refund this year totals $3,011. That's up 4.6% compared to the same time last year, when refunds averaged $2,878, the IRS reports.\n\nA few more statistics of note:\n\nThe average amount refunded by direct deposit is $3,088 through April 5, compared to $2,942 last year, a 4.9% increase.\n\nThe total number of returns received by IRS so far is 101.8 million, up from 101.3 million at this time in 2023.\n\nThe IRS has processed 100.1 million returns as of April 5, compared to 100.4 million at this time last year.\n\nVisits to the IRS website are up a whopping 18.2%, from about 421 million last year to 497 million this year. The agency has been working to improve customer service.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nWhat triggers an IRS audit?\n\nWhen you're audited, it means your return was singled out for closer inspection. This happens because your tax filing was among those that showed the \"highest potential noncompliance,\" the IRS says. The agency uses data-driven algorithms, third-party information, whistleblowers and information on the forms you submit to determine if income, expenses and credits are reported accurately.\n\nWhat triggers an audit? Mismatches. Make sure you enter your information from official tax forms correctly, so the numbers are consistent, said Erin Collins, National Taxpayer Advocate at the Taxpayer Advocate Service division of the IRS. The agency also looks for outliers, like a filer who writes off travel costs way above what the typical taxpayer would deduct.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid an audit is to be \"accurate, honest, and modest,\" said Eric Scaringe, principal at certified public accounting firm UHY.\n\nMedora Lee\n\nFiling an extension on Tax Day? You may need form 4868\n\nTax filers who aren't prepared to submit their returns on Tax Day can use IRS Free File to request an extension electronically. But if you prefer to mail a paper version of the extension, you'll need form 4868.\n\nIf you send the form by mail, make sure it's postmarked no later than April 15: today is the deadline for filing an extension. If you get an extension, you'll have until Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024, to file your return.\n\nWhere to send the form depends on where you live. Here is a list of addresses.\n\nGabe Hauari\n\nWhat is net pay?How it works, how to calculate it and its difference from gross pay\n\nMore:You may need Form 4868 to file a tax extension. Here's what to know as deadline looms.\n\nWhat other tax deadlines fall on April 15?\n\nTax Day is not just the deadline to file your federal taxes for the prior year.\n\nIf you earn income that isn't subject to withholding taxes, you're typically required to make estimated tax payments to the IRS. The agency divides the year into four quarterly payment periods, and the first quarterly payment for 2024 is due today.\n\nMost state taxes are also due on April 15. Residents of Massachusetts and Maine have until April 17 to file federal taxes because of state holidays. There are other exceptions.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nWhere’s my refund?\n\nYou've already filed your tax return for 2023. You have a refund coming. You want to know where it is.\n\nThere are multiple ways to receive a tax refund, but the fastest by far is electronically, the IRS says. If you filed electronically and chose to receive your refund by direct deposit, your refund will probably be issued within 21 days. If you mailed a paper return and expect a refund, it could take four weeks or more to process your return.\n\nThrough the IRS \"Where's My Refund\" tool, you can track when the IRS received your tax return, when it approved a refund, and when it issued the refund. If you chose direct deposit, the money should land in your account within five days from the date the IRS approves your refund. You can also call 800-829-1954.\n\nMedora Lee\n\nShould I file my taxes online or at the post office?\n\nYou’ve waited till the last day to file your 2023 tax return. The minutes are ticking by. Now, you face a choice: Should you file online, and try your luck with an overtaxed IRS website? Or should you print it out and head to the post office, risking long lines?\n\nNeither choice is entirely safe. The IRS website famously crashed on Tax Day in 2018, prompting the agency to give frustrated taxpayers a rare one-day extension.\n\nLong lines used to be the norm at post offices on tax day. You may still face a wait if you mail your form today. The Postal Service says some locations will offer extended hours, and suggests you call your local post office to check.\n\nThe IRS recommends electronic filing. Many tax experts agree.\n\n“Filing tax returns electronically is typically the preferred option,” said Eric Bronnenkant, director of tax at Betterment, a financial advisory company. “Even at the last minute, it is likely better than using mail.”\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nCan I file my taxes for free on Tax Day?\n\nYes! More people are filing their taxes using Free File this year, the IRS says.\n\nFree File allows any taxpayer with an adjusted gross income of $79,000 or less in 2023 to file taxes for free through one of eight IRS partners. To access the service, go online at IRS Free File and use the guided software.\n\nIf you're eligible, a free filing can save you a pretty penny. An individual taxpayer is estimated to spend 13 hours and $240 in out-of-pocket costs to prepare and file an annual tax return, according to the Taxpayer Advocate.\n\nMedora Lee\n\nWhy is April 15 Tax Day?\n\nApril 15 might seem an arbitrary date for the entire nation to file taxes. Here's some background:\n\nHistorical sources tell us President Lincoln first levied internal taxes in 1862, during the Civil War. The federal government adopted the modern income tax system in 1913, with the 16th Amendment. The original Tax Day fell on March 1. Congress moved the date to March 15 a few years later. In the 1950s, Tax Day was moved to April 15. The date shifts gave Americans more time to prepare their returns.\n\nSome years, Tax Day falls later than April 15, typically because the date falls on a weekend.\n\nDaniel de Visé\n\nTax Day freebies and food deals\n\nTax Day has its perks. Fast food and sit-down restaurants across the U.S. are offering customers freebies and discounts to celebrate the occasion.\n\nWhether you've already filed your taxes and are waiting on your tax refund, or you need to file a tax extension, you can take a break and seek out free or discounted treats. A few examples:\n\nKrispy Kreme customers can purchase an Original Glazed or assorted dozen in shop and receive a second Original Glazed dozen for the price of sales tax in their state.\n\nGrubHub is offering a $15 discount on delivery orders worth $25 or more.\n\nPotbelly shops nationwide are offering customers a free Original sandwich with the purchase of any Original or Big sized sandwich.\n\nGabe Hauari\n\nWhat happens if you don't file your taxes on time?\n\nNot filing a tax return can trigger two potential penalties: one for failure to file, the other for failure to pay. Together, they can max out at 50% of the tax you owe.\n\nFailure to file: If you miss the April 15 deadline, the standard penalty is 5% of any tax due for every month your return is late, up to 25% of the unpaid balance.\n\nFailure to pay: If you file a return by the deadline but fail to pay taxes you owe, or if you get an extension and leave a balance unpaid, you typically face a much smaller monthly penalty of 0.5% of any unpaid amount, up to 25% of the unpaid tax.\n\nJames Powel and Emily DeLetter\n\nHow do I file an extension with the IRS?\n\nSometimes, you just need more time.\n\nIf you can’t make the April 15 deadline, experts say, the next best thing is to seek an extension. If approved, it provides filers a six-month grace period to file, though it does not provide an extension to pay.\n\nThe deadline for filing an extension is today, April 15. If you get one, you'll have until Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2024 to file your return.\n\nTax Day deals 2024:Score discounts, freebies at Krispy Kreme, Hooters, Potbelly, more\n\nYou can request a free extension through the IRS. You'll need basic information, like your name, address, Social Security number, and estimated tax liability. Be prepared to make a payment, if you owe anything and have the funds.\n\nTax filers can use IRS Free File to request an extension electronically. If you prefer to mail a paper version of the extension, called form 4868, make sure it's postmarked no later than April 15.\n\nJames Powel and Emily DeLetter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}]}

Smugglers are ...", "text": "Havana, Cuba CNN —\n\nAs Cuba confronts the worst shortages of food and medicine in decades and runaway inflation, a new exodus of the island’s citizens is underway.\n\nIn March, more than 32,000 Cubans arrived at the US-Mexico border, almost twice the number from the previous month, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nDesperate to leave Cuba, Claudia, her husband and their young son managed to obtain visas to Mexico in Havana – the first step in a journey that placed them in the hands of criminal smuggling networks that are known to charge migrants thousands of dollars for safe passage to the US border.\n\nClaudia, who requested her real name not be used in this story for her safety, said she decided to leave Cuba after the July 2021 widespread protests over power outages, food shortages and a lack of civil liberties, boiled over.\n\nThe Cuban government said the protests were orchestrated by Washington to topple the communist government. Prosecutors have charged over 700 people with sedition and civil disobedience in the largest mass trials since the beginning of the Cuban revolution.\n\n“I was done after July 11,” Claudia told CNN. “I am leaving for my son, for his future. I spent all day waiting in lines so he can have yogurt. I work at a [government] hospital for $50 a month. I basically work for free.”\n\nCubans that have just crossed the US-Mexico border huddle near a fire in Yuma, Arizona in February. Katie McTiernan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nAfter pretending to be tourists for two days in Cancún, Mexico, Claudia and her family were told by the Mexican smugglers they contacted to fly from Mexico City to Mexicali, a city of more than one million inhabitants right on the US border.\n\nClaudia said the small plane to Mexicali was full of fellow Cubans. She said the smugglers had warned her that Mexican police would stop them as they arrived at the Mexicali airport and to place $100 in each of their passports.\n\nClaudia said Mexican police detained all of the Cubans from their flight and from another flight – from Guadalajara, that was carrying mostly Cuban passengers – that arrived at the same time.\n\nThe Cubans from the two flights were taken to a nearby police station and the officers kept their passports, she said. There, she said, the police let her and her family, along with the other Cubans who had placed a $100 bribe in their passports go free. The others remained detained, she said.\n\nPolice in Mexicali did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Migrants regularly complain that police in Mexico solicit bribes and rob them.\n\nAfter leaving police custody, Claudia said that the smuggler they had been in contact with picked them up in a car and drove them to an unfinished house in the Mexican desert.\n\nThere, she said a handful of armed smugglers told more than 30 migrants to wait in two stiflingly hot rooms until they could attempt the border crossing. One room was full of people from different countries, she said.\n\n“There were Colombians, Bangladeshis, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Haitians. It felt like the whole world was in there,” she said. The other room, Claudia said, was packed with Cubans.\n\nCubans collect donated food at a supermarket in Havana in August 2021. Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty images\n\nA mass exodus\n\nCubans have mass emigrated in waves throughout the years.\n\nIn 1994, some 35,000 Cubans made the dangerous journey to the US on makeshift rafts. And in 1980, during the “Mariel Boatlift,” an estimated 125,000 Cubans fled to the US on a flotilla of boats.\n\nHowever, this current exodus is on track to be even larger. According to US Customs and Border Protection data, nearly 80,000 Cubans reached the US border from Mexico from October through March.\n\nThe rise in migration comes as the Cuban government has begun to ease Covid-19 related travel restrictions.\n\nFor much of the pandemic, the government kept the island on a tight lockdown. People wanting to travel often waited months to get a spot on one of the handful of weekly flights out.\n\nA power outage in Havana. Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nAs Cuba relaxed the restrictions in November, the Cuban government’s ally Nicaragua lifted their visa requirements for Cubans – sparking a surge of people who tried to travel to the Central American nation as a way to eventually reach the US.\n\nSuddenly Cubans began posting online ads selling their homes with “everything inside” to pay for the expensive airfare. Others joked about “going to visit the volcanos” in Nicaragua, a tongue-in-cheek way of saying they were emigrating to the US.\n\nMany Cubans flew through Panama to reach Nicaragua – and in March, when the Panamanian government said it would require Cubans traveling via the country to obtain a transit visa, a large crowd of desperate Cubans mobbed Panama’s embassy in Havana.\n\nCubans protest outside the Panama Embassy in Havana as the country tightens visa requirements in March. Amanda Perobelli/Reuters\n\nIncreasing shortages on basic goods are what’s driving many people to leave the island, English teacher Kailen Rodríguez told CNN in April as she waited outside Panama’s embassy for a visa.\n\n“We don’t have the possibility to buy many things here.

But until now, it hasn’t been clear precisely how litigious he is and what that might portend for a Trump presidency.\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY analysis of legal filings across the United States finds that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and his businesses have been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in federal and state courts during the past three decades. They range from skirmishes with casino patrons to million-dollar real estate suits to personal defamation lawsuits.\n\nThe sheer volume of lawsuits is unprecedented for a presidential nominee. No candidate of a major party has had anything approaching the number of Trump’s courtroom entanglements.\n\nJust since he announced his candidacy a year ago, at least 70 new cases have been filed, about evenly divided between lawsuits filed by him and his companies and those filed against them. And the records review found at least 50 civil lawsuits remain open even as he moves toward claiming the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in seven weeks. On Tuesday, court documents were released in one of the most dramatic current cases, filed in California by former students accusing Trump University of fraudulent and misleading behavior.\n\nThe legal actions provide clues to the leadership style the billionaire businessman would bring to bear as commander in chief. He sometimes responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force. He doesn’t hesitate to deploy his wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources, such as homeowners. He sometimes refuses to pay real estate brokers, lawyers and other vendors.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAs he campaigns, Trump often touts his skills as a negotiator. The analysis shows that lawsuits are one of his primary negotiating tools. He turns to litigation to distance himself from failing projects that relied on the Trump brand to secure investments. As USA TODAY previously reported, he also uses the legal system to haggle over his property tax bills. His companies have been involved in more than 100 tax disputes, and the New York State Department of Finance has obtained liens on Trump properties for unpaid tax bills at least three dozen times.\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes, tied to Trump and his companies\n\nAnd despite his boasts on the campaign trail that he “never” settles lawsuits, for fear of encouraging more, he and his businesses have settled with plaintiffs in at least 100 cases reviewed by USA TODAY. Most involve people who say they were physically injured at Trump properties, with settlements that range as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAlan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said in an interview that the number and tenor of the court cases is the “cost of doing business” and on par with other companies of a similar size. \"I think we have far less litigation of companies of our size,\" he said.\n\nHowever, even by those measures, the number of cases in which Trump is involved is extraordinary. For comparison, USA TODAY analyzed the legal involvement for five top real-estate business executives: Edward DeBartolo, shopping-center developer and former San Francisco 49ers owner; Donald Bren, Irvine Company chairman and owner; Stephen Ross, Time Warner Center developer; Sam Zell, Chicago real-estate magnate; and Larry Silverstein, a New York developer famous for his involvement in the World Trade Center properties.\n\nTo maintain an apples-to-apples comparison, only actions that used the developers' names were included. The analysis found Trump has been involved in more legal skirmishes than all five of the others — combined.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis included an examination of legal actions for and against Trump and the more than 500 businesses he lists on the personal financial disclosure he filed with the Federal Election Commission. USA TODAY also reviewed five depositions in which Trump sat for 22 hours of sworn testimony. This report is based on those legal filings as well as interviews with dozens of his legal adversaries.\n\nA handful of the ongoing cases involve local or state government entities, with the possibility of personal legal disputes between the president of the United States and other branches of government if Trump is elected. For instance, the Trump team has filed a lawsuit seeking a state ethics investigation of the New York attorney general. The suit was filed in response to an ongoing fraud investigation into Trump University by the attorney general, an elected state official.\n\nTrump, New York attorney general spar again over Trump U.\n\nAnd at a campaign rally in San Diego last Friday, Trump railed against a federal judge overseeing an ongoing lawsuit against Trump University. Trump said Judge Gonzalo Curiel \"happens to be, we believe Mexican,\" and called him a \"hater of Donald Trump\" who \"railroaded\" him. Born in Indiana, Curiel was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama. The judge on Tuesday unsealed hundreds of pages of documents in the case.\n\nThe trial is set for November — just after Election Day.\n\nTrump’s history of legal actions provides clues about his style as a leader and manager. While he is quick to take credit for anything associated with his name, he is just as quick to distance himself from failures and to place responsibility on others. In one lawsuit — filed against him by condo owners who wanted their money back for a Fort Lauderdale condo that was never built — he testified in a sworn deposition: “Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers.”\n\nAt times, he and his companies refuse to pay even relatively small bills. An engineering firm and a law firm are among several who filed suits against Trump companies saying they weren't paid for their work. In a 2011 deposition tied to a dispute over his deal with Van Heusen menswear, he said he abruptly decided not to sign a check to a firm that helped broker the deal, after 11 consecutive quarterly payments, because \"I don't feel that these people did very much, if anything, with respect to this deal.”\n\nThe number of lawsuits raises questions about potential conflicts and complications if Trump does win the White House. Dozens of cases remain unresolved, about half in which he is the plaintiff. It raises the possibility of individuals being sued by the president of the United States, or suing him, in non-governmental disputes.\n\nUnder the law, Trump wouldn’t get special advantages as the plaintiff — or protections as a defendant. Under long-standing conflict-of-interest rules, as a plaintiff he couldn’t improperly benefit from governmental knowledge. He also wouldn’t get immunity from civil litigation that stemmed from events prior to taking office.\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK gathered Trump court files\n\nTogether, the lawsuits help address this question: How would Trump’s record in business translate into leading the most powerful government on the globe — a task that involves managing a $4 trillion annual budget, overseeing 1.8 million civilian federal employees and commanding the most powerful armed forces in the world?\n\nWhile leaders who had business careers sometimes have been elected to the White House — oilmen George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, for instance, and mining engineer Herbert Hoover — the jobs have some fundamental differences, political scientists and presidential historians say. A president can't rule by fiat, as some CEOs do. And getting things done in government often involves building coalitions among legislators and foreign leaders who have their own priorities and agendas.\n\n“He’s operating as his own boss and a CEO-on-steroids mentality, where you snap a finger and things get done,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who has written biographies of Franklin Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt and edited Ronald Reagan’s diaries. “But a lot of good governance is on learning how to build proper coalitions and how to have patience with the glacial pace of government, and you’re forced to abide by laws at all times. \"\n\nBrinkley sees \"a lot of warning signs about having someone of Trump’s temperament and professional disposition being the commander-in-chief.”\n\nTo be sure, likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has had her own legal challenges, including an ongoing FBI investigation and civil lawsuits into her exclusive use of an email server while secretary of State. When husband Bill Clinton was president, she was involved in investigations by special counsels looking into the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas and other controversies. None resulted in legal charges against her.\n\nDuring her time as first lady, U.S. senator from New York and secretary of State, Clinton has been named in more than 900 lawsuits, mostly as a defendant, a review of state and federal court records finds. More than a third of the lawsuits were filed by federal prisoners, political activists or other citizens seeking redress from the government by suing a list of high-ranking officials.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis identified at least 3,500 legal actions involving Trump. Reporters reviewed thousands of pages of records collected electronically and in person from courts in 33 states over three months, read more than 20 hours of depositions and interviewed dozens of litigants.\n\nAmong those cases with a clear resolution, Trump's side was the apparent victor in 451 and the loser in 38. In about 500 cases, judges dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Trump. In hundreds more, cases ended with the available public record unclear about the resolution.\n\nClose to half the court cases — about 1,600 — involved lawsuits against gamblers who had credit at Trump-connected casinos and failed to pay their debts. About 100 additional disputes centered on other issues at the casinos. Trump and his enterprises have been named in almost 700 personal-injury claims and about 165 court disputes with government agencies.\n\nDozens dealt with the bankruptcy proceedings of Trump's companies, and dozens more involved plaintiffs' lawsuits against Trump businesses that judges terminated because the Trump companies targeted had gone bankrupt.\n\nThey include Trump's ongoing suit against the town of Palm Beach over airplane noise near his Mar-a-Lago Club and an earlier lawsuit against the town over an 80-foot flag pole. Trump's team argued in court that a smaller flag would understate his patriotism, but he eventually settled with town officials, agreeing among other concessions to lower the pole by 10 feet.\n\nThere also are disputes with local governments from New York to Florida to Nevada over the size of his property-tax bills.\n\nThe terms of most of the 100 settlements that Trump and his businesses reached with plaintiffs have not been disclosed. In about 60 additional cases, those sued by the Trump side have settled with him.\n\nA few have become fodder on the campaign trail, including two breach-of-contract lawsuits he filed against restaurateurs in connection with Trump's development of the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The businesses said they backed out of deals with Trump because of his derogatory comments about Mexicans. Both lawsuits are pending.\n\nThe luxury Trump hotel will have a prime view of the Inaugural Parade next January.\n\nReview of thousands of legal actions show that Trump is fiercely protective of his brand, quick to distance himself from deals that struggle, willing to deploy outsized resources against adversaries and sometimes prone to micro-management, even in disputes that involve relatively small amounts of money. Those approaches, however appropriate in a business setting, may not translate to a political one, especially at the level of the White House.\n\nAmong the details:\n\n• Trump distances himself from deals that sour.\n\nWhen projects struggle, Trump doesn’t hesitate to cut ties, even those that relied on his name to secure investments. That was the case in condo projects that were never completed in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Panama and Baja, Mexico.\n\nCondo buyers who sued to get their deposits back often said they believed Trump was a full partner in the buildings. Trump was shielded by disclaimers in sales agreements explaining his branding-only role, though plaintiffs and their lawyers argued in court that fine print didn’t sync with marketing materials that made it appear these were Trump properties.\n\nIn depositions and court filings in the condo cases and similar branding deals, Trump's team appears to try to have it both ways in depicting his involvement. On one hand, Trump contends deep influence over even the smallest details to ensure Trump-branded products and developments are up to his standard, and he places high importance on the influence of his marketing muscle in such deals — usually as the lead name, face and voice behind a project.\n\nOn the other hand, his team argues in court that he's not liable for the deals that fail because he's simply lent his name.\n\nTrump himself walked lawyers through the difference between a brander and a developer in a 2013 deposition in one of the Fort Lauderdale condo cases.\n\n“Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers,” Trump said, arguing he’s not accountable when a project he lends just his name to goes under. “We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer.”\n\nIn lawsuits over his Trump University, he testified that he had never met instructors who were described in the university’s promotional materials as being “handpicked” by him. “It depends on the definition of what that means, handpicked,” Trump said during an exchange with a lawyer in a sworn deposition last December.\n\nWhen attorneys representing plaintiffs pointed out some instructors had criminal pasts and had been accused of berating seniors who signed up for the program, Trump replied: “In every business, people slip through the cracks.”\n\nFlorida attorney Sherri Simpson, who defends homeowners in foreclosure actions, said she signed up for Trump University classes because she hoped to capitalize on low prices during the housing downturn. She wanted to turn to a trusted real-estate name to learn how.\n\n“I’m aggravated that I lost all that money,” she said in an interview. “He promised to hire the best, to handpick the instructors, make sure everyone affiliated with the program was the best. But he didn’t do that.”\n\n• Trump is willing to spend large sums on small claims.\n\nNo detail is too small for a Trump suit, and he often brings to bear overwhelming legal resources that enable him to outlast his adversaries.\n\nIn February, he filed five lawsuits against eight neighbors of his Doral golf club in Miami for $15,000 in damages to reimburse him for \"vandalizing\" or \"destroying\" expensive areca palms and other plants his groundskeepers installed between their homes and the course. Trump's staff says the foliage was planted to block golfers' views of the houses; the homeowners say the trees blocked their views of the course. All five cases are pending.\n\n“No other developer put so many resources in trying to fight claims brought by the plaintiffs,” said Jared Beck, a Miami attorney who has represented dozens of clients in lawsuits against developers in South Florida. He said none has fought with the tenacity of Trump, citing a “mismatch of resources” that often works in Trump’s favor.\n\nBeck is now appealing to the Florida Supreme Court a case that dates to 2008 in which he represented a group of people who invested in condos in a failed development in Fort Lauderdale to which Trump licensed his name. “He is willing to go to the mat and has practically unlimited resources.”\n\n• Trump fiercely protects the monetary value of “Trump” as a brand name.\n\nTrump publicly has placed the value of his licensed real estate and other branding deals at $3.3 billion, though Forbes and other analysts question whether the figure is inflated. His moniker drives the value of his licensing deals, which now make up an important arm of his business model.\n\nIn one case, a South Florida developer hired experts who testified that having Trump's name attached to their proposed condominium development boosted the condos' value by at least $200 per square foot. The swanky seaside complex was only partially built, prompting some condo buyers to file a lawsuit against Trump and the developers seeking to recover their deposits. The developers had paid to license Trump’s brand, allowing them to use Trump’s name, his image and his reputation to help them sell units.\n\nTrump has attempted to pull out or distance himself from similar licensing deals, real estate and otherwise, if he feels the situation is hurting his brand. He also goes to court to collect royalties and other fees he says he's owed on those same kinds of deals.\n\n“Anything I put my name to is very important,” Trump said in a 2010 deposition tied to a failed real-estate development in Tampa licensed to carry Trump’s “mark,\" as he calls it. \"If I allow my name to be used, whether it’s a partnership or whether it is a licensing deal, they are all very important to me.”\n\nTrump sued for $4.5 million over unpaid royalties after a company that had been paying him to call its liquor Trump Vodka fell on hard times during the economic downturn, hurting sales of pricier spirits. The company stopped making its licensing payments, and Trump terminated the deal and sued to recoup what he was owed. He won a judgment for the amount, though it's unclear whether he ever collected from the troubled company.\n\nAnd he has been aggressive in suing unrelated companies that were using his name without permission. He won rulings over attempts to market Trump’s Best Coffee, a series of websites with names like trumpabudhabi.com and trumpbeijing.com, and a marketing agency calling itself Trump Your Competition.\n\nTrump’s general counsel, Garten, defended the number of lawsuits. “Our philosophy is that we are a company of principle,” he said. “When we believe we are in the right, we are going to pursue the matter to the end. If that requires that we go to trial and present evidence to a jury, we are prepared to do so. We are not going to cave to pressure.”\n\nBut experts in the presidency and business say Trump’s record, including in courtroom disputes, raise questions about whether he has exhibited the leadership qualities that have distinguished the nation’s most successful presidents.\n\n“Somebody like Lyndon Johnson was a guy who woke up in the morning studying the decisions and the hopes and the strengths and the weaknesses of all the people he had to influence,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and author of Leadership BS: Fixing Workplaces and Careers One Truth at a Time. “For that, you need two traits I think Trump lacks: Number one, an attention to detail, and number two, you have to subordinate your own ego. I’ve seen nothing from Trump that suggests he has that capacity, and government is the art of compromise.”\n\nTrump’s lack of government experience was a political advantage during the GOP primaries, reinforcing his status as an outsider vowing to shake up a dysfunctional Washington. But it threatens to be a liability in the general election. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, six in 10 voters said they had reservations about or were uncomfortable with Trump’s lack of experience in government or the military.\n\nEven so, some of those who have sued Trump, been sued by him or otherwise been caught up in his legal wake, say they still may vote for him in November.\n\nPhilip Monnin represented his daughter, Miss Pennsylvania contestant Sheena Monnin, in a defamation suit Trump filed after she posted on Facebook that she thought the 2012 Miss USA Pageant was “rigged.” An arbitration ruling upheld by a federal judge ordered her to pay $5 million in damages, although she and Trump eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed lesser amount. Monnin, who lives in Michigan, said the suit demonstrated Trump’s bullying tactics and attempts to intimidate legal opponents.\n\nBut he doesn’t rule out voting for Trump for president. “Both sides have failed to bring satisfactory candidates,” he said in an interview. “I don’t think any of us in the family has decided what to do, and we have a lot of time to consider how to cast our votes.”\n\nContributing: David McKay Wilson, Karen Yi, John Kelly and Kevin McCoy\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nTrump and the Law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/10/12/trump-election-decide-whether-we-remain-free-country/91932234/", "title": "Trump 'running for president, not choir boy'", "text": "Jeff Burlew\n\nTallahassee (Fla.)

Trump apologized for the comments but has dismissed them as “locker room talk” and a campaign “distraction.”\n\n“He’s just a man,” she said. “He said things that men say. He professes to be a Christian. He’s probably a fairly new Christian. He makes mistakes. He admitted it.

He said President Obama deserves to be behind bars, too.\n\n“I think they ought to occupy adjacent cells,” he said. “They’re ruining America.

He’s planning to visit the Sunshine State three times over the next couple of days, holding rallies in Ocala, Lakeland and West Palm Beach.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/politics/ron-desantis-pushes-election-police-force/index.html", "title": "DeSantis' proposed election police force alarms voting rights ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFlorida could become the first state in the country with a dedicated police force to investigate election fraud under a proposal that has become a top priority of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nThe proposal has concerned voting rights advocates, local election officials and Democrats, who fear the scope of this police force’s new mandate could lead to voter intimidation. If approved, the new office would have a 52-member team, including 20 sworn police officers, to “investigate, detect, apprehend, and arrest anyone for an alleged violation” of election laws.\n\n“They don’t have a lot of safeguards to keep this from being politicized and weaponized,” said Brad Ashwell, the Florida state director of the voting rights group All Voting is Local.\n\nDeSantis is asking lawmakers to set aside $5.7 million to create the Office of Election Crimes and Security and give the executive branch unique and unprecedented power to look into voting irregularities, despite little evidence of widespread voter fraud in his state.\n\nThe Repubican said last week that the new office would “ensure that elections are conducted in accordance with the rule of law” and “provide Floridians with the confidence that their vote will matter.”\n\nEstablishing an office that ultimately answers to the governor with powers to investigate election crimes is unprecedented at the state level, voting rights experts say.\n\nDeSantis’ proposal represents “an escalation in the broader attempt to sow doubt in the integrity of our elections,” said Wendy Weiser, vice president of democracy at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school. It’s unusual, she added, because “in the American system, we separate law enforcement functions from political functions.”\n\nThe governor first announced the proposal in November as supporters of Donald Trump pushed for Republicans to investigate the former President’s unfounded falsehoods about election fraud. Even in Florida, where Trump won by a historically wide margin, conservatives spent the fall knocking on doors in communities all over the state, hoping to find evidence of fraud that could convince leaders to conduct a review of the 2020 vote totals.\n\nTrump ally Roger Stone, a Florida resident, threatened in October to run against DeSantis in 2022 if the governor didn’t support an audit of the state’s election.\n\nDeSantis, widely considered a future GOP contender for president, has dismissed those demands as unnecessary in Florida, which he has said is a voting model for the country. Nevertheless, he has pushed for new voting measures that he said will prevent election fraud.\n\nFlorida law enforcement agencies, local election officials and state prosecutors already have the power to enforce election laws in Florida. The unit DeSantis has proposed would report to the Department of State, an agency overseen by the governor and administered by Secretary of State Laurel Lee, a DeSantis appointee.\n\nDeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw said the new office would like to hire people “who have experience and familiarity with election law,” such as former employees of the Department of Homeland Security, the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Department of Justice.\n\nIn December, Lee addressed a gathering of Florida election supervisors and offered more details about how the office would work, said Joe Scott, the elections supervisor in Broward County. He said he grew alarmed after listening to Lee.\n\n“It sounds like they are going to focus on grassroots organizations – the type of organizations that go out and do voter registration drives,” he said. And he worries that the potential for criminal prosecution will “intimidate people into not bothering” with electoral work.\n\nThe League of Women Voters of Florida typically registers thousands of voters each year in the state, said Cecile Scoon, a Panama City civil rights lawyer who serves as its president. If DeSantis succeeds in establishing a new elections security office, “it’s going to chill the behavior” of third-party groups such as hers “because we don’t want to be accused” unfairly of illegal activity, she said.\n\n“We’ve had almost zero fraud, almost zero problems, so you are asking yourself: ‘What are they going to be looking for?’ ” Scoon said. “When you create an office to stamp out something, they are going to look for it – even if there is nothing there.”\n\nScott, a Democrat, said he’s skeptical of an elections police force that’s controlled by a DeSantis appointee.\n\n“This is Gov. DeSantis’ political police squad. That’s what this is,” he said. “You shouldn’t have partisan election officials directing an agency like this.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers have reacted cautiously to the governor’s proposal. The top Republicans on the House and Senate election committees did not respond to phone calls from CNN. Speaker of the House Chris Sprowls previously said he would evaluate the idea but was uncommitted.\n\nState Rep. Evan Jenne, the House minority leader, called DeSantis’ idea: “A solution looking for a problem.”\n\n“If this had come on the heels of a massive scandal, I wouldn’t be so against the idea,” Jenne said.\n\nThe unit would have latitude to probe allegations of voter fraud in the state as well as take over other law enforcement agencies’ investigations, according to the proposed legislation. DeSantis would also embolden this new force to watch over election officers and “conduct proactive information gathering and investigations to identify and prevent potential election law violations or election irregularities.”\n\nWesley Wilcox, a Republican who runs elections in Marion County, Florida, said he was taken aback by what he called the “tough” wording.\n\n“It kind of makes supervisors, in my mind, almost look like bad guys in this process,” he said.\n\nThe Florida Supervisors of Elections, the group that represents all 67 county election officials in the state, is waiting to evaluate a concrete legislative proposal before taking a formal position, said Wilcox, the organization’s president.\n\nIn the past, top Republicans have turned to state law enforcement to investigate their vague allegations of election irregularities.\n\nWith his race headed for a recount in 2018, then-Gov. Rick Scott accused “unethical liberals” of trying to steal a US Senate seat from him and he requested that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement conduct a criminal probe into a South Florida elections office. The investigation was ultimately dropped.\n\nJust before the 2020 election, DeSantis questioned the legality of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s offer to raise funds to pay the court debts of felons so they could vote. Calls for an investigation ultimately landed in the lap of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which again found no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nPushaw seemed to confirm that the later episode could have fallen under the jurisdiction of DeSantis’ new elections force, had it existed.\n\n“The proposed Office of Election Crimes and Security is intended to investigate possible violations of election law and deter potential violations,” she said, adding: “Florida law explicitly prohibits ‘vote-buying’ and ‘vote-selling,’ ” which is what Republicans accused Bloomberg of violating.", "authors": ["Steve Contorno Fredreka Schouten", "Steve Contorno", "Fredreka Schouten"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/03/24/ukraine-russia-panama-dewayne-wickham-putin-obama-column/6793805/", "title": "Wickham: U.S., like Russia, exercises hegemony", "text": "DeWayne Wickham\n\nUSATODAY\n\nHere's a story that should sound familiar to you.\n\nA small, militarily weak country is racked by internal dissent after its government rejects a treaty with a foreign power. Secretly encouraged by a nearby superpower, a rebellious faction in this troubled country seizes a chunk of land and declares its independence. The superpower quickly dispatches a military force to the breakaway territory to ensure the success of this secession.\n\nIf you think I'm talking about the events that are playing out in Ukraine, the Eastern European country that's nestled against the southwestern edge of Russia, you're wrong.\n\nSure, Russian President Vladimir Putin dispatched thousands of troopsinto the Crimea region of Ukraine as it declared its independence and asked to be annexed into Russia. That action followed bloody street demonstrations that forced Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine's democratically elected president, to flee the country after he rejected a trade pactwith the European Union. Yanukovych, whose opulent lifestyle and roguish rule stained his presidency, favored closer economic ties with Russia. Not surprisingly, the unelected government that replaced Yanukovych signed the agreement with the European Union on Friday.\n\nBut I'm talking about the series of events that brought about the creation of Panama in 1903. Back then, Panama was a province of the nation of Colombia. When the Colombian government rejected a treaty that would have allowed the United States to build a canal across its territory to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, a plot was hatched to make Panama an independent nation.\n\nThe United States, then an emerging superpower, sent warships into the region to stop Colombia from reinforcing its beleaguered troops in its Panama province. The new nation responded by quickly giving America the treaty it sought. While the U.S. didn't annex Panama, it did exercise virtual sovereignty over it for 97 years.\n\nPanama is in the geopolitical backyard of the USA. It's inside America's sphere of influence, just as Crimea is inside Russia's. I don't say this to justify the imperialistic behavior of either superpower, but rather to suggest that it's nothing new. Nor should it be unexpected.\n\nOver the past century, every time one superpower acted badly in its sphere of influence, the other bashed its conduct. When Russia created the Soviet Union through the military conquest and political subjugation of Eastern Europe, the U.S. and its allies bemoaned its totalitarianism.\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. has stretched its sphere of influence – getting involved in the affairs of nations in the American hemisphere from Mexico to Argentina. Sometimes, U.S. presidents used military force, and other times they employed covert actions to exercise control over the affairs of countries in its backyard.\n\nIn agreeing to annex Crimea, Putin said he acted to keep NATO, the military wing of the European Union, out of Russia's backyard. \"We are against having (NATO) ... behaving as the master of the house outside our fence, next to our home or on our historical territory,\" he said.\n\nIn 1912, President William Howard Taft made a similar claim of U.S. dominance in America's backyard. \"The day is not far distant when the Stars and Stripes at three equidistant points will mark our territory: one at the North Pole, another at the Panama Canal and the third at the South Pole. The whole hemisphere will be ours in fact as, by virtue of our superiority of race, it already is ours morally,\" he said.\n\nIn truth, there is little to suggest that the U.S. today is any more willing to give up its claim to hegemony over its backyard than Russia is now exercising over its neighborhood.\n\nAnd as long as this is so, neither country can take the moral high ground on this issue.\n\nDeWayne Wickham, dean of Morgan State University's School of Global Journalism and Communication, writes on Tuesdays for USA TODAY.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including ourBoard of Contributors.

They were offered for about three decades before the 2021 municipal elections, when they were turned down by residents.\n\nOfficials have said they think the 2021 referendum was not approved because it got tied up with other ballot items and confused local voters.\n\nThe release says the same property tax exemptions are offered in unincorporated Bay County and Lynn Haven. It also says these breaks play a crucial role in helping the EDA attract international and domestic industries to the area, creating new jobs with competitive wages and helping the area rely less on tourism.\n\nIf the referendum is approved, tax breaks would be given only to select businesses that apply and qualify for them. Public hearings and additional ordinances also would be necessary before the breaks were granted.\n\nAlong with its public support, CPAR plans to launch a $25,000 campaign to encourage Panama City voters to approve the referendum. Voters will receive text messages, digital ads and mail supporting the exemptions leading up to the elections.\n\n\"We are excited to partner with the Bay County Chamber of Commerce and Bay EDA to support this program, which will bring new business opportunities and high-paying jobs to our community,\" Jennifer Ledesma, CPAR president, said in the release. \"This program is a valuable tool in the toolbox of our EDA as they work to drive businesses from around the globe to our area.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/08/23/republican-voting-laws-states-face-lawsuits-ahead-2022-elections/8111176002/", "title": "Republican voting laws in states face lawsuits ahead of 2022 elections", "text": "18 states adopted 30 laws since Jan. 1 making it harder to vote, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nAn assembly of people across the U.S. are challenging the laws.\n\nAdvocates argue the laws make it harder to vote, especially for people of color.\n\nAbsentee voting increased dramatically during the pandemic and the early voting tended to favor Democrats.\n\nWASHINGTON – In Panama City, Florida, the League of Women Voters set up a face-painting table for children during community gatherings at the library.

It has long had the potential to establish a breakout frontrunner.\n\nMost Republican presidential hopefuls have been eyeing Super Tuesday states ahead of the primary season. For instance, former President Donald Trump made a stop to Alabama in August to speak at a Republican dinner, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis addressed over 1,500 GOP voters in Tennessee in July.\n\nCandidates who dominate Super Tuesday don't always win the general election, however.\n\nFormer Republican Kansas Sen. Bob Dole won primaries in seven states on Super Tuesday in 1996, and Democratic Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry saw major victories in 2004. They both went on to lose the general election.\n\nContributing: Anna Kaufman, Jeanine Santucci, Jim Sergent and Karl Gelles.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/29"}]}

I went to Paradise Valley Christian School in kindergarten and first grade. Mrs. Dalton was my first-grade teacher and that's when I started becoming a conscious adult. (laughs). So yeah, I have a lot of memories there. I remember it always being so extremely hot. But I also lived in Lake Havasu, actually. So I've lived in a couple places in Arizona.

Produced by Justin Meldal-Johnsen and Paramore’s own Taylor York, the album also marks the return of original Paramore member Zac Farro. Billboard declared the song “Hard Times” to be “an addictive, Talking Heads-inspired jam that sounds like it could follow ‘Ain’t It Fun’ as a Hot 100 smash,” while Rolling Stone praising “Told You So” as “polyrhythmic funk-pop.” And Variety raved about the album: “Paramore has never sounded — or looked — more defiantly joyous... ‘After Laughter’ sounds like it’s about when life kicks you in the gonads. Instead of crying about it, hopefully Paramore will come back fighting and chop life’s head clean off.”\n\n9/24 Fleet Foxes\n\nFleet Foxes are bringing Beach House to Comerica Theatre on Sept. 24.\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, May 12, at livenation.com and ticketmaster.com.\n\nThe tour is in support of their forthcoming followup to 2011’s “Helplessness Blues,” a rustic gem whose more inspired moments felt like Brian Wilson writing harmonies for Crosby, Stills & Nash.\n\nThe much-anticipated “Crack-Up” hits the streets on June 16.\n\nThe lead single, a majestic chamber-folk suite called \"Third of May / Ōdaigahara,\" made our playlist of best March singles. In an interview with Pitchfork, Robin Pecknold talked about the inspiration for the single – his relatoinship with Skyler Skjelset, the childhood friend with whom he formed Fleet Foxes in 2006. The date in the title refers to May 3, 2011, the release date of “Helplessness Blues,” their previous effort, after which they embarked on a lengthy hiatus. It’s also Skjelset’s birthday. “It addresses our distance in the years after touring that album, the feeling of having an unresolved, unrequited relationship that is lingering psychologically,\" Pecknold said. \"Even if some time apart was necessary and progressive for both of us as individuals, I missed our connection, especially the one we had when we were teenagers, and the lyrics for the song grew out of that feeling.”\n\n9/26: Imagine Dragons\n\nImagine Dragons are launching their tour in support of “Evolve” at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sept. 26 with special guests Grouplove and K.Flay.\n\n“Evolve” is set to be released June 23.

TIME called “Believer” “another showstopper of an anthem,” while Entertainment Weekly noted its “thudding tribal drums, a massive shout along chorus, and a wicked bassline that’s the sonic equivalent of a slug to the gut.”\n\nVerified pre-sale goes from 10 a.m. Monday, May 15 to 10 p.m. Thursday, May 18.

To charge by phone, call 480-847-4681. All tickets are subject to facility and ticketing surcharges. All ages welcome.\n\nNow celebrating more than 50 years of touring, Rush's impact on the American music scene has been profound. He helped shape the folk revival in the '60s and the renaissance of the '80s and '90s, his music having left its stamp on generations of artists. Rush’s early recordings introduced the world to the work of Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne and James Taylor, and in more recent years his Club 47 concerts have brought artists such as Nanci Griffith and Shawn Colvin to wider audiences when they were just beginning to build their own reputations.\n\nRush began his musical career in the early '60s playing the Boston-area clubs while a Harvard student. The Club 47 was the flagship of the coffee house fleet, and he was soon holding down a weekly spot there, learning from the legendary artists who came to play, honing his skills and growing into his talent. He had released two albums by the time he graduated. Rush displayed then, as he does today, an uncanny knack for finding wonderful songs, and writing his own - many of which have become classics re-interpreted by new generations. Signed by Elektra in 1965, Rush made three albums for them, culminating in “The Circle Game,” which, according to Rolling Stone, ushered in the singer-songwriter era.\n\nPepsi Amphitheater season\n\nLooking to beat the Phoenix heat while taking in an outdoor concert?

And that means more seats have been added for the show.\n\nThe additional tickets go on sale at 11 a.m. Monday, May 8 at the Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., in Phoenix, or online at celebritytheatre.com. To charge by phone, call 602-267-1600 ext. 1. All tickets are subject to facility and ticketing surcharges. All ages welcome.\n\nWilson launched the “Pet Sounds” tour last year to honor the 50th anniversary of the Beach Boys’ finest hour with two fellow Beach Boys – Al Jardine and Blondie Chaplin – joining in the celebration (although Matthew Jardine, Al’s son, would go on to be the MVP with those amazing high notes when the tour played Phoenix last year).\n\nReleased on May 16, 1966, “Pet Sounds” is among the most acclaimed recordings in the history of rock and roll, with NME, Uncut and Mojo all declaring it the greatest album of all time. And with good reason.\n\nWilson started working on the \"Pet Sounds\" sessions while the other Beach Boys were off touring on the hits. Inspired by the Beatles’ “Rubber Soul,” he set out to create a masterpiece that marked a huge departure from the classic Beach Boys sound, although he’d hinted at the new direction in the more ambitious moments of “Today.”\n\n“It’s really been a trip to sit here and think about releasing Pet Sounds 50 years ago,” Wilson says. “I love performing this album with my band and look forward to playing it for fans all across the world.”\n\nIn addition to a full performance of the classic album, Wilson will be treating fans to highlights of his 54-year career with the Beach Boys as well as solo cuts.\n\nIn my review of last year’s show, I wrote:\n\nIt’s a magical — at times transcendent — night, an opportunity to witness Wilson reconnect as best he can with “Pet Sounds” in a 50th anniversary celebration of an undisputed masterpiece whose legacy hasn’t endured so much as blossomed with each passing year.\n\nIt’s a beautiful album whose bittersweet charms are heightened, in a way — made more cathartic and more poignant — by those obvious reminders that the man who poured his heart and soul into the making of that masterpiece has never been the same. Could never be the same. Will never be the same.\n\nAnd here he was revisiting “You Still Believe in Me,” “I’m Waiting For the Day,” “God Only Knows,” “I Know There’s an Answer,” “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times,” the heartache, the longing, the vulnerability he brought to those recordings duly underscored by the realities of Wilson’s life.\n\nThis was especially true of his vocal on “Caroline, No,” the album’s final song, on which a girlfriend’s haircut is the catalyst for a heartbreaking ballad about wishing he could go back to the way things used to be.\n\nHe’s assembled a stellar assortment of backing musicians for the tour, including fellow Beach Boy Al Jardine, who actually appears on “Pet Sounds,” and another former Beach Boy, Blondie Chaplin, who joined in the ‘70s.\n\nThere were 10 or 11 musicians on stage, including several multi-instrumentalists, allowing him to capture every richly textured nuance of the album — French horn, xylophone, saxophone, bass harmonica, electrotheremin, several keyboards, flute and a wide assortment of percussion instruments.\n\nThat also meant a wealth of vocalists on hand to reconstruct those awe-inspiring harmonies, with Matt Jardine emerging as the evening's MVP on that front, nailing every key falsetto part.\n\n7/19: Chris Isaak\n\nChris Isaak returns to the Celebrity Theatre on Wednesday, July 19th, for an 8 p.m. show.\n\nTickets ($60 and $90) go on sale at 10 a.m. this Friday, May 5 at the Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., Phoenix, celebritytheatre.com and 602-267-1600 ext. 1.\n\nThe star has worn his share of hats since \"Wicked Game\" turned up in David Lynch's \"Wild at Heart.” He’s been a talk-show host, a sitcom star, a SWAT commander in \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" No. 68 on of VH1's list of sexiest artists and a singer whose music continues to embody the qualities that made his early records so evocative.\n\n\"First Comes the Night,\" his latest effort, finds Isaak channeling the sound and spirit of the Sun recording artists he saluted on \"Beyond the Sun,\" especially Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, while sounding more timeless than retro.\n\n“My last release was ‘Beyond The Sun’ — my tribute to Sun Records with a lot of covers,” Isaak says. “So this time around I had a lot of new material that I was thrilled to record.”\n\nThis is the first time album Isaak has written and recorded so much in Nashville, a change in location he explored partly upon the suggestion of his friend Stevie Nicks. For all the firsts, there’s a strong through-line that continues from Isaak’s earlier triumphs like “Silvertone” (1985) and “Heart Shaped World” (1989).\n\n“I guess you can make a drink with many ingredients, but if one is very strong, that’s what you taste,” says Isaak with a laugh. “For better or worse, I have a tendency to dominate because I have a big voice and some twisted ideas.”\n\nAs for the show, expect the usual mixture of pathos and humor from Isaak and his band.\n\nDoors open at 6 p.m All tickets are subject to a surcharge.\n\n10/31: Halsey\n\nSpend Halloween with Halsey when the singer brings her U.S. tour to Talking Stick Resort Arena on Oct. 31 with PartyNextDoor and Charli XCX.\n\nThe eight-week tour is in support of Halsey’s second album, “hopeless fountain kingdom,” out June 2.\n\nPre-sales run May 8 through May 11 at hfktour.com, with general on-sale scheduled for May 12.

As the press release says, “OML isn’t bigger, louder, or more avant-garde, it’s more human.”\n\nThe set list will combine their biggest hits and songs from the new album.\n\n“Our fans know how much love we put into our live show,” says guitarist Brad Delson. “They know how much we enjoy the connection when we play a fan favorite on stage.

And although he hasn't had much luck crossing over to the pop charts since that debut single, Hamilton's still making good on the artistic promise of those early records on his latest album, last year’s “What I’m Feelin’.”\n\nOther song of note include “Can’t Let Go,” which topped the Adult R&B charts, and “You Got the Love I Need,” a collaboration with Al Green for which he won a Grammy.\n\n10/14: Harry Styles\n\nHarry Styles of One Direction is playing Comerica Theatre on Oct. 14.\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, May 5 at ticketmaster.com and the Comerica box office.

I didn't look like anyone there or feel like anyone – I felt like an outsider in my own town. It wasn't until I discovered punk rock and that community that I realized I did fit in somewhere in this world – with the other people who didn't fit in. It’s hard to rationalize rage – it’s hard to quantify anxiety ... this song does neither, it embraces the wave.\"\n\nThe album is their follow-up album to “American Beauty/American Psycho,” a platinum effort that debuted at No. 1 on Billboard in early 2015.\n\n7/12: Kendrick Lamar\n\nKendrick Lamar is launching The DAMN.

Thank you for understanding.\"\n\nAll tickets will be honored on the new date.\n\n10/5 Flaming Lips and Mac DeMarco\n\nThe Flaming Lips and Mac DeMarco are playing Comerica Theatre on Thursday, Oct. 5.\n\nThe Lips last played the Valley last October at the Arizona State Fair, a magical night to which I responded in my review (which you can read in its entirety just by clicking these words):\n\n“It takes a certain breed of entertainer to lead the members of an audience on an emotional journey from the smile-inducing spectacle of ‘Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Pt. 1,’ with Wayne Coyne surrounded by giant inflatables, including Santa Claus, to the existential majesty of ‘Do You Realize??,’ which brought me to tears.\n\nAnd I’m pretty sure the Flaming Lips would be the only actual entertainers in that certain breed.\n\nCoyne is such a bizarre, enigmatic performer, giving into the silliest aspects of the task at hand, with his bag of confetti, his smoke gun and his crazy jacket with strands of multi-colored lights hanging like extra-long fringe, while gleefully spreading his message of peace and love and making the most of the moment you’re in because ‘you realize that everyone you know someday will die.’”\n\nTickets are on sale at ticketmaster.com, the Comerica Theatre box office and 800-745-3000.\n\nThe Canadian singer-songwriter most likely to perform nude (with apologies to Gordon Lightfoot), DeMarco is touring an album titled “This Old Dog,” his much-anticipated followup to “Another One.”\n\nDeMarco is known for two things – songs that reach inside your soul and force you to reflect on what you’ve done and how you plan to make it right, and being a total goof onstage. A bit Paul Westerberg in that respect. And as Smokey Robinson, who may not have been writing specifically about DeMarco, could tell you, “There’s some sad things known to man / But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown.”\n\nI caught his set last Friday at Coachella, writing:\n\n“He mocked his placement on the bill. ... He brought out former bassist Pierce McGarry for an extended bit in which the bassist kept insisting he was actually Orlando Bloom. … He joked about King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, whose set had preceded his own on that stage. And he joked with a fan in the audience about his hat. ... As for the music, it was often as sublime as his behavior was ridiculous, from 'Salad Days' through 'On the Level.' \"\n\n9/10: Florida Georgia Line with Nelly\n\nFlorida Georgia Line will bring Nelly and Chris Lane to Ak-Chin Pavilion on Sunday, Sept. 10.\n\nGet tickets at at ticketmaster.com.\n\nThe country duo and Nelly are touring together, of course, because of their collaboration on the remix of “Cruise,” a bro-country landmark that five years later, remains the biggest-release digital release the country genre has ever produced.\n\nFour subsequent Florida Georgia Line followed “Cruise” to No. 1 on Billboard’s country charts while going multi-platinum -- \"Stay,\" the Luke Bryan-assisted \"This is How We Roll,\" \"Dirt\" and \"H.O.L.Y.\" (from their latest album, \"Dig Your Roots\").\n\n7/25: Buckingham McVie\n\nLindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac: The Rumours Years are headed to Phoenix in support of their first album as a duo, playing Comerica Theatre on Tuesday, July 25, with the Wallflowers.\n\nThe 10-song album is due to hit the streets June 9, preceded by a single, “In My World,” available now.\n\nThe collaboration began three years ago, when McVie rejoined Fleetwood Mac for their “On With The Show” tour. The duo went in to record new material prior to rehearsals for the tour and their natural creative chemistry was reignited. According to Buckingham, “We were exploring a creative process, and the identity of the project took on a life organically. The body of work felt like it was meant to be a duet album. We acknowledged that to each other on many occasions, and said to ourselves, ‘What took us so long?!!’”\n\nMcVie says, “We’ve always written well together,Lindsey and I, and this has just spiraled into something really amazing that we’ve done between us.”\n\nSessions for the album took place at The Village Studios in Los Angeles, where Fleetwood Mac recorded several of their classic albums, including “Tusk.” Buckingham and McVie were joined in the studio by fellow bandmates Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, who supplied much of the dynamic rhythmic engine.\n\nTickets are on sale at livenation.com.\n\n10/3: The Shins with Spoon\n\nThe Shins and Spoon will be playing four concerts together this year. And one of those concerts is happening right in Phoenix (your reporter is resisting the urge to end that sentence with several exclamation marks).\n\nThe tour hits Comerica Theatre on Tuesday, Oct. 3, in support of two of this year’s most acclaimed releases, the Shins’ “Heartworms” and Spoon’s “Hot Thoughts.” Tickets are $39.50-$50 and available through ticketfly.com.\n\nThe Shins recently headlined the opening night of McDowell Mountain Music Festival, where the songs from that new album, of which there were many, more than held their own against such classics as “Caring is Creepy” and “New Slang.” You can see how that set went, complete with pictures, here.\n\nIn an interview quoted on Pitchfork, James Mercer, the last remaining member of the “Oh, Inverted World” lineup, said the new music is closer to the way they sounded on their first three albums by design.\n\n“I’m really excited about this record,” he said. “I think we’ve got something that Shins fans will really love, and I think there’s some other things on there that are different enough. I made a concerted effort on certain songs to fit the palette, to use the palette that I’ve used historically for the band.”\n\nSpoon’s fourth album in a row to crack the Top 10, “Hot Thoughts,” was released to just the sort of hyperventilating praise you can expect from critics when a new Spoon album hits the streets. And with good reason. They’ve already given us a number of the century’s best rock releases. And this new one more than lives up to the promise of that legacy. I now defer you to the wisdom of the Consequence of Sound reviewed who suggest that Britt Daniel’s “big statement is his Body of Work, of which every fine part adds up to a greater sum. Here comes another one.”\n\n8/25: Yestival\n\nFresh from taking their long-denied place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the members of Yes will be bringing a festival called Yestival to the Celebrity Theatre, with Todd Rundgren and Carl Palmer’s ELP Legacy on Friday, Aug. 25.\n\nTickets ($49.50, $89.50 and $125) are available at Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., Phoenix, www.celebritytheatre.com or 602-267-1600 ext. 1.\n\nYes will play a set of greatest hits from every album up to 1980’s “Drama,” showcasing the storied career of one of the world’s most influential, ground-breaking, and respected progressive rock bands.\n\nThat era produced such Yes staples as “Roundabout,” “I’ve Seen All Good People,” “Yours is No Disgrace,” “Long Distance Runaround,” “Heart of the Sunrise” and “Close to the Edge.”\n\n“We are looking forward to presenting songs from each of the first nine studio albums, including some surprises,” says guitarist Steve Howe.\n\nFor the purpose of this tour, Yes will feature Howe, Alan White (drums), Geoff Downes (keyboard), Jon Davison (vocals) and Billy Sherwood (the late Chris Squire’s chosen successor on bass).\n\n10/4: Father John Misty\n\nFather John Misty is playing the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix on Wednesday, Oct. 4, in support of “Pure Comedy.\"\n\nTickets are on sale at phoenix.ticketforce.com.\n\nThe singer’s darkly comic narratives, often done in character, have marked Misty as his generation’s Randy Newman – not that I see Pixar work in Misty’s future. “Pure Comedy” is guaranteed to figure prominently on the shortlist of the year’s most celebrated albums, a third straight triumph for the singer-songwriter. Mojo said this album lifts him “to another level altogether,” while the Skinny raved: “He embraces the role, plays up to it, uses it to bend and manipulate the parameters of modern rock music and has managed to create something bitingly acerbic and cynical, yet achingly sincere. Again.”\n\nHe topped our playlist of best February singles with a track from “Pure Comedy” called “Ballad of the Dying Man,” on which he turns his darkly comic eye for detail on a self-important know-it-all who wonders on his deathbed if he’s “successfully beaten back the rising tide of idiots, dilettantes and fools on his watch.”\n\nWeyes Blood opens.\n\n10/8: Scorpions\n\nThe Scorpions Crazy World Tour is bringing Megadeth to Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday, Oct. 8.\n\nTickets are $40-$125 at www.dannyzeliskopresents.com.\n\nWhy Crazy World? If you have to ask:\n\n\"When our album 'Crazy World' was released back in '91, right at the end of the Cold War,” Klaus Meine says, “we toured around a world that was pretty crazy back then, but there was so much hope in the air for a more peaceful future. Now, 26 years later, things are getting more crazy every other day. After all these years, Crazy World is still a good motto for our upcoming world tour. We are very much looking forward to seeing all of you out there.\n\nFounded in Hannover, West Germany, in 1965, Scorpions released their debut album, “Lonesome Crow,” released in 1972. They rose to arena status with seminal releases “Lovedrive,” “Virgin Killer” and “Animal Magnetism.” In 1982, they topped the U.S. rock charts with \"No One Like You,\" a soaring power ballad they soon followed with their first Top 40 single, \"Rock You Like a Hurricane.\" Their biggest U.S. hit came later with another ballad, \"Wind of Change.\" They finished 46th on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, and \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" was No. 18 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs.\n\nThe set will offer a mix of fan favorites and highlights of their 19th studio release, “Return To Forever,” released in 2015 as part of their 50th anniversary festivities.\n\n5/2: New Found Glory\n\nPop-punk veterans New Found Glory are bringing their 20th Anniversary Tour to the Nile Theater in Mesa on May 2. They've been called \"the greatest pop-punk band in history\" by Bad Religion's own Brett Gurewitz, who scooped them up for Epitaph after they walked out on Geffen. Their first album for the label, \"Not without a Fight,\" debuted at no. 12 with Alternative Press declaring it \"a reminder of why we fell in love with NFG in the first place.\" After two albums on Epitaph, they switched to Hopeless for 2014's \"Resurrection,\" which Kerrang! declared \"a powerhouse of a record, the brave onward steps of New Found Glory proving that hope — like pop-punk — is not dead.\"\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 2.

Genasis and Kap G. In a break with arena tradition, Brown takes the stage at the start of the show and brings his guests out as the party goes, which means you’d do well not to show up late hoping to blow off the opening acts. The R&B star topped the Hot 100 in 2005 with \"Run It!,\" his first single, which went on to be his first of several multi-platinum hit, from the chart-topping \"Kiss Kiss\" to “With You,” \"No Air,\" \"Forever,\" \"Deuces, “Look at Me Now” and “Loyal.”\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Monday, May 15.

The Chicago Bulls star captivated the nation from his college days at North Carolina and used his professional career to break through barriers of what a basketball player could be. Jordan became a global icon in his 15-year NBA career and continues to be an international sensation.\n\nThis was all before the dawn of social media.\n\nToday’s basketball stars, including Kevin Durant, Candace Parker, Damian Lillard, Breanna Stewart and the NBA’s new scoring king, LeBron James, have built fanbases through excellence on and off the court. The importance of a personal brand continues to increase. But Jordan literally created his own brand.\n\nAs the six-time NBA champion celebrates his 60th birthday on Friday, here are 60 facts about his basketball career, pop culture influence and life beyond the hardwood:\n\nMichael Jordan's early days\n\n1. Michael Jordan was born on Feb. 17, 1963 to James and Deloris Jordan. The couple was living in Brooklyn, New York, at the time, but moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, a few years after he was born. Jordan has two older brothers, an older sister and a younger sister.\n\n2. Michael Jordan was motivated as a child by his brother, Larry, who also played basketball. They both wore No. 45 jerseys, but when they played on the same team, the younger brother had to pick a new number. So he cut 45 in half and rounded up to No. 23. He carried it through college, the NBA and into icon status.\n\n3. The only time Michael Jordan wore 45 after committing to 23 was after the return from his first retirement in March of 1995. He finished out the regular season and the first round of the playoffs in the new number before struggling in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals and deciding he had better luck in No. 23.\n\n4. Michael Jordan was very close with his father, James. In “The Last Dance,” he revealed that he was suspended three times during his ninth grade year and his father put him back on track.\n\n“My father pulled me aside that summer,” he shared, “and he said, ‘Look, you don’t look like you’re headed in the right direction. If you want to go about doing all this mischievous stuff, you can forget sports.’ That’s all I needed to hear. It was like from that point on, it was tunnel vision.”\n\n5. His sophomore year, Michael Jordan didn’t make the varsity basketball team at Laney (N.C.) High School. The experience gave him reason to not ever be left off a team again.\n\nMichael Jordan's legend starts at North Carolina\n\n6. As a freshman with the North Carolina Tar Heels, Michael Jordan hit the game-winning jump shot in the victory over the Georgetown Hoyas to win the 1982 national championship.\n\n“That turned my name from Mike to Michael Jordan,” he said in “The Last Dance.” “It gave me the confidence that I needed to start to excel at the game of basketball.”\n\n7. Michael Jordan received his degree from the University of North Carolina in 1986 when he returned to complete his classes after breaking his foot. He majored in geography.\n\n8. Michael Jordan wore a pair of North Carolina practice shorts under his Chicago Bulls shorts for every game.\n\nMichael Jordan dominates the basketball world\n\n9. Michael Jordan was selected by the Chicago Bulls as the No. 3 overall pick in the 1984 NBA draft. Ahead of him was Hakeem Olajuwon by the Houston Rockets and Sam Bowie by the Portland Trail Blazers.

Kennedy Jr.'s campaign is responding following a report from the New York Times saying that years ago doctors found a dead worm in his brain.\n\nThe Times reported Wednesday that doctors noticed a dark spot in brain scans for Kennedy after he experienced memory loss in 2010 and concluded he had a brain tumor, according to a 2012 deposition. He received a call from another doctor who believed that it was not a tumor, and was instead a dead parasite.\n\nThe doctor believed the abnormality “was caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died,” Kennedy said in the deposition, per the New York Times.\n\n'Loyal friend':Kevin Spacey endorses Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in presidential election\n\nKennedy told the Times he was also diagnosed with mercury poisoning likely from ingesting too much fish containing the heavy metal at the same time he learned about the parasite. Among other symptoms, mercury poisoning can cause irritability, indecision, headache, weakness or exhaustion and weight loss, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Kennedy's campaign team seemed to confirm a previous issue with a parasite, but said the issue has been resolved.\n\n\"Mr. Kennedy traveled extensively in Africa, South America, and Asia in his work as an environmental advocate, and in one of those locations contracted a parasite,\" his press team said in an email. \"The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago, and he is in robust physical and mental health.\"\n\nThe press team added: \"Questioning Mr. Kennedy’s health is a hilarious suggestion, given his competition.\"\n\nKennedy, 70, is running as an independent in the 2024 presidential election and his name will appear on the ballot in Michigan, Utah, Hawaii and, his campaign says, in Delaware and California. Voters in those states will have the option to vote for Kennedy, Republican nominee and former president Donald Trump, 77, and Democratic nominee and current president Joe Biden, 81.\n\nKennedy is the son of Robert F. Kennedy, a former U.S. Senator who was assassinated during his presidential campaign in 1968, and the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy. Beyond his famous family, Kennedy has made a name for himself as an environmental attorney, activist and writer, and notably, spreading anti-vaccine rhetoric and COVID-19 misinformation.\n\nMembers of the Kennedy family have rejected his campaign, formally endorsing President Joe Biden in April at a campaign rally in Philadelphia.\n\nContributing: Natalie Alund", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/12/bidens-allies-stop-rfk-jr-election-spoiler/73203434007/", "title": "How Biden's allies hope to stop RFK Jr. from becoming election spoiler", "text": "WASHINGTON ― Haunted by election spoilers of the past, President Joe Biden's Democratic allies have mobilized against Robert F. Kennedy Jr., intent on stopping his independent presidential bid from dooming Democrats in November.\n\nOn the 2024 campaign trail, Biden has ignored Kennedy, the anti-vaccine activist and son of deceased liberal icon Robert F. Kennedy, as he focuses solely on Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the Democratic National Committee recently hired a team of attorneys, led by Dana Remus, Biden's former White House counsel, to monitor Kennedy's efforts to get his name on ballots of key battleground states before upcoming spring and summer qualifying deadlines.\n\nAnd the DNC has expanded operations to paint Kennedy as a radical conspiracy theorist, rejected even by his family, whose campaign serves one purpose: boosting Trump's chances. Democrats are convinced much of the electorate isn't aware of Kennedy's controversial positions and theories or that he's boosted financially by a Trump Super PAC's largest donor.\n\n\"We're not taking anything for granted. No one wants to see what happened in 2000 and 2016 happen this time around, so we're putting pieces in place early,\" said Matt Corridoni, a DNC spokesman.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump: 'If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr.'\n\nSeven months from the election, Kennedy has the support of 11.7% of likely voters, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls. That doesn't make him a serious contender to win the election. But Kennedy's current double-digit standing is more than enough to swing outcomes in battleground states.\n\nDemocrats still blame Green Party nominee Jill Stein in 2016 for taking progressive votes away from Hillary Clinton, potentially costing Clinton Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin to Trump. In 2000, consumer rights advocate Ralph Nader won more than 97,000 votes in Florida, significantly greater than the margin of George W. Bush's victory over Al Gore in the state that gave Bush his victory.\n\n\"Any amount of shift, any amount that that RFK takes from either candidate, is a danger to them and could, in fact, flip the election,\" said Bernard Tamas, a political science professor at Valdosta State University and author of \"The Demise and Rebirth of American Third Parties.\"\n\n\"If I was working for the Biden campaign, I would take it very seriously because you don't know what's going to happen with him. The numbers will probably drop a lot,\" Tamas said. \"But you just don't know. It's an enormous uncertainty.\"\n\nWhether Kennedy takes more votes away from Biden than Trump − or whether it's about the same from both − has been debated among political observers. Kennedy is also facing increasing attacks from Trump's Super PAC, MAGA Inc., which has labeled Kennedy a radical far-left liberal in a push to pull progressive voters from Biden.\n\nTrump's allies believe that the multiple independent or third-party candidates in the race help Trump's chances, and are seeking to elevate their campaigns, the New York Times reported this week.\n\n\"If I were a Democrat, I'd vote for RFK Jr. every single time over Biden because he's frankly more in line with Democrats,\" Trump said in a video released by his campaign Thursday. \"I do believe that RFK Jr. will do very well, and I do believe he's going to take a lot of votes away from crooked Joe Biden.\"\n\nVoters view Biden, Trump more negatively than Kennedy\n\nKennedy initially launched a Democratic primary challenge against Biden before switching to an independent run last year.\n\nAlso threatening to peel off voters from Biden are left-leaning activist Cornel West, who is running as an independent, and Stein, who like 2016 is running as the Green Party's nominee. For now, the DNC is focused primarily on Kennedy, whose fundraising and organization far exceed the campaigns of West and Stein.\n\nDemocrats believe Kennedy's polling is inflated by his famous last name − arguably the most iconic brand in Democratic politics − and from avoiding heavy scrutiny until recently. Historically, third-party candidates perform better in polling than in elections, particularly months away from the start of voting.\n\nPolling regularly finds Americans view Kennedy, who many say they know little about, more favorably than Biden and Trump. A Marquette University Law School poll last week found 60% of voters have an unfavorable opinion of Biden and 56% an unfavorable view of Trump, but only 39% view Kennedy unfavorably. Thirty percent of respondents said they hadn't heard enough about Kennedy to form an opinion.\n\nDemocrats see the unfamiliarity as an opening to define Kennedy and keep him from siphoning independent and Democratic voters from Biden.\n\nMobile billboards funded by the DNC − featuring doctored photos of Kennedy and his newly named running mate, Nicole Shanahan, wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats − followed Kennedy at fundraisers in Florida last week.\n\n\"MAGA's spoiler candidate,\" a DNC ad placed in La Opinión, a Spanish-language newspaper based in Los Angeles., warned ahead of a March 30 \"Viva Kennedy\" event targeting Hispanic voters.\n\nIn cable television appearances, Democrats are increasingly flagging Kennedy's long trail of conspiratorial statements — that COVID-19 was \"ethnically targeted\" to attack certain ethnicities, his uncertainty of the government's explanation of the 9/11 attacks, and his warnings that the U.S. has been collecting DNA from Russia and China to create \"ethnic bioweapons.\"\n\nAnd they are highlighting Kennedy's considerable financial backing from Trump donors. The largest donation, $20 million, to Kennedy's main Super PAC, American Values 2024, came from Timothy Mellon, an 81-year-old Republican megadonor from Wyoming. Mellon has also donated $15 million to MAGA Inc., the 2024 election, the most of any donor to Trump's Super PAC.\n\nA 'spoiler for both,' Kennedy campaigns says\n\nIn a statement, Kennedy press secretary Stefanie Spear said the campaign is \"planning on being a spoiler for both President Biden and President Trump.\"\n\n\"We also plan to be a spoiler for the war machine, Wall Street, Big Ag, Big Tech, Big Pharma, Big Energy, and the corporate media,\" Spear said. “If Americans are ever going to escape the hammerlock of the two parties and their corrupt backers, now is the time to do it. These are the two most unpopular candidates in living memory.”\n\nOver the past week, Democrats seized on comments made by Kennedy in a CNN interview calling Biden a bigger threat to democracy than Trump and remarks from a Kennedy campaign consultant from New York who said her “No. 1 priority\" is defeating Biden. The campaign said Wednesday it terminated the contract of the consultant, Rita Palma, for \"misrepresentation.\"\n\nThe scale of the DNC's anti-Kennedy operation − and whether the party will spend vastly more resources to pay for television ads − is still unclear. It could depend on whether Kennedy is successful in qualifying for the ballots in the six to eight battleground states that could decide the election.\n\nSolidly red Utah is the lone state where Kennedy has officially qualified to run as an independent for the 2024 election, though his campaign has touted collecting enough signatures in several others. Laws to qualify to run for president vary by state − and the team of lawyers hired by the DNC intend to scrutinize Kennedy's efforts.\n\n\"We're going to make sure that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is playing by the rules,\" Corridoni said.\n\nBesides the DNC, several members of the Kennedy family have also raised alarm about their relative's bid. In a showing of support for Biden, dozens of members of the late John F. Kennedy's family visited the White House last month to celebrate St. Patrick's Day − with Robert F. Kennedy a notable absence.\n\nKennedy has found traction in 2024 election polling in part because of the vast number of voters known as the \"double haters\"− those who dislike Biden and Trump. Polling has found double haters make up between 15% and 20% of the electorate.\n\nA USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll taken in March found 44% of double haters currently back various third-party candidates led by Kennedy, who drew support from 21% of these voters. Trump led Biden among double haters 25%-18% in the poll. Stein had the backing of 7% of double haters, while West was supported by 6%.\n\nBut Tamas, an expert on third parties in the U.S., said independent or third-party runs that gain traction − most notably Ross Perot, who won 19% of the vote nationally in 1992 − tend to tap into discontent from blocs of voters who feel underrepresented. They often zero in on a singular theme. For Perot, it was economic populism.\n\nTamas questioned whether Kennedy's candidacy has the right ingredients to take off given the hodgepodge of issues he discusses.\n\nAt the same time Kennedy touts his environmentalism credentials in appeal to left-leaning votes, for example, he questions medical experts about vaccines and COVID while promising to \"seal the border to illegal immigration.\"\n\n\"Since he's not defining himself, chances are the Democrats and Trump are going to do a pretty good job of defining him for him,\" Tamas said, arguing that Kennedy probably isn't as big a threat as he looks in polls.\n\n\"But − and this is a giant but − since 2000, these elections have been so close that it really is only going to take a shift of maybe 1% or 2% of the vote to potentially flip the election,\" Tamas said.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/14/live-updates-iowa-caucus-2024-republicans/72192067007/", "title": "When is the Iowa Caucus?

The duo previously interrupted events over the weekend by GOP candidates Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nAt Binkley’s Sunday night event at a hotel near Des Moines International Airport, one of the duo approached the stage as Binkley was speaking and said, “There’s a candidate that really needs your vote, and that candidate is me because I need to become president and pardon myself,” seemingly a reference to frontrunner and former President Donald Trump.\n\n“The Good Liars” were drowned out by chants of Binkley supports — of whom there were around 45 at the event, including family and campaign staff — and escorted out.\n\n“I’ll give you a minute, but not right now,” Binkley told them.\n\nAs for his electoral path forward through and after Iowa, Binkley told his supporters, “We’re going to make a move tomorrow night.”\n\nHe viewed his low position in polls as a sign that there’s only room to improve and said “something’s missing” from the other candidates, be it in their character, message, style or platform.\n\n“My goal is to surprise Iowa,” Binkley told the Register after he spoke on Sunday. “Can we come out with 2, 3, 4, 5%? I think that would be significant for us,” he added.\n\n− Phillip Sitter\n\nLibertarians pitch presidential candidacies on caucus eve\n\nLibertarian hopefuls,, also caucusing Monday, held a debate at a pizza restaurant in Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday.\n\nModerated by Marco Battaglia, a former Libertarian candidate for Iowa attorney general and governor, the debate featured presidential candidates economist Mike ter Maat, tech entrepreneur Lars Mapstead, former candidate for the Georgia Senate Chase Oliver, and Joshua Smith. It was open to the public — a last ditch effort to encourage voters to caucus for the third party.\n\nIowa Libertarians earned enough support in 2022 to qualify as an official state political party for the 2024 election. Their candidate for president must take home at least 2% in the general election for the state party to keep its status. The Libertarian Party of Iowa will hold caucuses across the state at 6:30 p.m. Monday.\n\n\"Stop wasting your vote. If you are voting for someone that does not represent your principles and your ethics and your values, you are wasting your vote,\" ter Maat said to the near-empty pizzeria.\n\n\"I don't want to hear anybody tell me, 'Hey, these Republicans care about out liberties,'\" Smith said. \"No they don't. They are not our friends. They don't care about our values or morals. They don't care about the individual sovereignty of your own body. All they care about is money.\"\n\n-Addison Lathers\n\nVivek Ramaswamy shrugs off Donald Trump attack\n\nOne day after former President Donald Trump warned his supporters not to caucus for Vivek Ramaswamy during Monday's Iowa Caucuses, Ramaswamy said he would not engage with the former president.\n\nRamaswamy held five events Sunday, one day before Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses. During a briefing with reporters Sunday morning after an event in Ankeny, Iowa, Ramaswamy called Trump's attack bad campaign advice.\n\nRamaswamy, 38, told reporters that he respects \"the heck out of Donald Trump\" and would support Trump if he gets the Republican nomination.\n\n“It was probably an unfortunate move by his campaign advisers,” Ramaswamy said of Trump’s post. “I think he probably got bad advice. I don’t think friendly fire within our America First movement is helpful, and I’m not going to hold it against him. I’m not going to criticize him in response because he was an excellent president.\"\n\n– Philip Joens\n\nVivek Ramaswamy calls for armed guards in schools following Iowa shooting\n\nVivek Ramaswamy on Sunday offered his condolences to Perry High School Principal Dan Marburger's family and Perry's residents. Marburger died earlier in the day, over a week after he was injured in a shooting at the high school.\n\nIn a podcast during the latest Republican debate, Ramaswamy said three armed security guards were needed in each school across the country. As a reporter told Ramaswamy about Marburger’s death Sunday, he changed his stance slightly. One armed security guard could deter, but not stop shootings at schools, Ramaswamy said.\n\nSo he would like to see three armed security guards in most schools and up to five armed security guards in larger schools, the Ohio entrepreneur argued.\n\n“We apply more security in our airports, in our banks and many of our shopping malls than we do in our own schools, and I think that’s a failure,” Ramaswamy said. “Our most-valuable national asset is our children and the people taking the effort to educate those children. The least we can do as a country.”\n\n– Philip Joens\n\nNikki Haley: 'Lift up the Perry community in prayer' after Iowa principal dies following shooting\n\nHaley began her campaign event in Adel, Iowa, asking the crowd to \"lift up the Perry community in prayer\" after the death of Perry High School Principal Dan Marburger Sunday.\n\nMarburger was shot multiple times during a school shooting earlier this month while trying to distract the 17-year-old shooter, who killed an 11-year-old student and wounded 11 others.\n\n\"What happened in Perry, whenever you turn on the TV, it doesn’t matter what state it is, it still hurts,\" Haley said. \"And we still feel it. Our hearts still drop. And today, my heart dropped again when I heard that we lost Dan Marburger. This principal was a hero. He saved lives.\"\n\nHaley said Marburger's actions are a reminder of the good people who step up in tragic circumstances. She asked the crowd to thank the teachers, the law enforcement officers and other officials who responded to the shooting that day.\n\n\"First there’s shock and then there’s sadness and then there’s healing,\" Haley said. \"So as they go through this process, let’s not forget it because it happened one day and went off the TV. Let’s remember that this is going to be a process for them and we need to continue to pray for them.\"\n\n– Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nConservative lawmaker hypes up Nikki Haley in Adel, Iowa\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., a Freedom Caucus member who has endorsed Nikki Haley, said the one word he'd use to describe Haley is \"courage.\"\n\nHe recalled Haley's 2010 campaign for governor of South Carolina, where she was an underdog who went on to win the election. He said she can do the same this year.\n\n\"We cannot lose this election,\" he said. \"She is the only candidate that can get independents, that can get females, minorities. She’s got the total package. And she’s got the vision and does what she says.\"\n\n– Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nRon DeSantis addresses Perry shooting in Cedar Rapids\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis defended his record on gun legislation Sunday during an event at the Chrome Horse Saloon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\nAbout 100 people attended the campaign stop, where a student was among those who asked DeSantis questions after his stump speech. The question was inaudible from the back of the room, but appeared to be about the shooting earlier this month at Perry High School and DeSantis’ gun policies.\n\nDeSantis passed a bill in Florida eliminating the requirement to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Supporters of the legislation call it “constitutional carry.”\n\n“I don’t think there’s any connection between constitutional carry and what happened in Perry,” DeSantis said. “That was an underage student that was not even in lawful possession of a firearm.”\n\nDeSantis received applause when he later declared: “You don’t need a permission slip from the government to be able to exercise your constitutional right.”\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nDonald Trump gets endorsement from ex-rival Marco Rubio\n\nDonald Trump's campaign is trotting out endorsements a day before the Iowa caucuses – including one from a former rival who once upon a time described Trump as \"a con artist.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the candidates who lost the 2016 Republican presidential race to Trump, said Sunday he liked many of the things the former president did in office, such as an expanded child tax credit and sanctions of Cuba and Venezuela.\n\n\"We had a President who didn’t cave to special interests or let bureaucrats block us,\" Rubio said in a statement put out by the Trump 2024 campaign.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nIowa Caucuses:Presidential candidates make their final pitches ahead of Caucus Day\n\nWhat time does the Iowa Caucus start?\n\n7 p.m.\n\nState parties advise caucusgoers to get to their caucus site early to be sure they're properly registered and inside on time. Doors open at 6 p.m.\n\n– Des Moines Register\n\nAsa Hutchinson is making his 'last arguments' to the Iowa 'jury'\n\nAsa Hutchinson, once the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas and governor of the same state, is making his closing arguments to prospective Iowa caucusgoers ahead of the Iowa Caucus on Monday night.\n\n\"You have to make the case that our country needs to go a different direction than Donald Trump. And if someone does not say that then ... we're basically saying he's going to be a great nominee for us,\" Hutchinson said during his meet and greet on Sunday at Jethro's BBQ in Ames, Iowa.\n\nThe latest Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll had Hutchinson at 1%, far below the frontrunner Donald Trump at 48% and second place Nikki Haley at 20%.\n\n\"One person in America who really likes the poll numbers where they see Donald Trump 28 points ahead is Joe Biden. He's sitting there loving it because that's the one chance he has to win,\" he said.\n\nHutchinson continued to say he believes Republicans can still win the general election if they have the right nominee. \"And that's the case I have to make,\" he said.\n\n– Virginia Barreda\n\n'Even if you vote and then pass away, it's worth it,' Donald Trump tells Iowans\n\nFormer President Donald Trump made a final plea for supporters Sunday afternoon to show up in the frigid cold to caucus for him, revisiting familiar lines of attack against his political opponents while tempering expectations of his expected margin of victory.\n\n\"You can't sit home,\" Trump said. \"If you're sick as a dog … even if you vote and then pass away, it's worth it.\"\n\nTrump, who was scheduled to hold four in-person rallies throughout the state this weekend before scrapping three because of an extended blizzard, spoke to a packed Simpson College auditorium after supporters stood in line for hours in wind chills that reached the mid-negative 40s.\n\n\"If this is any indication, the storm has had zero effect,\" Trump said. \"You're very hearty people, I've heard that.\"\n\n– Galen Bacharier\n\n'Women for Nikki' lead enthusiastic crowd waiting for Nikki Haley\n\nA crowd of women in fuchsia feather boas and \"Women for Nikki\" T-shirts cheered \"Nikki's in the house!\" while waiting the former governor's entrance at an event in Ames, Iowa, Sunday afternoon.\n\nAmong an audience packed into the backroom of Jethro's BBQ, the women also held up signs and led chants of \"Nikki! Nikki!\" The Ames gathering is one of Nikki Haley's final campaign stops in the state before caucuses begin Monday.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\n'Heartbreaking news': Nikki Haley comments on Perry High School principal's death after Iowa shooting\n\nNikki Haley praised Perry High School Principal Dan Marburger, who died Sunday morning, 10 days after he was shot multiple times during a school shooting.\n\nMarburger has been widely praised for his heroism. He was attacked while trying to distract the 17-year-old shooter, who killed an 11-year-old students and wounded six others.\n\n\"Heartbreaking news out of Perry this morning,\" Haley shared on social media. \"Principal Marburger was a hero who dedicated himself to setting his students up for success and ultimately gave his life to protect them. Rest in peace.\"\n\n− Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nBeyond Iowa: Donald Trump's rally veers from crucial caucuses\n\nWhile he spent some of his speech on Sunday urging Iowans to caucus for him, Trump spent a good chunk of his rally on rhetorical ticks he has used for months − and even years.\n\nFrom re-reciting the lyrics of the song \"The Snake\" − a text he uses to criticize immigrants − to joking that he has been indicted more times than mobster Al Capone, Trump devoted parts of his speech to topics that have little, if anything, to do with Iowa.\n\n\"In conclusion ... we're having a good time,\" Trump said toward the end of a speech that lasted a little more than 100 minutes. He also blasted former House Speaker Paul Ryan, calling the one-time vice presidential candidate a member of a failed Republican establishment.\n\nThe former president's walk down memory lane additionally included talk about how he awarded medals to radio talk show icon Rush Limbaugh and Iowa wrestling legend Dan Gable.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nNorth Dakota's Doug Burgum endorses Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump introduced a special guest at his Indianola, Iowa, rally on Sunday: Former presidential candidate and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nBurgum endorsed the former president, telling a crowd of Trump's supporters that the longtime Republican frontrunner will \"deliver energy dominance\" to the nation. Energy policy was a centerpiece of Burgum's longshot 2024 bid.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nIowa caucus results: When will a winner be announced?\n\nIowa Republicans are expecting a smooth night on Monday as they report caucus results from 1,657 precincts around the state, in contrast to issues that plagued Democrats' caucuses in 2020 and prevented reports of timely and accurate results.\n\nPatrick Stewart, a consultant for the Republican Party of Iowa, told reporters ahead of the crucial contest that results from the smallest precincts, where only a few people show up to caucus, should be available about 30 minutes or so after the caucuses' 7 p.m. start. Results from larger precincts should begin coming in over the next few hours.\n\nBut, historically, Iowa's caucus results haven't always been known right away on caucus night.\n\n− Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\nWhat happens at the Iowa caucus?\n\nIowa caucus-goers will hold a binding vote for the party's presidential nominee at designated caucus sites and elect delegates to county conventions. The event does not require a minimum threshold to qualify for delegates.\n\nDelegates will attend this summer's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the party's nominee will be chosen.\n\nThe Iowa caucus voting is done with a secret ballot with no set list of candidates to choose from as voters can choose candidate they want. Some caucus sites provide pre-printed names of major candidates and a write-in option but most of the time voters write the name of the candidate on a blank paper sheet.\n\n− Anthony Robledo\n\nNikki Haley promotes resume in Iowa’s race for second place\n\nAfter canceling an in-person event Sunday morning in Dubuque, Iowa, due to extreme weather conditions, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley held a telephone town hall on Sunday. One caller, Bryce from Dubuque, asked Haley what to tell people who might be deciding between supporting her and backing Florida Ron DeSantis.\n\n“Ron has been a good governor,” Haley began, before touting her own record as the former governor of South Carolina.\n\nShe also detailed her time as the ambassador to the United Nations and her experience as a military spouse, arguing she is overall more qualified for the presidency than some of her rivals.\n\n“There are no foregone conclusions,” Haley said at the end of the virtual event. “We’re already moving up in the polls. Everybody else is moving down. We see the surge.”\n\nA Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll this weekend showed Haley moving ahead of DeSantis by four percentage points, while still trailing former President Donald Trump by almost 30.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nComedy group interrupts Vivek Ramaswamy's speech\n\nA day after attempting to present Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis with a “participation trophy,” members of the comedy duo \"The Good Liars\" took a turn at entrepreneur and author Vivek Ramaswamy during his Sunday morning speech in Ankeny.\n\nIt was difficult to hear what they told the Republican presidential candidate. But as Ramaswamy typically does with protesters, he told the men they could ask a question respectfully later. When they continued to interrupt, Ramaswamy said, \"Then you can get the hell out.\" The men were then led out of the event.\n\n\"The Good Liars\" comedy duo has been comprised of Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler since 2011. They are known for interrupting political events. On Saturday, a video of the duo went viral after they interrupted DeSantis with the trophy, and said he would not become president.\n\nRamaswamy has been part of several contentious exchanges with protesters over the past week. On Wednesday, protesters with the Sunrise Movement, a group which advocates to mitigates the effects of climate change, were removed after interrupting a Ramaswamy event in the Iowa State Capitol Rotunda.\n\nSunrise Movement protesters showed up to a Ramaswamy speech on Friday night in West Des Moines and were removed on three separate occasions.\n\n− Paige Windsor\n\nIs there a Democratic caucus in Iowa?\n\nYes, Democrats will hold a caucus in Iowa this year too, which President Joe Biden is currently expected to win.\n\nBut Democrats will not be choosing a presidential candidate in-person on Jan. 15. Instead, they will be conducting party business, including electing delegates and alternate delegates to county conventions, electing county central committee members and submitting platform resolutions for county conventions.\n\nIn an effort to simplify their process and make it more inclusive, Iowa Democrats have moved to an entirely mail-in system of casting their presidential preferences. Iowa Democrats can request an absentee presidential preference card, which functions like a ballot, that they can fill out and return to the state party until March 5, when results will be announced.\n\nThe last day to submit a request for a preference card is Feb. 19. Cards can be requested online at iowademocrats.org/caucus.\n\n− Des Moines Register staff\n\nRon DeSantis blasts Donald Trump ahead of Iowa caucus\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis hit out at former President Donald Trump on Sunday, issuing a warning to Republican voters just one day before the crucial Iowa Caucuses.\n\nDeSantis in an interview with ABC’s “This Week” was asked to deliver his closing argument to Iowa voters on the eve of the first GOP contest of the 2024 presidential election. The Florida governor said the former president is “running for his issues,” while he’s “running for your issues and your family's issues.”\n\nDeSantis accused the former president of failing to deliver on his signature 2016 and 2020 campaign promises, such as building a wall along America’s southern border. He also accused Trump of being distracted by his four sets of criminal charges, investigations into the Capitol riot on Jan. 6 and other legal challenges.\n\n“I think that ends up focusing the election on things that are going to be advantageous for Democrats because you're not going to be talking about the border. You're not going to be talking about the economy. You're going to be talking about all these things to make the election a referendum on Donald Trump,” DeSantis said.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nDonald Trump interrupted at Iowa rally\n\nA woman yelled at Trump during his Indianola, Iowa, rally for \"taking in millions,\" presumably a reference to foreign countries who checked into Trump hotels during his presidency.\n\nAs the crowd responded with chants of \"Trump, Trump, Trump,\" the former president said \"go home to Mommy.\"\n\nAs other 2024 candidates have encountered, protestors also called Trump a \"climate criminal.\" They were booed by the crowd as Trump responded, \"Go home to mommy, your mommy's waiting. ... So young.\"\n\n− Paige Windsor, David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump to caucusgoers: 'Dress warmly'\n\nDonald Trump has taken the stage in a small but crowded ballroom at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa − and issued a caucus warning about the weather.\n\n\"Dress warmly tomorrow night,\" he told supporters.\n\nThis is Trump's only scheduled public speech on Sunday, though he has a \"tele-rally\" set for later in the day. Temperatures in the Iowa city dropped to -10 degrees Sunday afternoon.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump greets volunteers at Des Moines hotel before heading to rally\n\nThe former president met with campaign volunteers on Sunday morning, before his motorcade departed for a rally in Indianola south of the capital city.\n\nTrump, donning a white-and-gold \"caucus captain\" hat in addition to his usual blue suit and red tie, remarked that some observers have predicted he might eclipse 50% of support on caucus night. He pointed to the record Republican margin of victory in the Iowa caucuses – a 12-point win by Bob Dole in 1996.\n\nTrump has frequently set sky-high expectations on the caucus trail, telling supporters to show up for a \"historic\" and \"landslide\" victory on Monday. The new Iowa Poll released Saturday night showed him leading the field by 28 percentage points.\n\nHe also tempered his concerns about turnout in the weather, with snow mostly passed but wind chills expecting to result in record-low temperatures for a caucus night: \"We seem to have a lot of good enthusiasm,\" Trump said. \"I don't know, maybe the weather is not going to be that big a deal.\"\n\n– Galen Bacharier\n\nAfter slipping to third place in Des Moines Register Poll, Ron DeSantis says Iowans ‘roll their eyes at these polls’\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis told WHO 13 News on Sunday that he’s skeptical about the latest Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll, where 16% of likely Republican caucusgoers selected him as their first-choice candidate.\n\n“I think a lot of the Iowans, they just roll their eyes at these polls. I mean, the idea that you’re gonna know in a caucus with negative-20-degree temperatures what that electorate’s gonna look like, you just can’t do it,” DeSantis said. “So it’s basically shooting into the wind.”\n\nDeSantis and his endorsers have waved away poll results for months, telling crowds in Iowa that polls are part of a “media narrative” that Trump is unbeatable. In a Sunday email, the DeSantis campaign assured its donors and supporters that the Register’s Iowa Poll has “an incredibly bad track record of predicting the results of the Iowa Caucus.” The email notes that Donald Trump was ahead in the final Iowa poll before the 2016 caucus, but Ted Cruz was the victor on caucus night.\n\nCruz and Trump were within just five percentage points of each other in the final poll before the 2016 caucus. As gold-standard pollster J. Ann Selzer said then: “The drill-down shows, if anything, stronger alignment with Cruz than Trump, except for the horse race.”\n\nIn this year’s pre-caucus poll, Trump is the first-choice candidate for 48% of likely Republican caucusgoers. That puts him 28 percentage points ahead of Nikki Haley and 32 percentage points ahead of DeSantis.\n\nIn the history of the Iowa Poll, no candidate with a double-digit lead over second place has gone on to lose the caucuses.\n\n“I’ve been down big right before an election and won before. So we’re doing it right,” DeSantis said on WHO. “Our voters are going to turn out. They are gonna be there and they’re excited to be there.”\n\n— Katie Akin, Tim Webber\n\nNikki Haley pulls ahead of DeSantis for second place in Iowa poll, Donald Trump leads\n\nDonald Trump retains a commanding lead in the final Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll before Monday’s caucuses, with Nikki Haley sliding past Ron DeSantis into second place.\n\nThe former president is the first choice of 48% of likely Republican caucusgoers, while former United Nations Ambassador Haley is at 20% and Florida Gov. DeSantis drops to 16%. No other candidate reaches double digits.\n\nThe poll of 705 likely Republican caucus goers was conducted Jan. 7-12 by Selzer & Co. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\n\n– Stephen Gruber-Miller\n\n‘Looking for momentum’: Nikki Haley supporter says Iowa is just the beginning\n\nSanford Owens, 67, travelled to Iowa from Portland, Oregon, to support Haley during the caucus. Yet, he said he doesn’t expect her to come out on top.\n\n“I think she’s going to have a good showing, but no I don’t think she’s going to win. I think Trump will win,” Owens said.\n\nThinking Iowans will already be “pre-set” on a candidate, Owens said he believes Monday's outcome will simply get “the ball rolling” for Haley heading into the New Hampshire primary next week.\n\n“We’re looking for momentum,” Owens said. “If Nikki gets momentum into New Hampshire, I think we’re going to do extremely well.”\n\nA registered Republican and foreign policy officer for 25 years, Owens said he started supporting the former UN ambassador about a month or two ago, largely due to her stances on overseas issues, including aid to Ukraine.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nA very low high in Iowa as the candidates campaign\n\nThe overnight temperature at Des Moines International Airport on Saturday into Sunday, minus 17 degrees, didn't set a record. But the forecast daytime high Sunday could match the coldest high for Jan. 14: 9 degrees below zero.\n\nThe last time Iowa shivered through a high that low on Jan. 14 was in 1888, 136 years ago, Allan Curtis, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Johnston, said Sunday morning. With gusty winds, the wind chill could hover around minus 40.\n\nRegardless, campaign events are set today for all the Republican presidential candidates.\n\n– Bill Steiden\n\nNikki Haley wins endorsement from former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan\n\nNikki Haley of South Carolina picked up an endorsement Sunday from a fellow former Republican governor: Larry Hogan of Maryland.\n\n\"It's time for the party to get behind Nikki Haley,\" Hogan said on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" claiming she has \"momentum\" in her uphill primary battle against frontrunner Donald Trump, with whom Hogan has repeatedly clashed.\n\nHogan who considered a 2024 presidential run of his own, also had discouraging words for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Trump challengers.\n\nHogan on X, formerly Twitter, said: \"Since I decided not to run for president, I've been saying that we don't want to see a multi-car pile-up that would just enable Donald Trump.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhich campaign events are still on?

Most respondents, 71%, say they would vote for Trump if November is a Trump-Biden rematch, while 11% say they would vote for Biden.\n\nSix percent of likely Republican caucusgoers say they would vote for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and 8% say they would vote for some other third-party candidate. One percent say they would not vote, and 3% aren’t sure.\n\n– Katie Akin\n\nWhen is the Iowa Caucus?\n\nThe Iowa Caucuses are scheduled for Jan. 15, starting at 7 p.m.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican contests function function differently.

Kennedy: The forgotten day between his shooting and his ...", "text": "Rick Hampson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLynette Ray’s mother enters her sleeping daughter’s bedroom, where last night, they sat in front of the black-and-white TV to watch coverage of the last day of the California Democratic presidential primary, and of their hero Robert Kennedy.\n\nThe mother holds the morning Oregonian, which she places on the bed. The date is June 5, 1968.\n\n“Lynnie,’’ she says softly, “Bobby’s been shot.’’\n\nLynnie’s memories of President Kennedy’s assassination five years earlier are vivid. After the first reports from Dallas, the principal at her Catholic elementary school told everyone to get on their knees. She can still hear the prayers, and the sobs, from each classroom echoing in the hallway.\n\nShe does not want Bobby to die, too. Especially not today. Today is her 11th birthday.\n\nThe assassination 50 years ago of Robert F. Kennedy, junior U.S. senator from New York, produced memorable images and moments: Kennedy lying wounded on the floor of a Los Angeles hotel; his brother Ted’s eulogy at St. Patrick’s Cathedral; the huge trackside crowds as a train carried the body from New York to Washington.\n\nBut the interval between RFK’s shooting and his death is all but forgotten.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King (shot by an assassin two months earlier) died almost immediately. Robert Kennedy lingered for almost 26 hours. Americans awoke on Wednesday to find he’d been shot and on Thursday to learn he had died.\n\nA lawyer in Fullerton, Pa., said it was like awakening not from a nightmare but into one.\n\nFor almost 26 hours, much of the nation, including the presidential campaign, was in limbo. Patrick Mazor, a high school sophomore in Ellensburg, Wash., was struck by the utter, awful silence at a special assembly in the school gym. “Not again,\" he thought. “Please not again.\"\n\nAmericans old enough to remember generally report less precise or vivid memories of 6/5/68 than of 11/22/63. But many, like Mazor, recall wishing for the best, expecting the worst and thinking that, whether Kennedy lived or not, something in America had died.\n\nThe last campaign\n\nIn a time filled with them, Robert Kennedy was America’s most fascinating public figure. At once tough and vulnerable, he was a rich man’s son who doted on the poor. He started out as a Senate aide to the witch-hunting Republican Joe McCarthy and wound up as a civil rights advocate.\n\nIn 1968, he challenged his party’s president for re-election. Lyndon Johnson won in a landslide in 1964 and enacted sweeping civil rights and anti-poverty measures. But his prosecution of the Vietnam War and his poor showing in the New Hampshire primary against another challenger, Sen. Eugene McCarthy, lured Kennedy into the race.\n\nThen, Johnson dropped out, leaving three candidates: McCarthy, Kennedy and Johnson’s vice president, Hubert Humphrey.\n\nCalifornia’s primary, on June 4, became crucial for Kennedy after he lost in Oregon the week before. After beating McCarthy, Kennedy told supporters at the Ambassador Hotel, “Now, it’s on to Chicago!\" site of the party convention at the end of August.\n\nHe left the stage around 12:15 a.m. and headed for the exit via the kitchen. He stopped to speak to a busboy when a Palestinian immigrant named Sirhan Sirhan, who hated Kennedy because he supported Israel, fired eight shots from a revolver. Kennedy, hit three times, was rushed to a hospital.\n\nA day to remember\n\nAt her home outside Portland, Ore., Lynette Ray, watching the news on television, began to believe Bobby would live. His press secretary, Frank Mankiewicz, had been mildly encouraging, saying his “life signs remain good — respiration, pulse, blood pressure.\"\n\nAfter Kennedy underwent a four-hour operation, Mankiewicz said the patient’s “condition is described as extremely critical,\" but his “vital signs remain about as they were, except that he is now breathing on his own, which he was not prior to the surgery. … The next 12 to 36 hours will be very critical.\"\n\nThat was vague enough to encourage some optimism. “I thank God that he is apparently going to live,\" blurted Daniel Boyle, chairman of the Johnson County, Iowa, Democratic committee.\n\n“As long as he was still alive,\" Lynnette recalled years later, “I was OK with that.\"\n\nAs the TV news played in the background, Lynette and her mother focused on plans for her special day. First, a trip to “the Coney Island of the West\" — Jantzen Beach Amusement Park on an island in the Columbia River. Then a stop at Farrell’s Ice Cream Parlour, famous for giving customers a free ice cream sundae on their birthday.\n\nAt the amusement park, Lynette and her friends went from ride to ride, including a carousel built for the 1904 St. Louis World’s Fair. They played and lost games to win stuffed animals. They ate cotton candy and hot dogs. The park’s sound system played the Beatles’ Yesterday.\n\nRay's mom and another mother who’d come along sat on a bench and looked worriedly at the afternoon paper, The Oregon Journal.\n\nThe other presidential candidates had suspended their campaigns (“none are sure how to proceed anyway,\" wrote columnist Tom Wicker) and received Secret Service protection, previously not provided as a matter of course.\n\nThousands of soldiers and Marines were on alert in case of the kind of rioting that followed King’s death.\n\nKennedy’s wife, Ethel, pregnant with their 11th child, received telegrams from men history would list as her husband’s biggest enemies: Lyndon Johnson (“We grieve and pray with you”) and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.\n\nIn Boston, Cardinal Richard Cushing said a Mass for Kennedy at the palatial archbishop’s residence. In Washington, there was a prayer service in muddy Resurrection City, the shanty town erected by Martin Luther King Jr.’s successors to call attention to poverty.\n\n'A violent people’\n\nAs Lynnette enjoyed the amusement park rides, Americans older than she were consumed by anxiety, doubt and confusion.\n\n“I don’t weep often,\" said the Rev. Billy Graham, “but today, I wept for my country.\"\n\n“What madness is afoot?\" asked Bob Considine, Hearst newspapers’ star columnist. “We’re sick. The assassin has 200 million heads. One is yours. One is mine.\" Historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a Kennedy adviser, was pessimistic: “We are a violent people with a violent history, and the instinct for violence has seeped into our national life.\"\n\nThere even was shock in the most violent place on the planet. A Marine corporal in Vietnam, Robert Wolfe of Dodge City, Kan., told a reporter, “The guys over here are fighting, and people back there are killing each other. It just ain’t right.’’\n\nWho was Sirhan, and what was his motive? If he wanted to kill a supporter of Israel, there were many more likely targets than Kennedy, whose Israel policy was among his least controversial.\n\nAround the time Lynette Ray got home, Mankiewicz told reporters that Kennedy’s medical team “is concerned over his continuing failure to show improvement.\" His condition was described as “extremely critical as to life.\"\n\nAt the White House that night, waiting to address the nation on television, Johnson kept asking aides, “Is he dead yet?\" He finally went on shortly after 10, telling Americans he was “as shocked and dismayed as you are\" and announcing a commission to study “the causes and preventions of violence.\"\n\nIt was still too early for a eulogy. Lynette went to bed happy. It had been a day to remember.\n\nTwo mornings\n\nJune 5, 1968, is a day lost to history.\n\nMajor chronicles either mention the time between Kennedy’s shooting and death briefly, such as Schlesinger’s 1,000-page Robert Kennedy and His Times, or skip it entirely, as in Theodore H. White’s The Making of the President 1968.\n\nAlmost nine in 10 people old enough to remember are still alive. Many conflate the mornings when they learned of the shooting and the death. Those with precise memories of the JFK assassination are apt to forget the details of his brother’s.\n\nWendy Lee Klenetsky is not unusual in thinking she saw the RFK shooting live on TV, which it was not. She says she recalls it happening after she got home from her high school, even though it was after 3 a.m. in the East, where she lived.\n\nSid Litke can tell you the number of students (13) in his one-room school in rural Aulne, Kan., when JFK was shot and describe the teacher lowering the flag outside. He has no memory of where he was or what he was doing when he learned about RFK.\n\nOne thing has not changed. If the mystery of Sirhan never became a national obsession, it never was satisfactorily explained. Certainly not by the defendant, who pleaded guilty despite claiming not to recall what happened.\n\nThis year, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., citing long-disputed forensic evidence, said he believed that more shots were fired in the hotel hallway than the eight from Sirhan’s gun, that there was a second gunman and that Sirhan did not kill his father.\n\n‘He’s gone’\n\nMuch of the suspense over Kennedy’s fate was illusory. By the time he arrived at Good Samaritan hospital, he was dying. His heart was beating, but the line on the brain monitor was flat.\n\nAfter speaking to the head of the surgical team, a Columbia-Presbyterian hospital neurosurgeon told reporters that, given the brain damage caused by one of the bullets, “I fear … the outcome may be extremely tragic.\"\n\nTragic didn’t necessarily mean death. There was also the possibility, as the Associated Press delicately put it, of “an indefinite life of limited usefulness.\"\n\nThe scene in Kennedy’s room would have dispelled any optimism. His body was covered with tubes and wires; the part of his face not covered with bandages was bruised; his eyes were blackened. One Kennedy biographer described Ethel Kennedy lying on the bed next to her husband, “as if she were dying, too.\"\n\nFinally, the family acknowledged the inevitable, and Kennedy was allowed to die. Joseph Kennedy III, his oldest son, went to the ward where his siblings were sleeping. “He’s gone,\" he said.\n\nMankiewicz decided to break the news with a simple statement. “To stick around and answer questions would take away from the import of the moment,\" he explained in a memoir.\n\nShortly after 2 a.m., standing at the lectern of the press center across from the hospital, he read these words: “Sen. Robert Francis Kennedy died at 1:44 a.m., June 6, 1968. With Sen. Kennedy at the time of his death were his wife, Ethel; his sisters, Mrs. Stephen Smith, Mrs. Patricia Lawford; and his brother-in-law, Mr. Stephen Smith. He was 42 years old. Thank you.\"\n\nThen he walked away.\n\nPostscript\n\nAfter dawn on June 6, Lynette Ray was again awakened by her mother, who again carried the newspaper and again laid it on the bed.\n\nThe girl spent the day following events on TV, reading newspapers and researching assassinations in the family’s Encyclopedia Britannica. She would never forget the photo of RFK lying on the floor of the kitchen, his arm outstretched, his face bathed in a halo of light.\n\nHer reaction to this assassination was less emotional than to JFK’s. She was older, more analytical, more self-centered. She didn’t cry, and neither did the adults around her. There was great sadness, but they all had been hardened.\n\nFive months later, on the Wednesday morning after Election Day, Lynette and her mother were in their Buick driving through Lake Oswego, Ore., when word came on the radio that the TV networks finally had called the election for Richard Nixon over Humphrey.\n\nHer mother had not mentioned Kennedy in months. Now she slammed her hand on the steering wheel and shouted a question that had no answer then, and has none now: “Why did we have to lose Bobby?”\n\nMore:RFK's visit to Appalachia, 50 years later: How Kennedy country became Trump country\n\nMore:50 years ago, Cesar Chavez and Robert F.

And one attendee shook from excitement and burst from his seat as Williamson leaned on the podium, took the microphone off its stand to accentuate a point and paced on the small stage as champions in the crowd hung onto her every word.\n\nShe received two standing ovations.\n\nThe early campaign event signified one of the first for the Democratic candidate since announcing her second bid for the White House after first vying for the presidency in 2020.\n\nFour years ago, the self-help author stood on the end of a presidential debate stage next to nine other contenders all vying for the Democratic nomination and delivered a message to former President Donald Trump that became a defining moment of her first campaign.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"You have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out,\" she said during her closing statement, later continuing, \"I'm going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field and sir, love will win.\"\n\nThe love-will-win delivery cast Williamson as, in her words from 2019, \"vulnerable to mockery.\" Now in her second attempt at the presidency, the candidate is concentrating on her other positions − campaigning on changing what she says is the \"unsustainable status quo\" that she believes is destroying the middle class and creating hopelessness for Americans.\n\nShe contends that a majority of current policies are geared toward making things easy for the wealthy at the expense of those less well off, creating a system where too many people are \"locked out\" of opportunities as children.\n\nThe campaign is filling a void, especially for younger voters looking for a fresh message from someone who doesn’t have a legacy in politics, such as her primary opponents President Joe Biden or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Someone who, as Williamson vows she would do in office, shake up the corrupted system.\n\nTouted as Oprah Winfrey's \"spiritual advisor\" − the TV show host called her \"a spiritual friend and counselor\" after she began making frequent appearances on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in the early 1990s − Williamson believes in a universal healthcare system, forgiving student debt, reparations to the descendants of slaves, addressing the environmental crisis and protecting abortion rights.\n\nA Williamson presidency would signify a “political awakening\" in the country, she says.\n\nIt's a mission that appeals to younger voters and mirrors the successes of former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University June poll found nearly a quarter of voters would support an unspecified independent contender over Biden, who is backed by 34%, and Trump, backed by 32%.\n\nBut the 70-year-old candidate is a longshot. A May CNN poll only shows her around 8% among Democratic voters.\n\nWilliamson likens the country and \"status quo incremental politics\" to a ship that is headed toward an iceberg.\n\n“We need to do more than hit the iceberg at a different angle. We need to turn this ship around,\" she said to the Washington, D.C. crowd.\n\nWhy run for president?\n\nWilliamson has spent decades on stages talking to crowds and holding seminars as a spiritual leader with a “love conquers all\" approach.\n\nShe told USA TODAY during a May interview she’s always been involved in charitable work and nonprofit activism during her 40-year career. She has described her work as helping people, individuals and organizations “endure and transform times of chaos.”\n\n“But I began to see that no amount of private charity can compensate for basic lack of social justice,” she said.\n\nHer brother, Peter Williamson, who she grew up with in Houston, told USA TODAY their father may have had an influence on Williamson and her ideas. An immigration lawyer, he would wake up at 4 a.m. every day to read the local newspapers as well as The New York Times and the Washington Post.\n\nPeter, also an immigration lawyer, recalled how their father one day asked Williamson where she got all her ideas.\n\n“She said, ‘From you, daddy,’” Peter said. “He was the center of an awful lot of powerful, psychological activity there.\"\n\nThe first time he heard his sister speak publicly, Peter was impressed.\n\n“She came out. She had no notes, not a single piece of paper. She did not stand behind the podium. She walked back and forth across the stage talking the whole time,” he said.\n\nHer first trial in politics came in 2014 when she ran unsuccessfully for a House seat as an independent for California's 33rd congressional district.\n\nFive years later, she set her sights higher and declared she would run for president in January 2019. She suspended her campaign one year later and endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Sanders.\n\nA self-help author, Williamson wrote 15 books, four of which have topped the New York Times bestseller list. Most center around the themes of love and spirituality.\n\nWilliamson is adding the 2024 presidential race to her resume because she says it's time for the country to change.\n\n“Kids are getting out of college and they don’t know how they’re going to make it. It’s unsustainable. It's immoral. It's unjust, and it’s un-American,” she told USA TODAY. “So why did I get in? Because I’m not the kind of woman who’s going to be silent about something like this.”\n\nWho is running in 2024?A closer look at every candidate so far.\n\nFirst day in the White House: Here's Williamson's plan\n\nAt another May campaign event on the 13th floor of the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Williamson debuted her 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights. Its wide-ranging targets include everything from workplace rights to environmentalism, as well as the right to healthcare and the right to cost-free higher education.\n\n“Some level of economic anxiety is now a feature, not a bug, of the American experience,” she said during her speech, calling economic hardships a form of “modern oppression.”\n\nShe told USA TODAY she has a long list of actions she would take on her first day in office: Cancel the Willow project, an oil drilling project in Alaska; audit the Pentagon; reschedule marijuana; lower pharmaceutical drug prices; cancel government contracts with union-busting companies and form a council of experts on everything related to childhood.\n\nHer long-term goal centers around children and making every public school a “palace of learning and culture and the arts.”\n\n“I want to be the children’s president,” she said.\n\nShe pointed to money in politics as the “cancer underneath all other cancers” in the country and said she agrees with her Democratic opponent Kennedy that a major threat to the country is the “corporate hijacking” of the government.\n\nDai Poole, of Norfolk, Virginia, attended two of Williamson’s recent campaign events in D.C. and compared her speaking to that of former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"She really understands where the people are and has an ability to speak to our issues where it doesn't matter if you're Democrat, Republican, political, apolitical,\" the 29-year-old freelance writer said.\n\nMaking the case to Gen Z\n\nWilliamson’s message has resonated with younger voters.\n\nThe candidate has built a large audience on TikTok, with nearly half a million followers − the most of any presidential candidate who has an official account on the platform. She posts several times a week with clips of her giving interviews, appearing behind the scenes on the campaign trail or talking directly to her followers.\n\nGabriela Orozco, 20, is a student in New York and learned about Williamson’s campaign after one of her TikTok videos appeared on the app.\n\n“I think it was cool because she was using TikTok seriously and presenting a serious message,” she said.\n\nWilliamson told USA TODAY she thinks she appeals to younger voters because she offers a more authentic conversation in the political realm. Young voters don’t have a memory of when the country worked better for its people, she said, adding that young people “are voting for their lives.”\n\n“They don’t remember a time that they’ve never not had to worry,” she said.\n\nHer strategy when launching her second presidential campaign wasn’t about specifically targeting young voters. “I didn’t go after them. I just feel I see them, and they see me.\"\n\nMax Friedstein, a college student in Flagstaff, Arizona, attended one of Williamson’s campaign events in Washington, D.C. and has supported her since her 2019 campaign launch. He said her stances speak to the younger generation − specifically her views on free college, the environment and canceling student loan debt.\n\nThe 27-year-old said he feels there has been no significant progress under Biden. In Williamson's second presidential bid, Friedstein said she comes across as more grounded and relatable, describing her as less “woo-woo.”\n\n“I think four years ago we were just so afraid of Trump winning that it was anything was better, but now we’ve realized it’s not just about not just having Trump. It’s about actual progress that needs to be made and evolution and it feels like she represents that change,” he said.\n\nWhite House mocks Williamson\n\nIn both of her presidential bids, critics have painted Williamson as an unserious candidate, spewing messages of love over solutions to problems.\n\nWhen asked about her most recent candidacy in March, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre referenced Williamson’s spirituality during a White House press briefing.\n\n“I mean, if I had a − what is it called? A little globe here... a crystal ball, then I could tell you. A magic eight ball or whatever. If I could feel her aura, I just don't have anything to share on that,” she said.\n\nWilliamson responded to the comment to USA TODAY, quipping that when Biden took office, he said he would fire anyone in his administration if they disrespected others.\n\n“So I guess my question is why she still has her job,” she said.\n\n'Raised to argue':Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says his 2024 campaign is 'largely misunderstood'\n\n'I've never seen a crystal'\n\nWilliamson’s daughter, India Williamson, grew up watching her mother on stage, calling it “second nature” to see her speaking to crowds.\n\n“She has not built a 37-plus-year career on crystals,” India said. “I’ve never seen a crystal or heard her talk about it, but she has on spirituality and faith and there’s just nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nIndia, 33, wasn’t surprised when her mother entered politics because advocacy has always been part of her life.\n\nBut India said she doesn’t understand the “orb lady” or “aura” labels placed on her mother and struggles to understand why other candidates aren’t attacked for their faith.\n\n“I guess I just don’t understand why when my mother tweets a prayer it’s seen as this insane example of a non-rational, non-scientific sort of scary outlook on the world,” India said.\n\nWilliamson’s campaign has faced other uphill battles.\n\nPolitico reported last month that Williamson lost her second campaign manager since declaring her candidacy. The Daily Beast also reported more than 10 staffers had quit. Williamson's campaign did not comment on the departures to USA TODAY.\n\nPolitico reported Thursday that six staffers quit the Williamson team. In a statement to USA TODAY, a campaign spokesperson said the campaign is restructuring under a new campaign manager to \"become more efficient leading into primary elections.\"\n\nPolitico also reported in 2020 that former staffers claimed she berated employees and frequently lost her temper. She denied to Politico the allegations calling them “categorically untrue.”\n\nBut if Williamson makes it far enough to win the primary and hypothetically face off against Trump, she said she has the “best shot” to beat him.\n\n“I already have my nickname for him − Donald darling,” she told USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/16/politics/lyndon-b-johnson-secret-audio-origseriesfilms/index.html", "title": "LBJ's secretly recorded calls: The most surprising moments | CNN ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: CNN’s new four-part series “LBJ: Triumph and Tragedy” reveals dramatic first-hand accounts from the last surviving members of President Johnson’s inner circle, never-before-broadcast archival material and secretly recorded audiotapes.

Johnson is one of the most consequential US presidents, responsible for passing some of the most significant pieces of legislation in modern history, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nBut his legacy is complicated because it’s intertwined with the escalations of the Vietnam War, which resulted in more than 58,000 US military casualties, according to the National Archives.\n\n“It’s been a half a century since LBJ was in the Oval Office, and he remains this misunderstood, enigmatic figure,” said Mark Updegrove, president and CEO of the LBJ Foundation. “Some people think he was a power-hungry warmonger. Other people think he was the greatest civil rights president since Abraham Lincoln.”\n\nDuring his presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson installed a recording device that saved all his phone calls. According to the LBJ Library, Johnson's secretaries knew about it, but they were the only ones -- not even the first lady was aware she was being recorded. LBJ Library\n\nDuring his time in office, Johnson installed a tape-recording system which secretly recorded all his calls. These recordings offer a rare and intimate look at the president’s strategy and confessions.\n\nHere are five of the top moments secretly captured during Johnson’s presidency.\n\nJohnson calls Vietnam ‘the biggest damn mess’\n\nOne of the big challenges Johnson faced during his presidency was the ongoing Vietnam War.\n\nJohnson, who inherited the conflict in Southeast Asia from the Kennedy administration, admitted early on in his presidency he did not know what to do. He believed the US had several choices in dealing with Vietnam, including sending in troops to “start attacking the Viet Cong,” or withdrawing and leaving South Vietnam to its fate.\n\nOn a call with national security adviser McGeorge Bundy on May 27, 1964, Johnson voiced his concerns about the war.\n\n‘The biggest damn mess I ever saw’: President Johnson on Vietnam On a secretly recorded call in 1964, former President Johnson told National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy about his concerns escalating the war in Vietnam. Johnson ultimately decided to send more troops to Vietnam, a decision that historians agree cost Johnson the re-election in 1968. Source: LBJ Presidential Library\n\nJohnson said, “It just worries the hell out of me. I don’t see what we can ever hope to get out of there with once we’re committed … I don’t think it is worth fighting for, and I don’t think we can get out. And it’s just the biggest damn mess I ever saw.”\n\n“Vietnam was really a very difficult thing for him. He never was comfortable with our presence in Vietnam,” said Jim Jones, special assistant to Johnson. “He felt that the United States had given its word with two different administrations, the Eisenhower administration and the Kennedy administration – it’s given its word to Vietnam.”\n\nJohnson ultimately decided to send more troops to Vietnam. He first he authorized sustained bombing of North Vietnam. Then he sent combat forces. And by November 1965, there were 175,000 troops in Vietnam, with an additional 100,000 the following year. The number surged to 535,000 by the end of Johnson’s presidency, according to the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.\n\nCritics say the decision cost tens of thousands of American lives, and historians agree Vietnam cost Johnson reelection in 1968.\n\nJohnson tells Martin Luther King Jr., ‘we just won’t give up an inch’\n\nJohnson had numerous calls with civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\n\nPresident Johnson with Martin Luther King Jr. at the White House in 1963. Okamoto/PhotoQuest/Getty Images\n\nShortly after becoming president following John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, Johnson told King, “I’m going to try to be of all of your hopes.”\n\nKing responded, “I am so happy to hear that, and I knew that you had just that great spirit, and you know you have our support and backing.”\n\nJohnson tells Martin Luther King Jr. ‘we just won’t give up an inch’ Lyndon Johnson called Martin Luther King Jr. shortly after John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963 to tell him his plan to pass federal civil rights legislation as a tribute to Kennedy. The former president said told the civil rights leader, ‘I’m going to try to be of all of your hopes.’ Source: LBJ Presidential Library\n\nJohnson used the months after the assassination, which he described as “an impossible period,” to pass federal civil rights legislation as a tribute to Kennedy. “I’m going to ask the Congress Wednesday to just stay there until they pass them all. They won’t do it. But we’ll just keep them there next year until they do, and we just won’t give up an inch,” he said.\n\n“No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy’s memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long,” Johnson said in a speech as he advocated for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nJohnson followed through on this goal, signing both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n“Lyndon Johnson was the advocate for the most significant civil rights legislative record since the nation’s founding,” said Melody Barnes, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under President Barack Obama. “It allowed for Barack Obama to be President of the United States.”\n\nThe President’s wife critiques his performance, giving him a B+\n\nJohnson’s tapes also capture affectionate moments between him and his wife, Lady Bird.\n\nOn one occasion, as Johnson was about to announce he had ordered the first bombing of North Vietnam, the first lady called. She said she rang, “merely to tell you I loved you. That’s all.”\n\nFirst lady Lady Bird Johnson with her husband in the Oval Office in 1968.\n\nAnother time in 1964, the first lady called minutes after a press conference to critique his performance. Johnson had made several personnel announcements and then answered questions from reporters about a series of topics including relations with France and Vietnam.\n\nPresident Johnson’s wife critiques his performance and gives him a B+ In 1964, the first lady called the President minutes after his press conference to critique his performance. She said he looked strong, firm and reliable, but he was a little breathless, looked down too much, spoke too fast and didn’t change his pace enough. Source: LBJ Presidential Library\n\nShe started by complimenting him saying he looked strong, firm and reliable.\n\nBut she continued to say, “During the statement, you were a little breathless, and there was too much looking down, and I think it was a little too fast. Not enough change of pace, dropping voice at the end of sentence. There was a considerable pickup in drama and interest when the questioning began. Your voice was noticeably better, and your facial expressions noticeably better.”\n\nShe gave him a B+ grade and recommended he give a shorter written statement.\n\nWhat did the President think of his own performance? He said, “I thought it was much better than last week.”\n\nThe call ended with the first lady saying, “I love you very much.” And Johnson saying, “OK, goodbye.”\n\nJohnson tells Judge Thurgood Marshall to ‘do this job Lincoln started’\n\nThe tapes also revealed the President’s carefully laid out plan to groom Thurgood Marshall to become the first Black man on the US Supreme Court.\n\nMarshall was unaware of all this when Johnson first called him in 1965, asking the federal appeals court judge to become solicitor general of the US.\n\nJohnson grooms Thurgood Marshall for the Supreme Court President Johnson called Thurgood Marshall in 1965 asking the federal appeals court judge to leave the secure position to become a solicitor general of the US – where he could be fired at any time. This was part of Johnson’s carefully laid out plan to set Marshall on the path to become the first Black Supreme Court justice. Source: LBJ Presidential Library\n\n“I want the top lawyer in the United States representing me before the Supreme Court to be a Negro. And be a damn good lawyer that’s done it before.” He added, “I want to do this job that (Abraham) Lincoln started, and I want to do it the right way.”\n\nLeaving the security of a lifetime job on the bench for an uncertain political post – where he could be fired at any time – at first concerned Marshall. But Johnson, a master persuader, convinced him during the call.\n\nJudge Thurgood Marshall with Johnson, following Marshall's appointment to the Supreme Court. Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nTwo years later, Johnson’s plans came to fruition, and he appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court. Marshall served until 1991. He died in 1993.\n\nNixon sabotaged Johnson’s peace talks with Vietnam\n\nNear the end of his term, Johnson tried to organize peace talks between North and South Vietnam but was shocked when suddenly South Vietnam, ally to the US, withdrew.\n\nThe FBI learned it occurred because Republican nominee Richard Nixon had intervened and promised South Vietnam a better deal under his administration.\n\n“This is a shocking revelation. An American presidential candidate is taking steps to undermine the foreign policy during a war of the sitting President,” explained Guian McKee, an associate professor in Presidential Studies at the Miller Center.\n\nJohnson alerted Sen. Everett Dirksen about the campaign’s interference and asked him to tell Nixon to “quit playing with it.”\n\nJohnson on Nixon: ‘This is treason’ Johnson tried to organize peace talks between North and South Vietnam but It was derailed when Republican nominee Richard Nixon intervened and promised South Vietnam a better deal under his administration.

Everett Dirksen about the interference and said, ‘This is treason.’ Source: LBJ Presidential Library\n\nJohnson told Dirksen, “This is treason.”\n\nNixon won the election in 1968, and the Vietnam War ended six years later when Saigon fell to the communists in April 1975.\n\n“In the final analysis, we actually had a better deal going at that time than we did when we pulled out of Vietnam in ’75. And in that time frame the lives lost was about 25,000,” said Jones, special assistant to Johnson. “If it hadn’t been for the Nixon (campaign), I think we could have gotten a peace agreement in Vietnam.”", "authors": ["Janelle Davis"], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/10/how-old-biden-and-trump-how-age-2024-election/70489981007/", "title": "How old are Biden and Trump? How age will impact the 2024 election", "text": "WASHINGTON — When Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is 81, suddenly froze at a press conference last month, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 90, fell and was hospitalized last week, it put a spotlight on a concern among voters about political candidates: age.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican frontrunners, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, are the oldest candidates running in the 2024 race.\n\nBiden, who’s 80, has said in multiple interviews that he’s capable of reelection and has even turned his age into a punchline. But some voters are concerned his age could become a liability in office.\n\nThirty-seven percent of Democratic and Independent voters say Biden’s age makes them less likely to vote for him, according to a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll. Three percent say it makes them more likely, while 56% say it doesn’t make a difference.\n\nAnd Trump, 77, is just three years younger than the current president.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHere’s what you need to know about how age will play a role in the 2024 election.\n\nHow old are the candidates running in 2024?\n\nThe field of presidential candidates in the 2024 race has grown bigger and more diverse in recent months, with people from a variety of backgrounds competing for a chance to run the country.\n\nSome voters are looking for a “fresh face” in the crowd, potentially someone youthful with no political experience. But others are looking for an older and more tenured leader who knows the ins and outs of the political landscape.\n\n\"Age has already been a constant topic, really since the last election,\" Matthew Schmidt, a politics expert at the University of New Haven, told USA TODAY.\n\nHow old are the Democrats running in the 2024 election?\n\nJoe Biden: 80\n\nMarianne Williamson: 71\n\nRobert F.

But it's impossible to say how age affects mental acuity because aging is such an individual process, she added.\n\n“On one hand, age can bring wisdom and experience, which can be enormously helpful when facing challenges on the global scale,” Chervinsky said. “On the other hand, the job is so demanding that voters naturally ask if a candidate is up to the task. That's something each voter has to answer themselves.”\n\nPrior to the most recent presidential elections, former President Ronald Reagan was the oldest person to seek the presidency run for office, she said.\n\nIt is getting more common to see candidates running in their 70s though, James Campbell, a political science professor at the University at Buffalo, said. For instance, by May 2019 during the lead-up to the 2020 election, all but one of the 2020 presidential candidates were above 70 years old.\n\nOne factor contributing to this change, Schmidt said, is that the life expectancy of individuals has increased.\n\n\"People live longer now and are more capable in their later years because they're healthier than in the past,\" Schmidt said.\n\nJennifer Ailshire, a gerontology researcher at the University of Southern California, said that as long as someone is up to the task, she doesn't see why age should be a limiting factor in an election. What voters should watch out for is the physical and cognitive fitness of a candidate, she added.\n\nAilshire's research has shown that while many older individuals will start to experience physical declines in their 70s, there are people who avoid these declines. She also warned that a momentary lapse in memory or focus does not necessarily mean someone is experiencing significant cognitive decline.\n\nBiden versus Trump: 'Life begins at 80'\n\nIf Biden reclaims the White House, he would be 82 years old at the beginning of his second term in January 2025. If Trump wins, he would be 78 − the same age that Biden was when he began his first term in 2021.\n\nTrump dismissed questions about his age in a Truth Social post last year, arguing that Biden was “one of the oldest 79s in History but by and of itself, he is not an old man.”\n\n“There are many people in their 80s, and even 90s, that are as good and sharp as ever,” Trump wrote. “Biden is not one of them, but it has little to do with his age. In actuality, life begins at 80!”\n\nThe White House, however, has rejected criticism about Biden's age, saying he is healthy and fit to serve in office.\n\nBarry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, argued that, even if Biden's age has not affected his ability to do the job, \"some members of the public may nonetheless believe he is not mentally sharp enough or that he lacks the necessary physical stamina.”\n\nThese concerns stem from reports of Biden falling, sometimes mixing up countries and dates and making other small blunders.\n\nThere were also reports of Trump slurring words, having difficulty walking and struggling to raise a water glass during his presidency, raising concerns about his age. One of Trump's long-time supporters, Franklin Graham, expressed concern of Trump's eating habits potentially compromising his health, as Axios reported in 2021.\n\nBut though he had gained a few pounds while he served in office, his doctor had said on numerous occasions that he was healthy. The former president has not released any medical records since leaving office.\n\nBut if voters do have concerns about candidate's age, that's an issue they can watch for on the campaign trail leading into next year's election.\n\n\"Voters need to be aware of the potential problems associated with aging in such a demanding job, and the best way for voters to get a good reading of the candidates' conditions is by frequently observing them,\" Campbell said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/23/biden-vs-trump-2024-double-hater-voters/73043564007/", "title": "'Double haters' could decide whether Biden or Trump wins in 2024", "text": "WASHINGTON ― Jana Pender is no fan of Donald Trump. \"All his lies. He's despicable,\" said the 67-year-old retired casino housekeeper from Detroit.\n\nYet despite voting for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, Pender is not backing him in 2024. She said Biden has \"blood on his hands\" for supporting Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"If nothing changes, I know I won't vote for Trump and I know I won't vote for Biden,\" Pender said. \"I just know I can't vote for either of these people.\"\n\nPender falls squarely within a group of voters known as the \"double haters\"− those who dislike Biden, the incumbent Democratic president, and Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nThis year, this group of skeptics is large and powerful. Double haters make up about 15% of the electorate, according to a poll this month by USA TODAY/Suffolk University, giving them significant sway in deciding the outcome of the November election. Other polls have found double haters make up as much as one-fifth of likely voters.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThey pose a challenge for Biden as his campaign looks to keep the Democratic coalition united − amid signs of splintering − and not jump ship to one of the third-party candidates or sit the election out altogether. But double haters are also a wild card for Trump, whose divisiveness turns many of them off.\n\nThe USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll, taken March 8-11, found Trump leading Biden 40%-38% among registered voters, followed by independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, 9%.\n\nTwenty-five percent of the double haters supported Trump in the survey, compared to 18% for Biden. About 44% of the double haters currently back various third-party candidates. Kennedy drew more of these voters, 21%, than Biden did. Green Party candidate Jill Stein had the backing of 7% of double haters, while independent Cornel West was supported by 6%.\n\n\"He would be top on my list of people to vote for,\" Sally Power, 73, of Pittsburgh, Pa., said of Kennedy. Power, who runs a nonprofit women's retail shop, doesn't approve of Trump's \"statements and interactions with others,\" but has concerns about Biden's age and capacity to effectively serve another term until he's 86 years old.\n\n\"I don't want to vote for either one of them, honestly. That's the problem. And I think I'm not alone in saying that,\" said Power, who voted for Trump in 2016 but Biden in 2020. \"I find both of them not representative of my views. And I don't see them as being representative of the country.\"\n\nWho are the double haters?\n\nIn the 2016 election, Trump performed 17 percentage points better than Hillary Clinton among the double-hater voters − who made up about 20% of the vote − steering him to victory.\n\nIn 2020, Biden enjoyed higher favorability marks than Trump − 49% to Trump's 45% in October of that year, according to Gallup − producing fewer double haters. They accounted for only 3% of voters in 2020. But this year, 55% of registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Biden, according to the USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll, while 55% also have an unfavorable opinion of Trump.\n\n\"I think they will end up being the key swing vote because they're the ones that could go third-party,\" said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who conducted polling for Biden's 2020 campaign. \"They are the ones that could decide to stay home. They are the ones that swing back and forth because they're not anchored by affection, they're anchored by disaffection. These are the voters who decided 2016.\"\n\nDouble haters are composed of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. Many consider themselves independents. They skew younger. Most are white but Latino voters also make up a sizable share. Double haters are among those voters who have lingering concerns about the state of the economy despite a robust jobs market, low unemployment and a booming stock market.\n\nForty-percent of double haters in the USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll said the economy is the most important issue that will determine their vote, followed by immigration, 21%.\n\nMany double hates are wary of Biden's age − even though Trump, 78, isn't significantly younger − and convinced Biden has been weak and ineffective in office. But they have a fear factor with Trump − what they perceive as self-centeredness, the constant drama with his court cases, his controversial statements that echo dictators, and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\"I think Biden's been an abject failure,\" said Robert Brown, a 35-year-old from Minneapolis, who works in marketing and advertising. \"Trump's a piece of s---, too. Just to be real.\" Brown said he's leaning toward voting for Kennedy. \"He's a third option. How many times do we have to pick the lesser of two evils, right?\"\n\nPeter O'Connor, a 26-year-old student studying strategic communications at The Ohio State University, voted for Biden in 2020 and doesn't like Trump. He is considering a vote for Kennedy this year. \"I've heard a little bit about this Robert Kennedy guy. He sounds interesting to me,\" O'Connor said.\n\nJim Meikle, 80, from Albrightsville, Pa., called Trump \"an egotistical maniac\" who cares about himself, not the country. Still, he said he will likely vote for Trump again, like he did in 2016 and 2020, over Biden, who he criticized over migration at the southern border, pushing the expansion of electric vehicles and his administration's rocky military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.\n\n\"You know, it's really a shame. We've got a population of over 300 million people in this country, and this is the best that we can offer to be our president?\" said Meikle, an 80-year-old retired manager at a sheet metal plant.\n\nCan Biden win the double haters back?\n\nIn a troubling sign for Biden, 87% of the double-hater voters in the USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll said they believe the country is on the wrong track. Only 11% said they approve of Biden's job performance, compared to 41% who said they approved of the job Trump did as president from 2017 to 2021.\n\n\"If you're Biden, you have to say, 'Hey, your memory is wrong, his presidency was awful compared to mine,'\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"Or if you're Trump, you have to say, 'All of this boogeyman stuff against me, is unfounded. I was president for four years, the world didn't fall apart and people have pretty good impressions of what I did.'\"\n\nThis week, Biden started to embrace an age-old election question that Trump has posed: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\"\n\n“I hope everyone in the country takes a moment to think back what it was like in March of 2020 - COVID had come to America and Trump was president,\" Biden told supporters Wednesday at a fundraiser in Dallas. He described a period in which hospitals were overcrowded, nurses wore garbage bags for protection, unemployment soared to 14% and the stock market crashed.\n\nPaleologos said double-haters' fixation on the economy presents an opportunity for Biden, pointing to growing optimism among Americans that the economy has recovered from the pandemic. Thirty-three percent of registered voters now believe an economic recovery is underway, compared to a low of 9% in July 2022.\n\n\"To me, there's an opportunity for Biden to do something that Hillary Clinton was not able to do in 2016, which is to either make Trump more unfavorable,\" Paleologos said, or make inroads among double haters over the economy. \"The fact of the matter is if the economy continues to rebound, that's Joe Biden's economy.\"\n\nLake, who regularly conducts focus groups with likely voters, said the Biden campaign must first crystalize the choice before voters when it comes to Biden and Trump.\n\n\"Do you want someone who you think may be a little old or do you want someone who you think may be a little crazy? And God knows where he would take the country,\" Lake said of Trump.\n\nYet that contrast alone might not be enough. \"Right now, they're headed to third party,\" she said, arguing it puts the onus on Democrats for voters to understand that the third-party candidates \"are not viable, and they may not be who you think they are.\"\n\nData suggests the popularity of third-party candidates is often inflated when voters are given their names in a poll. It's also unclear how many states they will make it on the ballot.\n\nYet even if Kennedy, Stein and West don't match their current polling in November, they could be major factors in battleground states potentially decided by a few thousand votes or less.\n\nUltimately, whether Biden can win over double haters mulling a third-party vote could come down to their perceptions of the economy. Lake said they must connect how the president's policies have improved their outlook.\n\n\"These are downscale voters who need steady progress,\" Lake said. \"They need six months of good news. So the most important thing for them is going to be what's the economy in May and June. You tell me what their perceptions of the economy are in May and June, and I'll tell you where they're headed.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/07/16/chappaquiddick-ted-kennedy-caused-death-mary-jo-kopechne-50-years-ago/1742106001/", "title": "Chappaquiddick: Ted Kennedy caused death of Mary Jo Kopechne ...", "text": "Associated Press\n\nBOSTON — The crash ended a young woman's life, and with it, a man's White House dreams.\n\nU.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's Oldsmobile sedan veered off a narrow bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, an extension of the resort island of Martha's Vineyard off Massachusetts, and plunged into a moonlit pond 50 years ago Thursday. His passenger, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned.\n\nKennedy, 37, survived, but his presidential ambitions did not. The Massachusetts Democrat waited 10 hours to report the accident to police, and the \"whys?\" dogged him for the rest of his days.\n\nHalf a century later, what did and didn't happen on Chappaquiddick Island on July 18, 1969, continues to fascinate and frustrate.\n\nChappa-what?:Everything you should know about Ted Kennedy and Chappaquiddick\n\nChappaquiddick film:What it was like to vacation at the 'Kennedy house'\n\n\"Every time there's an anniversary, it's like it happened yesterday,\" Leslie Leland, who served as foreman of the grand jury that investigated, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from his home on the Vineyard.\n\nNow 79, Leland was a young pharmacist on the island when he was swept up in the aftermath. He recalls getting death threats and 24-hour police protection, and says he is still frustrated by the judge's refusal to subpoena anyone who was at the party or share key investigative documents — stymieing the grand jury's efforts to determine whether Kennedy had been drinking.\n\n\"If we'd been allowed to do our job, there would have been an indictment and a request to have a jury trial,\" he said. \"Justice wasn't served. There were so many discrepancies, but we weren't allowed to do our jobs to get to the truth — whatever the truth may have been.\n\n\"I was young, and I believed in the system. I believed everyone played by the same rules. I learned they don't.\"\n\nChappaquiddick:The story we knew was a classic American tragedy\n\nKennedy was driving after a party when his car flipped into the chilly waters, trapping Kopechne inside. She had been a campaign worker for Kennedy's brother, Robert, who was assassinated the previous year in Los Angeles during California's Democratic presidential primary.\n\nKennedy, who managed to free himself from the submerged vehicle, said he tried in vain to rescue Kopechne. He later described his failure to report the accident to police for 10 hours as \"indefensible,\" attributing the delay to exhaustion, shock and a concussion.\n\nThe nation, too, was shocked. But it was also distracted by the historic Apollo 11 moon landing, which eclipsed news coverage. Kennedy, who insisted he hadn't been drinking, pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and received a suspended sentence of two months in jail. He was never indicted.\n\nFor Kopechne's family, bitterness has given way to a desire to honor her memory by telling her story and awarding scholarships in her name to bright young students, said William Nelson, a cousin born three years after she died. Kopechne's father died in 2003; her mother died in 2007.\n\n\"We've shifted into trying to have Mary Jo's life mean something,\" said Nelson, of Slatington, Pennsylvania. \"She was kind of glossed over as the girl in the car. It was all about Ted Kennedy. She would have gone on to do great things.\"\n\nKopechne's commitment to civil rights drew her to Robert Kennedy's campaign. Relatives believe she would have pursued more activism and perhaps a political career of her own.\n\n\"Mary Jo was ahead of her time for women in 1969, so I'm pretty sure she would have pioneered a new path for women in Washington,\" Nelson said. \"The true tragedy of that night in Chappaquiddick is she never got that chance.\"\n\nAnd what of Kennedy's own legacy?\n\nWere it not for Chappaquiddick, Kennedy may well have been the Democrat who denied Richard Nixon a second term in 1972. But he didn't dare run then, and a later presidential campaign in 1980 fizzled.\n\n\"The phenomenon of the personal becoming political began with Chappaquiddick,\" said Patrick Maney, a Kennedy expert and professor of political science at Boston College. \"There was something different in American politics after Chappaquiddick than there was before.\"\n\nEven so, Kennedy went on to serve another four decades in the Senate, where he was one of the nation's longest serving and most influential legislators of the 20th century, securing his place in the pantheon of American politics.\n\nIn \"True Compass,\" a memoir published shortly after his 2009 death, Kennedy called Chappaquiddick \"a horrible tragedy that haunts me every day of my life.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, nothing is planned to mark Thursday's anniversary at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, erected in his memory in the shadow of the John F.

The capsule's first crewed flight, called the Crew Flight Test or CFT, is tasked with taking astronauts Barry Wilmore and Suni Williams on a short-duration mission to the ISS.\n\n\"I wouldn't go indict anything on NASA or the Boeing safety process because we have these late findings. It's just now we're getting to the reviews of some systems,\" Stich said. \"I'm seeing us find things and make changes to the vehicle and do additional testing and engineering where we need to, and that's what's required to go fly safely.\"\n\nThe second problem found last week is more extensive since the tape used to protect Starliner's wiring harnesses from nicks or abrasions runs for hundreds of feet through several of the spacecraft's internal systems.\n\n\"There is a lot of tape on the wire harnesses,\" Nappi said. \"We're looking at solutions that would provide for potentially another type of wrapping over the existing tape in the most vulnerable areas that reduces the risk of a fire hazard.\"\n\nAlongside the new safety issues, Boeing teams also found a faulty valve that had to be replaced prior to loading propellants on the vehicle, which was slated to happen in the next few weeks to make a targeted July 21 liftoff of CFT aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.\n\nInstead, Boeing teams are now standing down from all launch preparations.\n\nThis latest months-long delay comes after a decision last March to shuffle the Crew Flight Test to the summer to give NASA more time to certify 330 requirements for Starliner to fly humans. The same requirements applied to SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which NASA also selected to take astronauts to the ISS after the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. Both companies were selected for multibillion-dollar contracts nearly a decade ago; Boeing received $4.2 billion while SpaceX was awarded $2.6 billion for Crew Dragon.\n\nSpace Force news:In major move, Space Force selects Space Coast for STARCOM headquarters\n\nSpaceX private mission:Splashdown wraps up record-setting SpaceX mission to ISS\n\nThe investment paid off in SpaceX's case when the company first launched Crew Dragon with two astronauts in May 2020. Since then, the company has flown seven crewed missions to the space station for NASA, two private missions for Axiom Space, and one privately crewed mission to orbit.\n\nStarliner has only launched twice on uncrewed demonstration missions, the first of which in late 2019 failed to reach a proper orbit and required an emergency landing.\n\n\"Our ultimate goal is to have one SpaceX and one Boeing flight per year to rotate our crews to station, and so we support Boeing,\" Stich said. \"We're doing everything we can during the investigation of each of these issues and trying to get to flight as soon as we can when it's safe to do so.\"\n\nAccording to Stich, the next opportunity to launch Boeing's mission won't be until later this fall, but that hinges on Boeing being able to rectify the issues in time to obtain certification from NASA to support crewed flight.\n\n\"You could say we're disappointed because it means a delay, but the team is proud that we're making the right choices,\" Nappi said. \"Bottom line here: safety is always our top priority. It's always been that way with human spaceflight; that drives this decision.\"\n\nFor the latest, visit floridatoday.com/launchschedule.\n\nContact Jamie Groh at JGroh@floridatoday.com and follow her on Twitter at @AlteredJamie.\n\nSpace is important to us and that's why we're working to bring you top coverage of the industry and Florida launches.

But Starliner will have to wait a little longer to prove it is safe to fly NASA astronauts to the space station.\n\nOn Monday, after thunderstorms passed through the area, Boeing engineers re-tested some systems which is standard protocol when lightning strikes near the launch complex. That's when the team detected Starliner's propulsion system valves were malfunctioning.\n\nBecause it is common to work issues during a countdown, the teams commenced with fueling on Tuesday but ultimately halted the launch because some of the propulsion system valves were still not operating correctly.\n\nBoeing teams have already run several tests and ruled out a number of potential causes, including software. Boeing said the storms appears to be an unlikely cause, but they will inspect for water or electrical damage while the spacecraft is in the VIF.\n\nTo make matters worse, now Boeing is under a time crunch due to scheduling conflicts at the space station and at the launch site.\n\nIf teams can determine the cause of the issue and resolve it quickly, there’s still a slim chance it could launch on Saturday or Sunday.\n\nBut if it’s a bigger problem or engineers can't access the components in the VIF, then the spacecraft will need to be removed from atop its Atlas V booster and returned to Boeing’s facility at Kennedy Space Center. That could delay the launch a couple weeks or even months.\n\nFor starters, SpaceX is slated to launch its next cargo resupply mission the space station on Aug. 29 and it needs an open docking port so Starliner would have to launch to the station and depart before then or wait until after SpaceX is slated to leave the station on Sept. 29.\n\nBut then things get busy for United Launch Alliance, which is set to launch NASA’s asteroid mission in early October and needs time to prepare and stack the Atlas V rocket.\n\nRegardless of the time pressure, Boeing says it will not launch until the team is ready.\n\n“We’re going to let the data lead our work,” Vollmer said. “Our team has worked diligently to ensure the safety and success of this mission, and we will not launch until our vehicle is performing nominally and our teams are confident it is ready to fly.”\n\nContact Rachael Joy Nail at 321-242-3577.

After two prior attempts to complete such a mission failed, Boeing’s goal is to prove the spacecraft can dock with the ISS. It must succeed before it can move on to missions with people on board.\n\nThe spacecraft took to the skies at 6:54 pm ET Thursday, riding atop an Atlas V rocket that launched from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. After the rocket delivered the capsule into orbit, the spacecraft fired up its own thrusters to orient it in the right direction. Boeing officials confirmed the Starliner’s “orbital insertion” — a sign the spacecraft is on the right path — about half an hour after liftoff.\n\nBut during a post-launch briefing, officials revealed that the thrusters didn’t work exactly as intended.\n\n“We had two to thrusters fail,” Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing’s Starliner program, said. “The first one that fired, it fired for a second and then it shut down. The flight control system did was what it’s supposed to, and it turned it over to the second thruster.”\n\nThat thruster then fired for only about 25 seconds before shutting down, according to Nappi. The flight control system again took over and kicked on a third thruster, which fired as intended.\n\n“The system is designed to be redundant and it preformed like it was supposed to,” Nappi told reporters Thursday night.\n\nThe issue is not expected to impact the overall mission, Nappi said.\n\nOn board this flight are some supplies for the astronauts already on board the ISS as well as a spacesuit-clad mannequin, named Rosie, after the World War II-era Rosie the Riveter.\n\nStarliner has proven a difficult program for Boeing, which originally hoped the spacecraft would be operational in 2017 but has been plagued by delays and development hangups. The first attempt of this test flight, called OFT-1, in 2019 was cut short because of an issue with the Starliner’s onboard clock. The error caused the thrusters onboard the capsule to misfire, knocking it off course, and officials decided to bring the spacecraft back home rather than continue the mission. It took more than a year to root out that issue and a series of other software problems.\n\nMore recently, the Starliner has been beleaguered by valve issues. When the spacecraft was rolled out to the launch pad in August of 2021, a pre-flight check revealed that key valves had been stuck in place, and engineers weren’t able to immediately troubleshoot the issue.\n\nEventually the capsule had to be rolled back from the launch pad. When engineers were not able to fix it at the site, it ultimately had to be taken all the way back to Boeing’s factory for more thorough troubleshooting.\n\nThe valves have since become an ongoing source of contention for the company. According to a recent report from Reuters, the subcontractor that manufactures the valves, Alabama-based Aerojet Rocketdyne, has been at odds with Boeing over the root cause of the valve issue.\n\nBoeing and NASA disagree, according to the report and comments from NASA officials during recent press conferences.\n\nTheir investigation pointed to moisture getting into the valves and causing “corrosion” and “binding,” Boeing vice president and Starliner program manager, Mark Nappi, said at a press conference last week. That led the company to devise a short-term solution, creating a purge system, which involves a small bag, designed to keep out corrosion-causing moisture. NASA and Boeing say they’re comfortable with this solution.\n\n“We’re in really good shape to go fly that system,” NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich said last week.\n\nBut that may not be the end of it. Boeing revealed last week that it may ultimately have to redesign the valves.\n\n“There’s a little bit of additional testing that we want to go do, and based on those results, we’ll solidify what kind of changes we’ll make in the future,” Nappi said. “We’ll probably know more in the coming months.”\n\nIf Boeing does move forward with a more extensive redesign of the valves, it’s not clear how long that would take or if it could further delay Boeing’s first astronaut mission, which, at this point, is years behind schedule. The hangups with Starliner have also cost the company about half a billion dollars, according to public documents.\n\nMeanwhile, SpaceX, once thought to be the underdog competitor in NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, has already launched five astronaut missions for NASA as well as two tourism missions.

As of August, NASA had spent $11.9 billion on the heavy-lift launch system and Orion spacecraft designed to catapult humans beyond low-Earth orbit and into deep space.\n\n\"At its current rate, we project Boeing will expend at least $8.9 billion through 2021 —double the amount initially planned — while delivery of the first Core Stage has slipped 2 1⁄2 years from June 2017 to December 2019 and may slip further,\" auditors said. \"Cost increases and schedule delays of Core Stage development can be traced largely to management, technical, and infrastructure issues driven by Boeing’s poor performance.\"\n\nSeveral of those issues have contributed to the $4 billion cost overrun and delay in delivery of the rocket stages, including:\n\nBoeing's underestimation of the scope of the work and a lack of well-staffed teams.\n\nHardware required for second stage testing is two years behind schedule.\n\nEquipment-related issues and extreme weather events.\n\n\"Furthermore, Boeing’s cost and schedule challenges are likely to worsen given that the SLS has yet to undergo its 'Green Run Test' — a major milestone that integrates and tests the Core Stage components,\" the report reads.\n\nThe OIG reported that several \"poor management practices by NASA\" helped contribute to the overruns, including:\n\nThe agency lacks visibility into Boeing's costs because all its SLS-related activities were combined into one contract line. This means NASA cannot extrapolate the cost of a single core stage.\n\nFlaws in NASA's evaluation of Boeing's performance, which was at times deemed \"excellent\" and \"very good.\"\n\n$321 million in expenditures that were not authorized through proper channels.\n\nNASA estimates it takes 52 months to procure a single core stage, jeopardizing the viability of future missions. To date, the agency has only ordered two core stages due to delays and overruns, meaning missions beyond the first two might be at risk.\n\nMoving forward, the OIG said, NASA could pursue sustainability in the program by following seven recommendations. NASA agreed with all but one.\n\n\"NASA had already recognized the opportunity to improve contract performance management in this large-scale program prior to this OIG's audit,\" the response reads. \"The OIG draft report is a fair assessment of NASA's management of the SLS Core Stages contract and of associated challenges, and the OIG's recommendations are consistent with the work NASA has underway.\"\n\n[ULA CEO Tory Bruno: No other rocket company consistently makes money]\n\n[How SpaceX found itself in the crosshairs of an SEC lawsuit]\n\nTalking to reporters last week, John Shannon, Boeing vice president and manager of SLS development, said the program has been funded differently than the Apollo moon program's storied Saturn V rockets.\n\nInstead of a big funding spike early on that fell off as the rocket’s design was completed, SLS has had relatively flat annual funding of roughly $2 billion. As a result, the first rocket to fly will be the very first one built, something Shannon said was “a little bit unprecedented” and has slowed down work on the first core stage.\n\n“What that means is that you have to pay extremely close attention to any first-time issues and make sure that you resolve them completely before you proceed,” he said. “I would say we underestimated that somewhat.”\n\nShannon acknowledged some missteps early on, but said lessons learned from the first SLS core stage would result in the next stages being built faster and more affordably.\n\nHe noted a $400 million “variance” over the planned cost of the first two core stages.\n\n“But over a five-year period, that’s probably not unexpected,” he said.\n\nNASA's Office of Inspector General is tasked with investigating instances of potential fraud, waste and abuse of programs that impact the agency.\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715.

As of about 9 p.m. EST Monday, the company estimated that the spacecraft could continue for another 40 hours “based on current fuel consumption” before losing power.\n\nNASA science equipment, human remains, aboard lander\n\nPeregrine was carrying 20 payloads from seven nations and 16 commercial customers, including space agencies like NASA, universities, companies and others.\n\nAmong the cargo was a payload of human remains bound for a lunar burial, which drew objects from the Navajo Nation.\n\nThe flight's failure is a setback for NASA, which had financed the mission in a vital step toward its goal of putting astronauts back on the moon for the first time since the last Apollo mission in 1972.\n\nNASA spent tens of millions of dollars for a spot for its scientific cargo on the spacecraft, which represents the debut of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program (CLPS). With a budget of $2.6 billion in contracts available through 2028, the program will see NASA more often partnering with private companies to help place scientific payloads on the lunar surface.\n\nFor the Peregrine mission, NASA's payload included a variety of scientific instruments aboard the lander meant to conduct experiments and studies of the lunar surface and its atmosphere. The findings would have proved crucial in helping the space agency search for evidence of water and other resources that would support human exploration of the moon as part of its Artemis program.\n\nBy the end of the year, the space agency hopes to send a group of spacefarers on a 10-day trip circumnavigating the moon – but not touching down – as part of Artemis II. The mission would pave the way for another group of astronauts who in the coming years NASA hopes will land on the lunar surface itself.\n\n\"Spaceflight is a daring adventure, and Astrobotic is making progress for CLPS deliveries and Artemis,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson posted on X after news of the propulsion failure came to light. \"NASA will continue to expand our reach in the cosmos with our commercial partners.\"\n\nWhat's next for NASA?\n\nFortunately for NASA, Astrobotic is just one private American company racing to get the U.S. back on the moon this year.\n\nHouston’s Intuitive Machines, the second company with lunar ambitions, aims to launch a lander in mid-February aboard a flight with SpaceX with NASA funding.\n\nThe space agency also says copies of four of the NASA payloads aboard Peregrine are expected to fly on future flights.\n\nAstrobotic itself has a contract for another lunar mission with a targeted launch at the end of the year. The Griffin, the largest lunar lander since the Apollo lunar module, will carry NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) to the moon's south pole, where it will search for water ice.\n\n“There are many challenges with spaceflight, and we’re incredibly proud of the Astrobotic and NASA teams that have put us one step closer to a robotic return to the lunar surface as part of Artemis,\" Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration at NASA, said in a statement. \"This delivery service model is a first for the agency and with something new, there is a higher risk.”\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

He, in fact, cannot continue with impunity to talk about the use of a tactical nuclear weapon as if that’s a rational thing to do,” Biden said, before warning of dangerous consequences of such a move.\n\n“The mistakes get made, the miscalculation could occur, no one could be sure what would happen and it could end in Armageddon,” he said, again stressing that a nuclear blast that kills thousands of people could lead to events barreling way out of control.\n\nThe danger of escalation\n\nBiden is stating the fear of some strategists who warn about a ladder of escalation that could occur if a nuclear bomb is used and triggers reprisals by the West – even though any initial US response would certainly go no further than conventional military action.\n\nHe also appears to be trying to create a narrative of deterrence around the specific situation in Ukraine. The logic of the US and Russia’s long-range strategic nuclear arsenals is that the use of them is deterred because a conflict would be suicidal for both sides. That equation does not exist in Ukraine, since the country has no nuclear arsenal and it’s hard to conclude that it represents a vital national interest that would lead Washington to respond in kind to Putin going nuclear. By stressing that even a tactical device – which could be small enough to destroy an airbase or large enough to reduce a city to ruins – could lead to something worse, Biden seems to be almost seeking to create a new chain of calculations in Putin’s mind.\n\nTwo moments in Tapper’s interview brought home the burden now borne by the man who is followed everywhere he goes by a military officer carrying the nation’s nuclear codes.\n\nFirst the CNN anchor asked the President to state the US red line for the US and NATO in Ukraine and what Washington would do if Putin bombed a nuclear plant in Ukraine or set off a tactical nuclear weapon.\n\n“It would be irresponsible for me to talk about what we would or wouldn’t do,” Biden said.\n\nThen, Tapper prodded the President over whether the Pentagon had gamed out scenarios. Biden soberly replied: “The Pentagon didn’t have to be asked.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch the full exclusive interview with President Joe Biden 15:20 - Source: CNN\n\nExpert: nuclear use in Ukraine still ‘not a probable event’\n\nMost experts and strategists estimate that there are many reasons why Putin would stop short of using a nuclear weapon – among them the possible risk of radioactive fallout crossing into Russia or the fact that the use of a tactical nuclear weapon may not actually be a sensible strategic option in the war.\n\nBut the fact he’s pushed himself into a corner, along with his obliviousness to civilian loss of life underscored again by his callous assaults on Ukrainian cities this week, suggests that a humanitarian impulse is unlikely to be part of his calculation. And Biden himself said in the interview that while he believed Putin was a “rational actor,” he had made significant miscalculations and his objectives were not rational. That leaves open the possibility of even more decisions that appear irrational to the West but may seem reasonable in Putin’s warped logic.\n\nThat is why Biden and experts who have dedicated their careers to staving off a nuclear apocalypse say the possibility that Putin may go nuclear must be taken so seriously – even if the chances remain very low and the US would likely be able to detect well ahead of time if Russia’s atomic devices were on the move.\n\n“It’s not a probable event. It’s not even likely,” said Joseph Cirincione, a nuclear non-proliferation expert and former president of the Plowshares Fund, said on CNN’s “Newsroom” on Tuesday.\n\n“But this is a low probability, high consequence event. If he uses even one nuclear weapon, he’s bringing us into a whole new world. He’s causing massive damage. And he’s running the risk of escalation with exchanges from the West that could lead to further exchanges, et cetera.”\n\nCirincione explained that even if Putin’s saber rattling represented a political threat designed to scare the West, it cannot be discounted.\n\n“He has the means. He has the doctrine that allows him to use it. And he has the motive. He is losing this war. He has to do something to try to turn the tide of battle in desperation. He might turn to a nuclear weapon.”\n\nWhile some critics have faulted the President for mentioning words like “Armageddon” and comparing his rhetoric to that of Putin, the motivations of the two men are very different. At a minimum, the Russian leader is boasting about nuclear weapons to scare the world. Biden is speaking publicly to stave off the possibility of disaster.\n\nBiden doesn’t rule out meeting Putin over basketball star\n\nOne reason the war in Ukraine is so dangerous is that nearly eight months in, there remains no prospect of any genuine diplomatic process that could defuse it. Ukraine’s forces, using US and allied weapons systems, are making remarkable progress on the battlefield and are determined to repel an unprovoked invasion that has caused carnage and extensive destruction. Putin has thrown so much personal prestige and Russian blood into the war he can hardly afford any outcome he cannot spin as a win, despite his autocratic grip on Russia.\n\nBiden signaled in the Tapper interview that he saw no real rationale to meet Putin when both leaders are expected to be at the G20 summit in Indonesia next month. But he did leave one intriguing door open to the Russian leader, saying he’d sit down with Putin if he were willing to discuss the fate of US basketball star Brittney Griner, who was sentenced in August to nine years in prison after pleading guilty to drugs smuggling. The US says Griner and another American, former US Marine Paul Whelan, have been wrongfully detained. Washington has offered to swap jailed Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout for the two Americans.\n\n“Look, I have no intention of meeting with him, but look, if he came to me at the G20 and said, ‘I want to talk about the release of Griner,’ I would meet with him, but that would depend,” Biden said.\n\nThe President also downplayed the idea that more generally there was anything to talk about.\n\n“He’s acted brutally, I think he’s committed war crimes, and so I don’t… see any rationale to meet with him now.”", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/11/politics/joe-biden-warning-chemical-weapons/index.html", "title": "Biden warns Russia will pay a 'severe price' if it uses chemical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden warned on Friday that Russia will pay a “severe price” if the country uses chemical weapons in Ukraine.\n\n“I’m not going to speak about the intelligence, but Russia will pay a severe price if they use chemicals,” Biden told CNN’s Arlette Saenz following remarks announcing further economic moves against Russia.\n\nWhile the US has so far not presented any evidence that Russia plans to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, the White House – most notably, press secretary Jen Psaki – has warned that the weapons could be used in the conflict.\n\nRussia could use chemical weapons in Ukraine or manufacture a “false flag” operation that uses them, Psaki said Wednesday. The press secretary, slamming what she called false claims from Russia that the US is developing chemical weapons in Ukraine, tweeted, “Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propaganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them. It’s a clear pattern.”\n\nShe also noted Russia’s “long and well-documented track record of using chemical weapons” as well as its pattern of “accusing the West of the very violations that Russia itself is perpetrating.”\n\nThe US government has previously found that the Russian government used chemical weapons in both the 2020 poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny and in 2018 against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in England. Both determinations by the US led to sanctions under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act, which requires the President to impose economic and diplomatic sanctions if a country is found to have used chemical weapons. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned earlier this year of the possibility of Russia carrying out a fake or real chemical weapons attack as a manufactured pretext for an invasion into Ukraine. But his comments came before Russia’s full invasion began.\n\nAdditionally, the US has said that Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, whose regime is supported by Russia, has used chemical weapons on its people dozens of times during the war there.\n\nWhen asked about her tweets at Thursday’s press briefing, Psaki declined to speculate on hypotheticals regarding the US response if Russia were to use chemical weapons in Ukraine.\n\n“Well, they have a large biological and chemical weapons program. So it’s a pattern, but they also have the capacity. While I’m not going to get into specific intelligence, we look at all of those factors,” Psaki told reporters.\n\nShe continued, “So the objective (of the tweets) was to make clear the inaccuracy of the information and the misinformation they’re trying to put out and make clear to the world that they not only have the capacity, they have a history of using chemical and biological weapons, and that in this moment, we should have our eyes open for that possibility.”\n\nShe declined to speculate on whether there is any sign of imminent use of chemical weapons by Russia in Ukraine.\n\nPressed by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on whether there will be a military response from the US if Russia were to conduct a chemical weapons attack, Psaki said the current US posture has not changed.\n\n“I’m not going to get into hypotheticals. What we’re saying right now is they have the capacity and the capabilities. I’m also not going to get into intelligence. But the President’s intention of sending US military to fight in Ukraine against Russia has not changed,” she said.\n\nBiden emphasized later Friday that the US will not send ground troops into Ukraine.\n\n“We will not fight the third world war in Ukraine,” Biden said during a speech in Philadelphia to the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nHe added, “I want to be clear though, we are going to make sure that Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves of an invading Russian force. And we will send money and food aid to save Ukrainians lives. We’re going to welcome Ukrainian refugees with open arms if in fact they come all the way here.”\n\nDuring the speech, Biden also thanked Democratic House members for their support of Ukraine, noting he spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday for about an hour. Biden added that he speaks to the Ukrainian President “almost daily.” Biden stressed how important it is that the US and its allies move together on any moves to counteract the Kremlin.\n\n“I know I’ve occasionally frustrated you, but more important than us moving when we want to is making sure all of NATO is together, is together – they have different vulnerabilities than we do,” Biden said.\n\nWhite House stops short of saying Russia is committing war crimes\n\nThe White House said Friday that there are “strong indications” that Russia is committing war crimes in Ukraine, stopping short of a declaration, which legally requires an investigation before such an assessment can be made.\n\n“We have all seen the devastating images coming out of Ukraine and are appalled by Russia’s brutal tactics. Pregnant women on stretchers, apartment buildings shelled, families killed while seeking safety from this terrible violence. We are also seeing reports of other types of potential abuses, including sexual and gender-based violence,” White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nHe added, “These are disgusting attacks. Civilian casualties are increasing. If Russia is intentionally targeting civilians, that would be a war crime. And as we are all seeing on live television, evidence is mounting and we are documenting it as it takes place. There are strong indications that this is occurring and that the heinous way Russia is prosecuting this war will result in war crimes.”\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield became the highest-ranking US official to say that actions committed by Russia against the Ukrainian people constitute war crimes, telling the BBC Thursday, “They constitute war crimes; there are attacks on civilians that cannot be justified by any – in any way whatsoever.”\n\nOther Biden administration officials have not gone as far as to declare outright that Russia has committed war crimes – violations of international laws of armed conflict – and instead have pointed to “credible reports” that such crimes have been carried out and their support for investigations into Moscow’s actions.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Thursday referenced “atrocities” committed by the Russians and said that the UN should investigate the allegations of Russian war crimes. On Friday, Harris said, “We are clear that any intentional attack or targeting of civilians is a war crime. Period.”\n\nBates said the US supports the human rights activists, civil society and independent media documenting, collecting and exposing evidence of possible war crimes, human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law.\n\nThe US will share that evidence with allies and partners and will “support accountability” with every tool available, “including prosecutions when appropriate,” Bates said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Sam Fossum Betsy Klein", "Sam Fossum", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/23/politics/biden-taiwan-china-japan-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Biden says US would respond 'militarily' if China attacked Taiwan ...", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Monday that the United States would intervene militarily if China attempts to take Taiwan by force, a warning that appeared to deviate from the deliberate ambiguity traditionally held by Washington.\n\nThe White House quickly downplayed the comments, saying they don’t reflect a change in US policy. It’s the third time in recent months – including during a CNN town hall in October – that Biden has said the US would protect Taiwan from a Chinese attack, only to have the White House walk back those remarks.\n\nDuring a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo, Biden was asked if the US would be willing to go further to help Taiwan in the event of an invasion than it did with Ukraine.\n\n“You didn’t want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?” a reporter asked.\n\n“Yes,” Biden replied. “That’s the commitment we made.”\n\n“We agree with the One China policy. We signed on to it, and all the attendant agreements made from there, but the idea that it can be taken by force, just taken by force, is (just not) appropriate,” he said.\n\nUnder the “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the self-governing island of 23 million. The US provides Taiwan defensive weapons, but has remained intentionally ambiguous on whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden's balancing act amid tensions between mainland China and Taiwan 02:41 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden’s strong warning was made right on China’s doorstep during his first trip to Asia as President. The visit is aimed at uniting allies and partners to counter China’s rising influence. It also came a day before Biden is scheduled to attend the second in-person summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) – an informal grouping between the US, Japan, Australia and India that has alarmed Beijing.\n\nSeveral of Biden’s top administration officials were caught off-guard by the remarks, several aides told CNN, adding that they were not expecting Biden to be so unequivocal.\n\nIn a statement following Biden’s comments, a White House official said the US’ official position remained unchanged.\n\n“As the President said, our policy has not changed. He reiterated our One China policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself,” the official said.\n\nWithin hours, China had expressed its “strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition” to Biden’s comments, saying it will not allow any external force to interfere in its “internal affairs.”\n\n“On issues concerning China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and other core interests, there is no room for compromise,” said Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.\n\n“We urged the US side to earnestly follow the One China principle … be cautious in words and deeds on the Taiwan issue, and not send any wrong signal to pro-Taiwan independence and separatist forces — so it won’t cause serious damage to the situation across the Taiwan Strait and China-US relations.”\n\nChina’s Taiwan Affairs Office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian added, “We urge the US to stop saying or doing anything in violation of the one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués. … Those who play with fire will certainly burn themselves.”\n\nTaiwan lies fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) off the coast of China. For more than 70 years the two sides have been governed separately, but that hasn’t stopped China’s ruling Communist Party from claiming the island as its own — despite having never controlled it.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping has said that “reunification” between China and Taiwan is inevitable and refused to rule out the use of force. Tensions between Beijing and Taipei are at the highest they’ve been in recent decades, with the Chinese military sending record numbers of war planes near the island.\n\nJoanne Ou, a spokesperson for Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN that it “expresses sincere welcome and gratitude to President Biden and the United States government for reiterating its rock solid commitment to Taiwan.”\n\nBiden compares potential invasion of Taiwan to Ukraine war\n\nBiden on Monday compared a potential invasion of Taiwan by China to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, warning, “It will dislocate the entire region,” and emphasizing “Russia has to pay a long-term price for its actions.”\n\n“And the reason I bother to say this, not just about Ukraine – if, in fact, after all (Russian President Vladimir Putin has) done, there’s a rapprochement … between the Ukrainians and Russia, and these sanctions are not continued to be sustained in many ways, then what signal does that send to China about the cost of attempting, attempting to take Taiwan by force?”\n\nBiden said that China is “already flirting with danger right now by flying so close and all the maneuvers they’re undertaking.”\n\n“But the United States is committed, we made a commitment, we support the One China policy, we support all we’ve done in the past, but that does not mean, it does not mean that China has the ability, has the, excuse me, jurisdiction to go in and use force to take over Taiwan,” he added.\n\nAt the press conference, Kishida also reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.\n\n“Attempts to change the status quo by force, like Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, should never be tolerated in the Indo-Pacific, above all, in East Asia,” he said.\n\n“As the regional security environment becomes increasingly severe, I reaffirmed with President Biden that we need to speedily strengthen the deterrence and response of the Japan-US alliance,” he said, adding that he conveyed his determination to “fundamentally strengthen Japan’s defense capability.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and reaction.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Donald Judd Nectar Gan", "Kevin Liptak", "Donald Judd", "Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/23/politics/us-russia-ukraine-nuclear-weapons/index.html", "title": "US has privately warned Russia against using nuclear weapons in ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe US has privately communicated to Russia for the past several months that there will be consequences if Moscow chooses to use a nuclear weapon in the Ukraine war, according to US officials.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how or when the warnings were sent. The State Department was involved, according to one official. The Biden administration has also leaned heavily on intelligence channels to communicate sensitive messages to Moscow throughout the buildup and prosecution of Russia’s war in Ukraine, including recently in the negotiations over wrongfully detained Americans.\n\nThe warnings, first reported by The Washington Post, come as Russian President Vladimir Putin has once again threatened to turn to nuclear weapons amid a series of embarrassing setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine. In a speech on Wednesday, he warned that, “In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff.”\n\nUS officials have emphasized that this is not the first time Putin has threatened to turn to nuclear weapons since the start of his invasion of Ukraine in February, although some analysts have seen this threat as more specific and escalatory than the Russian president’s past rhetoric.\n\nThe US has also sought to deter Russia from using a nuclear weapon in public warnings in the past and have made the issue a theme of remarks at the UN General Assembly this week in New York. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday said Russia’s “reckless nuclear threats must stop immediately.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden, appearing on CBS’s “60 Minutes” last week, said his message to Putin should he be considering the use of nuclear weapons was: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.”\n\nThe US reaction would be “consequential” but would depend “on the extent of what they do,” Biden said, without providing further details.\n\nFor now, top CIA officials have said publicly that they have seen no signs that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons. But some military analysts have been concerned that Russia may seek to use a so-called tactical, or battlefield, nuclear weapon in response to its poor showing in Ukraine — a tactic sometimes called “escalate to deescalate.” Intelligence officials believe Putin would likely only turn to that option if he felt Russia or his regime were existentially endangered, and it’s not clear if he would feel that losing his war in Ukraine would fit that description.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis Oren Liebermann Kylie Atwood", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Oren Liebermann", "Kylie Atwood"], "publish_date": "2022/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/politics/russia-us-diplomatic-note/index.html", "title": "Russia formally protests US weapons shipments to Ukraine | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia this week formally protested the US’ ongoing shipment of weapons to Ukraine, sending a diplomatic note to the State Department warning of “unpredictable consequences” should the support continue, according to two US officials and another source familiar with the document.\n\nThe note, known as a demarche, was sent earlier this week as the US was preparing to announce that it would be sending an additional $800 million military aid package to Ukraine. The Washington Post first reported on the document.\n\nThe US has for the first time agreed to provide Kyiv with the types of high-power capabilities some Biden administration officials a few short weeks ago viewed as too great of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago, including 11 Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzer cannons and 300 more Switchblade drones.\n\nA source familiar with the Russian diplomatic note said it was expected that Moscow would protest the shipments, and it was still unclear whether it means Russia will change its behavior in any way. But this person acknowledged that the note could signal a more aggressive Russian posture against the US and NATO as the war drags on.\n\nOne administration official told CNN the Russian notice indicates how effective the US weapons shipments to Ukraine have been. The official suggested the Russians were also concerned by the latest announcement, which includes more sophisticated and heavier duty weaponry.\n\nSome Biden administration officials believe that the diplomatic note shows the Russians are hurting, a senior administration official said. This official said the Russians would not have sent that message if they felt they were in a strong place on the battlefield.\n\nCNN previously reported that the United States believes Russian President Vladimir Putin’s risk tolerance has increased, and that he may be willing to take more aggressive action against the US in response to its support for Ukraine.\n\nAsked for comment, a separate US official said, “We won’t confirm any private diplomatic correspondence. What we can confirm is that, along with Allies and partners, we are providing Ukraine with billions of dollars worth of security assistance, which our Ukrainian partners are using to extraordinary effect to defend their country against Russia’s unprovoked aggression and horrific acts of violence.”\n\nThe first flight from the US of the $800 million in new aid for Ukraine is expected to arrive in the region in the next 24 hours, according to a senior defense official. The official said the material will be picked up at the border by Ukrainians and taken into the country. The manifest is not being disclosed.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has for months been pleading with the West for heavier equipment in order to effectively fight off the Russians, who invaded Ukraine on February 24.

Pentagon officials met with defense contractors this week to discuss how to increase production of the kinds of systems and weapons that Ukraine will need to continue fighting.\n\n“This [meeting] was really focused on the kind of systems and weapons that have been relevant in the Ukraine war,” Kirby said on Wednesday, as well as “the possibility for accelerating some of those production lines and expanding based on the heavy draw on our inventory.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Evan Perez Kylie Atwood Kaitlan Collins", "Natasha Bertrand", "Evan Perez", "Kylie Atwood", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/politics/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-armageddon-analysis/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Biden's chilling 'Armageddon' warning sharpens the stakes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTo learn that an American president is talking so frankly about the possibility of nuclear “Armageddon,” as Joe Biden did Thursday, is bone chilling.\n\nIt’s also a commentary on the grave uncertainty over how Russian President Vladimir Putin, a self-styled strongman, might react to the increasing possibility of defeat in Ukraine in a war to which he has nailed his political survival.\n\nBiden’s remarks, at a fundraising event in New York, could open him to criticism by political opponents that he is speaking in an inartful way about nuclear war – and at a political fundraiser of all places. But they are paradoxically also a little reassuring because they reveal a president who is deeply conscious of the risks of escalation with the volatile Kremlin leader.\n\nAnd whether they were meant for public consumption or not, his comments will have the effect of signaling to Putin that any use of nuclear arms – even a smaller battlefield device – could create a cascade of consequences that could lead to global disaster. In other words, Biden may be reasserting a measure of deterrence after Putin warned that he was not bluffing over his threat to possibly use a nuclear bomb.\n\nBut Biden’s comments also show that, in one way at least, Putin’s nuclear threats have worked: They have left his adversaries unsure how he might behave.\n\nBiden told Democratic donors that the world had arrived at a dangerous moment.\n\n“(For the) first time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have a direct threat of the use (of a) nuclear weapon if, in fact, things continue down the path they are going,” Biden said.\n\n“We’ve got a guy I know fairly well,” Biden said of Putin.\n\n“He’s not joking when he talks about potential use of tactical nuclear weapons or biological or chemical weapons because his military is, you might say, significantly underperforming.”\n\nUS officials are concerned that Putin might consider the use of a smaller tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine in a desperate attempt to turn the course of the war. The White House says it has warned the Kremlin that such a decision would be “catastrophic” for Russia but has not said publicly exactly how they would respond – though there is speculation NATO might get involved and directly target Russian forces, a scenario that could lead to a dangerous escalation with Moscow.\n\nUS officials have also said, however, that they have detected no sign that Russia is moving or readying any of its tactical nuclear weapons, which can be small enough to target soldier formations or big enough to destroy a city. A US official told CNN’s Jeremy Diamond on Friday that Biden was speaking “frankly” following Putin’s “irresponsible and reckless” rhetoric but that his comments were not based on any new information about Russia’s nuclear posture. There has also been no shift in the US nuclear posture, the official said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ex-US defense secretary says in unlikely event that Putin resorts to nukes, he could use this weapon 02:08 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden’s burden\n\nBiden’s comments on Thursday underscore the burden that he now shoulders since the first president since the end of the Cold War more than 30 years ago who faces the frightening reality that nuclear war with Moscow is possible. At least once, during the decades-long standoff between the US and the Soviet Union, Armageddon could have been triggered accidentally, historical accounts show. But the only time that Washington and Moscow stood on the brink of a deliberate nuclear exchange was in the tense 13-day standoff almost exactly 60 years ago in October 1962 over Russian plans to station nuclear missiles in Cuba. Eventually, after intense messaging between Washington and Moscow, Russia leader Nikita Khrushchev backed down.\n\nPresidents are often less guarded during political fundraising events, which are usually not on camera even though a press pool is allowed in for some remarks. So it’s possible that the President’s comments – his most stark on the nuclear question since the war in Ukraine started – might not have happened in a more conventional setting like a news conference. And the White House has frequently walked back unscripted presidential remarks on foreign policy, especially on how the US would respond if China invaded Taiwan.\n\nBut Biden’s musings do appear to offer a window into his thinking as he games out how this crisis ends. He seems to have been wrestling over the very same questions about escalation and avoiding a moment of no return that President John Kennedy faced in 1962 in his game of nuclear poker.\n\n“I’m trying to figure out what is Putin’s off ramp,” Biden said. “Where does he find a way out? Where does he find himself in a position that he does not not only lose face but significant power within Russia?” Biden said.\n\nThe President may have been thinking of Kennedy’s commencement address at American University in Washington in 1963 in which he reflected on the lessons of the Cuban missile crisis and the risks posed by weapons that could end the world.\n\n“Above all, while defending our own vital interests, nuclear powers must avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war,” Kennedy said.\n\n“To adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy – or of a collective death-wish for the world.”\n\nBiden has been scrupulous in trying to avoid a direct confrontation with Russia over Ukraine even though Putin has styled the conflict as a showdown with the West. But the great strategic danger now is that Russian defeats are leading Putin into exactly that corner that Kennedy warned against, where the Russian President may face a choice between humiliation or the use of a nuclear weapon.\n\nNo off ramps\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that there is no prospect of a diplomatic process to end the war. Ukraine is in no mood to talk after suffering an unprovoked invasion that has caused human carnage, especially as it now appears to have Russian troops on the run. Putin cannot afford any outcome to the war that looks like anything other than total victory even though his control over the Russian media might allow him to spin a loss into a win.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken addressed the lack of diplomatic off ramps during a visit to Peru on Thursday.\n\n“The fact is that President Putin and Russia have shown absolutely no interest in any kind of meaningful diplomacy. And unless and until they do, it’s very hard to pursue it,” Blinken said.\n\n“We’ve said all along, President (Volodymyr) Zelensky has said all along, that this will ultimately be resolved through diplomacy. And if and when Russia shows that it has any seriousness of purpose, about engaging in such diplomacy, we’ll be ready, we’ll be there. But every sign in this moment, unfortunately, points in the opposite direction.”\n\nThe longer the war goes on, and the greater the success of Ukraine’s forces, the more concern there will be about Putin reaching for his nuclear arsenal to try to change the equation. While some strategists think that he is either bluffing or that there are no real strategic advantages to breaking the nuclear taboo – an act that would leave Russia even more ostracized in the world – there is real concern in Western governments about Putin’s state of mind. All of his previous tactical assumptions and decisions in Ukraine have backfired and don’t show the kind of strategic caution and clear thinking that is critical when the question becomes whether or not to use nuclear weapons.\n\nWith that in mind, Biden appeared to be making an argument, which Putin will now be sure to hear about, that the idea that the use of a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine could be contained and not lead to a wider conflagration is wrong.\n\nThe entire strategic logic between maintaining nuclear weapons for self-defense is that they are too terrible to be used, and any nation that did would be writing their own death warrant.\n\nThe President has now sent a clear signal to the Russian leader that crossing the nuclear threshold in any way could cause an escalation that would lead to a disastrous full-on nuclear war.\n\n“I don’t think there’s any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon,” Biden said at the fundraiser.\n\nHis comments underscore the most important mission of his presidency – shepherding the world through the most dangerous nuclear brinkmanship in 60 years.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/13/politics/us-weapons-ukraine-war/index.html", "title": "Why the Biden administration is giving new, heavier weapons to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor the first time since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US is providing Kyiv with the types of high-power capabilities some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago.\n\nThe $800 million list is driven not only by direct requests from Ukraine, but also in preparation for a new type of fight on the open plains of southeast Ukraine right next to Russia, terrain that plays into Russia’s natural military advantages.\n\nThe new weapons package represents the starkest sign to date that the war in Ukraine is shifting – and with it the weapons Ukraine will need if it hopes to continue to stymie a Russian military that has regrouped and resupplied after its initial failures in the opening weeks of the war.\n\nThe Biden administration announced the new package included 11 Mi-17 helicopters that had initially been earmarked for Afghanistan, 18 155 mm Howitzer cannons and 300 more Switchblade drones, in addition to radar systems capable of tracking incoming fire and pinpointing its origin.\n\nThis package stands out from previous security assistance in part because this tranche includes more sophisticated and heavier-duty weaponry than previous shipments. A US official tells CNN that’s by design, arguing that because Russia, which was unable to capture Kyiv, has shifted its strategy to concentrate forces in eastern Ukraine, the US is shifting its own strategy in what it gives Ukraine.\n\n“The contours of what they need is very different,” the US official said.\n\nThe newly authorized package was announced days after national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley spent more than two hours on the phone with their Ukrainian counterparts reviewing requests. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke with Ukrainian Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov twice in the last week. Reznikov gave an update of the situation on the ground, which allowed Austin to determine what weapons Ukraine most needed.\n\nBiden delivered the news of the assistance package during a 58-minute phone call with Zelensky from the Oval Office on Wednesday. There was one item Zelensky asked Biden for directly: Mi-17 helicopters. According to a source familiar, the helicopters had initially not been included in the package as of Tuesday night because US officials weren’t clear on whether the Ukrainians wanted or needed them at this time. Zelensky made clear to the President on Wednesday that they did.\n\n‘A little bit like Kansas’\n\nThe weapons being provided are focused on the type of fighting that’s likely to take place in the Donbas region – open terrain rather than the close fighting in urban and wooded areas that’s occurred in areas around Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. The region also borders southwest Russia, allowing Russian forces to avoid the sorts of sustainment, logistics and communication problems that derailed their all-out invasion of the country nearly from the beginning.\n\nPentagon press secretary John Kirby said Wednesday that the package was tailored to the fight in Donbas, a topography he described as “a little bit like Kansas.”\n\n“It’s a little bit flatter. It’s a little bit more open. And it’s the kind of place where we can anticipate that the Russians will want to use tanks and long-range fires, artillery and rocket fire to achieve some of their objectives before committing ground troops,” Kirby said.\n\nThe new weapons package, Kirby added, was “very much an effort to give the Ukrainians every possible advantage in this fight that’s coming.”\n\nThe Biden administration has faced bipartisan pressure to do more to help Ukraine, particularly in calls to send more powerful weapons. But the administration resisted for weeks, wary of how Russian President Vladimir Putin, with his forces already deployed, would respond. Officials warned the Kremlin may see it as escalatory or an indication that the United States was joining the fight.\n\nThe issue was most acutely felt with the MiG-29 fighter jets Ukraine requested. The administration refused to take part in a transfer of the Soviet-era jets from a third country to Ukraine via the United States, rejecting a proposal from Poland.\n\nThe US worried, Kirby said on March 9, that “the transfer of combat aircraft right now could be mistaken by Mr. Putin and the Russians as an escalatory step.” A large part of the concern internally was over the proposal to fly them into Ukraine from a NATO air base.\n\nNow the rhetoric of the Biden administration appears to have shifted along with the scope of the war. As the US prepares to send in the types of weapons it has not sent since the invasion began, the Pentagon insisted this was part of the US commitment “from the very beginning” to help Ukraine defend itself.\n\n“How that gets interpreted by the Russians – you can ask Mr. Putin and the Kremlin,” Kirby said Wednesday.\n\n‘Very quickly in a different place’\n\nFor weeks, Zelensky pleaded with world leaders for more arms and equipment. In March, he spoke with the parliaments of 17 countries, as well as three international organizations. He never strayed far from his core message: Ukraine needs more weapons.\n\nHe asked Congress for new air defense systems to help defend Ukraine’s skies. He requested 1% of NATO’s tanks and planes to fight back against Russian forces. And he sought more weapons from Belgium, warning that if Ukraine loses, the European Union loses.\n\nBut his calls for heavier firepower went largely unanswered. For the most part, countries sent more small arms ammunition, anti-armor missiles and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as protective and medical equipment.\n\nNow, with Russian forces preparing for a massive assault on the Donbas region, the tide is turning.\n\n“The envelope of what people are prepared to provide has grown considerably in the last couple of weeks,” the US official said. Once Ukrainian forces were able to hold off the Russian invasion for the first few days, it put the options for security assistance “very quickly in a different place.”\n\nSlovakia provided Ukraine with S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. The Czech Republic sent in T-72 tanks. The United Kingdom announced that it would ship 120 armored vehicles to Ukraine. And now the United States has authorized a range of new and more powerful weapons.\n\nAs a sign of the coordination on assistance to Ukraine, the European Union announced it would provide another $544 million in aid on the same day the White House authorized its own $800 million.\n\nPentagon says it’s working as quickly as possible\n\nThe package announced Wednesday marked the first time the US was providing Ukraine with howitzer cannons. Kirby said that several systems would require additional training for the Ukrainians to use them, including the howitzers and counter-artillery radars.\n\nMany of the weapons that are being directed toward Ukraine are heavier, making them more difficult to transport across the country. Ukraine has collected the weapons provided to date from the US and other countries at its western border before moving them to forces around the country.\n\nKirby said the Pentagon knows “time is not our friend” as Russia prepares its next offensive but that it’s working to move equipment into Ukraine’s hands as quickly as possible:\n\n“Even before this was announced, we had been moving at very, very fast speed all the other security assistance that we’ve been providing, frankly at an unprecedented rate.”\n\nThe Pentagon hosted the CEOs of the military’s eight largest prime contractors Wednesday to figure out how to arm Ukraine faster, according to a readout of the classified meeting. The roundtable discussion, led by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, focused on the Pentagon’s objectives to keep supplying Ukraine with arms while being able to maintain the readiness of US forces and support the defense of allies.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.", "authors": ["Oren Liebermann Jeremy Herb Kaitlan Collins", "Oren Liebermann", "Jeremy Herb", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/politics/biden-ukraine/index.html", "title": "Biden stops short of accusing Russia of war crimes as his UN ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nRussia is intentionally targeting Ukrainian civilians in its attack on the country, the US President alleged Wednesday, adding to mounting Western warnings of Moscow’s brutality as the human toll of the seven-day war creeps higher.\n\nDespite the accusation, President Joe Biden stopped short of formally saying Moscow is committing war crimes, though his envoy to the United Nations accused Russia of preparing to use banned weapons, including “cluster munitions and vacuum bombs,” in Ukraine.

Do not commit war crimes,” US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during remarks to an emergency session of the General Assembly.\n\n“Do everything you can to put down your weapons and leave Ukraine,” she implored.\n\nHer warnings reflected the growing fear among Western officials that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be employing brutal new tactics in his war after failing to advance as quickly as expected during the invasion’s earliest days.\n\nRussia’s bombing of civilian targets has intensified in the past days, sending death counts higher and leading to new fears for the capital Kyiv.\n\nUkraine’s State Emergency Service said Wednesday more than 2,000 Ukrainian civilians have so far been killed amid Russia’s ongoing invasion, though United Nations estimates have put that number much lower. The agency said some transport infrastructures, houses, hospitals and kindergartens have been “destroyed” by Russian forces over the last seven days.\n\nBiden said it was evident civilians were being targeted by Russia.\n\n“It’s clear they are,” he said, echoing an accusation made earlier by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that Putin’s forces are dropping munitions on innocent people.\n\nUnlike Johnson, however, Biden stopped short of labeling Russia’s actions a war crime.\n\n“We are following it very closely,” Biden said. “It’s too early to say that.”\n\nInside the General Assembly hall at the United Nations, Thomas-Greenfield warned Russia is “preparing to increase the brutality of its campaign,” citing videos showing Russian forces moving “exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine.”\n\nHer references to cluster munitions and vacuum bombs are the first US acknowledgment of those weapons being moved into the country. country. They are banned under the Geneva Convention for their destructive capacity.\n\nA Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher was spotted by a CNN team south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThese types of weapons do not use conventional ammunition.

They are sometimes called “vacuum bombs” because they suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects.\n\nBiden was speaking a day after delivering a harsh condemnation of Putin during his annual State of the Union address. He generated bipartisan applause for his denunciation of the Russian invasion and the united response from the West in imposing punishing economic sanctions.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden reiterated that sanctioning Russian oil exports remained a possibility, though officials have cautioned they will work to minimize the impact of such a move on US and global oil prices.\n\n“Nothing is off the table,” Biden said when specifically pressed on banning Russian oil exports.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki told CNN earlier the administration would strongly weigh the possibility of significant disruption to US and global oil markets when making a decision.\n\nUkrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky, who has remained in the capital Kyiv as it comes under fire, has called on the US and other Western nations to step up their sanctions packages. He has also asked for the US and other nations to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, a prospect that’s been rejected by the US.\n\nOperating from a bunker, Zelensky has repeatedly said he plans to remain in the country, even as he describes himself as Russia’s top target during the invasion. The US has said previously it is providing a broad range of support for Zelensky, though hasn’t detailed what measures it’s taking to protect him.\n\nBiden said Wednesday it is up to Zelensky whether he wants to remain in his country as it comes under siege by Russia.\n\n“I think it’s his judgment to make and we’re doing everything we can to help him,” Biden said.\n\nCNN has reported previously that the US has discussed contingency plans with Zelensky about leaving Ukraine or relocating to Lviv.

A last-minute presidential visit to Israel is under way before the first tanks roll into Gaza. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held marathon negotiations in Tel Aviv that were interrupted by the sound of air raid sirens, prompting a dramatic dash to a bunker.\n\nBiden has publicly warned terrorist groups and other nations hostile to Israel not to interfere and expand the confrontation with Hamas, a militant group the U.S. considers a terrorist organization. Biden even singled out Iran by name last week, saying he “made it clear to the Iranians: Be careful.”\n\nYet despite Biden’s admonition, there are signs that groups in the Middle East are bracing for a broader war.\n\nIn Iran, the primary backer of Hamas, leaders warned Monday that an expanded war is increasingly becoming unavoidable.\n\n“The time for political solutions is running out and the possibility of expanding the scope of the war on other fronts is approaching the stage that cannot be avoided,” Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nTo the north, Lebanon’s militant group Hezbollah said it has started destroying surveillance cameras on several Israeli Army posts along the Israel-Lebanon border. Hezbollah’s actions come amid concerns it could join the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAnd in a major setback for Biden's Middle East visit, the Jordanian government announced it canceled a summit previously scheduled Wednesday in Amman, Jordan in which Biden was to meet with King Abdullah II, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nThe cancellation came after Israel and Palestinians blamed each other Tuesday for an explosion that killed hundreds at a Gaza City hospital. The White House cited three days of mourning announced by Abbas following the hospital blast for postponing the summit.\n\n“The president sent his deepest condolences for the innocent lives lost in the hospital explosion in Gaza, and wished a speedy recovery to the wounded,” a White House official said. “He looks forward to consulting in person with these leaders soon, and agreed to remain regularly and directly engaged with each of them over the coming days.”\n\nTimeline of conflict:Why the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian fighting is among the most brutal in years\n\nBiden meets with Netanyahu as Middle East 'on the precipice' of larger conflict\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, told reporters Monday evening the U.S. is watching closely for signs that other countries or groups are looking to widen the conflict.\n\n“We don’t want to see any other actor, and that includes Iran, jumping in here and escalating this conflict,” Kirby said. “We haven’t seen any indication that that’s necessarily in the offing right now, but we are watching it very, very closely.”\n\nIn Washington, Biden canceled a trip to Colorado on Monday to promote his economic agenda and remained at the White House, where he huddled with his national security advisers and intelligence officials and placed calls to the leaders of Germany, Egypt and Iraq.\n\nBiden will meet with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, a move seen as another show of solidarity with a longtime ally – and a possible warning to others looking to escalate the conflict.\n\n“Sure, the administration wants to avoid a broader war in the Middle East, but its interests are not merely avoiding a broader war in the Middle East,” said Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nThe administration has a strong interest in ensuring that Israeli leadership keeps its eye on the ball and is thinking through the end game and what actions are necessary to achieve that goal, Alterman said.\n\nAaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for the State Department and now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the administration’s actions also serve as a deterrent to others who may be looking to expand the conflict.\n\n“It’s intended to send an unmistakable signal to Iran and Hezbollah that if they widen the war, there’s the real possibility of U.S. engagement, and neither Hezbollah nor Iran wants to court the possibility of massive American airstrikes,” Miller said.\n\nThe Middle East is “right on the precipice” of a larger conflict, said Natan Sachs, director of the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.\n\nClashes on a limited scale have already broken out between Hezbollah and Israel on the Lebanese-Israel border. There are fears Israel’s threatened ground assault in the Gaza Strip could prompt Hezbollah to launch a full-scale attack on Israel from Lebanon.\n\n“The danger is very real, and Hezbollah is far stronger than Hamas,” Sachs said. “So, the possibility of the war becoming far greater and much more damaging not only to Israel but also to Lebanon is acute.”\n\n'I won't condemn Hamas':Some Palestinians find it hard to denounce attacks on Israel\n\nUS steps up military show of support for Israel\n\nThe Biden administration has already stepped up its support to Israel in the week and a half since the conflict began, when Hamas staged an attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed more than 1,400 Israeli civilians and soldiers. At least 30 Americans have been killed, and 13 others are missing. Hamas also is holding at least 199 hostages.\n\nIsrael responded to the attack by hitting the Gaza Strip with a barrage of airstrikes that the Palestinian Health Ministry says has killed more than 2,700 Palestinians. An Israeli ground invasion into Gaza is expected soon.\n\nThe Pentagon continues to bolster its firepower in the Middle East with a second aircraft carrier strike group steaming to the region.\n\nThe Pentagon’s intent is to prevent adversaries like Iran and Hezbollah, its proxy force in Lebanon, from launching a major attack against Israel, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe USS Dwight Eisenhower and its escort warships will join the Pentagon’s newest, largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, in the eastern Mediterranean. The ships and aircraft provide intelligence gathering and the ability to hit targets with missiles and bombs.\n\nThe Air Force has held fighter jets and pilots in the Middle East that had been scheduled to be replaced, boosting the number of warplanes to the region. The Pentagon also is working to supply Israel with interceptors for its Iron Dome missile-defense system, precision-guided weapons and artillery ammunition.\n\nThe message sent by the Pentagon has likely been received by Iran, said Mark Quantock, the former head of intelligence for U.S. Central Command and a retired Army two-star general.\n\n“Iran/Hezbollah won’t want to poke the bear any harder,” Quantock said.\n\nIsrael wants help:Israel seeks Iron Dome missiles, U.S. guided weapons after Hamas attack\n\nThe Pentagon regularly adds warships to the region, especially when Iran acts provocatively. Marines aboard amphibious assault vessels were sent to the region over the summer when Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps intercepted commercial shipping.\n\nThis time is different, Quantock said. Hamas killed American citizens, holds others hostage and inflicted “unspeakable” atrocities on unarmed Israeli citizens, Quantock said.\n\n“The U.S. is also not in the mood to be trifled with,” Quantock said. “Iran/Hezbollah would be wise to sit this one out. Time will tell.”\n\nSachs said he believes Biden will respond with airstrikes from the carriers if Hezbollah counters with a significant attack on Israel. The targets would most likely be Hezbollah or other Iran-backed militias depending on their involvement, he said, not Iran itself.\n\n“I take him at his word. I think the U.S. would use naval firepower,” Sachs said. “I don't think there will be Americans on the ground.”\n\nReach Michael Collins on X, formerly Twitter, @mcollinsNEWS, Garrison @joeygarrison and Vanden Brook @tvandenbrook.\n\nHamas attacks Israel:Hoe the police and military are trying to find the gunmen.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/russian-cyberattacks-what-matters/index.html", "title": "A Russian cyberattack could lead to war.

The President on Monday referred to the conversations as an “altar call.”\n\n“We’ve had a long conversation about, if he uses it, what would be the consequence,” Biden told business leaders on Monday.\n\nBiden has more control over that consequence than he does over the preparedness of US companies that are involved in American infrastructure. He appealed to their sense of “patriotic obligation” to get their cyber-defense capabilities up to scratch.\n\nHe specifically mentioned the energy, power and financial sectors.\n\nWhat might a large-scale cyberattack look like?\n\nIt’s happened before. Estonia was the victim of a large-scale cyberattack in 2007, although there was not enough evidence to definitively pin it on Russia at the time.\n\nCNN’s Ivana Kottasová wrote about the attack, which Estonia considered an act of cyber-warfare, last June. It all started with Estonia’s decision to remove a Soviet-era war memorial from central Tallinn.\n\nHere are some key lines from her report:\n\nThe attack made Estonia realize that it needed to start treating cyber threats in the same way as physical attacks.\n\nAt that time, the country was already a leader in e-government, having introduced services like online voting and digital signatures. While no data was stolen during the incident, the websites of banks, the media and some government services were targeted with distributed denial of service attacks that lasted for 22 days. Some services were disrupted, while others were taken down completely.\n\nNATO and the international community took notice of the attack on Estonia and experts developed a standard to assess cyber-war as a result.\n\nWhen is a cyberattack an act of war?\n\nI called Tess Bridgeman, co-editor in chief of the website Just Security and a former attorney in the Obama White House who is an expert on war powers and international law.\n\n“If a cyberattack causes significant death, destruction or injury, of the same sort that you would see from a more traditional attack using kinetic means, like bullets or missiles, you know, then you would call it a ‘use of force’ in international law,” she said.\n\nA cyberattack that targeted a dam or air traffic control towers might rise to this level, but the government would try very hard to avoid responding to a cyberattack with a military attack, she said.\n\nThe attacks on the US to date have fallen short of the threshold to justify a military response.\n\nAs the government seeks countermeasures to respond, Bridgeman said, there’s a good chance they won’t be publicly known.\n\n“It may appear that the US is sitting by idly, but I would be highly doubtful that that’s the case,” she said, arguing that defensive actions might be more effective at de-escalating the standoff. “It’s setting the example for what responsible state behavior looks like.”\n\nCould weapons be used to respond to a cyberattack?\n\nThe threat of a military response is always there for the worst cyberattacks, should they cost American lives.\n\n“Our policy, our declared policy is, if it’s a big enough attack on us and it hurts us, we will use the conventional weapons response,” Richard Clarke, who was a top adviser to President George W. Bush on cybersecurity, told CNN’s Michael Smerconish shortly after the war in Ukraine began.\n\n“So we could very easily find ourselves in a shooting war with Russia if they try devastating – and that would have to be devastating – cyberattacks like turning out the power grid,” Clarke said.\n\nMost of these attacks are meant to be part of espionage campaigns or to be meddlesome rather than deadly. Clarke argued that Russian attacks on US industries could be more devastating than attacks on the government itself. He said the government doesn’t really know what would happen if the Amazon, Google and Microsoft cloud systems went offline, for instance.\n\n“I can tell you if those clouds go down, the United States stops working, our economy stops working, the phones stop working – we will find ourselves pretty soon in the dark ages if the internet goes down,” said Clarke.\n\nWhat if Russia attacked a US ally?\n\nIt’s not clear that Russia would want to provoke the US specifically in a such a devastating way, or how the US would respond.\n\nWhile its cyberattacks in Ukraine since the war began have been less severe than some expected, according to a report by Lyngass, Russia has targeted internet infrastructure in parts of the country.\n\nThere has been concern that cyberattacks in Ukraine could spill over to nearby countries that are in NATO and could lead the organization to invoke Article 5 of its charter – the principle that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all members.\n\nCould a cyberattack trigger Article 5?\n\nA cyberattack could absolutely trigger Article 5. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made this clear in February just after Russia’s invasion.\n\n“An attack on one will be regarded as an attack on all,” Stoltenberg said at a news conference when asked about a potential Russian cyberattack.\n\nBut he added that NATO would be very careful in assessing an attack and would make sure a cyberattack on Ukraine – shutting off electricity, say – that accidentally spilled over into Poland or Romania is not construed as an attack on those countries.\n\nHe also said it’s intentionally unclear what kind of cyberattack would rise to the level of invoking Article 5.\n\nNATO, he said, would not want to “give a potential adversary the privilege of defining exactly when we trigger Article 5.”", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has roiled the House in chaos. The move to oust McCarthy – known as a motion to vacate – had the support of a handful of hard-right lawmakers who have expressed anger at McCarthy for working with Democrats to avert a government shutdown.\n\nHere's what you missed after a chaotic day in Washington.\n\nGaetz led a group of eight Republicans who voted to remove the speaker, joined by 208 Democrats who at times giggled at the GOP’s infighting.\n\nRepublicans weren't laughing, however, as the civil war has cast a shadow over their majority.\n\nDuring the debate some accused Gaetz of grandstanding and hurtling the House into chaos without a clear plan as to who, if anyone, would take the job.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's coverage of the speaker fight in the halls of Congress.\n\nMcCarthy yet to speak with Biden\n\nKevin McCarthy said Tuesday he has not spoken to Joe Biden in a \"long long time.\"\n\n\"I've been thinking about that. It's been a long long time,\" McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy says he had respect for the president despite their different philosophies, but wished the president was more \"hands on.\"\n\nThe timeline raised some eyebrows in Washington, considering Congress last week voted to temporarily avert a government shutdown that would have impacted millions of Americans. But House Republicans have also launched an impeachment inquiry into Biden, claiming he benefitted from his family's business dealings.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nPelosi, McCarthy says, vowed to back him up\n\nDuring his pursuit of the speakership that lasted 15 votes earlier this year, one of McCarthy's key concessions was allowing a single member of Congress to file a motion to vacate.\n\nMcCarthy counseled his fellow Californian and former Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for advice. Pelosi, he said, told him to make the concession.\n\nIf the motion to vacate ever came up, McCarthy claimed, Pelosi would have backed him up.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\n'I think you've got a real institutional problem,' Kevin McCarthy warns\n\nNoting that only a small minority – 8 members – of the House GOP conference voted to oust McCarthy, the former speaker said there was an \"institutional problem.\"\n\n\"I think you've got a real institutional problem,\" McCarthy said, also joking that if he knew he would eventually be ousted, he wouldn't have helped his opponents get elected.\n\nBut McCarthy on Tuesday night also gave some advice the next speaker of the Republican-controlled House where a single member can bring forth a motion to vacate: \"Change the rules.\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nKevin McCarthy: 'I leave the speakership with a sense of pride'\n\nKevin McCarthy formally announced his intentions to not run again for speaker of the House at a press conference, saying he is making his exit with a \"sense of pride and optimism.\"\n\nThe California Republican noted his decision to work with Democrats to avert a government shutdown put his leadership position at stake, but that \"doing what's right isn't always easy. But it's necessary.\"\n\n\"I took a risk for the American public,\" McCarthy said.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nHouse adjourns until next Tuesday\n\nIn a display of the chaos that has upended the House, lawmakers are headed home until next Tuesday as the lower chamber is now paralyzed without a speaker.\n\nHouse Republicans will decide on candidates for speaker next Tuesday. The next speaker election is expected to take place next Wednesday.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nMcCarthy will not seek the speakership again\n\nLeaving the closed-door conference meeting, Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., told reporters McCarthy plans to not run again.\n\nThe plan, the Oklahoma Republican said, is to adjourn for the night and discuss alternatives to succeed McCarthy\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nMatt Gaetz walks into GOP closed door meeting\n\nGaetz has entered a closed-door House GOP conference meeting to discuss next steps after he ousted McCarthy as speaker.\n\nHe did not answer any questions on his way in.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhite House pushes House to ‘quickly elect’ McCarthy’s replacement\n\nPresident Joe Biden wants the Republican-led House of Representatives to move quickly to elect a new speaker to replace McCarthy following his removal, the White House said.\n\n“Because the urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait, he hopes the House will quickly elect a Speaker,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said of Biden. “The American people deserve leadership that puts the issues affecting their lives front and center.”\n\nPrior to the vote to vacate McCarthy’s speakership, the White House did not take a public position whether McCarthy should remain in his role and instead deferred to House Democratic leaders who voted to oust McCarthy.\n\nThe White House highlighted a “split screen” Tuesday between the chaos in the House and action in the executive branch as Biden announced that all 10 prescription drug drugs tapped for Medicare’s first price negotiations have agreed to participate.\n\n“Once the House has met their responsibility to elect a speaker,” Jean-Pierre said, \"he looks forward to working together with them and with the Senate to address the American peoples’ priorities.”\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nGaetz, McCarthy's chief antagonist, claims victory\n\nGaetz, who spearheaded the successful efforts to oust McCarthy from his post, claimed victory on the Capitol steps after the historic vote to remove the speaker.\n\n\"It's the benefit of this country that we have a better speaker of the House than Kevin McCarthy,\" Gaetz told reporters after the vote. \"We should elect a speaker who's better.\"\n\nThe Florida conservative taunted his moderate colleagues as House Republicans are expected to huddle to discuss next steps.\n\n\"The stages of grief I think are in progress right now with some of my colleagues. I think there was a stage of denial. I've certainly experienced a good amount of their anger. And now we appear to be headed towards bargaining,\" Gaetz said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nGOP Rep. Ryan Zinke: ‘This is a vote without purpose’\n\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., told reporters that he thinks McCarthy being ousted as speaker is “sad and tragic.”\n\nZinke said he doesn’t think McCarthy gives up when asked whether the next election in the House for speaker will spark multiple rounds of contentious voting.\n\n“Last week, one of the latest excuses - not valid - is that McCarthy reached out to members that voted with purpose on the continuing resolution,\" he said, referencing the temporary measure that lawmakers approved to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n\"In the last round, the Democrats did vote with purpose. They voted to keep the government open and they voted to keep the policies in place,\" he said, before calling the vote to remove McCarthy \"a vote without purpose. And I always look at purpose and intent.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGOP lawmaker to lose Republican support over McCarthy vote\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., one of eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy, said he’s already received angry phone calls, less than an hour since the vote ended.\n\n“This will cost me,” Burchett said. “I’ve already gotten the calls from a lot of the big supporters of mine that said they’ll never support me again.”\n\nBurchett said that made it a “tough decision,” but “I worry more about our country.”\n\nWhen asked who would be picked to replace McCarthy, the Tennessee congressman said he’s been in conversations but didn’t have a name to share. He said there could be about eight lawmakers in the running.\n\n“Members have whispered in my ear,” Burchett said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nRepublican lawmaker: ‘Much different than the speaker’s election’\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., told reporters that the vote to oust McCarthy was “much different than the speaker's election where one wins, one loses,” despite the group of Republicans seeking to remove him from the leadership office.\n\n“It’s certainly a disappointment, and I think those responsible for coordinating reflect on it and I think if they do…I don't think they'll ever think they made the right call, but that's up to them,” Cole said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho will be the next speaker of the House? Patrick McHenry?\n\nRepublican Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina is temporarily leading the House after Kevin McCarthy was ousted. McHenry, one of McCarthy's closest allies, is known as the speaker pro tempore.\n\nThe speaker pro tempore has far more limited powers compared to a speaker of the House, but he will preside over the lower chamber until a new speaker is elected.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho voted against Kevin McCarthy\n\nIn a historic turn of events, McCarthy has been ousted as speaker, leaving the House in turmoil as lawmakers must elect a new permanent speaker.\n\nEight GOP lawmakers voted to eject McCarthy from the speakership, they are:\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nKevin McCarthy is ousted, House moves to elect new speaker\n\nConservative rebels successfully ousted McCarthy as speaker, plunging the House into chaos as lawmakers move to elect a new speaker. House Democrats, who voted against the motion to table, joined the conservative hardliners in ejecting McCarthy from the speakership. The vote to oust McCarthy was 216-210.\n\nMcCarthy, even though he was ousted, is still able to run again as speaker if nominated by a lawmaker. In the meantime, an acting interim speaker must be named, but they will have limited power.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIn sign of hope for McCarthy, one GOP vote flips in his favor\n\nIn a glimmer of hope for McCarthy’s speakership, Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio., who voted against the motion to delay Gaetz’ effort to oust him, also voted against the motion to vacate.\n\nDavidson’s vote is a sign there could be more conservative hardliners who flip in favor of McCarthy.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse starts roll call vote to decide Kevin McCarthy's fate\n\nAs the House starts voting on whether or not to eject McCarthy from the speakership, a sense of deja vu has fallen on the House floor, as lawmakers are voting through voice vote, similar to how lawmakers voted during the speaker election back in January.\n\nIt will take a while. Each lawmaker has to be called one-by-one to declare their vote.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMatt Gaetz calls Biden impeachment inquiry ‘failure theater’\n\nGaetz, making his case to oust McCarthy, slammed Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden as “failure theater.”\n\nIn the first impeachment inquiry hearing targeting Biden last week, three expert witnesses invited by Republicans each told the House Oversight Committee no evidence has emerged that Biden committed an impeachable offense. It was a setback in Republican efforts to impeach Biden.\n\n“It’s hard to make the argument that oversight is the reason to continue when it looks like failure theater,” said Gaetz, responding to comments earlier by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who defended McCarthy.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nGOP yells ‘Shame!’ at Gaetz for fundraising off motion to vacate\n\nOne of Kevin McCarthy’s top lieutenants, Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., defended the speaker in an impassioned speech, also lambasting Matt Gaetz for fundraising off of his efforts to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\n“Using official actions to raise money, it’s disgusting,” Graves said.\n\nWhen Graves held up his phone displaying one of Gaetz’ fundraising messages, GOP lawmakers yelled “Shame!” at Gaetz.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nGaetz met with silence as he debates McCarthy allies\n\nIn a display of just how much power a handful of conservative hardliners wield over the the House, Matt Gaetz has responded to nearly every Kevin McCarthy ally speaking on the California Republicans’ behalf on the House floor.\n\nThe contrast between the two factions couldn’t be any more clear.\n\nWhile McCarthy allies including Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., and Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. has received overwhelming applause from GOP lawmakers after their remarks, Gaetz’ speeches have been met with silence.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if McCarthy is ousted?\n\nIf the House votes to oust McCarthy, then someone would have to fill his position temporarily until an election is set and the next speaker is chosen in the lower chamber.\n\nThat temporary replacement would be chosen from a succession list McCarthy submitted in January. According to Rule one, clause 8 of House rules, the next person on the list “shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore.”\n\n“Pending such election the Member acting as Speaker pro tempore may exercise such authorities of the Office of Speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to that end,” the House rules say.\n\nThe rules don’t specify how long the person would temporarily fill the speaker’s spot. It is unclear when the House would choose to hold an election for the next speaker if McCarthy is removed.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMcCarthy nearly expressionless as House Republicans debate his fate\n\nWhile House Republicans debate on McCarthy’s fate as speaker, the California Republican, sitting in the second row from the front of the floor, has been nearly expressionless, only occasionally chatting with Rep. Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz., who is seated next to him.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIs GOP hostage to right-flank of party?\n\nThe 11 Republican lawmakers who joined Democrats to vote against a procedural vote delaying the motion to vacate now leads to a final vote on the House floor to oust McCarthy.\n\nThese 11 Republicans include some of the most ultra-conservative members of the Republican conference, including members of the House Freedom Caucus like Reps. Bob Good of Virginia, Ken Buck of Colorado, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Matt Rosendale of Montana and Eli Crane of Arizona.\n\nDespite comprising a minority of the Republican caucus, these ultra-conservative members, with help from the other side of the aisle, may be the reason McCarthy is removed from his speakership.\n\nSome, like Good, listed their grievances with McCarthy as speaker. Good called it a “totally avoidable situation.”\n\n“We need a speaker who will fight for something, anything, besides just staying or becoming speaker,” Good said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDemocrats stand aside as House Republicans debate among themselves\n\nWhile Kevin McCarthy's allies and the conservative hardliners against the speaker debate on the House floor over his speakership, Democrats have stayed on the sidelines watching House Republicans quarrel amongst themselves.\n\nAs the rest of the House GOP conference cheered on McCarthy's allies and jeered at Gaetz, House Democrats remained silent, reflecting Jeffries and leadership's intention for House Republicans to settle the matter within their own conference.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nRepublican calls McCarthy ouster 'totally avoidable situation'\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va., who voted against tabling the motion to vacate against McCarthy, spoke on the House floor after the vote listing his grievances with McCarthy and calling it a “totally avoidable situation.”\n\nGood said back in January during the votes that made McCarthy speaker, he persuaded five of his colleagues to vote present in the final vote that allowed McCarthy to win his leadership role. He claimed he continued to work with McCarthy and persuade some of his ultra-conservative colleagues to support McCarthy’s priorities throughout the year.\n\nThe Virginia lawmaker claimed McCarthy made a promise to bring 12 spending bills to the floor individually this year, which did not happen as Congress lurched toward a government shutdown this weekend. Good said he reluctantly agreed to vote for a short-term solution to avert a shutdown, despite the promise McCarthy made\n\n“We need a speaker who will fight for something, anything besides just staying and becoming speaker,” Good said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nMcCarthy ally: ‘This is a very sad day’\n\nSpeaking on behalf of McCarthy and his allies on the House floor, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., chair of the House Rules Committee, praised the California Republicans’ leadership through multiple tough votes that put McCarthy’s speakership into question, including negotiations over the debt ceiling earlier this year and the recent government shutdown crisis.\n\n“We were on the verge of a government shutdown,” Cole said. “He put his political neck on the line … to do the right thing.”\n\n“He did the right thing for our party,” Cole added, earning a standing ovation from the majority of the House GOP conference.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho will serve as speaker if Kevin McCarthy is ousted?\n\nThat's not clear.\n\nIf McCarthy is removed from his leadership role a temporary speaker would lead in the House. McCarthy submitted a succession list to the House clerk in January, though the document is private.\n\nBut who's likely on that list? Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the House majority leader, is a likely option. So is Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the majority whip, another crucial leadership position.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTexas Republican concerned about upcoming vote to remove McCarthy\n\nThere is not a clear name for McCarthy’s successor, should the speaker be ousted, said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-TX.\n\n“There’s not really an option. Another reason this is very silly,” he said.\n\nThe Texas congressman said he’s worried about the message today’s events will send to voters about the GOP.\n\n“It’s clear that there’s just a group of people that don’t want conservatives to win,” Crenshaw said. “And they label themselves as the most conservative, which is not possibly true.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nPresident Joe Biden stays out of Kevin McCarthy speakership fight\n\nThe White House is staying out of the fight over McCarthy’s speakership – seemingly more than happy to watch Republicans beat up each other.\n\n“We’re just not going to get involved,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday, deferring to House Democratic leaders who have vowed they won’t help McCarthy.\n\nJean-Pierre said it is “nothing new” for the White House not to weigh in on congressional leadership decisions.\n\n“Is there chaos in the House Republicans? Absolutely. That is something that they have to deal with,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nOn Sunday, President Joe Biden said, “I don't have a vote on that matter. I'll leave that to the leadership of the House and the Senate.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n'Get a time machine'\n\nWhen asked whether there was anything McCarthy could do to change anything, Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told reporters that he could “get a time machine and bring us all back to the table like I suggested two months ago and keep his word.”\n\nBurchett added that “everything’s always chaos..this country was built on chaos” and said he was more concerned about the dollar collapsing and the economy failing.\n\n“It scares me a lot worse,” Burchett said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\n11 GOP lawmakers vote against McCarthy in setback to his speakership\n\n11 GOP lawmakers voted against the motion to table the effort to oust McCarthy in a massive setback for the speaker. The House will on the motion to vacate McCarthy, which is the formal vote that will decide his speakership.\n\nThe members that voted against McCarthy are:\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\nRep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.\n\nRep. Cory Mills, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont.\n\nRep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMotion to table fails: McCarthy’s speakership closer to the brink\n\nKevin McCarthy faced a severe setback when a handful of conservative hardliners and House Democrats voted against a procedural motion – known as a motion to table – to discard Gaetz’ efforts to oust the California Republican as speaker. The vote failed by 208-218\n\nThe House will immediately vote now on the motion to vacate to determine whether McCarthy stays in his post.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhite House vows US support for Ukraine won’t waver if McCarthy loses job\n\nThe White House expressed confidence Tuesday that Congress will continue to support aid for Ukraine if House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is ousted from his speakership.\n\n“Regardless of what happens in the House of Representatives,” said John Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security issues, “all the House leadership is supportive of continuing to help Ukraine and the vast majority of House members on the Republican side are in support.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden is pushing Congress to approve additional aid to help Ukraine fight Russia after Congress passed a continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown for several weeks that lacked Ukraine funding to appease hardline Republicans. A growing number of far-right Republicans in the House oppose continued support of Ukraine.\n\nMcCarthy, whose speakership is in jeopardy, has backed Ukraine funding in the past but said he wants future financial support for Ukraine to be tied to additional security on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n“We don't believe they should be tied, or one dependent on the other, but both are important,” Kirby said.\n\nBiden held a phone call with NATO allies Tuesday in which he “reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes as it,” the White House said.\n\n“As winter fast approaches, it is imperative that we help them take advantage of every single day,” Kirby said. “A lapse of support for even a short period of time can make all the difference on the battlefield.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump: Why are Republicans 'always fighting among themselves'?\n\nWhile attending his bank fraud trial in New York for a second day, Donald Trump found time Tuesday to weigh in on the drama surrounding McCarthy - sort of.\n\nTrump did not mention McCarthy or Gaetz by name in a Truth Social post, nor has he taken a public position on their dispute, but he did criticize GOP in-fighting.\n\nSaid the former president: \"Why is it that Republicans are always fighting among themselves, why aren’t they fighting the Radical Left Democrats who are destroying our Country?\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNancy Pelosi says Democrats aren't taking up speaker fight\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, shared in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"In this Congress, it is the responsibility of House Republicans to choose a nominee & elect the Speaker on the Floor.\"\n\n\"At this time there is no justification for a departure from this tradition,\" she added.\n\nHer comments come as House Democrats have vowed not to step in and save Kevin McCarthy from a rebellion from his fellow Republicans.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolitics:Will Kevin McCarthy be forced out as Speaker of the House? Here's how it could happen.\n\nAbsences could save McCarthy\n\nAhead of the procedural vote to suspend Gaetz’ motion to vacate against McCarthy, the California Republican could be saved due to absences.\n\nThe procedural vote – referred to as a motion to table – requires just a simple majority rather than an absolute majority. That means McCarthy does not technically need 218 votes to table the motion to vacate, but rather just more votes to table the motion than against it.\n\nBoth House Republicans and House Democrats are seeing absences that could factor into McCarthy’s survival.\n\nIt is unclear how many absences there are on each side, but House Democrats are currently voting by hand in an unrelated vote series likely to buy more time for their rank and file members to make it to the crucial vote on McCarthy’s fate.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n‘We’ll see what happens’: Lawmakers enter House chamber for votes\n\nAs lawmakers file into the House chamber, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., took a swipe at Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., when asked about the upcoming vote against McCarthy. Greene has long supported the speaker.\n\n“Are we all gonna be dressing like John Fetterman here pretty soon when we don’t have a speaker and don’t have rules,” Greene said. “We’ll see what happens.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho's trying to oust Kevin McCarthy? Matt Gaetz, Freedom Caucus members\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., introduced a motion Monday night to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from the top position in the House.\n\nHis motion came after a contentious week of negotiations to avoid a government shutdown, during which Gaetz had previously threatened to oust McCarthy if the Speaker looked across the aisle for support.\n\nBut Gaetz is joined in the push by several members tied to the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, including Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs.\n\nWhat happens if there's a government shutdown and no speaker of the House?\n\nIf McCarthy is ousted by his fellow Republicans, and Democrats refuse to step in and help him, a temporary speaker would lead in the House. McCarthy submitted a succession list to the House clerk in January, though the document is private.\n\nThat means the House could continue with its important business, as lawmakers have just weeks to compromise on a slate of spending bills to avoid a government shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat happens if Congress ousts McCarthy?\n\nIf the House decides to remove McCarthy as speaker, then someone from a private backup list provided by McCarthy at the beginning of the year will fill his slot until a new election is held.\n\n“There's a little disagreement amongst Hill procedural experts about how much power that temporary Speaker would actually wield,” Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told The Washington Post.\n\nHowever, McCarthy can choose to run as speaker again. It is unclear when the House would hold that vote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMotion to vacate history: Has a speaker of the House ever been removed?\n\nThe last time the House voted on a motion to vacate was 1910 against then-Speaker Joseph Cannon, R-Ill. In 2015, then-Rep. Mark Meadows filed a motion against Speaker John Boehner, but it never made it to a floor vote.\n\nA House speaker has never been removed via a motion to vacate. Boehner resigned months after Meadows' motion amid continued dissent in his party.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nCapitol Hill in turmoil\n\nThe move to oust Kevin McCarthy has consumed the House in turmoil as lawmakers strategize over how to approach the conservative rebellion against the California Republican.\n\nMcCarthy, exiting a closed-door weekly conference meeting, told reporters firmly he wouldn't entertain working with Democrats to save his speakership and conceded that \"I'm out\" if a handful of Republicans decide to boot him from the speakership.\n\nIn their own extended closed-door conference meeting to discuss strategy, to prevent leaks, House Democratic lawmakers were barred from bringing in their phones to the meeting as leadership decided on whether or not to bail McCarthy out.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse Democrats will vote to remove Kevin McCarthy\n\nIn a lengthy letter sent to House Democrats, Jeffries said leadership will vote to vacate McCarthy from the speakership.\n\n\"It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War. Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair,\" the letter reads.\n\nHouse Democrats have for days said they will vote in line with their leadership. Jeffries' statement means that McCarthy's speakership will hinge on uniting enough House Republicans behind him to defeat the conservative rebellion.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat state does Kevin McCarthy represent? How long has Kevin McCarthy been in Congress?\n\nKevin McCarthy was sworn in as a member of the House of Representatives in 2007. He represents California's 20th House District, which includes parts of Kern, Fresno, Tulare and Kings counties.\n\nCongress voted to make McCarthy speaker of the House in January, after a marathon 15 rounds of votes. He faced objections from some of the same hard-right lawmakers in January during his bid to become speaker that he faces now as they seek to remove him.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs McCarthy being impeached?\n\nNo, Kevin McCarthy is facing what's known as a motion to vacate, which could remove him from his role as speaker of the House, a role that's in line behind the vice president to succeed the presidency, if needed.\n\nImpeachment is a process designed to remove presidents from office, along with other federal officials. House Republicans have opened up an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, but they haven't approved any formal articles of impeachment against him.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is a motion to vacate?\n\nA motion to vacate is a congressional procedure initiated by a House member that calls for the removal of a sitting House speaker and the election of a new one, according to Ballotpedia.\n\nWhile the motion can be brought forth by one person, there must be a majority vote in the House to remove the top leader.\n\nUnder House rules, the motion must be voted on in two legislative days.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Democrats help McCarthy?\n\nThe answer is likely no.\n\nAs of noon on Tuesday, it appears Democrats will remain unified and vote to remove McCarthy from his role as speaker of the House.\n\n“House Democrats are going to continue to push people over politics,” House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters Tuesday.\n\n“We are ready to find bipartisan common ground,” he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \"Our extreme colleagues have shown no willingness to do the same. They must find a way to end the House Republican Civil War.”\n\nOther lawmakers made clear they support House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y. call to “end the House Republican Civil War.”\n\n“I hope everybody votes no on the motion to table. I expect everybody to be unified,” Rep.

It has been updated to reflect the current status of the legislation.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law a $1.7 trillion yearlong federal government spending package on Thursday, after the House and Senate passed it last week.\n\nThe legislation includes $772.5 billion for nondefense discretionary programs and $858 billion in defense funding. That represents an increase in spending in both areas for fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe sweeping package includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies, an overhaul of the electoral vote-counting law, protections for pregnant workers, an enhancement to retirement savings rules and a TikTok ban on federal devices.\n\nIt also provides a boost in spending for disaster aid, college access, child care, mental health and food assistance, more support for the military and veterans and additional funds for the US Capitol Police. And the legislation contains several major Medicaid provisions, particularly one that could disenroll up to 19 million people from the nation’s health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nHowever, the law, which runs more than 4,000 pages, left out several measures that some lawmakers had fought to include. An expansion of the child tax credit, as well as multiple other corporate and individual tax breaks, did not make it into the final bill. Neither did legislation to allow cannabis companies to bank their cash reserves – known as the Safe Banking Act – or a bill to help Afghan evacuees in the US gain lawful permanent residency. And the spending package did not include a White House request for roughly $10 billion in additional funding for Covid-19 response.\n\nThe spending law, which will keep the government operating through September, the end of the fiscal year, is the product of lengthy negotiations between top congressional Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCongress originally passed a continuing resolution on September 30 to temporarily fund the government in fiscal year 2023, which began October 1.\n\nHere’s what’s in the law:\n\nMore aid for Ukraine: The spending law provides roughly $45 billion to help support Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself against Russia’s attack.\n\nAbout $9 billion of the funding will go to Ukraine’s military to pay for a variety of things including training, weapons, logistics support and salaries. Nearly $12 billion will be used to replenish US stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority.\n\nAlso, the law provides $13 billion for economic support to the Ukrainian government. Other funds address humanitarian and infrastructure needs, as well as support European Command operations.\n\nEmergency disaster assistance: The law provides more than $38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans in the west and southeast affected by recent natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. It will aid farmers, provide economic development assistance for communities, repair and reconstruct federal facilities and direct money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, among other initiatives.\n\nOverhaul of the electoral vote-counting law: A provision in the legislation aims at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, the first legislative response to the US Capitol insurrection and then-President Donald Trump’s campaign to stay in power despite his loss in 2020.\n\nThe changes overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which Trump tried to use to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe legislation clarifies the vice president’s role while overseeing the certification of the electoral result to be completely ceremonial. It also creates a set of stipulations designed to make it harder for there to be any confusion over the accurate slate of electors from each state.\n\nFunding for January 6 attack prosecutions: The law provides $2.6 billion for US Attorneys, which includes funding efforts “to further support prosecutions related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol and domestic terrorism cases,” according to a fact sheet from the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe package also gives $11.3 billion to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including for efforts to investigate extremist violence and domestic terrorism.\n\nThe funding measures are part of nearly $39 billion for the Justice Department.\n\nRetirement savings enhancements: The law contains new retirement rules that could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings – and less costly to withdraw them. Among other things, the provisions will allow penalty-free withdrawals for some emergency expenses, let employers offer matching retirement contributions for a worker’s student loan payments and increase how much older workers may save in employer retirement plans.\n\nTikTok ban from federal devices: The legislation bans TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, from federal government devices.\n\nSome lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok – or its parent, ByteDance – to hand over the personal data of its US users. Recently, a wave of states led by Republican governors have introduced state-level restrictions on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices.\n\nProtections for pregnant workers: The law provides pregnant workers with workplace accommodations – such as additional bathroom breaks, stools or relief from heavy lifting duties – needed for healthy pregnancies. It will prevent them from being forced to take leave or losing their jobs, as well as bar employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions. Also, another provision in the package guarantees workplace accommodations – particularly time to pump – for more nursing workers.\n\nChanges to Medicaid and other health care programs: The law phases out the requirement that prevented states from disenrolling Medicaid recipients as long as the national public health emergency was in effect in exchange for an enhanced federal match. This continuous coverage measure was enacted as part of a Covid-19 relief package passed in March 2020 and has led to a record 90 million Medicaid enrollees, many of whom may no longer meet the income requirements to qualify.\n\nUnder the law, states will be able to start evaluating Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility and terminating their coverage as of April 1. The redetermination process will take place over at least 12 months. Also, the enhanced federal Medicaid funding will phase down through December 31, 2023, though the states will have to meet certain conditions during that period.\n\nUp to 19 million people could lose their Medicaid benefits, according to estimates, though many would be eligible for other coverage.\n\nAlso, under a provision in the law, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, will offer 12 months of continuous coverage for children. This will allow the 40 million children on Medicaid and CHIP to have uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year.\n\nIn addition, the law makes permanent the option for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage for low-income mothers through Medicaid, rather than just 60 days. More than two dozen states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the measure, which was available on a temporary basis through the American Rescue Plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another seven states are planning to implement the option.\n\nPlus, the package provides more money for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The funds are intended to speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive measures, beef up public health activities and strengthen the nation’s biosecurity by accelerating development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats and fortifying stockpiles and supply chains for drugs, masks and other supplies.\n\nIncreased support for the military and veterans: The package funds a 4.6% pay raise for troops and a 22.4% increase in support for Veteran Administration medical care, which provides health services for 7.3 million veterans.\n\nIt includes nearly $53 billion to address higher inflation and $2.7 billion – a 25% increase – to support critical services and housing assistance for veterans and their families.\n\nThe law also allocates $5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, which provides additional funding to implement the landmark PACT Act that expands eligibility for health care services and benefits to veterans with conditions related to toxic exposure during their service.\n\nBeefing up nutrition assistance: The legislation establishes a permanent nationwide Summer EBT program, starting in the summer of 2024, according to Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger advocacy group. It will provide families whose children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals with a $40 grocery benefit per child per month, indexed to inflation.\n\nIt also changes the rules governing summer meals programs in rural areas. Children will be able to take home or receive delivery of up to 10 days’ worth of meals, rather than have to consume the food at a specific site and time.\n\nThe law also helps families who have had their food stamp benefits stolen since October 1 through what’s known as “SNAP skimming.” It provides them with retroactive federal reimbursement of the funds, which criminals steal by attaching devices to point-of-sale machines or PIN pads to get card numbers and other information from electronic benefits transfer cards.\n\nHigher maximum Pell grant awards: The law increases the maximum Pell grant award by $500 to $7,395 for the coming school year. This marks the largest boost since the 2009-2010 school year. About 7 million students, many from lower-income families, receive Pell grants every year to help them afford college.\n\nHelp to pay utility bills: The package provides $5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Combined with the $1 billion contained in the earlier continuing resolution, this is the largest regular appropriation for the program, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Home heating and cooling costs – and the applications for federal aid in paying the bills – have soared this year.\n\nAdditional funding for the US Capitol Police: The law provides an additional $132 million for the Capitol Police for a total of nearly $735 million. It will allow the department to hire up to 137 sworn officers and 123 support and civilian personnel, bringing the force to a projected level of 2,126 sworn officers and 567 civilians.\n\nIt also gives $2 million to provide off-campus security for lawmakers in response to evolving and growing threats.\n\nMore money for child care: The legislation provides $8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a 30% increase in funding. The grant gives financial assistance to low-income families to afford child care.\n\nAlso, Head Start will receive nearly $12 billion, an 8.6% boost. The program helps young children from low-income families prepare for school.\n\nMore resources for children’s mental health and for substance abuse: The law provides more funds to increase access to mental health services for children and schools. It also will invest more money to address the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder.\n\nInvestments in homelessness prevention and affordable housing: The legislation provides $3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants, a 13% increase. It will serve more than 1 million people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe package also funnels nearly $6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program and related local economic and community development projects that benefit low- and moderate income areas and people, an increase of almost $1.6 billion.\n\nPlus, it provides $1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which will lead to the construction of nearly 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units and maintain the record investment from the last fiscal year.\n\nMore support for the environment: The package provides an additional $576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency, bringing its funding up to $10.1 billion. It increases support for enforcement and compliance, as well as clean air, water and toxic chemical programs, after years of flat funding.\n\nIt also boosts funding for the National Park Service by 6.4%, restoring 500 of the 3,000 staff positions lost over the past decade. This is intended to help the agency handle substantial increases in visitation.\n\nPlus, the legislation provides an additional 14% in funding for wildland firefighting.\n\nWhat’s not in the law\n\nEnhanced child tax credit: A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates pushed hard to extend at least one provision of the enhanced child tax credit, which was in effect last year thanks to the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Their priority was to make the credit more refundable so more of the lowest-income families can qualify. Nearly 19 million kids won’t receive the full $2,000 benefit this year because their parents earn too little, according to a Tax Policy Center estimate.\n\nNew cannabis banking rules: Lawmakers considered including a provision in the spending bill that would make it easier for licensed cannabis businesses to accept credit cards – but it was left out of the legislation. Known as the Safe Banking Act, which previously passed the House, the provision would prohibit federal regulators from taking punitive measures against banks for providing services to legitimate cannabis businesses.\n\nEven though 47 states have legalized some form of marijuana, cannabis remains illegal on the federal level. That means financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses are subject to criminal prosecution – leaving many legal growers and sellers locked out of the banking system.\n\nCovid-19 response: Lawmakers did not include a White House request for an additional $10 billion in funding for Covid-19, which would have been aimed at continued access to and development of vaccines and therapeutics, among other things. Earlier in the year, the Biden administration unsuccessfully pushed for $22.5 billion in extra funds.\n\nFBI headquarters: There was also no final resolution on where the new FBI headquarters will be located, a major point of contention as lawmakers from Maryland – namely House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer – pushed to bring the law enforcement agency into their state. In a deal worked through by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the General Services Administration would be required to conduct “separate and detailed consultations” with Maryland and Virginia representatives about potential sites in each of the states, according to a Senate Democratic aide.\n\nAfghan Adjustment Act: Also not included in the spending bill was the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would have helped Afghan allies who run the risk of deportation from the US. It would have given those evacuees a pathway to lawful permanent residency before their temporary status, known as humanitarian parole, expires in 2023. Many congressional Republicans raised concerns about vetting and other issues, but the legislation’s supporters, including former US military leaders, argued those worries have been addressed.\n\nLegislation to extend and expand Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked with the US during the war there and want to come to America is included in the spending bill.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby Katie Lobosco", "Tami Luhby", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/10/12/louisiana-loses-chance-to-have-house-speaker-after-steve-scalise-withdraws/71135886007/", "title": "Louisiana loses chance at U.S. House speaker after Steve Scalise ...", "text": "Louisiana has lost the chance to have its first U.S. House of Representatives speaker after Congressman Steve Scalise withdrew his nomination Thursday evening, escalating the chaos in Congress.\n\nScalise had been nominated Wednesday over Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan by the Republican conference on a narrow vote, but over the next 24 hours it became clear Scalise couldn't secure the 217 votes needed on the floor to become speaker.\n\n“It’s been quite a journey and there’s still a long way to go.

If no candidate was able to do both, then the Mississippi House decided on the election outcome.\n\nIn 2020, voters repealed the system, instead requiring candidates to receive only a majority of the popular vote to get elected in the state.\n\n\"Now that it's just a popular vote, then the influence of the Black vote means more,\" said Charles V. Taylor Jr., the executive director of the Mississippi state conference of the NAACP.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nPolls close in parts of Kentucky\n\nPolls have closed in parts of Kentucky as voters consider whether to reelect Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear or replace him with Republican Daniel Cameron.\n\nMuch of Beshear’s first term was dominated by his response to a series of natural disasters and the pandemic. But his reelection campaign often focused on dire warnings about the future of abortion rights.\n\nCameron would be the nation’s first Black Republican to be elected governor if he wins. He has reaffirmed his support for the current Kentucky law, which bans all abortions except when carried out to save a pregnant woman’s life or to prevent a disabling injury.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nBallots run out at several Mississippi county precincts\n\nMultiple locations in Hinds County, Mississippi, ran out of ballots, and the Hinds County Election Commission was in the process of trying to print more ballots and deliver them as time was running out on voting Tuesday afternoon, according to Pete Perry of the Hinds County Republican Party.\n\nAs many as nine precincts have run out of ballots.\n\n\"The election commission did not print enough ballots for the precincts.

Democrats have warned that a red Virginia would lead to further abortion restrictions, while Republicans defend their proposed 15-week limit, with exceptions, as a “common sense” compromise.\n\nOut of a list of issues ranging from crime to taxes, abortion was second most top of mind for voters in a Christopher Newport University Wason Center poll last month.\n\nNext on that list: K-12 education.\n\nVirginia Republicans have campaigned on “parents’ rights\" in education, a rallying cry that began in the state during Gov.

After the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging Philadelphia officials violated state law while ballots were being tallied, which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed.\n\nWhoever is elected to the state's Supreme Court this year could be crucial, as fights could play out again in Pennsylvania in 2024.\n\nThe court has a 4-2 Democratic majority after the death of Justice Max Baer. If Carluccio were to be elected, the majority balance between parties wouldn’t change.

Officials aim to earn your trust in 2024\n\nWASHINGTON − Ahead of another election cycle that is already shaping up to be contentious, federal and state election officials are in the midst of campaigns of their own to reassure wary voters about the integrity of casting their ballots.\n\nThey are recruiting poll workers, certifying voting machines and hosting lessons on how election systems work in community centers, classrooms and libraries.\n\nThe steps are needed, experts say, to restore voters' confidence in a system that, despite some flaws and outspoken election deniers, was mostly trustworthy and secure in the first place.\n\nThose fraud claims, in part, gave rise to calls for major overhauls of election systems in some states led mostly by Republican lawmakers. Some, particularly voters of color, were already skeptical of a system with a history of discrimination that hasn't always been open to them. New laws to restrict access has fueled that mistrust, experts said.\n\nMuch of the work of assuring voters will fall to local elections officials, experts said. Americans have more trust in their local election systems, which they’re more familiar with, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\n\"People know their local election officials. They know when they go to city or town hall that they trust the people that work there,'' said Rob Rock, Rhode Island's deputy secretary of state. \"It's really important to make sure that people understand the process.''\n\n–Deborah Barfield Berry and Terry Collins\n\nRead the story:Fearful of voter fraud?

They also demonstrate how he played a key role in the attempts to stop Biden’s certification on January 6.\n\nThe never-before-seen texts include messages from Trump’s family – daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr. – as well as White House and campaign officials, Cabinet members, Republican Party leaders, January 6 rally organizers, Rudy Giuliani, My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, Sean Hannity and other Fox hosts. There are also text exchanges with more than 40 current and former Republican members of Congress, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.\n\nThe texts include everything from plans to fight the election results to surprising and unexpected reactions on January 6 from some of Trump’s staunchest allies. At 2:28 p.m., Greene, the conservative firebrand who had helped to plan the congressional objections that day, texted Meadows with an urgent plea for help as the violence was unfolding at the Capitol.\n\n“Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn’t the way to solve anything,” Greene wrote. Meadows does not appear to reply.\n\nMore messages flooded in.\n\n“Mark: he needs to stop this, now. Can I do anything to help?” Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former acting White House chief of staff, texted Meadows.\n\n“It’s really bad up here on the hill. They have breached the Capitol,” Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk wrote.\n\n“The president needs to stop this ASAP,” texted GOP Rep. William Timmons of South Carolina.\n\n“POTUS is engaging,” Meadows sent in response to Loudermilk. “We are doing it,” he texted to Timmons.\n\n“Thanks. This doesn’t help our cause,” Loudermilk replied.\n\nShortly after, Donald Trump Jr. weighed in: “This his(sic) one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse.”\n\n“TELL THEM TO GO HOME !!!” texted Trump’s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus.\n\nHeated rhetoric and conspiracy theories\n\nThe text messages CNN obtained begin on Election Day, November 3, 2020. Even before the election was called, Meadows was inundated with conspiracy theories about election fraud, strategies to challenge the results and pleas for Trump to keep fighting. The messages – from GOP activists, donors, Republican members of Congress and state party officials – appear to act as an echo chamber affirming Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen. For months leading up to Election Day, Trump had claimed the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged.\n\nPreviously disclosed text messages showed that former Trump administration Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., each texted Meadows on November 4 and 5 with ideas for overturning the election.\n\nOn November 7, hours before the election was called, Perry texted Meadows again: “We have the data driven program that can clearly show where the fraud was committed. This is the silver bullet.”\n\nWhile Perry has previously denied CNN reporting about his text messages to Meadows, CNN has confirmed it’s his cell phone and he signed this text, “Rick Perry,” including his number.\n\nOther texts, however, include hints of doubt expressed by members of Trump’s team and even Meadows himself about the veracity of conspiracy theories being spread by Trump’s “kraken” team – outside attorneys working for Trump that included Giuliani and Sidney Powell.\n\nSome key congressional allies who worked with Trump’s campaign initially in its efforts to overturn the election, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, ultimately soured on the approach as the January 6 congressional certification neared, CNN previously reported.\n\nThe texts also show how Trump allies were quick to deflect responsibility for the January 6 attack. Shortly after pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol, one of his top aides began crafting a counter-narrative.\n\nAt 3:45 p.m., Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller suggested to Meadows and Trump aide Dan Scavino that Trump should tweet: “Call me crazy, but ideas for two tweets from POTUS: 1) Bad apples, likely ANTIFA or other crazed leftists, infiltrated today s peaceful protest over the fraudulent vote count. Violence is never acceptable! MAGA supporters embrace our police and the rule of law and should leave the Capitol now! 2) The fake news media who encouraged this summer s violent and radical riots are now trying to blame peaceful and innocent MAGA supporters for violent actions. This isn’t who we are! Our people should head home and let the criminals suffer the consequences!”\n\nTrump’s allies in Congress appeared to get the message. At 3:52 p.m., Greene told Meadows: “Mark we don’t think these attackers are our people. We think they are Antifa. Dressed like Trump supporters.”\n\nFive minutes later, Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, texted Meadows: “Cap Police told me last night they’d been warned that today there’d be a lot of Antifa dressed in red Trump shirts & hats & would likely get violent.”\n\nIn the 16 months since January 6, hundreds of indictments have shown nearly all of those who breached the Capitol were in fact pro-Trump supporters.\n\nWhile Greene was alarmed on January 6, by the next day she was apologizing that the efforts to block Biden’s certification had failed.\n\n“Yesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I’m sorry nothing worked. I don’t think that President Trump caused the attack on the Capitol. It’s not his fault,” she wrote the morning of January 7. “Absolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks Marjorie.”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) wears a \"Trump Won\" face mask as she arrives on the floor of the House to take her oath of office as a newly elected member of the 117th House of Representatives in Washington, U.S., January 3, 2021. Erin Scott/Reuters\n\nGreene is currently facing a legal challenge to disqualify her from running for Congress because of her alleged role in January 6. In court testimony Friday, the Georgia Republican repeatedly deflected or said she didn’t remember what she had said around the events of January 6. The Meadows text logs offer a new glimpse into what she was telling the White House chief of staff in real time.\n\nOn December 31, Greene reached out to Meadows for advice about how to prepare for objections to certifying the election on January 6.\n\n“Good morning Mark, I’m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,” Greene wrote. “I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn’t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board. And we need to lay out the best case for each state.”\n\nMeadows does not appear to respond.\n\nBy January 17, Greene was suggesting ways to keep Trump in office, telling Meadows there were several Republicans in Congress who still wanted the then-President to declare martial law, which had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month earlier.\n\nGreene texted: “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law. I don’t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!”\n\nAgain, Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nWhat Meadows turned over\n\nMeadows provided the cache of 2,319 messages to the January 6 committee in December 2021. But soon after, he stopped cooperating and refused to appear for a deposition. Ultimately, the House voted to hold the former White House chief of staff in contempt of Congress. The Justice Department has not yet announced whether it will charge Meadows.\n\nMeadows has sued the House committee in an attempt to block the congressional subpoenas. And in a late-night court filing on Friday, the committee responded with new details revealing Meadows was warned ahead of time that January 6 could turn violent, according to testimony from Cassidy Hutchison, one of Meadows’ former White House aides.\n\nIn addition, the committee released text messages Meadows exchanged with Republican members of Congress, including texts with Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania about a scheme to replace Justice Department leaders who opposed Trump’s claims of election fraud.\n\nIn late December, Perry reached out to Meadows, connecting him to then-DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, who was pushing unfounded claims of voter fraud inside the Justice Department. Trump was considering firing the acting attorney general and installing Clark instead. Clark invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times when he spoke to the January 6 committee in February.\n\nOn December 26, Perry texted Meadows, “Mark, just checking in as time continues to count down. 11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration. We gotta get going!”\n\n“Mark, you should call Jeff,” he continued. “I just got off the phone with him and he explained to me why the principal deputy won’t work especially with the FBI. They will view it as as (sic) not having the authority to enforce what needs to be done.”\n\n“I got it,” Meadows responded. “I think I understand. Let me work on the deputy position.”\n\nOn December 28, Perry reached out again: “Did you call Jeff Clark?” Meadows does not appear to respond.\n\nMeadows withheld more than 1,000 messages from the committee on claims of privilege, the panel said in Friday’s court filing. In his lawsuit, Meadows’ attorney argued the former White House chief of staff “has been put in the untenable position of choosing between conflicting privilege claims.”\n\nHannity to Meadows: ‘Yes sir’\n\nIn addition to the texts the committee has released, CNN and other news organizations have previously published selections of text messages Meadows received from Lee, Roy, Trump Jr., Perry and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, Ginni Thomas.\n\nThe logs obtained by CNN include numerous messages from official White House cell phone numbers. Some have been identified by CNN, others are unknown.\n\nThere are also numerous group texts with Trump’s inner circle. The various group chats include Meadows, Ivanka Trump, Trump Jr. and Kushner, as well as top advisers such as Hope Hicks, campaign manager Bill Stepien, Miller and Scavino, among others.\n\nSome texts only include links to news reports and social media. Others appear to contain content that was cut-and-pasted and forwarded. The logs do not contain images or attachments.\n\nSupporters of U.S. President Donald Trump watch a video featuring Fox host Sean Hannity ahead of Trump's arrival to a campaign rally in Michigan on October 30, 2020.

Throughout the logs, Hannity both gives advice and asks for direction.\n\nOn the afternoon of Election Day, Hannity texted Meadows to ask about turnout in North Carolina.\n\nMeadows responded: “Stress every vote matters. Get out and vote.”\n\n“Yes sir,” Hannity replied. “On it. Any place in particular we need a push.”\n\n“Pennsylvania. NC AZ,” Meadows wrote. “Nevada.”\n\n“Got it. Everywhere,” Hannity said.\n\nFor the most part, Meadows’ texts are short, and frequently he does not appear to reply at all. Some conversations include non sequiturs. It’s unclear whether Meadows did not respond to the messages or if the logs are incomplete, because texts could also have been deleted or withheld for claims of privilege.\n\nCNN reached out for comment to all individuals who sent text messages quoted in this story. Meadows and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the January 6 committee declined to comment.\n\nThe fight to ‘stop the steal’\n\nThe text messages provide a timeline showing how Trump’s team searched all corners for evidence of election fraud and tried to overturn the election. Beginning on Election Day, Meadows was in the middle of it all, from connecting activists pushing conspiracy theories to strategizing with GOP lawmakers and rally organizers preparing for January 6.\n\nThe texts also show Meadows was dealing with everything from mediating a fight over who would be on the speaker’s list for the January 6 rally to fielding requests to pay Giuliani’s bills.\n\n“Sir, we are airborne on the way to Michigan from Arizona. We’re going to need a hotel for the team and two vehicles to pick us up,” Bernie Kerik, a Giuliani associate, texted Meadows on December 1.\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Kerik confirmed the text was his and said that he never received a credit card for those travel expenses, paid for it himself and was later reimbursed.\n\nOther texts show Meadows coordinating with GOP activists in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\n“Pls get 4 or 5 killers in remaining counts. Need outsiders who will torch the place. Local folks won’t do it. Lawyers and operators. Get us in these states,” American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp texted Meadows on November 4.\n\n“I may need to get you and mercy (sic) to go to PA,” Meadows responded, referring to Schlapp’s wife, Mercedes, who is a former Trump White House aide.\n\nOn a few occasions, Trump family members weighed in. Ivanka Trump sent a note on November 5 to a group that included Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Miller and Meadows: “You are all WARRIORS of epic proportions! Keep the faith and the fight.”\n\nDozens of Republicans also offered support and advice to Meadows – as well as perpetuated conspiracy theories that were gaining traction in right-wing media.\n\nFor instance, Rep. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican now running for Senate, suggested in a text on November 7 that Dominion Voting Systems could be connected to George Soros’ company. Dominion has no corporate ties to Soros, a billionaire and frequent target of baseless conspiracy theories, according to a CNN fact check.\n\nOn November 6, Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, appeared to suggest that state legislatures should appoint electors “in the various states where there’s been shenanigans,” a move he acknowledged would be “highly controversial.” In his text, he wrote the legislatures could appoint “a look doors,” which is phonetically similar to electors.\n\nOn December 1, then-Attorney General William Barr infuriated Trump when he publicly stated that the Justice Department did not find widespread evidence of voter fraud. Nevertheless, Meadows received multiple texts pushing back, including from Schlapp later that day: “Happy to walk ag through our evidence. Its (sic) overwhelming.”\n\nThe texts also show Meadows reached out to GOP officials in multiple states to lobby for Trump’s cause. On two occasions, Meadows attempted to contact Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was under attack from Trump for certifying Georgia’s election for Biden.\n\n“mr Secretary. Can you call the White House switchboard,” Meadows wrote on December 5. “Your voicemail is full.”\n\nRaffensperger does not appear to reply to the messages.\n\nTrump’s efforts to overturn the election results in Georgia are under investigation by a district attorney in the Atlanta area.\n\nMeadows also received text messages from GOP activists and local officials making outlandish claims, including allegations that “traitors inside our intel agencies” were committing election fraud, as well as baseless charges that voting equipment companies Dominion and Smartmatic had manipulated votes – the same false claims being pushed by Giuliani and Powell.\n\nBoth companies have filed billion-dollar lawsuits over the false election claims, including against Fox News, right-wing media organizations, Giuliani, Powell and Lindell.\n\nThroughout the two months, Meadows received dozens of messages from Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who offered what she claimed were examples and sources of voter fraud.\n\nOn December 9, she sent a text to Meadows letting him know she’d already reached out to Trump’s executive assistant: “This guy says he’s cracked the whole election fraud and wants to speak to someone. I sent his info to Molly Michael a few days ago, but I’m not sure it went anywhere.”\n\n“I will call him,” Meadows responded.\n\nMyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, speaks to reporters outside federal court in Washington, Thursday, June 24, 2021. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nAnother frequent texter was Lindell, one of the most vocal proponents of baseless election conspiracy theories. Even after courts had dismissed dozens of Trump’s legal challenges, the My Pillow CEO was still pressing the White House.\n\n“Everything Sidney has said is true! We have to get the machines and everything we already have proves the President won by millions of votes!” Lindell texted Meadows on December 20. “This is the biggest cover up of one of the worst crimes in history! I have spent over a million$ to help uncover this fraud and used my platform so people can get the word not to give up!”\n\nMeadows replied, “Thanks brother. Pray for a miracle.”\n\n\n\nReached for comment by CNN, Lindell confirmed the text was his. He told CNN that he has not spoken to Meadows since before January 20, 2021, and that at the time he was “just trying to get an appointment with the President.”\n\nDoubts about election fraud\n\nWhile Trump and his allies publicly stuck by their claims that the election had been stolen, behind the scenes, Trump’s inner circle – including Meadows – expressed some doubts. Trump’s aides also questioned whether lawyers like Giuliani and Powell were doing more harm than good.\n\nOn November 6, Miller, Trump’s campaign spokesman, texted a group, which included Ivanka Trump, Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Scavino and Meadows, suggesting that the numbers in Philadelphia didn’t back up claims about alleged election fraud there.\n\n“One other key data point: In 2016, POTUS received 15.5% of the vote in Philadelphia County. Today he is currently at 18.3%. So he increased from his performance in 2016. In 2016, Philadelphia County made up 11.3% of the total vote in the state. As it currently stands, Philadelphia County only makes up 10.2% of the statewide vote tally. So POTUS performed better in a smaller share. Sen. (Rick) Santorum was just making this point on CNN - cuts hard against the urban vote stealing narrative,” Miller wrote.\n\nJason Miller talks on the phone in a meeting room for lawyers of former President Donald Trump during his Senate Impeachment trial on Capitol Hill, February 12, 2021 Jabin Botsford/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\n\nA week later, Miller wrote to Meadows again, this time saying that campaign research did not find any evidence of a conspiracy involving Soros, the Democratic donor. Miller also said he was concerned about sharing the findings with Trump.\n\n“Lots there re: functionality problems, not much there on Dem/Soros conspiracy connections,” Miller wrote on November 13. “Will defer to you on whether or not to share full report with POTUS. POTUS is clearly hyped up on them, not just from his tweets, but he also called me and Justin separately last night to complain. JM.”\n\nOn November 20, Meadows was asked by a Florida contact how confident he was about fraud related to Dominion. Meadows texted back: “Dominion, not that confident. Other fraud. Very confident.”\n\nTwo days later, Ginni Thomas messaged Meadows with apparent concerns, asking, “Trying to understand the Sidney Powell distancing…”\n\nMeadows responded: “She doesn’t have anything or at least she won’t share it if she does.”\n\n“Wow!” Ginni Thomas wrote back.\n\nIn one of the few messages Meadows received from Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law shared a fact check on December 4 debunking one of the most prominent election fraud claims from Georgia. The article showed that despite inflammatory claims of poll workers stashing suitcases filled with ballots under a table, that did not, in fact, occur.\n\n‘Hoping the VP sticks with us’\n\nAfter the Electoral College affirmed Biden’s win on December 14, Trump’s allies turned their attention to January 6: the congressional certification of the electors and the rally that Trump said on Twitter “will be wild!”\n\nOn December 21, Brooks, the Alabama congressman, wrote to Meadows and others in a group text asking whether he should engage with the media about the “formulation of our January 6 strategies.”\n\n“Does the White House want me to reply or be mum?” Brooks wrote. A staunch Trump ally running for Senate this year, Brooks gave an incendiary speech on January 6 but recently fell out of favor with Trump after suggesting Republicans should move on from 2020.\n\n\n\nIn response to CNN’s request for comment, Brooks said he had “no regrets” about his speech on January 6 and that he was “shocked” by the violence. “I had no inkling,” Brooks added.\n\nCruz, a Texas Republican who pushed a plan inside the Senate that would have delayed certification of the election, exchanged just a few messages with Meadows – links to his statements posted to social media.\n\nOn January 2, the senator sent Meadows his tweet proposing a 10-day audit of the election results.\n\n“Here’s the statement,” Cruz wrote.\n\n“Perfect,” Meadows responded.\n\nThe texts also make frequent reference to then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with Trump’s plan to try to block the certification on January 6. On December 30, Rep. Brian Babin of Texas expressed concern that congressional leaders might try to short circuit their objections – and that Pence was not on board.\n\n“Dems and some Republicans may well try to shortstop our objection efforts. Hoping the VP sticks with us,” Babin wrote.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, Miller shared a news article with Meadows that Pence opposed a lawsuit intended to help overturn the election. Miller warned that it could be used “to drive a massive wedge between POTUS and everybody else in the party.”\n\n“He’s absolutely going to blow his stack on this if he isn’t already aware,” Miller said of Trump. “Oh boy I don’t understand what the VP was thinking here.”\n\nOn January 5, Jordan, the Ohio congressman and close GOP ally of Meadows, weighed in.\n\n“On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all – in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence,” Jordan wrote.\n\nMeadows responded the morning of January 6: “I have pushed for this. Not sure it is going to happen.”\n\nThe January 6 committee included the text exchange in its Friday court filing as evidence of Meadows’ alleged involvement in the effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe logs also show Meadows was involved with planning the rally on January 6, helping to mediate a fight over the speakers list. Trump adviser Katrina Pierson was alarmed at some of the proposed fringe figures who wanted to speak.\n\nCrowds arrive for the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January 06, 2021 in Washington, DC. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nOn January 2 and 3, Pierson wrote to Meadows looking for help.\n\n“Good afternoon, would you mind giving me a call re: this Jan 6th event. Things have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction. Please,” she asked on January 2.\n\nThe next day, she reached out again: “Scratch that, Caroline Wren has decided to move forward with the original psycho list. Apparently Dan Scavino approved??”\n\nShe continued: “So, I’m done. I can’t be a part of embarrassing POTUS any further.”\n\nWren was a fundraiser for the Trump campaign and helped organize the January 6 rally. She has been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee.\n\nLess than an hour later, Pierson wrote Meadows that she told Wren she was talking to the White House in order to get her to back down.\n\n“I let her know that I was going to reach out to WH and her tone changed,” Pierson wrote. “So, I’ll continue to build a proper event.”\n\n“Thank you,” Meadows responded.\n\n‘As bad as this can get’\n\nIn the aftermath of the violence at the Capitol on January 6, Trump’s inner circle discussed in a group text how to deal with the fallout – and Trump’s suspension from Twitter. At 10:10 p.m. on January 6, Kushner texted the group: “Why don’t we post on his Facebook page since he isn’t locked out there.”\n\nIn the final days of Trump’s term, as he faced impeachment for a second time, Meadows received words of encouragement from staunch allies, as well as caution from advisers.\n\n“I would like to pass to POTUS that we are still with him, I believe in him and I want to encourage him,” Rep. Andrew Clyde, a freshman Georgia Republican, wrote on January 9. “I truly hope he does create a new platform to complete (sic) with Twitter and I hope he calls it ‘Trumpet’ and then we can send out ‘notes’ to each other!”\n\n“I will share it with him. Thanks Andrew,” Meadows responded.\n\nOn January 13, the day the House voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol – with 10 Republicans joining Democrats – Miller shared polling data in a group text with Meadows, Scavino and Kushner that showed “2/3 of the MAGA base wants us to move on.”\n\n“I tried to walk the President through this earlier but he won’t have any of it,” Miller said.\n\nAs Trump prepared to leave power, he appeared to be a pariah in the Republican Party. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had said during the House’s January 13 impeachment debate that the outgoing President “bears responsibility” for the riot. Six days later, on January 19, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell denounced Trump from the floor of the Senate, saying the mob that attacked the Capitol was “provoked by the President and other powerful people.”\n\nNevertheless, Trump’s standing in the Republican Party quickly recovered, especially after McCarthy’s January 28 visit to Mar-a-Lago and the February 2021 acquittal of Trump in the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nBut before Trump left office, the Meadows text logs show some of Trump’s staunchest allies were dejected. On January 19, in one of the final texts Meadows received as chief of staff, Fox’s Sean Hannity shared a video of McConnell’s floor speech.\n\nHannity texted Meadows: “Well this is as bad as this can get.”", "authors": ["Jamie Gangel Jeremy Herb Elizabeth Stuart", "Jamie Gangel", "Jeremy Herb", "Elizabeth Stuart"], "publish_date": "2022/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/03/07/robert-renny-cushing-dies-hampton-nh-house-democratic-leader-prostate-cancer/9417816002/", "title": "Renny Cushing, NH House Democratic leader, of Hampton dies of ...", "text": "Staff Report\n\nnews@seacoastonline.com\n\nHAMPTON — The community is mourning the loss of Robert \"Renny\" Cushing, a long-time Hampton state representative who is being remembered as a \"tireless and passionate advocate for New Hampshire\" and for making a real difference in people's lives.\n\nCushing, 69, died Monday surrounded by loved ones after a nearly two-year battle with stage 4 prostate cancer.\n\n\"A true public servant, he dedicated his entire life to the betterment of others,\" stated Acting Deputy Democratic Leader Mary Jane Wallner.\n\n\"New Hampshire lost a fearless warrior, but his legacy will live on through the lives he has changed, the stories he’s shared, and the very real ways he left New Hampshire better than he found it,” said Senate Democratic Leader Donna Soucy.\n\nHouse Bill 1645:Renny Cushing tells panel about his dad’s murder by Hampton police officer\n\nCushing stepped down last week from his position as House Democratic minority leader to take a medical leave of absence to focus on his cancer battle. In his statement to the Democratic Caucus, Cushing wrote, \"I have fought my entire life for the people of New Hampshire and served in the legislature for more than 20 years — but for now, I need to focus on another fight.\"\n\nCushing was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer in August 2020. The cancer had already metastasized in his bones and lungs and he was told without treatment that he would have between nine and 18 months to live.\n\nWith full knowledge of his diagnosis, he took on the Democratic minority leader position telling his colleagues he would focus on \"finding common ground in the fight for the common good.\"\n\nAnd fight he did.\n\nAs the coronavirus spread, not only did he defend Democratic principles but also waged an unsuccessful legal fight to allow lawmakers with serious medical conditions to participate in legislative sessions remotely.\n\n\"My regret is that he didn’t have a chance to be the majority leader when he had his full strength, when he still had his fastball, so to speak,\" said Chris Muns, president of the Hampton Democratic Committee. \"What’s happening today wouldn’t be happening if he had been leader 10 years ago.\"\n\nMuns called Cushing \"a master parliamentarian in the House.\"\n\nOthers like Jim Splaine, a former Portsmouth Democratic state representative and state senator for some 30 years, called him \"the most effective legislator in the past 25 years.\"\n\n\"He didn't compromise for the sake of getting something through,\" Splaine said. \"He believed what he believed and he fought for it until he won.\"\n\n'He didn't raise his voice. He just made his case'\n\nCushing was drawn to politics early in life as an opponent of the Vietnam War, advocating to lower the voting age from 21 to 18.\n\nHe was also a founding member of the Clamshell Alliance, which was formed in the mid-1970s to oppose a proposed nuclear power plant in Seabrook.\n\n\"He had passion throughout his life going all the way back '70s,\" Splaine said. \"He had this amazing energy. You saw a controlled passion whenever he spoke on an issue. He didn't raise his voice. He just made his case.\"\n\nSplaine said Cushing was among more than 1,400 protesters arrested at the site of the plant on April 10, 1977. Though later demonstrations led by splinter groups turned violent, the earlier sit-in was peaceful and served as a model for other anti-nuclear campaigns across the United States.\n\n\"I think more people realize the consequences of the nuclear age,\" Cushing said at a rally marking the protest's 10-year anniversary. \"People who did not consider themselves activists are waking up and saying: 'I was fooled. Nuclear power isn't clean and it isn't safe.\"'\n\n'One of Renny’s biggest accomplishments' - abolishing the NH death penalty\n\nCushing was first elected to the House in 1996, and was serving his eighth non-consecutive term in Concord at the time of his death.\n\nHe was known for pushing progressive causes.\n\nRenny Cushing: Dying while legislating — 'There’s no end of the work to do'\n\n\"One of Renny’s biggest accomplishments and a joy for colleagues in the House to witness, was abolishing the death penalty in New Hampshire,\" said Acting Democratic Leader Rep. David Cote, D-Nashua.\n\nCushing spent more than 20 years trying to repeal the state's death penalty law, finally achieving victory in 2019 when lawmakers overrode a veto by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu.\n\nHis testimony in support of the repeal, where he spoke about his personal experience after both his father and brother-in-law were murdered, is still talked about to this day.\n\n\"If we let those who kill turn us into killers, then evil triumphs and we all lose,\" he said in March 2019.\n\nCushing's father was murdered June 1, 1988, by off-duty police officer Robert McLaughlin, who shot the schoolteacher in the chest at the door to his house. His brother-in-law was shot and killed in Tennessee in 2011.\n\n‘Murder at the Front Door’:Retired cop pens novel on Cushing homicide in Hampton\n\n\"What I came to realize is that (capital punishment) would only compound the family tragedy,\" Cushing said in a 2019 interview on why he spent decades fighting for the repeal. \"Not only would my father be dead, but so too the values he instilled in me.\"\n\nCushing founded Murder Victims' Families for Human Rights, and as its executive director, traveled the country speaking on behalf of victims against the death penalty.\n\n'A passionate and dedicated public servant'\n\nSplaine said Cushing was instrumental in getting his bill approved legalizing same-sex marriage in New Hampshire in 2009.\n\nSplaine said it was Cushing who recommended that he postpone the vote because the votes were not there that day. Splaine followed that advice and a week later it passed by a vote of 186-179.\n\n\"Renny knew parliamentary procedures and he was a great vote counter,\" Splaine said. \"We would not have been the fifth state to adopt marriage equality without him.\"\n\nIn recent years, Cushing championed the legalization of medical marijuana, drinking water standards, the clean up of the Coakley Landfill and the the construction of a secure psychiatric facility to serve patients currently held in a prison unit.\n\nCushing column:Digging out of the ditch New Hampshire Republicans have left us in\n\n\"He was highly respected amongst his peers in the House and throughout the State of New Hampshire,\" said House Speaker Sherman Packard, R-Londonderry. \"He was a passionate and dedicated public servant - never afraid to take on controversial issues for the sake of bettering this great state.\"\n\nA champion for Hampton\n\nNancy Stiles, former Republican District 24 state senator, said \"Renny was committed to representing Hampton.\"\n\nShe said they worked together to secure funding for the $14.5 million redevelopment project of Hampton Beach, as well as the new Hampton District Courthouse.\n\n\"He was a great representative for Hampton,\" Stiles said.\n\nStiles said Cushing would cross the aisle to get things done for Hampton.\n\nAnother loss in Hampton:Hampton renames town hall in memory of former state Sen.

But he announced he's leaving the House to run for the congressional seat now held by Charlie Crist, who himself is now a Democratic candidate for governor in 2022.\n\nAlexander is in his third term representing Leon and Gadsden counties. Once word of Diamond’s plans began to spread last week, House Democrats began to contact Alexander about the leadership position.\n\n“I am very grateful that 34 of my colleagues have called me and encouraged me to take this on,” Alexander said on Monday.\n\nAs the current House Democratic Whip, Alexander counts votes for the caucus, and knows the significance of receiving 34 calls of encouragement from his 41 Democratic colleagues.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAnd some of the calls went public Monday.\n\nWhile Alexander prepared to inform the House Clerk’s office in writing about his candidacy to become the House Democratic Leader, the party’s progressive wing took to social media to pressure Alexander to make a public statement.\n\nRead more:\n\n“Rep.@RamonAlexander is someone who should seriously consider it — he cares about our Caucus, has policy experience & a track record of electoral success too!” tweeted Rep.

Passed in the wake of the horrific 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland high school, the state law provides police a path to ask a judge to temporarily bar dangerous individuals from possessing or purchasing a firearm. Since its creation, Florida judges have acted more than 8,000 times to keep guns out of the hands of people authorities deemed a risk to themselves or others, according to data maintained by the Office of the State Courts Administrator.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pomponio added another one to the list: A man accused of pointing two guns at his stepfather.\n\n“He was enjoying the whole thing,” the stepfather told the courtroom. His stepson’s wife even filmed the encounter, he said. “He said he wanted to eff me up.” One of the guns was later found in the bed of the stepson’s 11-year-old brother, a sheriff’s deputy told the courtroom.\n\nIn the aftermath of recent massacres in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, those looking to change the country’s gun laws see in Florida a blueprint to move forward – not only because leaders moved to restrict firearms, but because it emerged out of a Republican stronghold unofficially known as the “Gunshine State.”\n\n“The Florida law is a good law, and it’s a signal of what’s possible,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the most vocal advocates in Congress for gun control, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nIn Florida, a red flag policy, also known as risk protection orders, was one piece of a sprawling gun reform package that then-Gov. Rick Scott signed into law just three weeks after a teenage gunman killed 17 people inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It included $400 million in new spending for priorities like school security and mental health resources, and allowed trained school staff to carry firearms for the first time. Republican lawmakers also agreed to raise the age to own a gun to 21 and implemented a three-day waiting period to purchase most rifles.\n\n“I knew the time for thoughts and prayers, although necessary, was not enough,” said Bill Galvano, a Republican and the former state senator who sponsored the legislation.\n\nGalvano told CNN he began drafting the bill at his kitchen table after a tour of the carnage in Parkland. He incorporated ideas he had picked up from interviewing teachers and staff at the school. He was intent on including some gun safety reforms and focused on what he thought could pass. He was still learning how red flag laws worked when it was added to the draft.\n\nLooking at the data on the people who had guns taken away in Florida, Galvano says, “You have to believe that makes a difference.”\n\nResearch suggests red flags have made a difference where they’ve been implemented. One analysis of Connecticut’s red flag law, in place since 1999, found that for every 10 to 20 guns removed by a risk protection order led to one averted suicide. Another study found intimate partner homicides dropped in states where authorities can prohibit people convicted of “nonspecific violent misdemeanors” from possessing firearms.\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its Florida lobbyist, Marion Hammer, fiercely opposed the 2018 gun safety legislation. The organization’s influential scorecards loomed over the head of most Republican lawmakers. Hammer, a towering figure in Florida politics for decades, called GOP supporters “turncoat Republicans” and the organization urged its members to pressure lawmakers into abandoning the legislation. Galvano acknowledged that some of his colleagues were concerned the NRA would mount primary challenges against them in the coming elections.\n\nFormer state Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas, recounted the headwinds they faced with Republicans in power and the NRA throwing arounds its weight.\n\n“Yet, we rolled the NRA,” Moskowitz said, adding: “Not one Republican who voted for that bill in Florida has paid a political price for protecting kids and doing the right thing.”\n\nThe NRA responded by docking the scorecards of anyone who voted for the bill, and it knocked Scott from an A+ to a C. The organization also filed a lawsuit against the state over the new legislation. The case remains in court under appeal.\n\nHammer did not respond to an email for comment.\n\nStill, the law has survived as the legislature has grown more conservative and through the first term of Gov. Ron DeSantis. As a candidate in 2018, DeSantis said he opposed the gun restrictions in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act, telling one Florida newspaper he would have vetoed it.\n\nDeSantis has not publicly commented on the shooting in Uvalde and his office did not respond when asked if the governor supports Florida’s red flag law. He recently promised Florida would join other states that no longer require training or a permit to carry a firearm in public, like Texas.\n\nRepublicans lukewarm\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell previously told CNN he has encouraged Texas Sen. John Cornyn to work with Murphy on a middle-ground solution in response to the massacre inside the Uvalde elementary school.\n\nHowever, support for adopting risk protection orders like Florida’s appeared tepid as senators headed into the Memorial Day recess.\n\nEven Scott, who once called Florida’s response to the Parkland massacre “an example to the entire country that government can and must move fast,” now seems uncertain about a national risk protection policy. Scott, elected in 2018 to the US Senate, told The Washington Post: “It ought to be done at the state level.”\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of red flag laws have grown increasingly vocal as gun reform advocates hone in on the proposal.\n\n“What you’re essentially trying to do with the red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken. And it’s a really difficult thing to do, it’s difficult to assess whether somebody is a threat,” said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Republican from Texas. “Now if they are such a threat that they’re threatening somebody with a weapon already, well, then they’ve already broken the law. So why do you need this other law?”\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd defended Florida’s red flag law against Crenshaw’s characterization. Polk is a conservative county between Tampa and Orlando that former President Donald Trump won in 2020 by 14 points, and it is also the county that has issued more risk protection orders than any other in the state.\n\n“Let me tell Rep. Crenshaw, if that were so, then Florida, which is dominated by conservatives, the Republicans wouldn’t have passed (risk protection orders),” Judd said.\n\nJudd – who simultaneously describes himself as a law-and-order sheriff and a “Second Amendment guy” – defined a risk protection order as a “cooling off period” for people who have displayed dangerous behaviors. Some are experiencing a mental health episode or expressed a desire to hurt themselves. Others have made threats that may not rise to an arrest, or they are charged with a crime that won’t result in a loss of gun charges. The risk protection orders, he said, allows law enforcement to focus on prevention instead of reacting to an active shooter when “it’s too late.”\n\nIn a Polk courtroom last week, a young woman described her boyfriend putting a loaded gun to his head in front of her and his mother. In another case, a prosecutor told the judge that a woman named Carol “threatened to burn down her house and shoot any responders that would get there.” In both instances, the judge took away their ability to have a firearm.\n\nDavid Carmichael, an attorney who represents local police departments in Polk County in these cases, says in his experience, about half of the people facing risk protection orders willingly give up their right to a weapon without having to go through a hearing.\n\n“They don’t have an objection,” he said. “They say, ‘I’m in a bad place. I fully understand it’s a good idea.’ I expected more people to aggressively defend themselves.”\n\nRisk protection orders\n\nIn Florida, orders last for one year, and can be extended for another 12 months. At the time of the shooting in Uvalde, there were 2,845 people under risk protection orders in Florida, according to the state Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nJudges may require someone to undergo a mental health or substance abuse treatment before the order is lifted. However, unless convicted of a felony, most people are likely to get their firearms returned after a year.\n\nTampa city attorney Michael Schmid described an individual under the influence of a drug who was acting strange in public and making people uncomfortable. Police confronted him and found guns in every part of his car. They later searched his home and found an arsenal of 100 guns “if not more,” Schmid said, with some hidden in stuffed animals and a cat scratch post. A sign in the house said, “If they ever come in my house, I’m not going easy.”\n\n“I hope he accomplished something during the cooling off period and having him evaluated helped,” Schmid said. “But at the end of the day, he will get his guns back.”\n\nAs it is, some activists don’t see red flag laws as going far enough to curb gun violence. Many Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for the 2018 legislation to include a ban on the AR-15, the weapon used in the vast majority of mass shootings, and other semiautomatic long guns.\n\nIn a news conference with Florida Democrats in response to the Uvalde tragedy, state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando noted some states allow loved ones and family members to petition the courts for a risk protection order. Those are the people “who know the person best,” he said. Florida limits petitions to law enforcement.\n\n“That’s why it’s important in Florida that we expand on the good move we made in enacting the red flag law in the first place, to make sure we can continue to prevent these instances of gun violence,” Smith said.\n\nMoskowitz, now running to represent Parkland in the US House of Representatives, said moving the ball 20 yards is still a victory. “And you come back and you move the ball another 20 yards.”\n\nGalvano said Florida was able to act because the legislation “had aspects that both parties wanted and liked and aspects that both parties did not support.”\n\n“Look at the politics and understand we are a conservative state,” Galvano said. “We’re red by all accounts. And we were still able to make some reforms that were not traditional.”\n\n‘It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect’\n\nTony Montalto’s daughter Gina was killed inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. Within days of the massacre, he and other Parkland parents became a unified force in pressuring Florida lawmakers to take meaningful action.\n\nMontalto, as president of Stand with Parkland, has spent the last four years urging more states to follow Florida’s lead in hopes no parents would have to experience his pain. There are 19 states plus the District of Columbia with red flag laws, and 14 were passed after Parkland.\n\nIt’s a legacy that makes Montalto proud, but makes it all the more difficult to watch a similar tragedy unfold in Texas.\n\n“They would’ve been a lot safer had they taken advantage of simple things, such as red flags that we passed in Florida. This is simple stuff that keeps the majority of people safe,” Montalto said. “We heard extremists say this was a gun grab and all these bad things would happen. But the sky has not fallen. People still own guns. People still hunt. People still protect themselves. And yet, thousands of people in Florida have had their guns taken away to protect the majority of people.”\n\n“We had President Trump support red flag laws. We’ve seen President Biden support red flag laws. How come Congress has not acted?”\n\nShannon Frattaroli, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, is reviewing risk protection cases in six states, including Florida. Her research has found hundreds of examples of police using red flag laws to remove weapons from people who have threatened mass violence.\n\n“If even 1% of the orders that are issued in response to a threat of mass violence makes a difference, that’s pretty powerful,” Frattaroli said. “It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno Leyla Santiago Denise Royal", "Steve Contorno", "Leyla Santiago", "Denise Royal"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/08/23/republican-gop-debate-live-updates/70653558007/", "title": "Republican debate recap: Highlights as GOP candidates face off", "text": "Eight Republican presidential candidates battled Wednesday over Ukraine, abortion and the Jan. 6 Capitol riot as they gathered in Milwaukee for their first primary debate of the 2024 cycle.\n\nWith frontrunner Donald Trump absent, Vivek Ramaswamy took a lot of heat, with Mike Pence calling him a \"rookie\" and Chris Christie attacking him as an \"amateur.\"\n\nAs other candidates criticized Ramaswamy’s lack of experience, the Republican entrepreneur said his business background was a better asset to lead a \"revolution” and pitched himself as some who could offer a new generation of leadership.\n\nNikki Haley ripped into Ramaswamy for saying that the United States should cede eastern Ukraine to Putin. “You have no foreign policy experience and it shows,” she said.\n\nTrump’s name finally came up about an hour into the debate: The candidates were asked : Would you support Trump if he is convicted? Most of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\nWould you support Trump if he is convicted? Most of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection. Mike Pence got backup for the issue that has been the biggest weight on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes on Jan. 6, 2021 as Trump wanted.\n\nRepublican hopefuls make their pitch to voters\n\nDuring a 14-minute discussion, most of the GOP candidates said they would still support Trump, even if he is convicted of crimes and still wins the Republican nomination. They also said GOP voters are tiring of all the drama surrounding the former president.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" said former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. \"We can’t win a general election that way.\"\n\nTwo GOP candidates, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, again said that Trump's indictments disqualify him from leadership of the party or nation.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd at a sports arena in downtown Milwaukee.\n\nOn the stage in Milwaukee, most of the attacks went against businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, an upstart who has seen his poll numbers rise. Rivals like former Vice President Mike Pence hit Ramaswamy on his lack of government experience. Ramaswamy called than an asset.\n\nDeSantis, who is second to Trump in many polls, emerged from the debate relatively unscathed, but had no memorable quotes. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum used the debate to promote their own platforms.\n\nSome highlights from debate day:\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy spar about age on the debate stage\n\nWhen asked whether an elected president should pass a mental or physical test if above a certain age, Pence, 64, said Americans can make their own judgment. But he added that the country doesn’t need a president who’s too old, or a president who’s too young.\n\nRather, he said that the country needs a president who’s been there and knows how the government works.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, 38 and the youngest candidate on the debate stage, said that there needs to be a person of a different generation leading the country forward, and that he is the only candidate to do that.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublican candidates push to eliminate Education Department\n\nSeveral of the Republican candidates showed their support for eliminating the federal Department of Education.\n\n“We need education in this country, not indoctrination in this country,” Ron DeSantis said.\n\nRamaswamy agreed that the Department of Education should be shut down and said he supports parents choosing where they send their kids to schools. He said he believes high school students should have to pass a civics test, like individuals in the process of becoming American citizens.\n\nDoug Burgum, also in favor of removing the Department of Education, said the country forgets that education differs by state. He emphasized the need for schools to innovate.\n\nNikki Haley pushed for transparency in the classroom.\n\n“There’s a lot of crazy, woke things happening in schools,” she said, later adding, “Parents need to be deciding which schools their kids go to because they know best.”\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\n'C'mon, man': Chris Christie doesn't like UFO question\n\nThe former governor of New Jersey took umbrage at a \"lighting round\" question on whether presidents should \"level\" with the American people about UFOs.\n\n\"I get the UFO question? C'mon, man,\" Christie told Fox News' Martha MacCallum.\n\nHe did answer the question by saying: “The job of the president of United States is to level with the American people about everything.\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nSparks fly over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence tore into entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for saying he’d freeze the current lines of control in Ukraine in return for a promise from Russia that it would not form a military alliance with China.\n\nPence told Ramaswamy “if we do the giveaway that you want to” and give Putin eastern Ukraine, “it's not going to be too long” before he rolls across the border into a NATO nation.\n\n“Ukraine is not a priority for the United States of America,” Ramaswamy argued, raising China as a bigger threat.\n\nHaley argued that a win for Russia is a win for China and said Ukraine is the first line of defense.\n\n“You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows,” Haley told Ramaswamy.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nOther GOP candidates said Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6\n\nMike Pence got some back up for the issue that has been the biggest anchor on his candidacy: his refusal to interfere in the congressional counting of electoral college votes as Donald Trump wanted.\n\nAsked if Pence did the right thing on Jan. 6, 2021, other candidates said he did – though it took longer for some to get there than others.\n\nAfter Ron DeSantis tried to dodge the question, Pence said the American people deserve to know if everyone on stage would’ve done what he did.\n\n“Answer the question,” Pence said.\n\n“Mike did his duty,” DeSantis responded. “I’ve got no beef with him.”\n\nPence got his biggest backing from Chris Christie who said the former vice president stood up for the Constitution and deserves thanks, “not grudging credit.”\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says he would pardon Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump’s indictments over his handling of classified documents and the 2020 election have raised the question among his GOP rivals of whether they would pardon the former president if they're elected.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy said on the debate stage that he would pardon Trump, a position he has long held. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was \"inclined in favor\" of a pardon in an interview, though Haley noted that the discussions were still premature.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence said pardons would only be appropriate to weigh if Trump was found guilty. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Trump’s two most vocal critics, have leaned against a pardon.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nNikki Haley targets Donald Trump's electability\n\nDuring the 14-minute discussion of Donald Trump's legal problems, Nikki Haley was the only candidate who mentioned a political issue: His ability to win a general election.\n\n\"We have to face the fact that Trump is the most disliked politician in America,\" Haley said. \"We can’t win a general election that way.\"\n\nTrump will no doubt disagree with this assessment, but don't be surprised if other GOP candidates echo Haley's argument in the coming weeks.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump finally comes up: Most candidates will support him even if he is convicted, but not Chris Christie\n\nThe first Trump question came at 9:56 p.m., eastern, nearly an hour in: Would you support him if he is convicted?\n\nMost of the candidates raised their hands, while Christie raised an objection.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said, drawing boos from the crowd and criticism from Ramaswamy, who said the Justice Department is being weaponized against Trump.\n\nScott also criticized the Justice Department. So did DeSantis, though he said the party also needs to stop talking about this and look forward - presumably with him as president.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy says we are in a \"dark moment;\" Mike Pence disagrees\n\nMike Pence and Vivek Ramaswamy went at it again, this time over the moral climate of the nation.\n\nPence bashed Ramaswamy over his negativity, saying \"we just need government as good as our people.\"\n\nRamaswamy's reply: \"It is not morning in America. We are living in a dark moment and we have to confront that,\" an apparent reference to former President Ronald Reagan.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nGOP lacks uniform abortion message\n\nNikki Haley and Mike Pence’s exchange on abortion shows the hopscotch Republicans have to deal with since the Supreme Court knocked down Roe v. Wade.\n\nSix states have had reproductive rights questions on their ballot since then, and liberals have won all of those.\n\nOn the stage, most of the GOP contenders talked about a 15-week national ban being the standard, but Ron DeSantis talked up signing a 6-week ban in Florida. At one point Tim Scott, who often talks about his anti-abortion views, said that Congress should aim for a 15-week ban at least.\n\nBut others such as former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, don’t support a federal prohibition at all, saying it should be left up to the states.\n\nEach touted how they are a “pro-life” candidate, but there isn’t a uniform standard.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNikki Haley, Mike Pence tangle on abortion\n\nNikki Haley tried to argue to Republicans that they need to be honest with Americans when discussing a national abortion ban. Because any federal legislation will require 60 votes in the Senate, she said, party leaders should be trying to find a consensus on abortion issues, such as banning later abortions and agreeing not to jail women who get them.\n\nMike Pence, the strongest anti-abortion advocate on the stage, wasn’t having it.\n\n“Nikki, you’re my friend,” Pence said, “but consensus is the opposite of leadership.”\n\nPence said abortion is not an issue for the states to decide.\n\n“It’s a moral issue,” he said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMore than 45 minutes in − and no discussion of Donald Trump\n\nAfter more than 45 minutes, the debate moderators, and the candidates, have yet to discuss a big campaign issue: Donald Trump.\n\nMike Pence made passing references to the president who put him on the ticket in 2016, but neither he nor his rivals mentioned Trump's indictments or big poll leads.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVivek Ramaswamy falsely claims climate change agenda is a hoax\n\nVivek Ramaswamy during the debate claimed that climate change is a hoax, but that is inaccurate.\n\nThere is a wide range of proof that climate change is real, including research on increasing global temperatures, rising sea levels and and decreasing Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nScientific data show warming has accelerated since the mid-20th century and that human activities have contributed to that trend.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nChris Christie on Vivek Ramaswamy: ‘A guy who sounds like ChatGPT’\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie didn’t hesitate to attack entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy after the candidates were asked whether they believe in climate change.\n\n“I’ve had enough already tonight of a guy who sounds like Chat GPT stand up here…” Christie said, interrupting Ramaswamy.\n\n“The last person at one of these debates who stood in the middle of the stage and said, 'what’s a skinny guy with an odd last name doing here' was Barack Obama, and I’m afraid we’re dealing with the same type of amateur,” Christie added.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTim Scott tells opponents to stop being childish\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott sought to bring order to all the noise, telling colleagues that \"going back and forth\" and \"being childish\" will not help the American people.\n\nHis opponents are likely to continue being feisty.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHaley draws attention to being sole woman on stage\n\nAs several of the candidates traded insults, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley saw a chance to draw attention to her status as the only woman on stage.\n\n“This is exactly why Margaret Thatcher said, `If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask a woman,’” Haley said.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nNo one has 'the sway': South Carolina young Republicans on the GOP debate\n\nPedro Mateo, 29, said he thinks the debate will be more about setting the stage for determining a vice president or even 2028 candidate.\n\n“I don’t think anyone on the stage really has the sway to upend Trump,” Mateo said.\n\nMateo is the chairman of the political engagement committee for Young Greenville, a Republican club in South Carolina. He said regardless of who ultimately wins the nomination, he’ll support any candidate over the Democratic opponent.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nVivek Ramaswamy takes heat from Mike Pence\n\nSo far, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is getting the most heat, with former Vice President Mike Pence attacking him for a lack of government experience.\n\nAfter Pence called the rising Republican a \"rookie,\" Ramaswamy said his business background is a better asset to lead a \"revolution.\"\n\n\"We're just going to have some fun tonight,\" he said.\n\nLater, several candidates hooted at Ramaswamy for claiming he is the only candidate not \"bought and paid for.\" Chris Christie compared him to another guy with a \"funny name:\" Barack Obama.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley comes out swinging\n\nWhereas the other candidates played nice when they first spoke, Nikki Haley wasn’t having it.\n\nThe former South Carolina governor, who is the lone women running for the GOP nomination, drew first blood by attacking her rivals for supporting COVID-19 stimulus spending.\n\n“The truth is that Biden didn't do this to us, our Republicans did this to us too,” she said.\n\nHaley mentioned multiple candidates on the stage by name and Trump when slamming Republicans for raising the U.S. debt and supporting earmarks.\n\n“You tell me who are the big spenders,” she said. “I think it’s time for an accountant in the White House.”\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nRon DeSantis starts with an attack on Joe Biden\n\nThe moderators opened with a question about a song that bemoans the state of the nation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis used it as an excuse to bash President Joe Biden, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed suit.\n\nThe eight candidates on stage were quick to criticize Biden over a slate of economic issues, from inflation to job opportunities.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nThe lineup: The candidates' positions on the stage - and the polls\n\nThe candidates were introduced in the order of their place in political polls: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former Vice President Mike Pence, former South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.\n\nDeSantis and Ramaswamy are first and second, so they are in the center. They are flanked by Pence, Haley, Christie, Scott, Hutchinson and Burgum.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBrian Kemp chides Donald Trump for skipping debate\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp remains one of the few popular Republicans who won’t spare Donald Trump a criticism.\n\nKemp, who is mentioned as a possible 2024 contender, trekked to Wisconsin for the first GOP debate. He said the former president, who remains the clear front-runner, is making a big mistake by not joining the discussion.\n\n“Fight it out,” Kemp said on a podcast appearance.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNew Hampshire voters turn to Republican debate: ‘I’d like to see how everybody conducts themselves’\n\nEven though Kenneth Biel has narrowed down his vote for a few specific candidates in New Hampshire’s crucial first-in-the-nation primary, the debate he said, could sway him.\n\n“I’m open to hearing somebody change my mind,” said the 47-year-old software engineer from Chester. Biel said he is eyeing former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. But if a different candidate has a standout performance, the debate could change his mind.\n\n“I’d like to see how everybody conducts themselves,” Biel said, adding he’s open to “people who I disagree with.”\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWill Donald Trump attend the Republican debate?\n\nFormer President Donald Trump will be skipping the first Republican primary debate, citing his lead in GOP polls.\n\nThe former president had previously hinted he would not attend the event in Milwaukee, saying he did not want to give trailing rivals free shots at him on a debate stage.\n\n“The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his Truth Social platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!”\n\nMeanwhile, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson posted his taped interview of Trump on the X social media site at 8:55 p.m., eastern.\n\n– Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden's campaign mocks Donald Trump for ‘softball’ interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nAhead of Wednesday’s debate, the Biden campaign mocked former President Donald Trump for taking part in a “softball” interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that will air online simultaneously.\n\n“In his softball 'interview' posting tonight, Donald Trump will again make clear that he’s running on the same extreme and deeply unpopular MAGA agenda the American people have rejected time and time again,” Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a statement.\n\nMunoz said that instead of explaining his “broken promises” to bring manufacturing jobs to Wisconsin, Trump will likely “double down on his most out-of-touch positions, including his support for wild, debunked conspiracy theories and a national abortion ban.”\n\nThe Biden campaign has circled the first Republican primary debate as an opportunity to ramp up their attacks against the GOP field after staying mostly quiet since Biden announced his reelection bid in April.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhere do the Republican candidates stand on student loan forgiveness?\n\nEarlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden’s plan to forgive $400 billion in student loan debt, a move 2024 GOP candidates applauded.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on X that a president “cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors.” South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has supported legislation prohibiting Biden from cancelling student loan debt.\n\nLikewise, biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy also supported the court’s decision, sharing at the time: \"We have a bad habit in America of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do.\"\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFollow along as we fact-check the first Republican debate\n\nWas that fair criticism or cherry-picked data?

Follow our live fact-check file as we dig through the data, documents and transcripts to sort fact from fiction.\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate: What the Republican candidate hopefuls get right and wrong\n\n− Eric Litke\n\nBashing Biden: Democrat likely to be a GOP punching bag\n\nGOP candidates will be eager to demonstrate they have the best chance of beating President Joe Biden in the general election.\n\nA strategy memo put together by Ron DeSantis’ political action committee, which the candidate and his campaign have denounced, suggested the Florida governor focus his attacks on the Democratic president.\n\nDebaters will need little prompting to criticize Biden, although entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and several others have said they intend to use the primetime event to introduce themselves to voters and make the case for their own candidacies. Vice President Kamala Harris is also likely to be a target. DeSantis has been sparring with Harris over slavery, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has been critical of the vice president’s record. Haley has made a point of arguing that if anything happens to Biden, who is 80, Harris would succeed him as president.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nA crowd gathers in Milwaukee for Republican debate night\n\nIt's party time in Milwaukee: the Republican Party. As the debate approaches, ticket holders, Republican supporters and curious bystanders are enjoying the restaurant-and-bar areas near the city's sports arena.\n\nOthers have more organized activities.\n\nMore than 100 union members marched behind the arena, promoting labor rights and chanting \"we are the union/the mighty, mighty union.\" Another chant included the line \"Republicans hear our call!\"\n\nDown the avenue, an old-fashioned fife-and-drum corps led a group of Vivek Ramaswamy supporters dressed in Revolutionary War-era garb, topped by bonnets and tri-cornered hats, all in 99 degree weather.\n\nSpecial guests gathered in the plaza right beside Fiserv Forum, the home of professional basketball's Milwaukee Bucks. Food trucks, television tents, and a bandstand dotted the \"Block Party\" hosted by Young America's Foundation, one of the debate sponsors.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump declared Republican debate victory hours ago\n\nHours before the first Republican presidential debate even began, Donald Trump’s campaign was claiming victory, mocking his rivals and the network hosting the event.\n\n“President Trump has already won this evening’s debate because everything is going to be about him,” Chris LaCivita, who serves as a campaign senior adviser, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nLaCivita added how Fox News hosts will \"show an unnatural obsession\" with Trump by asking the other GOP contenders their reaction to the front-runner's policy positions. He said the campaign will even be looking for how many times the former president's name is brought up.\n\n“In fact, tonight’s Republican undercard event really shouldn’t even be called a debate, but rather an audition to be a part of President Trump’s team in his second term,\" he said.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nVivek Ramaswamy Googled most, Mike Pence least before Republican debate\n\nWhich candidate were Googlers most curious about leading up to the debate? That would be political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nHe was the subject of 40% of searches for candidates by name this past week, according to Google. Former President Donald Trump was next at 33%.\n\nThen there was a drop-off in interest with everyone else appearing in no more than 10% of searches.\n\nMike Pence, Trump’s former running mate, was last at 1%.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhich Republican candidates go beyond bashing Biden over inflation?\n\nWhen the candidates go after Joe Biden on the debate stage tonight, there’s a good chance they’ll bring up inflation. Although price increases have cooled over the past year, pocketbooks are still pinched and Republicans love to blame Biden.\n\nSome of the candidates have been more specific than others about what they would do differently.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence has an entire “Ending Inflation” plan that includes specific spending cuts, such as eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency. Both Pence and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy want to change how the Federal Reserve manages the economy.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott has backed a proposal to bar Congress from passing any legislation that would increase inflation when the inflation rate is 4.5% or higher.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nHow have the GOP candidates prepared for the Republican debate?\n\nFrom the tennis courts – entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy called his tennis practice this week “three hours of solid debate prep” – to the basketball courts – North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. GOP candidates employed a range of tactics to prepare for the debate.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis brought in debate coach Brett O’Donnell, who has experience prepping former President George W. Bush, former Arizona Sen. John McCain and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney for debates.\n\nOthers like former Vice President Mike Pence and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley relied on their prior political experience, with Pence falling back on the way he approached one-on-one vice presidential debates in 2016 and 2020 and Haley relying on her experience from 80 town halls she held in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nSen. Tim Scott will likely lean into his faith and role as the \"nice guy” in the race. Scott campaign spokesperson Nichole Morales told USA TODAY earlier this week he “will share his positive, conservative message on the debate stage in Milwaukee.”\n\n– USA TODAY staff\n\nFact-checking the GOP debate:What the Republican candidate hopefuls got right and wrong\n\nConservative advocacy groups descend on Milwaukee before presidential debate\n\nThe Republican presidential campaigns aren't the only political organizations in town for the debate − advocacy groups are also hanging around the city's pro basketball arena promoting their issues.\n\nEconomic conservatives, like the Club For Growth, and social conservatives, like the Faith & Freedom Coalition are represented in Milwaukee to lobby lawmakers and candidates, many of whom they back with money and voter turnout.\n\n\"We want to make sure they hear what our message is,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nIt's not just conservative groups taking advantage of the big political event.\n\nDeath Penalty Action, which describes itself as the only national organization strictly focused on stopping the death penalty, is also in town solicitating support for a national ban on capital punishment.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nWhat to know ahead of the debate: Here's where candidates stand on China, potential invasion of Taiwan\n\nRepublicans agree on what they argue is an urgent need to combat the military and economic threat from China. But that’s where their agreement on the issue ends.\n\nThe United States has traditionally had a policy of strategic ambiguity on whether it would send troops to Taiwan to defend the island in the face of a Chinese invasion. Former Vice President Mike Pence supports this policy and says the U.S. should keep providing Taiwan with military assistance.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has described China as the “most dangerous foreign threat we face since the second world war” and said it’s clear that Beijing is preparing for war. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he would do everything he could to avoid using the U.S. military against China, “but if it was unavoidable, I would do what needs to be done.”\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy says he would aggressively defend Taiwan – but only until the U.S. has semiconductor independence, which he has pledged to do by 2028. At that point, he said, would not risk war for “some nationalistic dispute between China and Taiwan.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nGOP candidates who won't be at presidential debate blast polling requirement\n\nGOP candidates Larry Elder and Perry Johnson announced on Tuesday that they planned to sue the Republican National Committee after not making the debate stage.\n\nElder alleged on X that the RNC notified him after he turned in his debate qualification package that one of the polls he cited would not count. Johnson’s campaign also sent an email claiming that the committee had rejected him because they weren’t accepting certain polls.\n\nGOP candidate Francis Suarez said on X that his campaign also faced a similar issue on Monday night, though he added that he respects the rules set forth by the RNC.\n\n“I am sorry that this debate will not include my perspectives from the largest growing voting block in our country - young, conservative Hispanics,” Suarez wrote.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFlying the flag: Donald Trump aides, supporters and surrogates swarm presidential debate site\n\nDonald Trump himself may not be in Milwaukee, but Trump World has a definite presence at the debate site.\n\nSurrogates like U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are out and about, giving television interviews promoting their favorite absent candidate. Trump campaign aides are also milling about the area around the Fiserv Forum and speaking to reporters.\n\nEveryday supporters have also flocked to downtown Milwaukee, despite temperatures in excess of 90 degrees, adorned in red or white Trump t-shirts and carrying signs. Part of their job, apparently: Wave the signs while standing behind television correspondents during live shots.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPlanned Parenthood highlights Mike Pence, Tim Scott and other GOP candidates’ position on abortion\n\nPlanned Parenthood launched this week its first ad in the 2024 presidential campaign, highlighting what five of the GOP candidates have said about abortion.\n\nThe first clip is of former Vice President Mike Pence, who has for decades tried to end government funding for Planned Parenthood and has taken the strongest anti-abortion stand in the 2024 field.\n\n“Every Republican candidate for president should support a ban on abortion,” Pence says in the clip.\n\nThe ad is running on social media and in Wisconsin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nUkraine war a pressure point for the GOP field\n\nThe Ukraine war could prove to be fertile ground for the large group of presidential hopefuls to differentiate themselves.\n\nSupport for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine is flagging inside the GOP electorate with Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s army making slow progress. Still, any suggestion that Ukraine is at fault for Russia’s violation of its sovereignty is likely to drive away establishment Republican voters.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ description of the conflict as a “territorial dispute” helped fuel his decline, even though he later backtracked the comment and called Putin a “war criminal.” Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also come under scrutiny for his views, including a proposal to allow Putin to keep parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nFormer U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Vice President Mike Pence are among the candidates who say that stopping Putin is vital to U.S. national security and helps to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nAsa Hutchinson, Chris Christie and other GOP candidates weigh in on Trump's indictments\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s indictments in both federal and state criminal cases have led some of his rivals to defend him, while others have sharply criticized him over the charges.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott have condemned the indictments on the campaign trail. Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have largely dodged questions about his criminal cases.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson have been some of Trump's most vocal critics, particularly after he was indicted for allegedly trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden. After Trump's federal indictment over the 2020 election, former Vice President Mike Pence said anyone who puts themselves above the Constitution should not be president.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: The newcomer on the presidential debate stage\n\nBiotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has faced scrutiny in recent days over conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attack, something his rivals could use to their advantage during the debate.\n\nIn an interview on CNN earlier this week, Ramaswamy claimed he was misquoted in an article about his 9/11 comments, though that wasn’t the case according to a recording released later.\n\nRamaswamy, a Trump-loving candidate who embraces meritocracy and anti-wokeness, has previously drawn scrutiny over comments on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, Juneteenth and more.\n\n– Rachel Looker and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nConservative Supreme Court could factor into GOP debate\n\nSeven years ago, during the first GOP debate of the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was criticized by several candidates.\n\n“It's time that we recognize the Supreme Court is not the supreme being,” then candidate Mike Huckabee quipped.\n\nWhat a difference a few years makes.\n\nThe nation’s highest court, which today is more conservative than it has been in decades, has already factored into the GOP primary. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump have swiped at each other over whether the bench is conservative enough. Last month, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy released a list of candidates he said he would nominate to the court, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nPresident Biden hopes to watch ‘as much as I can’ of Republican debate\n\nPresident Joe Biden is among the millions of Americans expected to tune in to tonight’s Republican primary debate.\n\n“I’m going to try to see — get as much as I can, yes,” Biden, who is vacationing in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, told reporters when asked if he plans to watch the debate.\n\nAsked about his expectations, Biden smiled and laughed. “I have none,” he said.\n\nWhile Republican frontrunner Donald Trump skips out on the debate in Milwaukee, Biden’s reelection campaign is going on the offensive during the event.\n\nThe Biden campaign launched a $25 million television ad blitz to coincide with the first Republican debate and dispatched surrogates to Milwaukee as Democrats seek to paint the eight Republicans on the debate stage as part of an extreme “MAGA” Republican Party.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump opts for interview with Tucker Carlson\n\nTrump may not be on the stage in Milwaukee, but he is expected to weigh in on the proceedings.\n\nA pre-taped interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson is scheduled to be posted at 9 p.m., eastern, the same time as the debate.\n\nTrump - who has also threatened to skip a second GOP debate scheduled for Sept. 27 in California - will likely comment on whatever happens in Milwaukee on Truth Social.\n\n“The public knows who I am & what a successful Presidency I had,\" Trump said Sunday on his social media platform, before adding: \"I WILL THEREFORE NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!”\n\n- Rachel Looker and David Jackson\n\nTrump, absent from the debate, remains frontrunner in GOP primary polls\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is still leading the polls for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, according to an average calculated by RealClearPolitics.\n\nHe has garnered 55.4% in an average of polls, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails behind him with 14.3%. Biotechnology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is in third with 7.2%, and former Vice President Mike Pence leads behind with 4% of support.\n\nIn line after those candidates are former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nTrump aides are all over media set-ups outside the debate venue in Milwaukee, promoting those polls and proclaiming the race all but over. “You can’t stop the Trump Train,” senior adviser Jason Miller said.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and David Jackson\n\nDoug Burgum rushed to emergency room a day before the GOP debate\n\nNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, 67, was rushed to a Milwaukee emergency room on Tuesday after he tore his Achilles tendon while playing basketball. He is currently using crutches.\n\nHowever, he will still be on the debate stage, according to a post he shared on X, the platform previously known as Twitter.\n\nBurgum, who did an early afternoon “walk through” said he wants to debate. A candidate with little name recognition, Burgum previously told USA TODAY his focus in the debate will be to introduce himself to Americans.\n\n– Francesca Chambers,David Jackson and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDemocrats look to get in a word at the Republican debate\n\nDemocratic Party officials are also zeroing in on the Milwaukee debate, trying to promote their messages in favor of President Joe Biden.\n\nSpeakers are doing national and local media hits, arguing that the Republicans are too extreme and too beholden to the missing debater, Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats also have paid advertising on local and national media, as well as billboards on highways surrounding Milwaukee. The signs feature Biden answering various Republican proposals.\n\nOne section of the billboard says \"tax cuts for yacht owners?\" Biden's response: \"Good luck with that, champ.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGOP debate location: Why it's in Milwaukee\n\nThe debate will take place at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin is one of several swing states that could decide the presidency in 2024. Out of the last six presidential elections, four have been decided by less than one percentage point in Wisconsin.\n\nThe debate will be held ahead of the Republican National Convention, which is also set to take place in the city next year.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nHow can you watch the Republican debate?\n\nThe first Republican primary debate is scheduled for Wednesday at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe debate, hosted by Fox News, will air on Fox News Channel as well as Fox Business Network. It will also be streamed at foxnews.com and on the streaming service Fox National as well as on Rumble, an online streaming platform.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nWho is in the Republican debate tonight?\n\nThe Republican National Committee formally announced that eight GOP candidates will take the debate stage Wednesday.\n\n- Rachel Looker, David Jackson\n\nWhat time is the GOP debate?\n\nThe debate is scheduled for 9 p.m. Eastern time.

Once in the United States, he did not enter right away, despite a brother who was already here. Instead, he first waited at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, not just to be processed but also so that he could be screened for tuberculosis as well as other contagious diseases.\n\nAdmittedly, screening methods were ineffective back then compared with now, but immigrants knew that it was part of gaining admission to this land of promise, land of sanctuary.\n\n120 years later, I was out on the street in front of my office recently when I saw a man lying in the hundred degree heat barely moving. I examined him with my stethoscope and found that he was still breathing. I called 911 and the ambulance took him to the hospital where I had trained, Bellevue, which proudly takes all comers. The ambulance attendants said they thought the man was a migrant who had crossed the border from Mexico, and without being detained had been bussed to New York City, where he had nowhere to go but the street.\n\nMayor Eric Adams, who was initially welcoming in our status of sanctuary city, is now expressing alarm as about 100,000 asylum seekers have come to New York City since spring 2022. Our shelters are full, and there are few other places for them to go than the streets and the summer heat.\n\nAdams is making a major plea to the state and Gov. Kathy Hochul, but so far not nearly enough has been done. A public health emergency for the city is a public health emergency for the state and for the country as well. USA TODAY just reported \"plans to use $25 million in state funds to rent temporary homes for up to 1,250 asylum-seeking families who opt to leave New York City's crowded shelters.\" But this is just a drop in the bucket.\n\nMigrants could be carrying infectious diseases\n\nLast week I also visited migrants, including many children who looked at me with sad, expectant eyes, camped outside the Roosevelt Hotel here in Manhattan, without proper means to wash or toilet or without guaranteed hydration.\n\nThey were immediately at risk for dehydration and dysentery. I offered them my medical services, but they proudly refused.\n\nWhy aren't we searching for answers?More young Americans are dying – and it's not COVID\n\nMigrants could be bringing infectious diseases across our southern border. When they are bussed to New York and elsewhere, these diseases go with them. A recent study showed that more than 4% percent of migrants from Central and South America to Europe were sick with Chagas' disease. It's contagious without the help of an animal or a blood-sucking bug and can cause serious complications, including heart failure.\n\nTuberculosis is on the rise in this country, as is syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that immigration applicants with communicable diseases are inadmissible to the United States, but they can’t be stopped if they aren't routinely screened before entering the country, as is the case with undocumented migrants.\n\nDr. Deborah L. Birx:Now that the COVID-19 national public health emergency is over, it’s time to fix the CDC\n\nWhat doctors and law enforcement face at the southern border\n\nNeha Jaggi Sood, a spokesperson at the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at the CDC, told me that though the CDC has ”comprehensive systems to track communicable diseases,” they do not “track diseases by immigration status.”\n\nSood added that “underreporting might occur.”\n\nDr. James Hodges, an internist practicing at the Texas border, told me that in his experience, the “open border” is leading to more drug-resistant tuberculosis in the United States because patients are only partly treated by over-the-counter antibiotics available in Mexico.\n\nIn southern Arizona, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb told me, “Border Patrol and local agencies have seen all types of diseases like tuberculosis, scabies, COVID, hepatitis A and B, gonorrhea, syphilis, mumps, chicken pox, dengue fever, etc. When the discussion was hot and heavy about Title 42 (a law that allows denial of entry to limit the spread of a disease) going away, I would consistently say it wasn’t just about COVID; it was about all the other health hazards being brought across our borders.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, head of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told me in a radio interview recently that it is measles that keeps him up at night. With measles vaccination rates dropping, and not all undocumented migrants are screened for measles before entry, he might well be right.\n\nMeasles and other vaccines are offered to eligible U.S.-bound migrants and refugees, but there's no enforcement in place yet.\n\nThe health risk extends wherever the migrants are sent, including here in New York City. The porous border is not just a national security crisis, it is also a public health emergency.\n\nDr. Marc Siegel, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at New York University's Langone Health.

New state health data show two more cases in Broward County, of a child younger than 5 and another between ages 5 and 9.\n\nThe newly reported infections bring the total to eight, just days after Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo contradicted federal and medical professional guidance to contain the spread of the highly contagious and preventable disease that's resurging globally and in the U.S. Florida is one of 11 states that have seen cases this year.\n\nIt's unclear if Florida's two new cases are connected to the school outbreak. Broward County Public Schools haven’t identified new cases since Tuesday, when there were six, district spokesperson John Sullivan said.\n\nThe state Department of Health said there was no additional information at this time.\n\nMeasles outbreak in Florida grows:What to know about virus flare-ups across the US\n\nIn a letter Tuesday, Ladapo said Manatee Bay parents and guardians could decide whether to send their children back to school, a statement that conflicted with federal and medical professional recommendations that children from the school should remain at home to prevent the spread of measles. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that unvaccinated children exposed to measles be isolated for three weeks. Ladapo appeared to agree with this assessment before he concluded that children’s attendance was up to parents or guardians because of the “high immunity rate” and the burden of healthy children missing school, but he said the state's recommendation could change.\n\nHealth experts are concerned by his lax attitude.\n\n“This is a state surgeon general saying that he is not going to enforce any of the tenets of public health in the name of freedom,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, which has worked to contain a recent measles outbreak among children in the Pennsylvania city. “He wants freedom at the expense of putting children in harm’s way.”\n\nThe only freedom Ladapo is upholding is the \"freedom to harm,\" Offit said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis tapped Ladapo to be surgeon general in 2021, in part because of his vocal opposition COVID-19 vaccine mandates and school closures. Last month, Ladapo said the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines pose health risks, defying federal approvals and scientific consensus.\n\nWith the measles outbreak, Ladapo again stands apart. Experts say that isolation and vaccination are the best way to stop the spread.\n\n“This is a vaccine-preventable disease,” Dr. Thresia Gambon, president of the Florida chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told USA TODAY. “There are very strict guidelines as to what to do in an outbreak in order to contain it quickly.”\n\nGambon’s organization, which represents pediatricians in the state, supports CDC’s recommendation that children at the school should have been told to isolate.\n\nMeasles map:See where measles cases are being reported across the US\n\nMeasles can come with serious risk. About 1 in 5 children who become ill end up in the hospital, the CDC said. And 1 in 1,000 can develop encephalitis, or brain swelling that can have neurological effects. Between one and three children in a thousand will die.\n\nA full-dose regimen of the vaccine is about 98% effective against measles. About 90% of unvaccinated people who come in contact with the virus will get it. Measles can be transmitted without physical contact. A person can catch it from droplets lingering in the air or on surfaces.\n\nAt Manatee Bay Elementary, 33 of the school's 1,067 students don’t have the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, said Sullivan, of Broward County Schools. That means about 97% have been given some percentage of their measles vaccine. Sullivan declined to say whether the six students who contracted measles had previously been vaccinated, citing privacy concerns.\n\nLess than 92% of Broward County kindergartners had been immunized as of 2022, in line with state figures. This is below national averages, which have shown declines in recent years, and the U.S. goal of 95% coverage with the measles vaccine.\n\nIn the meantime, parents at Manatee Bay have pulled their children out of school. On Tuesday, 219 students did not attend class in person, Sullivan said. By Friday, some had returned and 159 students remained at home.\n\nIn January, the CDC warned health providers they needed to do more to detect a potential measles spread in their communities amid a global rise in cases. The lack of large U.S. outbreaks so far signals there is still good immunization against measles through vaccines, said Dr. William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's International Vaccine Access Center.\n\nBut outbreaks could worsen in the right circumstances, Moss said, if enough unvaccinated children are exposed to the virus and they spread measles into a community.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/10/24/rsv-vaccine-shot-babies-new-cdc-guidelines/71299105007/", "title": "Shortage of RSV shots brings new CDC guidelines for babies and ...", "text": "Health officials are reeling back their recommendations about who is eligible for a shot that prevents severe respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, in infants amid a drug shortage that has coincided with a steady rise in cases.\n\nIn August, an advisory panel recommended the monoclonal antibody shot Beyfortus for all infants under 8 months entering their first RSV season. Children 8 to 19 months who are at increased risk of severe disease also were able to get the shot if they were entering their second season.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends prioritizing higher doses for babies younger than 6 months and infants who have underlying conditions putting them at risk for severe disease. The agency said parents of children 8 to 19 months should consider getting their babies another monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, if they're eligible.\n\nOne of the drug’s makers, Sanofi, blamed “unprecedented demand” in a statement and vowed to accelerate the production of additional supply along with the company's manufacturing partner AstraZeneca.\n\nThe tightened recommendations came as the CDC reported a spike in RSV cases nationwide. The cases are primarily concentrated in the southeastern U.S., where the agency issued a heath advisory last month. In the U.S., about 58,000 children younger than 5 are hospitalized for RSV each year, and several hundred die of the disease every year.\n\nCOVID vaccineThe new booster appears harder to find. Here's why.\n\nBefore the shortage became apparent, health officials had said babies could get a shot of Beyfortus like a vaccine before the RSV season, which typically runs from fall into winter. Results from clinical trials show the drug prevents RSV lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children entering or during their first RSV season.\n\nThe monoclonal antibody is the first of its kind to be widely available to everyone beyond a small population of immunocompromised children. The other option – palivizumab – is recommended only for high-risk infants born severely premature at 29 weeks or earlier. That drug requires monthly injections.\n\nHealth officials are urging doctors to encourage pregnant patients to get a new vaccine designed to protect newborns from RSV. Babies who receive that drug in utero, don't require followup shots of the antibody vaccine.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on X, formerly Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Those actions include staying at home when sick, staying up to date with vaccines, practicing good hygiene and improving indoor air quality.\n\nThe change marks the first time the agency has revised its coronavirus guidelines since 2021. It is intended for people and employers, not for hospitals or nursing homes that have separate guidance, the CDC said.\n\nCDC officials called the change a streamlined approach that’s easier for people to understand and more in line with circulating respiratory viruses that spread the same way and have similar symptoms.\n\nThe announcement reflects progress made in reducing hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 over the last two years, CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a Friday news conference. Still, she emphasized continued use of vaccines and treatments.\n\n“We're in a different situation, but we must use the tools that work to protect against respiratory viruses,” she told reporters. “That’s why our updated guidance emphasizes some core prevention actions to protect against severe illness from respiratory viruses.”\n\nIn February, the Washington Post first reported on the CDC's plans to change the guidance.\n\nWhat guidance does\n\nFriday's guidance, CDC officials said, is meant to target respiratory viruses more broadly because the flu, RSV and COVID-19 all have similar symptoms such as cough and fever; have similar means of spread; and require the same protection strategies.\n\nThe CDC is recommending that people who test positive for the coronavirus should base their isolation period on clinical symptoms. The CDC doesn't recommend testing as a standard for deciding when someone is no longer contagious, in part, because CDC surveys show fewer people use at-home tests if they have symptoms, according to Dr. Brendan Jackson, who leads respiratory virus response for CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease. The CDC's decision is more streamlined to tell people to stay home if they are sick.\n\nAmericans can return to public life if they have been fever-free for at least 24 hours and symptoms are improving, regardless of a positive test, agency officials told reporters on Friday. When they return to normal activities, the CDC recommends people use preventative strategies for the next five days. This includes limiting close contact with others, enhancing hygiene like hand-washing, improving ventilation, masking and testing as needed.\n\nOfficials said the federal action followed similar updated guidance from California and Oregon, which were the first states to announce new COVID-19 guidelines in early January that also did away with specific isolation times.\n\nDr. Lara Jirmanus, a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School, said people may struggle to interpret this new guidance.\n\nExclusive:Health is political, Americans are divided. How new CDC head aims to fix that.\n\n“This guidance is going to be confusing to people because when they hear it, they're going to hear, ’the CDC now says COVID is not a big deal,’” said Jirmanus, a primary care doctor in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “That's not true. It's a deadly and disabling virus.”\n\nShe added people who are repeatedly infected increased their risk of developing long COVID, a potentially disabling condition that inflicts millions of Americans. Infants not yet eligible for vaccination remain at risk, as well.\n\nRecent weekly reporting periods indicate nearly 19,000 people are hospitalized and more than 1,000 die from COVID-19 each week. However, Jackson, of the CDC, said COVID-19 figures are now approximately the same as those for the flu and far lower than early in the pandemic.\n\n“These data reinforced that COVID-19 is still an important public health threat, but it is not the emergency that it once was,” Jackson said. “Its health impacts increasingly resemble those of other respiratory virus viral illnesses.”\n\nHow public should respond\n\nAnyone who has a respiratory illness ‒ a cough, stuffy nose, often a fever ‒ should assume they have either COVID-19, the flu, or RSV, all of which kill tens of thousands of vulnerable Americans a year, said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nHe recommends that people at risk for severe disease from COVID-19, including those who are pregnant, immunocompromised, or over 65, get tested quickly if they develop these symptoms so they can benefit from the very effective available treatments, Paxlovid and the antiviral Molnupiravir.\n\nAnyone not at high risk should just assume they have one of these highly contagious infections and should wear a mask to protect the vulnerable, Offit said.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said he's one of the few people in his Nashville, Tennessee, region still masking in public.

But, he added, what's important is preventing hospitalizations, severe illness and deaths in the face of a virus that \"is much more transmissible than the flu or than a regular rhinovirus that gives you the common cold.\"\n\nWestern states moved first\n\nThe CDC's shift mirrors updated guidance from California and Oregon, which were the first states to announce new COVID-19 guidelines in early January that also did away with specific isolation times.\n\nIn California's order, issued on Jan. 9, the changes were attributed to the reduced impact of COVID-19 compared to past years, the availability of treatment and the changing expectations to keep people most at-risk safe while posing minimal disruptions to the public.\n\nThose who experience no apparent symptoms are no longer required to isolate at all, according to the state policies.\n\n“We are now at a different point in time with reduced impacts from COVID-19 compared to prior years due to broad immunity from vaccination and/or natural infection, and readily available treatments available for infected people,” the director of the California Department of Public Health Dr. Tomás Aragón said in the state order.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThe concern remains for people returning to work while contagious, which is often the case for people who can’t afford to take time off.\n\nCohen said the CDC is encouraging companies to allow employees to stay home when they’re sick, regardless of whether it's COVID-19 or another respiratory viral illness.\n\nThe decision also comes as the CDC earlier this week recommended a booster shot of the latest COVID-19 vaccine for people ages 65 and older. Cohen said it’s important to get vaccinated, with an updated COVID-19 and flu shots expected this fall.\n\nKaren Weintraub contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/child-vax-rates-school-mandates/index.html", "title": "Covid-19 vaccines will be on the 2023 vaccine schedule, but that ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nCovid-19 vaccines will be part of recommended immunization schedules in 2023 for both children and adults, after a unanimous vote by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s independent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nThat doesn’t make the vaccines mandatory for anyone, a point that was emphasized in a discussion before Thursday’s vote. The board members addressed concerns from the public that adding Covid-19 vaccinations to the schedule would force schools to require the shots.\n\n“We recognize that there is concern around this, but moving Covid-19 to the recommended immunization schedule does not impact what vaccines are required for school entrance, if any,” said Dr. Nirav Shah, a committee member and director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“Indeed, there are vaccines that are on the schedule right now that are not required for school attendance in many jurisdictions, such as seasonal influenza. Local control matters, and we honor that. The decision around school entrance for vaccines rests where it did before, which is with the state level, the county level and at the municipal level, if it exists at all. They are the arbiters of what vaccines are required, if any, for school entry. This discussion does not change that.”\n\nIn fact, Covid-19 vaccines are explicitly banned from being included in school mandates in at least 20 states. Only California and the District of Columbia have announced that Covid-19 shots will be among mandated vaccinations for students, but those mandates were not implemented for this school year.\n\nIt’s been nearly a year since eligibility for the Covid-19 vaccine was expanded to include everyone in the US 5 and older, but coverage among children still lags behind that of adults. Even as these vaccines and the related mandates have become highly politicized over the course of the pandemic, experts say vaccine hesitancy among parents isn’t new.\n\nAlthough the Covid-19 shot will not become mandatory for school, all 50 states do have laws requiring specific vaccines for students – most of which include shots for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) and varicella.\n\nUptake for these vaccines, mandated by schools long before Covid-19, fell during the pandemic.\n\nIn the 2020-21 school year, vaccination coverage for kindergarteners fell to less than 94% – dropping below the overall target of 95% that was set as an objective by the US Department of Health and Human Services in the Healthy People project for the first time in six years.\n\nA CNN analysis of the latest CDC data suggests that students in states with stricter school vaccine requirements are more likely to have their shots.\n\nAll school immunization laws grant exemptions to children for specific medical reasons. But 44 states and Washington, DC, also grant religious exemptions, and 15 states allow philosophical or moral exemptions for children, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAccording to the CNN analysis, states that were stricter with exemptions were much more likely to still meet the 95% coverage target. In the 2020-21 school year, an average of about 96% of kindergarten students had their MMR vaccine in states that allowed only medical exemptions, compared with 92% of students in states that also allowed philosophical or moral exemptions.\n\nThe full effect of the pandemic on children’s routine vaccination rates isn’t clear: It will be another few months before the CDC shares national data for compliance rates for mandatory vaccinations in the 2021-22 school year, and schools are in the midst of outreach and programming to ensure that as many students as possible will continue through the 2022-23 school year up to date on their vaccines.\n\nVaccine hesitancy isn’t new\n\nCorrecting the drop in vaccination coverage in students will probably depend more on better access to care, information and outreach – and school vaccine mandates can help.\n\nWith many people who are hesitant, it’s “because of something they’ve heard or something they’ve read,” said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a pediatrician who co-authored a clinical report about countering vaccine hesitancy in 2016. “Most people [who are hesitant] have a very free-floating worry about vaccines. It’s not specific in most cases.”\n\nA small share of parents – about 2% or 3% – are adamantly opposed to vaccines, and that rate has stayed mostly consistent over the years, said Hackell, who is also chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Practice and Ambulatory Medicine.\n\nOverall vaccination coverage fell among kindergarteners in the 2020-21 school year, but the share of students who had an exemption also declined from 2.5% to 2.1%, according to CDC data. The rate has changed by less than 1 percentage point over the past 10 years.\n\nAbout 3% of kindergarteners in the US – about 120,000 students – were considered to be out of compliance with mandatory vaccines in the 2020-21 school year.\n\n“Mandates may not do anything to those people who would pull their kids out of public school,” Hackell said. “But the vast majority of parents are not opposed. They’re hesitant, or they’re uncertain. And when there’s pressure to do it for another reason, such as getting your kid into school, they come around.”\n\nResponsibility for enforcing vaccine mandates falls to the education system, and practices vary by state. Some students are ultimately turned away because they aren’t up to date, but most states offer provisional enrollment periods that allow kids to stay in school if they are in progress with at least one shot in a series or evidence of an upcoming appointment.\n\nAccording to the CDC, “school officials may prefer to keep students in school where they have access to education, safe supervision, nutrition, and social services while working with parents or guardians to get children vaccinated.”\n\nAnd many states do their best to help students stay up to date on their immunizations, with vaccination drives and direct followup with parents.\n\n“I think that the drop in the past year or two is partly pandemic-related,” Hackell said. “What we’re seeing, I think, is a little bit of a disparity between kids who have a medical home and have a private [doctor] versus kids who get their immunizations from a public source” like a school clinic.\n\nA model of high vaccination: Mississippi\n\nMississippi is an impressive example of finding ways to keep child vaccination rates high, Hackell says. Public schools are the only option for many in the state, where poverty rates are higher than anywhere else in the US.\n\nDespite the large public need and additional resource struggles that the pandemic brought, 99% of kindergarteners in Mississippi met required vaccination coverage in the 2020-21 school year – better than any other state, according to the CDC.\n\n“They’ve done a tremendous job at that,” Hackell said, and it demonstrates the power of mandates. Mississippi is strict with exemptions – one of just six states allowing medical reasons only – and just 0.1% of kindergarteners were exempt in the 2020-21 school year.\n\nHackell says he would be most concerned if he sees a sustained drop in vaccination rates for highly transmissible diseases, especially measles and polio. And he’s worried about pockets of low vaccination rates in certain communities.\n\nSchools are public spaces with a level of control, and 95% vaccination coverage is a goal with intent.\n\n“We know it’s never going to be 100% because there are some people who cannot medically be vaccinated. But if you have 95%, that means in any given school classroom of 30 kids, there might be one unvaccinated kid. And so if that child brings a case of something into the class, there’s nobody else to give it to,” he said. “It stops there with one case.”\n\nAnd when it comes to adding Covid-19 vaccines to the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule, the focus is still on public health – not on adding another requirement.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’ve had parents who come in my office, and I say, ‘What are you here for?’ And they say, ‘Well, we’re here for vaccines so that our kids can go to school.’ And I’ve said, ‘OK, I understand that, but really I’m not vaccinating so you can go to school, I’m vaccinating because I want to prevent serious disease and death in your kids,’ ” Dr. Matthew Daley, an ACIP member and senior investigator with the Institute for Health Research at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, said at Thursday’s advisory meeting.\n\n“And the fact that there’s a school immunization requirement helps because it brought you into the office, but that’s not my goal. My goal is to prevent serious disease.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/07/22/deadly-covid-style-pandemic-could-easily-start-in-us-report-finds/70442786007/", "title": "Deadly, COVID-style pandemic could easily start in US, report finds", "text": "The next global pandemic could come from the United States.\n\nThat's the sobering message of a report from Harvard Law School and New York University, examining how humans, livestock and wild animals interact here.\n\nMany familiar ‒ and terrifying diseases ‒ originated in animals, including HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Zika, pandemic flu and COVID-19. Some started in other countries, typically on the African or Asian continents. These so-called zoonotic diseases are often blamed on poor hygiene, lack of government oversight, or unsafe practices in those places.\n\nWhile Americans often think \"it couldn't happen here,\" regulations are so loose and interactions so frequent, researchers found, that a virus or another contagious bug could easily jump from animals to people in the U.S., sparking a deadly outbreak.\n\n\"There really is this false sense of security and unfounded belief that zoonotic disease is something that happens elsewhere,\" said Ann Linder, one of the report’s lead authors and associate director of policy and research with the Brooks McCormick Jr. Animal Law & Policy Program at Harvard Law School. \"In fact, I think we're more vulnerable than ever in many ways.\"\n\nThe report, also led by NYU's Center for Environmental and Animal Protection, highlights several areas of vulnerability, including commercial farms where millions of livestock come into close contact with each other and their handlers; the wild animal trade in which animals are imported with few or no health checks; and the fur trade in which minks and other animals are bred for their coats, with little safety oversight.\n\n\"Through globalization, we've erased seas and mountains and other natural boundaries of disease,\" said Linder, an expert in law and animal policy. \"We're mixing animals and pathogens across different continents and circulating at a dizzying and ever-increasing pace.\"\n\nAbout 10 billion land animals are raised in the U.S., a number which is increasing by about 200 million a year, according to the report. Pigs and poultry, for instance, are raised in higher numbers in the United States than almost anywhere else in the world, the report found, and are the most likely vectors for a particularly lethal outbreak of the flu.\n\nIndustry representatives were quick to defend the safety of their practices.\n\n“According to the CDC, the likelihood of spreading an avian disease to a human in the United States is extremely rare,” Ashley Peterson, National Chicken Council senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, said in an emailed statement.\n\nA pork industry group did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nWorkers on pig and poultry farms are particularly vulnerable because of a lack of regulations protecting them, said Delcianna Winders, an associate professor of law and director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at Vermont Law and Graduate School in Royalton.\n\n\"There is virtually no regulation of on-farm raising of animals. There's limited regulation of the slaughterhouse but it is extremely inadequate and it's getting worse,\" said Winders, who was not involved in the report, but researches a similar area. \"Right now, the federal government is deregulating slaughter, rather than increasing oversight.\"\n\nBecause the mink and larger fur industry does not produce food, it is even less regulated, Linder said.\n\nA different study publishedlast week in \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,\" found \"that mink, more so than any other farmed species, pose a risk for the emergence of future disease outbreaks and the evolution of future pandemics.\" Other studies have shown that mink are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and outbreaks were detected on 18 American mink farms during the pandemic's first two years. At least four Americans, two of whom worked on mink farms, were believed to have been infected by the animals.\n\nChallis Hobbs, Executive Director of the Fur Commission USA, a trade group, said \"we unequivocally assert our commitment to the health and safety of our animals, our workforce, and the communities in which we operate.\"\n\nThe industry, working with the federal government and state agencies, vaccinated 95% of the U.S. mink population beginning summer 2021, he said. The cost was entirely covered by the mink farmers, who also are helping to fund a SARS-CoV-2 surveillance project on mink farms.\n\n\"Despite claims from animal rights advocates,\" he said, \"there is no significant threat to the general public from U.S. farmed mink.\n\nAbout 220 million live wild animals are imported into the United States every year for pets and other purposes, many without health or safety checks, Linder said.\n\nIf someone wants to bring a dog or cat into this country, there's a process, Linder said. \"But if I'm a wildlife importer and I want to bring in 100 wild mammals from South America, I can do that with very little regulation of any kind.\"\n\nPerhaps the earliest Ebola case, which sparked the outbreak in West Africa from 2013 to 2016, was blamed on bush meat. It's illegal to import bush meat to the United States, but it's not illegal to import the same live animals that bush meat comes from, she said. \"There are wide gaps.\"\n\nBoth Linder and Winders also highlighted the lack of industry transparency.\n\n\"So much of this is hidden from public view,\" Winders said. \"There's so much we don't know because we're not monitoring.\"\n\nWinders said she's concerned about how much money the government spends subsidizing and protecting industries she believes put the American public at risk. She hopes Congress will take advantage of this year's reenactment of the Farm Bill to limit subsidies and impose new safety regulations on animal industries.\n\n\"Don't we see the writing on the wall?\" Winders asked. \"Scientists are telling us there's a looming threat of a zoonotic outbreak that could make COVID look like a cakewalk, and we're still just ignoring it, even after what we've gone through over the last couple of years.\"\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com and Adrianna Rodriguez at arodriguez@usatoday.com.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible, in part, by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders posted on X, formerly Twitter. \"Rest assured that as long as I’m Governor, Arkansas will not force our kids to wear masks in school.\"\n\nYet far from embracing mask mandates, the White House is trying to stay out of the politically fraught issue, arguing it is up to local officials to decide whether they want to follow mask guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's a marked departure from the COVID-19 politics of a few years ago, when President Joe Biden actively encouraged Americans to wear masks.\n\n\"It is up to the schools,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday. \"It is the decisions of the districts to decide what they want to do with the guidelines that they’ve been provided by CDC.\"\n\nShe stressed there are no federal mandates: \"These are guidelines. To be very, very clear: These are guidelines.\"\n\nMost of the country has ditched masks, polling shows\n\nConvinced that most Americans have no appetite to return to masks or social distancing, Republicans have highlighted a growing list of mask mandates in schools, hospitals and other public spaces. Most of the nation isn't affected by the policies, nor is any sort of federal mandate under consideration.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, introduced legislation to ban all federal mask mandates. \"This is coming back unless we stop it from happening,\" Vance warned.\n\nMuch of the country − with COVID-19 vaccines available for protection against the virus − long ago ditched their face masks.\n\nOnly 12% of Americans said they wear masks outside their home regularly, according to a Yahoo News/YouGov poll last month, down from 27% in January and 60% in January 2022. Fourteen percent of respondents said they \"think less\" of those who wear masks.\n\n“Here's my real theory on mask mandates,\" said Rick Cannon, 69, of Cape Coral, Florida, who invented a lockout device for circuit breakers. \"If you get the vaccine and the vaccine works, then you're protected. Why would you try to force other people to wear a mask because you're already protected?”\n\nIn response to an increase in COVID-19 cases, very few communities, most of them in areas that lean Democratic, have brought back masks in recent days. Hospitalizations nationally as a result of COVID-19 were up 15.7% between Aug. 20 and Aug. 26, according to the CDC, and deaths from COVID-19 were up 17.6%.\n\nIn Silver Spring, Maryland, outside Washington, D.C., Rosemary Hills Elementary School reinstated a mask mandate for students and staff Tuesday after at least three people in one class tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, announced a plan Tuesday to distribute N95 masks to students as the school year begins, but they aren't required to wear them.\n\nThe health care company Kaiser Permanente put in place a mask mandate in August for staff, patients and visitors at its facilities in Santa Rosa, California. And in Atlanta, Morris Brown College announced late last month that it would require students and employees to wear face masks on campus for two weeks − a measure that was later lifted.\n\nJenny Longhurst, 60, an operations manager at Beyond Productions in Los Angeles who has battled COVID-19 twice, told USA TODAY she supports mask mandates.\n\n“I had it quite badly,\" said Longhurst, a Democrat and mother of twin boys. \"So I don't think it's too big of an imposition to just wear masks to try and keep everyone safe.\"\n\nBiden's new nonchalant attitude on masks is telling\n\nBiden flouted COVID-19 mask protocols Wednesday when he arrived at a White House event holding, not wearing, a mask. The moment came just days after he was in close contact with his wife, first lady Jill Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday.\n\nThe president even joked about not wearing it like he should − a strong signal he has no plans to return the country to COVID-19 restrictions of the past.\n\n\"Don't tell them I didn't have it on when I walked in,\" Biden said, openly violating the CDC recommendation for people who have been in close contact with someone infected with the virus to wear a high-quality mask when indoors and around others for 10 days.\n\nSome Americans are skeptical N95 and other high-quality masks stop the spread of COVID-19, despite the advice of the CDC and medical professionals.\n\n\"Personally, I think that the masks aren't going to do anything to protect me very much,\" said Katie Hodge, 33, a registered independent from Sacramento, California, who works as a personal assistant in real estate.\n\nHodge has a 6-year-old daughter who was too young to be in school at the height of the pandemic in 2020 but was in day care where masks were required. Hodge said she would not like to see school mask mandates return and would prefer measures such as social distancing.\n\n\"I think it's really mean to make kids wear masks,\" Hodge said. \"My heart broke every day because she cried and cried and cried that it was hard for her to breathe when she was running around.\"\n\nA hodgepodge of COVID protocols in schools nationwide\n\nMore than three years after the height of the pandemic, the CDC still recommends that school districts require masks in areas with high levels of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Only 15 counties met the threshold nationwide as of late August, according to The Washington Post.\n\nStudents and teachers with “known or suspected exposure” should wear a mask for 10 days after they’re exposed even if they’re vaccinated, according to the agency. But anyone who chooses to wear a mask, the agency says, “should be supported in their decision to do so at any COVID-19 hospital admission level, including low.”\n\nHow schools districts follow the guidance varies wildly .\n\nA junior high school in rural Cuba, Alabama, advised students, employees and visitors a few weeks ago to wear masks after a slow rise in COVID-19 cases. Talladega City Schools, also in Alabama, made a similar recommendation.\n\nMeanwhile, the Los Angeles Unified School District, once known for some of the harshest COVID-19 protocols in the nation, is now advising students to still come to school even if they’re “mildly sick” to combat chronic rates of absenteeism.\n\nEleven laws have passed over the past two years to ban school districts from enforcing mask mandates, according to an analysis from EdWeek.\n\n“Probably the most important thing from a school perspective is that messaging about keeping children home when they’re sick,” said Lynn Nelson, president-elect of the National Association of School Nurses.\n\nTrump and other Republicans embrace a new COVID fight\n\nDespite the White House's reluctance to embrace masks during the COVID-19 resurgence, Republican presidential candidates are working to make mandates an issue in their nomination fight, appealing to conservative voters who are still angered by pandemic-era restrictions.\n\n\"The left-wing lunatics are trying very hard to bring back COVID lockdowns and mandates,\" said former president and GOP front-runner Donald Trump in a recent video.\n\nHe added: \"Gee whiz, you know what else is coming? An election.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, returning to the campaign trail this week after tending to hurricane damage in his state, also hit mask mandates.\n\nIn a Facebook post, DeSantis said \"they want to muzzle your children\" and vowed political retribution for mandates. \"When I'm president, there will be a reckoning for the harm they've done to kids in pursuit of a political agenda,\" DeSantis said.\n\nOther candidates also jumped on the anti-mask bandwagon. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley described mandates as attacks on parental rights. \"We don't co-parent with school boards and we don't co-parent with the government,\" she said before a campaign event in New Hampshire.\n\nIn Congress, Senate Republicans introduced legislation to stop future federal mask mandates, even though the Biden administration hasn't shown any signs of proposing a nationwide mandate. Although a previous U.S. travel mandate − overturned by a federal judge in 2022 − required masks on planes and trains, the U.S. never had a blanket mask policy for public schools and other public spaces.\n\nBiden ended the federal government's national and public health emergency declarations in May as Republicans in Congress threatened to end it immediately through legislative action.\n\nVance, R-Ohio., who introduced the bill banning federal mask mandates, dubbed the Freedom to Breathe Act, said that if the White House and Democrats are not pushing for new mandates, his legislation should be allowed a vote on the floor.\n\nVance tried to fast-track his legislation Thursday afternoon in the upper chamber but failed to push through the bill past Democratic objections. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., among those who objected, called it a “red herring\" and “misleading” on the Senate floor.\n\n“My bill gives you a perfect opportunity to go on the record with that fact,” Vance told reporters. “The concern here is not that there’s going to be a federal mask mandate tomorrow. I think the concern is that if you continue to have this massive national freakout over a small spike in COVID cases, we can have (mandates) next month, and we’re trying to get ahead of that fact.”\n\nSen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., a co-sponsor of Vance’s bill, echoed those sentiments: “Better be prepared rather than complain about it after the fact.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/us/us-border-entry-food-rules-cec/index.html", "title": "If you're planning to travel to the US with food items, read this | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nUnited States border officials have a message for travelers who bring food items from overseas: Violations will cost you.\n\nLast month, a passenger traveling from Indonesia to Darwin Airport in Australia’s Northern Territory was fined $1,874 after two egg and beef sausage McMuffins – along with a ham croissant – were found in their luggage.

Introducing it in the US ecosystem could be detrimental to the agriculture industry, the CBP said.\n\n“We work closely with the US Department of Agriculture, Animal and Health Inspection Services to prevent the introduction of plant pests and foreign animal diseases,” a CBP spokesperson told CNN.\n\nWhat food products are not allowed into the country?\n\nMost meat, poultry, milk and egg products are either banned or restricted in the US – with rules depending on the country of origin and what livestock diseases are prevalent in the region.\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture prohibits animal and bird products from countries with reported cases of livestock diseases such as mad cow, foot-and-mouth, avian flu and swine fever. The USDA provides a link where travelers can check common animal diseases in specific countries.\n\nSometimes, there are gray areas. Pork products from Mexico are banned, for example, but a small amount for personal use – like a ham sandwich – may be allowed at land borders if the meat is thoroughly cooked.\n\nWhat food products can you bring?\n\nA long list of food items are allowed into the US, including condiments, cooking oils, bread, cookies, crackers, cakes, cereal, packed tea and other baked and processed products. The CBP provides a list of allowed items on its website.\n\nJarvis, a beagle, works in the baggage claim area at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.

And every agricultural food item has to be declared on US Customs forms, so inspectors can examine them and ensure they do not carry harmful foreign pests or diseases.\n\n“The declaration must cover all items carried in checked baggage, carry-on luggage or in a vehicle,” the CBP’s website notes.\n\nCan you bring in fruits or vegetables?\n\nThe short answer is no.\n\nNearly all fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are prohibited from entering the US due to risks of pests and diseases – some of which can survive in frigid temperatures, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Even the fruits and vegetable snacks provided on an airplane or cruise ship should be left behind, says Lucero Hernandez of the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n\nTravelers crossing a land border into the United States from Canada can bring some fresh fruits and vegetables – as long as they were grown in Canada. But they need proof that the produce is free of soil, pests, and diseases, and that it was grown in Canada, not just sold there, the USDA says.\n\nAnd in all cases, travelers coming to the US should save receipts and original packaging to prove food products’ country of origin, according to the CBP.\n\nWhat happens if you bring forbidden items?\n\nTravelers who declare agricultural products in their luggage don’t face penalties – even if an inspector concludes the items are not eligible to enter the country, the USDA says. In such cases, the food is destroyed.\n\n“An apple or snack that can mistakenly be brought won’t always make a significant incident,” the CBP spokesperson explained of an unintentional failure to declare a food item. “However, attempting to bring in prohibited items would lead to traveler delays and may result in a fine.”\n\n“Failure to declare a prohibited food item may result in the issuance of a civil penalty,” the spokesperson added.", "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2022/02/25/mask-mandate-travel-cdc-guidelines/6938530001/", "title": "Yes, masks are still required on planes and at airports despite new ...", "text": "Flying soon?

(Kelly retired as CEO this month.)\n\nThough welcomed by the industry and unions, the federal mask mandate has not put an end to in-flight resistance by some passengers; frequent high-profile incidents have delayed or diverted flights, and passengers were escorted off planes.\n\nThere have been 607 unruly passenger incidents in 2022, 397 of which were tied to masks, the Federal Aviation Administration reported this week.\n\nU-TURN IN THE AIR: Woman refuses to wear mask on flight to London, so pilot heads back to Florida\n\n'SIT DOWN, KAREN': Delta passenger removed from flight after mask dispute\n\nFines for not wearing mask on plane\n\nPassengers who refuse to wear masks face fines and other consequences.\n\nLast fall, Biden doubled the fines for travelers who refuse to mask up in airports.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/02/23/goodwill-norton-healthcare-to-bring-hospital-to-louisville-west-end/6897300001/", "title": "Goodwill, Norton Healthcare to bring hospital to Louisville West End", "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Opportunity is coming to the West End, Louisville leaders announced Wednesday, in the form of a $100 million investment from two major local employers and the first hospital to be built west of Ninth Street in more than 150 years.\n\nThe “opportunity campus,” as it was called by speakers at a press conference announcing the move, will include a new $30 million headquarters for Goodwill Industries of Kentucky as well as a $70 million hospital from Norton Healthcare. Other local social service organizations will have a space at the 20-acre complex at Broadway and 28th Street, officials said, including Big Brothers Big Sisters and KentuckianaWorks.\n\nConstruction should begin this year, Goodwill Industries of Kentucky President and CEO Amy Luttrell said, with employees set to move in sometime in 2023.\n\nDeVone Holt, Goodwill's chief external affairs officer, said he grew up in the region and he's seen firsthand the impact the hospital and surrounding complex could have on the West End, an area that is predominantly African American and has about 65,000 residents. He said the partnership between Goodwill and Norton Healthcare should bring hope to an area that's seen several companies pull out over the years.\n\n\"I've watched a lot of organizations and investments move to other parts of the city,\" Holt said. \"But today I'm happy to announce that west Louisville has two good friends who are walking in when others have walked out.\"\n\nRussell Cox, CEO of Norton Healthcare, said that the announcement could make Wednesday “the most transformational day in the history of health care in our community.”\n\n“Today provides us with an opportunity to truly begin to change the narrative about investment in west Louisville, permanence of commitment in west Louisville and sustainability in west Louisville,” Cox said. “… We absolutely believe that people can't truly have opportunity if they don't have access to quality health care. That's how everybody's going to live their best life. That's what this is about.”\n\nThe hospital will include adult and pediatric physician offices, Cox said, along with a 24-hour emergency department, on-site diagnostic services like X-ray machines and CT scan equipment and 20 inpatient beds.\n\nThose services, he noted, haven’t been available in the West End in recent years.\n\nThe new facility will be the first hospital built west of Ninth Street since 1845, Cox said. That complex, the historic U.S. Marine Hospital, closed in 1933, though the building has since been renovated and was added to the National Register of Historic Places 25 years ago.\n\nOf course, the “opportunity campus” is bigger than the hospital. Goodwill’s state headquarters will be on the corner and will give visitors access to job training programs, child care and youth mentoring, legal and restorative justice services and other lifestyle programs. More than half a dozen other local organizations will set up shop at the complex as well.\n\nMetro Council President David James, who represented the area where the facility will be built before recent redistricting went into effect, said he spoke with Holt about the project for the first time about a year ago, toward the beginning of the planning process. Their first conversation \"took my breath away,\" he said, and the new complex is an ideal fit for a block.\n\n\"This is like a dream come true for us, and it's going to be a dream come true for west Louisville, and it's going to be so good for the citizens of west Louisville,\" James said. \"A $100 million investment, and the way (they're) investing it, is a dream.\"\n\nFor Courier Journal subscribers:How businesses along the Preston Corridor are working for safety and new customers\n\nGov. Andy Beshear touted the economic impact he expects the campus will bring to the Parkland corner, which is across the street from the Broadway Kroger grocery. The 200 construction jobs expected to come with the project are “just the tip of the iceberg,” he said – once it’s open and all tenants have moved in, the “opportunity campus” should bring more than 200 jobs to the area with an average annual wage of $59,000.\n\n“I hope COVID has taught us that access to health care is not just a basic human right. It should be a good business as well,” Beshear said. “Ensuring that we have services in every part of this state so that everybody can live their healthiest lives is absolutely necessary.”\n\nWednesday’s announcement is the latest marquee moment for Louisville’s health care industry. City officials are working to approve funding for a new nine-story tower to be built by the University of Louisville Hospital downtown and for construction of a full-service hospital to be added to an outpatient facility in Bullitt County.\n\nGoodwill had previously said it planned to move to Broadway and 28th Street after buying the property in April 2020 for $1.7 million. A manufacturing plant that once stood on the land was razed last year to make way for the new campus.\n\nBeshear said the facility could help reshape that West End corner into a high-profile Louisville business hub, creating an estimated yearly economic impact of $18.7 million.\n\nA Kentucky Transportation Cabinet Driver Licensing Regional Office was relocated to Broadway and 29th Street recently as well, he said, and once the new facility opens, it has a chance to turn that stretch of the busy Louisville roadway into a place where \"hundreds of hundreds of people are working, a bustling economic opportunity.\"\n\nThe project's potential economic impact is noteworthy. But for others with ties to the region, quick access to long-sought medical services was the headline.\n\nU.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, who did not speak but was in attendance, told The Courier Journal he's \"constantly\" heard from members of the West End community about the need for a hospital there.\n\nYears ago, he said, when city officials were working to find a space to build a new Veterans Affairs hospital, he urged those behind the project to consider Broadway and 18th Street. Officials eventually chose an open parcel in the East End along Brownsboro Road for that hospital, which is under construction.\n\nMeanwhile, Charles Booker, a U.S. Senate candidate and West End native, said Wednesday's announcement meant his kids would have access to services that his family had been missing in the past.\n\n\"All my family's from the West End. My grandparents didn't have a hospital, my parents didn't, I didn't, but my children will,\" Booker said. \"If we really want to end poverty and we want to uplift the West End and all of our city, we do investments like this. This is a huge moment.\"\n\nOpportunity Campus tenants\n\nNorton Healthcare\n\nGoodwill Industries of Kentucky\n\nBig Brothers Big Sisters\n\nKentuckianaWorks\n\nVolunteers of America\n\nYMCA\n\nLegal Aid Society\n\nPark Community Credit Union\n\nShawnee Christian Healthcare Center\n\nKentucky College of Barbering\n\nLucas Aulbach can be reached at laulbach@courier-journal.com, 502-582-4649 or on Twitter @LucasAulbach.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/06/slave-rebellion-reenactment-voting-space-warrior-gene-defense-news-around-states/40556103/", "title": "Slave rebellion reenactment, voting from space: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state is offering money to help develop its inland ports. The Department of Economic and Community Affairs says it’s accepting applications for grants of as much as $1 million to help improve infrastructure at ports located away from the coast. Money could be used for improvements like storage, moorings, new construction and maintenance. The grants are being offered through a $5 million program created by state legislators this year. Alabama has inland ports along the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in western Alabama, and there are more port facilities located in Florence and in Jefferson County near Birmingham. The head of the state agency overseeing the program, Kenneth Boswell, says the grants will help inland ports increase cargo and get products to coastal areas.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state’s public defender agency is referring more cases to the Office of Public Advocacy because of conflicts of interest with other cases or clients, according to a state oversight report released Monday. The number of conflicts jeopardizes the primary defense role the agency plays because the more cases it cannot do, the more the Office of Public Advocacy and contract attorneys will do, the report said. The public defender agency inconsistently reports the number of cases it has, has had higher caseloads in offices where it has struggled to recruit and keep attorneys, and would be more efficient with additional support staff, according to the report, which also suggested the agency could more effectively use its resources. Public Defender Samantha Cherot says her agency cooperated in the review.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A group of University of Arizona students is demanding the school’s president apologize for remarks he made using Native American stereotypes. Members of Native SOAR, a university mentoring program for Native American students, posted on social media Sunday that they want a face-to-face apology from President Robert Robbins, and he says he'll meet with them. According to the group, Robbins unexpectedly visited a class last month. He reportedly said he wasn’t trying to “pull an Elizabeth Warren,” but he had a DNA test done because he thought he might be part Cherokee. But he planned to get retested because of his “very high cheekbones.” The group also wants Robbins to open a position on his senior leadership team for someone who can represent tribal communities.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s Department of Human Services is closing offices in four counties by the end of 2020. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the department issued a news release Monday announcing its plans to shut down offices in DeWitt, Clarendon, Booneville and Osceola. The department said it will also launch an application processing center in Osceola by June 2021. The center will employ about 50 people using positions that will be shifted from other areas of the state. It also noted the planned changes come after the department studied how its 85 county offices could be better located around the recipients of programs such as Medicaid, food stamps and subsidized child care. The county offices authorize and process applications for the programs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Authorities seized more than $1.5 billion worth of illegally grown marijuana plants in the state this year – an amount an industry expert said is roughly equal to its entire legal market – as part of an annual eradication program, officials said Monday. The raids netted more than 950,000 plants from nearly 350 growing operation sites this year through the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting program, an effort known as CAMP that dates to 1983 and is considered the nation’s largest illegal marijuana eradication program. Authorities could not estimate a street value of the plants seized and based their figures on wholesale prices of $1,600 per plant. But Jerred Kiloh, president of the United Cannabis Business Association, said wholesale costs are doubled for the retail market – meaning the enforcement operation netted more than $3 billion worth of illegally grown pot.\n\nColorado\n\nGrand Junction: A federal agency says rebuilding a sage-grouse population found only in Colorado and Utah could take more than 50 years and cost nearly $561 million. The Daily Sentinel reports the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has released a draft recovery plan for the Gunnison sage grouse, which is listed as a threatened species. Colorado Parks and Wildlife estimates the bird’s population at more than 3,000, primarily in the state’s Gunnison Basin. Officials say the bird is found only in eight western Colorado counties and one eastern Utah county. Planned recovery actions include invasive weed treatment and improved livestock grazing practices. The largest proposed expense is nearly $309 million to acquire conservation easements or purchase private lands.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: Environmental officials are announcing $2.6 million in grants for Long Island Sound conservation efforts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says 20 grants totaling $1.4 million will benefit Connecticut, while $250,000 will go to efforts in Massachusetts and Vermont and the rest to New York. The money benefits local projects meant to improve water quality and restore habitat around the Long Island Sound watershed. In Connecticut, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal says the matching funds will help communities install trash skimmers, restore salt marshes, spur growth of fish and bird populations, and support environmental education efforts. The EPA says the projects will treat 8.2 million gallons of stormwater, collect 46,000 pounds of floating trash and prevent 17,000 pounds of nitrogen from entering the vital estuary.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Amid deer hunting season and shorter days, the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control is reminding drivers to be wary of deer. According to DNREC, at least half of all deer-involved crashes happen in the last three months of the year, with the highest number of deer hit on the roads occurring in late October through mid-November. A recent State Farm report showed that from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019, drivers made 5,816 deer-vehicle crash insurance claims in Delaware, a 7% increase from the 5,435 during the same time period last year. This year, Delaware ranks 26th out of the 50 states and D.C. for where deer-vehicle collisions are most likely to occur, according to State Farm’s report.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: An independent investigation has determined that a regulatory agency in the district didn’t properly handle a complaint about an illegal rooming house that later caught fire, killing two people. The Washington Post reports the investigation by an outside consulting firm hired by the district was made public Friday. The overcrowded row house caught fire in August, killing 9-year-old Yafet Solomon and 40-year-old Fitsum Kebede. Authorities have said the house contained a deadly mixture of broken smoke detectors, narrow halls and barred exits. The investigation says authorities conducted only cursory property checks, didn’t follow up with the police officer who made the complaint, and ended their inquiry without appropriate approval or documentation.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether felons can be kept from voting if they haven’t paid fines, fees and restitution. Lawyers for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and other state officials, as well as those arguing on behalf of felons seeking their voting rights, will appear before the court Wednesday. Voters last year approved a constitutional amendment restoring voting rights to most felons who have completed their sentences. But the Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bill requiring that all financial obligations related to their sentences be paid before rights could be restored. DeSantis signed the bill. Advocates for felons sued the state, saying the law implementing the amendment was equivalent to a poll tax. DeSantis asked the Supreme Court to clarify the amendment.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStone Mountain: Billed as the largest Native American gathering in the state, the four-day Native American Festival and Pow Wow is preparing for this week’s showcase of the culture through dance, music and more. The festival will be held Thursday through Sunday at Stone Mountain Park. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the event will feature tribes from across the U.S. and Central America. According to the event’s website, visitors can learn about the culture through “dance, music, authentic craft demonstrations, cooking traditions, storytelling, wildlife presentations and more.” Demonstrations will include skills such as flint-knapping, bow making, fire starting, open-fire cooking and pottery, plus an encampment where kids and adults can go inside traditional dwellings. Other popular highlights include the intertribal dance and drum competitions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The City Council has proposed a bill that would create a new property tax category for homeowners operating bed-and-breakfast establishments. The Star-Advertiser reports the City Council approved the first reading of the bill last month. City officials say the bill could be in effect by July 1 if passed. Officials say tax rates for each category are determined by ordinance by the Council each June. Officials say the new category could fall somewhere between the standard residential category – currently $3.50 for every $1,000 of assessed value – and the $13.90 hotel-resort category. City officials expect to issue up to 1,700 new permits for hosted B&B operations starting in October 2020 after the Council approved a new vacation rental ordinance in June.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s Department of Health and Welfare says 10 people have been hospitalized with vaping-related illnesses. Boise television station KTVB reports health officials say no single substance has been associated with the cases. The illnesses are marked by respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath and chest pain. Nationwide, roughly 33 people have died and nearly 1,900 people have been hospitalized in connection with the outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says those numbers are expected to rise because of a lag in reporting.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Public housing residents in the city are being told they can’t smoke marijuana at home, even as pot turns legal in the state Jan. 1. The Chicago Sun-Times reports the Chicago Housing Authority began sending notices last week. The agency says it can terminate public aid if anyone is using marijuana for recreational or medical purposes on CHA property. CHA says marijuana is illegal under federal law, and it must follow the law to get federal money. Medical marijuana cards have been available in Illinois since 2014. Kate Walz of the Shriver Center on Poverty Law says people in public housing “don’t have the same rights as the rest of us do.” Jacqueline Reynolds says she’ll keep sparking a joint. The 67-year-old says marijuana keeps her off blood pressure medication.\n\nIndiana\n\nLafayette: Three years after it was plucked from its perch near an Interstate 65 exit, the clock that was a local icon on top of the Hour Time Restaurant for four decades has a new owner and could have a new home soon. Lorne Koehler-Marsh, a landscaper who collects and repairs clocks, says he bought the clock – with its four 12-foot faces – with hopes of mounting it atop a tower at the front of a shop he wants to build on family property in Dayton. He says he’d hoped to buy the clock when memorabilia and fixtures at the Hour Time first went up for auction in 2016. But he skipped the auction, figuring the price would be too salty. “When I saw what it sold for,” Koehler-Marsh says, “I thought, ‘Crap, I wish I’d gone.’ ” It went for $7,500, and he finally convinced the new owner to part with it last month. The clock dates to 1910, built in Leicester, England. Weighing in at 7 tons, it originally sat on top of a train station in Rochdale, England.\n\nIowa\n\nMadrid: The Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation says it’s buying Clover Woods Camp & Retreat Center from the Iowa 4-H Foundation. The Natural Heritage Foundation said in a news release Monday that it’s made a deal for all 1,011 acres along the Des Moines River in Boone County. The price won’t be disclosed until the closing later this year. The 4-H Foundation was formed in 1949 to build the camp. It’s split into separate “villages” and includes a ropes course, climbing tower, swimming pool and 20 miles of trails. Iowa 4-H Foundation Executive Director Emily Saveraid has said the needs of 4-H participants and their families have changed, and they now prefer camping options closer to home. She says the foundation will focus more on camping and other outdoor activities at the county and regional levels.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A federal judge has delayed the trial of an Army infantry soldier who prosecutors say is a Satanist hoping to overthrow the U.S. government and distributed information about building bombs. U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree in Topeka on Monday granted a request from attorneys for Jarrett William Smith to postpone a trial from early December until at least mid-January. Smith pleaded not guilty in September to charges of distributing explosives information and making a threatening interstate communication. His attorneys said they needed more time to review evidence. Smith was a private stationed at Fort Riley. He’s accused of providing information about explosives to an FBI undercover agent and threatening to burn down the house of a far-left-leaning “antifa” member. Authorities say he also wanted to car bomb a major news organization.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Officials say programs at Murray State University and Bluegrass Community and Technical College offer a certification ensuring graduates have essential employability skills that employers say are often lacking. A statement from the Council on Postsecondary Education says the Essential Employability Qualities certification tells employers that academic programs integrate skills into the curriculum including communication, collaboration, problem solving and ethics. The statement says two programs at Murray State are certified, as is one program at Bluegrass Community and Technical College. Officials say four other campuses are pursuing certification in at least three programs: Kentucky State University, University of Kentucky, Gateway Community and Technical College, and Jefferson Community and Technical College.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: More than 200 years after the largest slave rebellion in American history, hundreds of reenactors will retrace their journey through the sugar plantation country of southeastern Louisiana. The reenactment was conceived by artist Dread Scott. His work focuses on racial injustice and oppression. The reenactors will dress in period costumes and carry machetes or muskets as they march 26 miles Friday and Saturday from LaPlace to the New Orleans outskirts. Scott says the project sprung from his interest in concepts of how people liberate themselves. He was also intrigued at learning about the little-known rebellion’s goals and how close it came to success. The slaves who carried out the rebellion intended to establish a free republic in New Orleans, but it was viciously put down.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Scientists and leaders from New England and Canada are gathering in Maine this week for an event focused on what the warming of the ocean will mean for the region. The Gulf of Maine 2050 International Symposium is taking place in Portland until Friday. Organizers say the event’s purpose is to “increase our collective understanding about how the Gulf of Maine is expected to change over the next 30 years and to promote regional resilience in the context of those changes.” The Gulf of Maine is warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. It’s also home to some of America’s most important fisheries, such as the lobster harvest. Among the keynote speakers is Ko Barrett, vice chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Preliminary approval has been granted by the City Council to ban retailers from giving out plastic bags. The Baltimore Sun reports the council voted 13-1 on Monday night to ban the use of plastic bags and charge 5 cents to give any other kind of bag, including paper bags, to customers. Retailers would keep 4 cents of the fee, and the city would get 1 cent. Some products, such as newspapers, would be exempt from the rule. Another vote is planned for Nov. 18. If approved, the bill would advance to the mayor’s desk. He could sign the ban or allow it to take effect without his signature. Councilwoman Danielle McCray was the only person to vote against the proposal. She didn’t say why she opposed it.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is planning to spend $10 billion to $28 billion on updates to the commuter rail. The Boston Herald reports the Fiscal and Management Control Board approved a series of resolutions Monday directing the MBTA to start working on an overhaul of the commuter rail. The project is intended to decrease the number of commuters traveling by car by 2040. Potential updates could include the electrification of main commuter rail lines and running trains every 15 to 20 minutes all day. The most expensive version of these plans would include building a tunnel linking North and South stations. Gov. Charlie Baker would not confirm how the multibillion-dollar project will be funded.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Police officers, firefighters and paramedics in the city will be recognized for exceptional service to the community. The annual Above and Beyond Awards ceremony is scheduled Wednesday at the MGM Grand in Detroit. Those recognized will include 19 officers from the 5th and 9th precincts who helped evacuate more than 100 people from a burning apartment complex for the elderly Sept. 23. Detroit Emergency Medical Services Asst. Superintendent Joseph Barney said he arrived to see “a swarm” of officers “literally running into the building like a flood.” He added that their “actions certainly saved lives.” Paramedics Justin Kidd and Madison Stitt will receive Medal of Valor awards. On May 8, they helped stop an attack by a pitbull on a 13-year-old girl. The awards are presented by the Detroit Public Safety Foundation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Wildlife managers say they’re close to rounding up enough trash bins to dispose of deer carcasses in zones of the state where they’re trying to stop the spread of chronic wasting disease. One vendor, Waste Management, recently decided not to accept carcasses that potentially might be contaminated. That has sent the Department of Natural Resources scrambling to find replacements ahead of Saturday’s firearms deer season opener. DNR wildlife health program supervisor Michelle Carstensen told reporters Monday that she’s not sure if they’ll hit their goal of 26 dumpsters statewide, but there’s a good chance they’ll have 20. The DNR requires hunters in parts of southeastern, central and north-central Minnesota where diseased deer have been found to submit their deer for mandatory testing, and it urges them to use designated bins for disposing of carcasses.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Pet dogs can now dine with their owners under certain conditions at restaurants. The Mississippi State Department of Health’s new policy went into effect Friday. Restaurants must apply for a variance to the department’s food code to allow the animals and pay a $165 inspection fee. Under the new policy, a restaurant must have a separate outside entrance into a designated outdoor, dog-friendly area. Dogs, who must remain leashed, are not allowed to go indoors – unless considered a service dog. Disposable dishes and utensils are required, and dogs can’t come into contact with any items involved in food service operations. Employees cannot touch or handle the animals. More information is available online.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: After spending eight days in a tree to protest construction of a mid-Missouri nature trail, activist Sutu Forte has been arrested. The Columbia Missourian reports that city authorities on Tuesday removed Forte from the tree by using a fire truck’s hydraulic bucket. She was handcuffed and taken to jail but released a short time later. Forte says the police “handcuffed me very gently.” One of her supporters held the summons Forte was given by police that indicated a charge of first-degree trespassing. Police Chief Geoff Jones and a city spokesman declined comment. Supporters in the crowd sang “This Little Light of Mine” as Forte was brought down from the tree. Forte had staged the protest since Oct. 28 over concerns that the trail extension would lead to forest destruction.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The city is not known for moose, but there will be a lot more “PaddleHeads” around when the next baseball season opens. The Missoula Osprey announced plans Monday to change its name to PaddleHeads with an updated logo and merchandise displaying the moose nickname, The Missoulian reports. The team decided 11 months ago to change its nickname as part of a rebranding to revive falling attendance. The Rookie Advanced affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks plays in the Pioneer League from June to September. The organization received nearly 500 name suggestions submitted online, and team officials were on a conference call with a consultant in March discussing the six finalists, says Matt Ellis, team executive vice president. Of PaddleHeads, “I said, ‘I’ve got one problem: I don’t equate a moose to the heart of Missoula.’ Just then our phones lit up with an alert,” Ellis says. “There was a moose in downtown Missoula, a block from our office.”\n\nNebraska\n\nYutan: The Nebraska Army National Guard has established a new infantry battalion – an outfit that a general says could help recruitment. The 2nd Battalion, 134th Infantry Regiment was activated during a ceremony Saturday at the guard’s parachute landing area near Yutan. It was followed by a parachute jump by more than 100 members from a helicopter hovering 1,000 feet in the air. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the Nebraska Army National Guard has been dominated by support units for years. Brig. Gen. Lynn Heng, the Nebraska Army Guard’s land component commander, says adding an infantry battalion should boost state recruiting. He says the new battalion is “a very attractive unit for these young folks who are looking for adventure, joining the guard.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Public safety officials in the state are beginning a drive to improve pedestrian safety with chalk silhouettes on roads, reflective bands for people crossing streets, and advisories for motorists. Vulnerable Road Users Project chief Erin Breen at UNLV says a “Dusk 2 Dawn” campaign kicked off Monday in and around Las Vegas, where 91 white outlines mark spots where pedestrians have died in recent years. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ranked Nevada the fifth-most-dangerous state for pedestrians in 2017, with a little more than three pedestrian fatalities per 100,000 residents. Clark County, including Las Vegas, ranked 11th among 25 counties in the U.S. with the highest number of pedestrian fatalities per year in 2014 through 2018. Officials say pedestrian fatalities tend to increase during evening darkness following the end of daylight saving time.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAllenstown: A graveside service is planned for two suspected victims of a serial killer who were identified decades after their remains were discovered in a barrel in 1985. A public service is scheduled Saturday afternoon at Saint John the Baptist Cemetery for Marlyse Honeychurch, 24, and 6-year-old daughter Marie Vaughn. They were buried in an Allenstown cemetery with a headstone that said they were known “only to God.” Authorities found a total of four decomposed bodies. This year, they confirmed the identities of Honeychurch, Vaughn and 1-year-old Sarah Lynn McWaters, another daughter of Honeychurch. The victims’ families said in a statement that they “are grateful to the residents of Allenstown who never ceased in their compassion, thoughts and prayers for these young women.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMadison: Weather authorities have confirmed it was a tornado that damaged homes and vehicles in northern New Jersey on Halloween night. The National Weather Service says the EF-1 tornado in Morris County touched down in Harding Township shortly before 12:30 a.m. Friday packing winds up to 100 mph. The twister snapped trees and brought down utility lines while traveling almost 5 miles to the borough of Florham Park. At Drew University, it brought down numerous trees, some of them crushing several vehicles. Another tree northeast of downtown Madison crushed the front porch of a home and another uprooted tree fell onto another residence. No injuries were reported. NJ.com reports the storms knocked power out to about a quarter of Madison’s homes and businesses.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state Supreme Court debated Monday whether a murder defendant should have been allowed to introduce evidence that he has a genetic predisposition to violence. At issue is whether a district court acted properly in excluding evidence of a so-called warrior gene variant linked to a predisposition toward aggressive and violent behavior as it weighed murder charges against Anthony Blas Yepez. The Supreme Court listened to oral arguments from opposing attorneys without yet issuing a decision. Yepez was convicted in the killing of his girlfriend’s 75-year-old step-grandfather during a domestic dispute in 2012. He is serving a 22-year sentence for second-degree murder with additional time for auto theft and tampering with evidence.\n\nNew York\n\nNiagara: Parks officials are monitoring a century-old grounded barge that briefly broke loose during a storm last week in the river just above Niagara Falls. WGRZ says the rusty iron scow had been stuck since 1918 on rocks in the upper rapids above the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side. High winds and rain last Thursday dislodged it before it got stuck again. The Washington Post says it was originally about a third of a mile from the brink of Horseshoe Falls. Then it moved about 164 feet downstream and became lodged again. A Niagara Parks official said it could be stuck in its new location for days or years.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWaynesville: An attempt to tree a bear has ended with a hunter injured and the bear dead. North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission Capt. Andrew Helton says the hunter rolled off a slight cliff with the 350-pound bear Saturday. He says the hunter was with another man who had shot the bear while it was in a tree near Mount Sterling in Haywood County. The bear fell out of the tree and began biting the hunter. The bear walked away after the two tumbled off the cliff. Helton says Wildlife Resource officers found the bear dead Sunday. It was taken to a state Department of Agriculture lab for rabies testing. The hunter was taken to a hospital in Asheville with several injuries.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem has asked South Dakota authorities to help investigate an agency that allegedly violated state law on contract bidding. Auditor Joshua Gallion released a report last month that said the Department of Commerce violated the law on bidding uncompetitive contracts totaling more than $87,000 for the state’s new “Be Legendary” logo. The logo sparked criticism earlier this year when the contract for it was awarded to a Minnesota firm headed by a woman who once worked for Gov. Doug Burgum’s old Fargo software business. In a letter, Stenehjem does not give a reason for asking for South Dakota’s help but says it’s allowed under North Dakota law. The Commerce Department says it did nothing wrong but has identified where some improvements can be made.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: An arena has a new name after U.S. Bank decided not to renew its naming rights agreement with the site. Officials have announced the new name of the former U.S. Bank Arena will be Heritage Bank Center. The 17,000-seat indoor arena downtown has been the host to musical acts including James Brown and Led Zeppelin, as well as the home arena for the Cincinnati Cyclones hockey team. It has had several names since first opening in 1975 as Riverfront Coliseum. Chris Caddell, chairman of Erlanger, Kentucky-based Heritage Bank, said Monday that the center plans to attract events with the power to draw people from the region and beyond. Financial details of the 10-year naming rights agreement with arena owner Nederlander Entertainment weren’t disclosed.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Supporters of a proposal to expand Medicaid say they have enough signatures to put a state question on the ballot next year. The Oklahoman reports that Yes on 802’s campaign manager Amber England says the community organization collected the state requirement of 178,000 signatures, which must be verified. The proposed question would amend the state’s constitution and expand Medicaid coverage to adults between ages 18 and 65 whose income does not exceed 133% of the federal poverty level. The conservative think tank Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs challenged the initial plan, but the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked it.\n\nOregon\n\nWest Linn: A 130-year-old paper mill is back open, two years after its abrupt closure. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the newly formed Willamette Falls Paper Co. restarted two months ago and is now trying out new classes of paper made from pulp and agricultural waste instead of wood. The mill said Monday that it plans to begin commercial production of coated and uncoated papers by mid-month. The plant closed in October 2017, citing “unforeseeable events” that reduced available pulp for making paper. The shutdown cost 250 workers their jobs. Earlier this year, Clark County investor Ken Peterson made a “multimillion-dollar” investment to get the mill operational again. Willamette Falls originally planned to hire 85 at the restarted mill but now employs 120, according to Phil Harding, the mill’s director of technology and sustainability.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNew Castle: An election official didn’t think anything of the absentee ballot application until he saw the out-of-this-world voting location. The New Castle News reports the application to Lawrence County’s voter services department listed the location as “International Space Station, low Earth orbit.” Director Ed Allison says his reaction was “What?” But then he found out that astronaut Andrew “Drew” Morgan, currently on the space station, has an address in Neshannock Township and is a registered voter in the county. County IT director Rick DiBello set up a secure email and password and a fillable PDF file that Morgan received, filled out and sent back. DiBello says he thought “that is pretty cool.” And Allison calls it “very, very cool” and says: “This is the future.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has launched a new program to make more electric vehicle charging stations accessible to drivers. The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources says it launched Electrify RI as an electric vehicle charging station incentive program. The $1.4 million program will help fund the installation of new charging stations at workplaces, multi-unit dwellings, and state, quasi-public and local government properties. The money is coming from a government settlement with Volkswagen, which modified vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. State Energy Commissioner Carol Grant says she wants to make it easier for people to install charging stations and “inspire drivers to go green,” to reduce transportation-related carbon emissions and pollutants.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A group of moderate senators restored exceptions for rape and incest Tuesday to a measure to ban nearly all abortions in the state, sending the bill to the state Senate floor for a potential 2020 election year fight. The exceptions may be crucial for the bill to have any chance to pass. A proposal to ban abortions without them failed last year in South Carolina’s Republican-dominated Senate. The chamber is the last hurdle for the Fetal Heartbeat Protection from Abortion Act, which would make almost all abortions illegal once fetal cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks after conception. The bill has always allowed an abortion if the mother’s life is in danger. It easily passed the House in April once the rape and incest exceptions were added, and Gov. Henry McMaster has said he will sign it no matter what.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: City councilors are considering whether to lift a ban on beekeeping. Two councilors have been working on the proposal to keep beehives within city limits for nearly a year. Theresa Stehly and Janet Brekke see beekeeping as a benefit to the environment. Their proposal creates a regulated system involving permits and fees along with education and training requirements. Ahead of Tuesday night’s City Council meeting, Sioux Falls Animal Control Supervisor Julie DeJong said her officers will need to ensure they’re equipped to hand bee-related emergencies, should the proposal pass. The Rapid City Journal reports that in 2016 several people were injured and a dog was killed by bees that were being raised in Sturgis that had become agitated.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee says his administration is gearing up to use a portion of its $732 million in reserves from a federal welfare program for families with children. The large surplus has come under scrutiny after first being flagged last month in a report by the Beacon Center of Tennessee, a conservative think tank. According to the report, the state receives $190.9 million annually through the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program but last year spent just $71.1 million of that money. Lee, a Republican, initially defended the reserve amount by arguing that the surplus would provide a cushion for a potential future economic downturn. However, on Monday, Lee told reporters he was open to using the surplus on a variety of options to continue helping Tennessee’s poor.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A man previously freed after spending 15 years in prison for the 2001 killing of a teenager has been formally exonerated. The Dallas County district attorney’s office says the state’s top criminal court issued a ruling of “actual innocence” Monday in the case of Quintin Lee Alonzo. The 39-year-old Alonzo, who was in prison on a life sentence, was released in May 2018. He was convicted of murder in 2003 in the death of 18-year-old Santos Gauna, who was killed when a fight broke out at a Dallas party Alonzo attended. Another man confessed to Gauna’s killing in 2015 before he was executed for a different crime. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals’ ruling allows Alonzo to seek state compensation for being falsely imprisoned. The district attorney’s office says Alonzo’s is its 41st exoneration since 2001.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: A state lawmaker says she’s working on a proposal to study how implicit racial biases may play into the disproportionate number of minorities in the state prison system. Republican Rep. Marsha Judkins of Provo tells the Standard-Examiner she’s working on a prosecution transparency bill to be introduced next year that would require the collection of data about arrest, charging, sentencing and parole decisions. Utah Sentencing Commission numbers show 43% of people newly sentenced to prison in 2017 were racial or ethnic minorities. Census data shows minorities made up 20% of the population. Judkins says the statistics point to clear racial disparities. But without specific data, it’s hard to determine what’s driving it. The issue is important because Utah’s prison population is rising faster than any other state but Idaho.\n\nVermont\n\nBurke: The federal receiver overseeing two ski resorts in the state after their owner was accused of massive fraud says Burke Mountain Resort will not be sold for at least a year. Michael Goldberg said in court filings earlier this month that he hoped to sell Jay Peak Resort by the summer of 2020. He also wrote that he was “fairly certain” the investors “will incur a significant loss of their principal investment.” Foreigners invested in various developments at Jay Peak through the EB-5 visa program, which helps them obtain permanent residency by investing at least $500,000 in job-creating developments in the U.S. Goldberg told the Caledonian Record that projects at Burke may not have created enough jobs under the EB-5 visa program, so the resort cannot be sold yet.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state has added more than 300 acres to natural area preserves, including land near the Appalachian Trail. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Friday that the Department of Conservation and Recreation had acquired land around the state that will help protect rare plants and animals. That includes land in the Antioch Pines Natural Area Preserve in Isle of Wight County, the Buffalo Mountain Natural Area Preserve in Floyd County, and the Bald Knob Natural Area Preserve in Franklin County. The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club and the state also will share ownership of 125 acres in Rockingham County next to Shenandoah National Park.\n\nWashington\n\nVancouver: Protesters at the Port of Vancouver, Washington, took steps Tuesday morning to block a shipment of pipeline meant for the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project. KOIN reports at least five people climbed up and chained themselves on the dock off which the shipment was to be loaded. Other “kayaktivists” were in the surrounding water, rallying behind the climbers to stop this project they say “is jeopardizing a livable future for everyone on this planet.” Local law enforcement and the Coast Guard were monitoring the situation. The Trans Mountain Pipeline carries crude oil from the Alberta tar sands to the British Columbia coast for export. The expansion project would add a second parallel line that would nearly triple the system’s capacity.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: Police say they have identified a source of suspected heroin-laced vaping solutions while investigating overdoses that sickened two high school students. Morgantown Police Chief Ed Preston says in a news release that an underage high school student has been identified as a suspect. Preston says detectives obtained a search warrant that resulted in the recovery of more than 100 charged vaping solutions, packaging materials, marijuana and empty vaping cartridges that were being filled with the suspected solution. Preston says one of the vaping pens was confirmed to be contaminated with heroin and other dangerous chemicals. Morgantown police spokesman Andrew Stacy says the exact source of the vaping pens that made the students sick last week remains under investigation.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The 2019 Milwaukee Film Festival pulled in a record 87,618 fans in its 15-day run, the festival’s nonprofit operator Milwaukee Film announced Tuesday. Attendance for the film festival, which concluded its run on a snowy Halloween, was up nearly 12% from 2018, when the festival had attendance of 78,510. Last year’s tally was a 6% drop from the previous year. Attendance totals for 2019 include 8,440 students who took part in education screenings at the festival’s home base, the Oriental Theatre. At the festival, the documentary “Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am” received the Allan H. (Bud) and Suzanne L. Selig Audience Award for best feature, and “Tree #3” received the Selig Audience Award for best short film.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state Department of Education has named a conference room after the longest-serving department employee to commemorate decades of her work. Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports Superintendent Jillian Balow honored Rita Watson on Monday with a plaque and surprise dedication for her 50-year work anniversary. Department officials say Watson, her husband and Balow ate with Gov. Mark Gordon and his wife Friday to celebrate the milestone. Officials say they plan to place a plaque outside the room as a tribute to her career. Balow says Watson has worked for every superintendent of public instruction since 1974. Watson says one of her favorite parts of the job was enabling others to do their best, and she hopes to be remembered by her work ethic and love for the job.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2023/11/06/birds-named-after-slaveowners-racism-will-soon-get-new-name/71427391007/", "title": "Some birds named after people will be getting new names", "text": "Some birds are about to get new names. And no, we aren't talking pets, parrots at a zoo, or cartoon characters like Woody Woodpecker. Think the Cooper’s hawk, Townsend’s warbler and Bachman’s sparrow — birds named after people.\n\nThe American Ornithological Society, the organization responsible for standardizing English bird names across North and South America, announced Wednesday it is going to rename all species named after people.\n\nMany of the people whose names have been attached to birds \"have objectively horrible pasts,\" according to Bird Names for Birds, a group leading the charge for change. Many of the birds' namesakes owned slaves, took land from Indigenous tribes, advocated for white supremacy, or had other troubling ties, according to one of the group's founders.\n\nIn a statement, the Ornithological Society said such bird names can be harmful, exclusive, and detract from \"the focus, appreciation or consideration of the birds themselves.\"\n\nThe Indiana Audubon Society said it endorses the decision to change honorific bird names.\n\n\"Yes, certain honorific bird names, particularly those named after people who supported racist behavior, should be changed,\" the state organization said in a statement to IndyStar. \"These names can perpetuate a legacy of injustice and discrimination, which is contrary to our mission of celebrating and conserving birds and their habitats.\"\n\nIn fact, one bird that will be renamed is the Audubon shearwater, a bird found off the coast of the southeastern United States. The bird's name will no longer acknowledge John James Audubon, the famous bird illustrator the National Audubon Society is named after in recognition of his contributions to the field of ornithology.\n\nAudubon also was a slave owner who adamantly opposed abolition.\n\nSome other birding organizations, including the Bird Union and the Chicago Bird Alliance, recently changed their names to avoid an association with Audubon. The National Audubon Society voted to retain its name earlier this year, saying that the organization's mission transcends the history of one person.\n\nInclusivity:Here's why some North American bird names no longer fly\n\nThere has been pushback to the renaming movement, with some questioning if it is another trivial grievance in the age of \"wokeism\" that is seeing statues removed and school mascots changed.\n\nBut Jordan Rutter, one of the Bird Names for Birds founders, previously told IndyStar the group has been working on this for years. She said if a conversation about bird names has been this hard, then it lessens hope for progress on the more important things.\n\n“We are coming up on year three of this,” Rutter said. “And if we are struggling this hard to have a conversation about bird names, what hope is there for the future for making progress on those more important things.”\n\nAs a result of the AOS's decision, dozens of bird species will have their English names changed in an attempt to avoid associations with \"historic bias.\" The effort will begin in 2024 and will focus initially on about 70 to 80 bird species that occur primarily in the U.S. and Canada, according to the AOS.\n\nIts decision comes in response to pressure from birders to remedy the situation. That includes a petition from Bird Names for Birds that began in 2020 and was addressed to the Ornithological Society to confront the bird names it describes as \"verbal statues\" to their eponyms.\n\nBird Names for Birds is a grassroots organization founded three years ago by a few members of the birding community. The idea started after a May 2020 incident in Central Park that received nationwide coverage. Christian Cooper, a Black birder, was watching birds in the park when a woman called the police and falsely claimed he was threatening her after Cooper had asked that she keep her dog on a leash.\n\nThat was a reckoning for the birding community, one of the organization's founders previously told IndyStar.\n\nIn 2022, the AOS announced it was forming a committee to look into how to address the controversial bird names. Last week's announcement is the culmination of that effort.\n\nIn total, more than 100 bird species across the Americas will receive new names. The AOS said it is committed to changing all bird names derived from people.\n\nThe Society said it will assemble a diverse group to oversee the renaming process and it will include input from the general public. The new names will aim to be more descriptive either about the birds' habitats or physical characteristics.\n\nThis comes as part of a broader push in science, the AOS said, and to create a more welcoming and inclusive environment.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Sarah Bowman at 317-444-6129 or email at sarah.bowman@indystar.com.

In response, officials plan to scale back and rename the event, as they work \"to keep the organization stable.\"\n\nIn the wake of the announcement, Clearwater Executive Director Greg Williams told the Journal the organization is also preparing to pay for $800,000 worth of restoration work to its iconic sloop; a state grant is covering $323,000, leaving Clearwater to pay for the rest.\n\nStill, Williams maintained Clearwater is in a better financial position than when it canceled the 2016 Great Hudson River Revival, \"but still not so good that we can easily weather an unexpected $190,000 loss.\"\n\nThe executive director projected optimism in the face of the expenses announced.\n\n\"While Clearwater has had its ups and downs, we have always managed to find a way to keep sailing and to keep educating kids and to keep pressure on government agencies to protect our Hudson River and our water environment and we expect to keep doing that,\" Williams told the Journal.\n\nCLEARWATER: Sloop returns to the river\n\nHUDSON RIVER: Clearwater organization 'recharged'\n\nPETE SEEGER: Grammy win honors late Dutchess Junction folk singer\n\nFounded in 1966, Clearwater utilizes sailing, educational programs and an environmental action department to advocate on behalf of the Hudson River and its surrounding valley. The group in 2019 marked two major milestones — the 50th anniversary of the launch of the sloop Clearwater; and what would have been the 100th birthday of the organization's late founder, Pete Seeger of Dutchess Junction.\n\nHow the festival will change\n\nThe Clearwater festival — a source of revenue for the group — has been an anchor for the regional music scene for decades. David Crosby, Lake Street Dive and Los Lobos are among the notable musical acts that have performed at past festivals.\n\nWilliams said Clearwater was hoping to break even with the 2019 festival. But a forecast of wet weather, along with rain on the second day of the gathering, resulted in a drop of 3,100 attendees, from 2018 to 2019.\n\nThis year's event will be smaller and bear a new name, but be held at the same place.\n\nLike the Revival, the new Clearwater Community Celebration will be held on Father's Day weekend at Croton Point Park in Westchester County. But unlike the Revival, which drew 7,600 attendees in 2018 and 4,500 people in 2019, attendance for the Clearwater Community Celebration will be capped at 529 people per day, including attendees, musicians and volunteers.\n\n\"It's disheartening,\" said City of Poughkeepsie resident Amanda Burdine, a Clearwater member, co-coordinator of the children’s area at the festival and member of the Revival Planning Committee. \"However, we're still trying to be hopeful. You don't give up.\"\n\nAfter it was canceled in 2016, the festival had been held each year since 2017.\n\nBut Tuesday's announcement regarding the size of the 2020 festival marked a sharp left turn for the festival and the organization.\n\n\"It would be irresponsible of Clearwater to move forward with replicating another million-dollar Clearwater Festival in 2020 without having addressed the financial loss we incurred in 2019,\" the press release said. \"We expect that these steps, with the public's ongoing support, will put us in the best position to return with Revival in 2021.\"\n\nThe decision to reduce the scope of the 2020 festival followed a review of the 2019 event by a committee that included Clearwater board members, staff and long-time Revival volunteers.\n\nWilliams told the Journal that Clearwater's most expensive festival costs included the rental of such items as stages, golf carts, sound equipment, portable bathrooms and shuttle buses; as well as paying for emergency services. The 2020 festival will be held in a smaller section of Croton Point Park, which will reduce these logistical costs as well as the rental fee for the property and cost of musical acts, he said.\n\n\"Following a thorough review of festival production practices, monies still owed to 2019 vendors and increasing expenses every year, the Clearwater Board of Directors has determined that the wisest course is to produce a smaller but still significant event in 2020,\" the press release said.\n\nHow Clearwater is responding\n\nAccording to Clearwater's announcement, \"Since June, we have been working to keep the organization stable, while paying down our debt to festival vendors, and we are grateful for their patience.\"\n\nAsked about the organization remaining \"stable,\" Williams during the telephone interview with the Journal said Clearwater had \"success in stabilizing a number of factors in advance of the 2019 festival and is proud of that work.\"\n\nThese factors, he continued, included stabilizing staff turnover; maintaining predictable finances; and \"having a good relationship with our banks. As successful as we were in all of that work, we were not so successful that we could easily weather a $190,000 loss. We are doing the best we can by the vendors to whom we owe money and retaining that fiscal stability.\"\n\nWilliams said the organization has been hiring new employees, including a new director of development and grant manager.\n\n\"Part of what we're doing better is looking further into the future and making good decisions on behalf of the organization well before they need to be made,\" he said.\n\nClearwater has also been taking steps to trim costs that are unrelated to the festival, Williams said. These include the enlistment of volunteers to perform custodial work on the sloop, rather than paid contractors. Also, members of the board of directors have been working the phones to raise money.\n\nAs for the restoration work, the sloop will be out of the water for the majority of the proposed six-month project, which will stretch from late 2020 into early 2021. The work will focus on timbers, frames, and planks above the water line. Williams in an email said that the work is not mandated by the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\n\"Though we work hand in glove with the U.S. Coast Guard, we've transitioned to a maintenance plan that routinely exceeds their requirements while providing more predictability and efficiency,\" he said.\n\nJohn W.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/11/01/birds-renaming-inclusive-racist-genocidal-histories/71394771007/", "title": "Dozens of birds, including ones named after white supremacists, are ...", "text": "Dozens of bird species in the United States and Canada will get \"imaginative\" new names that reflect their traits and habitats rather than the names of people, the American Ornithological Society announced Wednesday.\n\nThe society plans to remove all human names from the common names for birds within its jurisdiction, to create a more inclusive environment for people of diverse backgrounds interested in bird-watching and ornithology. The public process, yet to be fully defined, will include 70 to 80 birds in the U.S. and Canada, the society stated.\n\nFollowing years of controversy over bird names linked to people with racist and genocidal histories, the society's decision thrills ornithologists and scientists who supported a campaign to name birds for themselves.\n\n\"I'm really excited about this change,\" said Corina Newsome, an ornithologist who was among a group of dozens of Black outdoor enthusiasts that launched the first Black Birders Week in May 2020.\n\n\"It’s a major change in how we think about bird names,\" said Sushma Reddy, secretary of the society and the Breckenridge Chair of Ornithology at the University of Minnesota. \"We came to the decision that we really want bird names to be about birds.\"\n\nThe society wants new bird-watchers hearing bird names for the first time to \"feel this is a welcoming environment for people from different backgrounds and just enjoy nature for what it is,\" Reddy said. \"Birds are for everybody. Science is for everybody.\"\n\nAlthough the project was initiated in part \"to address past wrongs\" over links to historical figures known for their support of slavery or genocide of Indigenous peoples, the Society plans to remove all honorific human names. A committee that considered the recommendations noted the blanket removal would avoid potentially contentious value judgments about the character and morality of individuals from the past.\n\nNew bird names will favor more descriptive names like the blue-footed booby or red-headed woodpecker rather than nebulous names like Ross' goose or Bachman's sparrow that give no clues about how to identify the bird.\n\n\"We’re hoping to be imaginative about this,\" said noted naturalist and author Kenn Kaufman. \"It’s a great chance to come up with beautiful and evocative ways of describing the visual appearance, song, or habitat they live in.\"\n\nThe committee also proposes to change names considered derogatory or culturally inappropriate for three other birds: the flesh-footed shearwater; Eskimo curlew, and Inca dove.\n\nA welcome announcement\n\n\"I was honestly very surprised they came to this decision,\" Newsome told USA TODAY. \"It fosters a more equitable approach to learning about the living world.\"\n\nShe first started noticing \"bizarre names\" associated with species' names when she began memorizing names in college.\n\n\"I noticed names that described how the species looked or how it acted in some way were easier to remember than species with an honorific name,\" she said. Later in college, she became uncomfortable with the general practice of naming other living things after people, she said. When she began to learn more about the people behind some of the names, she found it \"even more upsetting.\"\n\nSeveral events helped kick off the society’s multiyear deliberations over bird renaming.\n\nIn 2018, college student Robert Driver proposed renaming McCown's longspur. The small bird that lives on shortgrass prairies in the Central United States was named for John P. McCown, who first collected a specimen of the species in 1851. That was before he fought in the Seminole Indian War in Florida in 1856 and 1857, before he participated in an expedition against Mormons in Utah in 1858 and before he became a general in the Confederate Army in 1861, according to the Central Arkansas Library System. Driver's renaming proposal was rejected, to the dismay of many birders.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, major events sparked a national outcry, protests over racism and police brutality, and a renewed focus on racism in the U.S. Two of those occurred on May 25. A white woman in Central Park called the police and falsely accused Black birder Christian Cooper of threatening her after he asked her to put her dog on a leash. Then in Minneapolis, police killed George Floyd.\n\nBy August of 2020, the society was looking at things differently. It accepted a rewritten proposal from Driver and a co-author and the longspur was renamed the thick-billed longspur. Other birders and ornithologists also were calling for the removal of names associated with past racism. The society apologized for derogatory remarks by a member about Hawaiian bird names distributed in 2011 documents and began some of the initial steps that led to Wednesday's announcement.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nKaufman, who has been in the bird business nearly his entire life, was among those initially reluctant to support changing dozens of bird names.\n\n\"It’s easy to get set in your ways,\" he said. \"I believed in the value of stability. Having stable names makes it easier for people to communicate.\" He's also seen the mass confusion among bird-watchers when species have been split or combined for taxonomic purposes.\n\nBut after the 2020 rejection of Driver's proposal, Kaufman was struck by the \"vocal outcry, mostly from younger ornithologists and bird conservationists.\" He began to be persuaded during a conversation with two of those ornithologists, Jordan Rutter and Gabriel Foley, who launched their Bird Names for Birds campaign in 2020.\n\nRutter and Foley argued some of the bird names were essentially verbal Confederate monuments, he said. \"At a time when the bird community was trying to become more inclusive, it seems like that maybe would be a barrier.\"\n\nAfter talking to dozens of fellow birders of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, he said he was convinced renaming was the best option.\n\nWhile researching a book on the history of ornithology in early America, Kaufman started \"coming across more names of people with birds named after them that would be unsavory by modern standards,\" he said. \"A few of these names are really genuinely offensive to people of color.\"\n\n\"If you have a bird named for a person who was an avowed white supremacist, who preached the inferiority of Black people and it’s found mainly in the South, if people research the history, they’re going to find it offensive,” he said. One example often cited is the Scott’s oriole, named for Winfield Scott, a military general responsible for the Trail of Tears.\n\nAmerica's birds are under siege.These are among the most at risk for extinction.\n\nHow renaming will work\n\nA pilot project will begin in 2024, starting with an initial group from among the 70-80 birds that will be renamed in the U.S. and Canada, the Society said. In total over time, up to 260 birds with people's names could be reviewed across the Americas and associated islands.\n\nThe society, which now has two naming committees, one each for North and South America, will appoint a third committee specifically for the review of English common names. Reddy said the group will include not only experts in taxonomy but also experts in social science and communication.\n\nThe public will be invited to suggest names, which Reddy hopes will build more excitement to learn about birds.\n\n\"It’s going to be a slow and deliberative process,\" Kaufman said, with \"lots of opportunities for public input.\"\n\nAddressing past wrongs in the scientific world\n\nThese aren't the first birds to be renamed, and similar events have occurred as other science groups wrestle with the past. The society's predecessor, the American Ornithologist's Union, changed the name of the Oldsquaw duck to the long-tailed duck in 2000, according to a July 2000 update in the organization's magazine.\n\nIn 2001, the American Fisheries Society changed the name of a fish once known as jewfish to Goliath grouper.\n\nThe Entomological Society of America revamped its guidelines in 2021, barring insect names that referenced ethnic or racial groups.\n\nThe National Audubon Society also has struggled with the controversial past of its namesake, John James Audubon. Earlier this year, the society announced it had considered but rejected adopting a new name.\n\nThe decision prompted several local and state chapters to drop the Audubon name. Among the renamed chapters are the Golden Gate Bird Alliance in California and the Badgerland Bird Alliance in Madison, Wisconsin.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/ford/2020/08/05/detroit-train-station-renovation-ford/5548057002/", "title": "Detroit train station renovation still moving ahead in pandemic ...", "text": "Ford Motor Co. intends to keep its promise to rebuild the iconic Michigan Central Station despite the pandemic that has led to billions in losses over the past six months, the Free Press has confirmed.\n\nThe iconic building in the heart of Corktown that came to represent despair, so-called \"ruin porn\" and the disintegration of Detroit still remains a \"priority\" for Ford two years after the company celebrated its purchase of the train station along Michigan Avenue, 7 miles down the street from its world headquarters in Dearborn.\n\n\"We were excited to get back to work on Michigan Central Station in early May after a seven-week pause due to the stay-at-home order,\" said Christina Twelftree, Ford spokeswoman for the Corktown project.\n\n\"While the virus has impacted our project in some ways due to availability of the workforce, materials and logistics, there hasn't been any fundamental shifts to our overall development plan,\" she said. \"We still expect to meet our original construction completion date for the train station at the end of 2022.\"\n\nThe train station project, she said, is \"critical\" to delivering on the company's long-term business plan and \"pivotal\" for Detroit and for \"ensuring Michigan remains a leader in mobility, research, testing and innovation.\"\n\nThe company remains mindful of cost.\n\n\"We're always thoughtful about how we deploy resources,\" Twelftree said.\n\nFord spokesman T.R. Reid said explicitly, \"There's been no change to our plans\" involving the train station.\n\nWorkers are now in the middle of Phase Two of the restoration of the station, the longest and most labor-intensive part of the project. This involves fixing the street structure and repairing more than 8 acres of masonry.\n\nWorkers are cleaning and repairing brick and terra cotta masonry on the exterior of the building and replacing almost 300 limestone blocks on the waiting room exterior facade.\n\nInterior demolition continues, as well as carpentry and roofing installation. By late summer, Ford expects to have several hundred people on-site doing the work.\n\nIn September, two dozen Detroit residents will begin working on the train station as part of a paid training program that teaches skilled trades with preference given to people from the immediate area.\n\n\"We have a role in lifting communities up,\" said Pamela Alexander, director of community development for the Ford Fund, which directs community outreach in Detroit and for the development project. \"To lift up, you have to listen and engage and be firm in your commitments.\"\n\nThe train depot, which opened the day after Christmas in 1913, has been abandoned since 1988. After Ford announced plans for the $350 million renovation that includes city and state tax incentives, people from around America and the world responded with joy.\n\nMore:Thief returns train station clock, thanks Ford for believing in Detroit\n\nMore:Ford receiving calls to return stolen Detroit train station property\n\nMore:Ford's Detroit train station dream: Hundreds of workers, cars of future\n\n\"We're in a war for talent. If you think of some of the great tech companies that have these beautiful campuses, nobody will have anything like this,\" Bill Ford Jr., executive chairman of the company, told the Free Press in June 2018.\n\nHe said later during the public celebration on June 19, 2018, \"For 76 years, the train station was our Ellis Island. Once the last train pulled out, it became the symbol that hope left. ... We at Ford want to help write the next chapter.\"\n\nUgly rumor\n\nBob Roberts, co-owner of McShane's Irish Pub and president of the Corktown Business Association, said he worried the whole project would die.\n\n\"Obviously, there has been a tremendous amount of investment by the city of Detroit, by the community through the Neighborhood Advisory Council and the community benefits agreement that was required by ordinance when Ford announced they were going to develop the train station,\" he said. \"It was probably about a year's long worth of community outreach that took place that finally got the agreement adopted by Ford.\"\n\nThe symbol of decay was a knife in the heart of locals who believed in its potential.\n\n\"It's important to have this developed,\" Roberts said. \"Within four weeks of the actual (coronavirus) shutdown, there was a rumor taking place that Ford was going to keep part of their footprint with this project but the actual train station itself was going to have to be put up for sale.\"\n\nAs soon as he heard the rumor, he called Ford contacts \"and they said there couldn't be anything farther from the truth. They couldn't be more committed. They said, 'As soon as we're allowed to be back on the property to do the work, we'll be there.' And they were.\"\n\nThe Detroit Public Schools Book Depository next to the train station will be finished first, he noted.\n\n\"Ford Motor Company is taking painstaking efforts to make sure it is redeveloped as closely as possible to its original era,\" said Roberts, who grew up in Brighton and moved to Corktown six years ago. \"Being historic Corktown, that's very important. We're the city's oldest neighborhood.\"\n\nHe explained, \"They're very committed to the history and to the historic significance of the train station.\"\n\nFor example, to preserve the historic look of the exterior of the building, Ford is currently replacing or upgrading all the limestone and terra cotta and restoring the large cast iron and wooden windows of the grand waiting room to their exact historic specifications.\n\nIn November 2018, then-Ford executive Joe Hinrichs told a Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York that the project would cost an estimated $740 million for the station and neighboring properties — purchase, renovation and new construction — and the company would seek more than $238 million in tax or other incentives.\n\n\"It's not only a good use of capital but it's the right thing to do,\" Hinrichs said at the time. \"For a lot of reasons, it makes sense for the future of Ford — attracting and keeping talent.\"\n\n'For how long?'\n\nOn Monday, Morgan Stanley wrote investors that a new Universum survey of 44,000 college students between October 2019 and April 2020 showed the auto industry has grown more attractive for engineering students. Tesla is viewed as the top choice with Ford at No. 12, General Motors at No. 15, BMW at No. 16 and Toyota at No. 21.\n\n\"The window for legacy automakers to bring in top engineering talent is still open, but for how long?\" asked Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley analyst.\n\nMore:Ford's plan to defer government loan payments a 'concerning sign'\n\nWhile Ford portrays the train station as a valuable recruiting tool, stockholders and analysts have wondered publicly and privately whether the investment remains prudent during exceptionally challenging circumstances. The company lost nearly $2 billion in the first three months of this year and another $1.9 billion in the second quarter, which actually exceeded expectations.\n\nTrain station value: Priceless\n\nSome say the true value of the train station can't be measured.\n\n\"On your finance sheets, there's no line item for the value of the brand,\" said Marcus Collins, a Cass Tech High School graduate who went on to become a marketing professor in the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"The only time a brand is valued is during an acquisition or merger,\" he said. \"But the brand value is represented in what they call goodwill.The benefits of brand are not fully captured in the numbers.\"\n\nCollins explained, \"Everything around us has meaning based on who you are, how you see the world and what your affiliation is. If I told you the Eiffel Tower is losing the city of Paris money, well, what is Paris without the Eiffel Tower? The train station has become a part of the artifacts that make Detroit what it is. For some, it’s as Detroit as the Joe Louis fist downtown.\"\n\nMore:Detroit train station ends public tours\n\nMore:Bill Ford shares vision for Corktown\n\nMore:Ford pumped 227,000 gallons of water out of Detroit train depot\n\nFor so many Michigan families, the train station is about connection to a place and a time. More than 20,000 people made reservations to visit the train station over a handful of days when Ford opened it to the public with controlled crowds.\n\n“We felt so fortunate to get in,” Carolyn Montie of Lincoln, Massachusetts, who registered after reading about the train station in the New York Times, said in June 2018. “The space is magnificent. It’s sort of like a real temple to the economic power of the city when it was built. It was a celebration of all that.”\n\nFound whiskey bottle, memories\n\nFew can forget the story of the thief who returned the train station's stolen clock to Ford with a message of gratitude. And other missing objects have been returned over the past two years.\n\nBut workers have also found keepsakes from times past, like an old whiskey bottle tucked between the walls — left there by plasterers more than 100 years ago.\n\n\"Our guys are taking the plaster down and come to find out, they pull this bottle out, this whiskey bottle, with a little bit left in the bottle,\" said Richard Bardelli, construction manager on the new project. \"The plaster guys were plastered. Back then, they just drank. And they set that empty bottle on the ledge and just left it there. But they were artisans.\"\n\nNo one tasted the old whiskey but the scent remained.\n\nThe plaster work, Bardelli said, is simply unbelievable in its craftsmanship.\n\nThe whiskey bottle — Westminster Rye Whiskey — was from a Detroit whiskey maker that operated from 1882 to 1916, historical research suggests. The 18th Amendment passed in 1919. Michigan enacted Prohibition in May 1917, making Detroit the first major city to ban alcohol, according to the Walter P. Reuther Library at Wayne State University. But nationally, the ban on manufacturing, transporting and selling alcohol took effect in 1920 and lasted until 1933.\n\n\"C.H. Ritter & Co. is one of those lost names in Detroit, the type you see on a building facade in a faded photograph, but with little or no context,\" said Joel Stone, senior curator at the Detroit Historical Society.\n\n\"Local saloon patrons probably recognized the brands that Ritter distributed — Chamberlain Silver Rye, Westminster Rye, Caravan Special Reserve Whiskey — more than his company,\" he said. \"Today, except to bottle aficionados, C.H. Ritter's name is all but forgotten.\"\n\nHistorical writings indicate that Charles H. Ritter entered the 5th Michigan Infantry as a private and became 1st Lieutenant and Adjutant in October 1864 during the American Civil War.\n\nClassic Coke in the Motor City\n\nConstruction workers also found Coke bottles and old beer bottles, one from the West Side Brewery Company that flourished in Detroit in the late 1800s and early 1900s, in the train station.\n\nAnd there are newspaper pages from the 1960s, a Street & Smith \"Love Story\" magazine from September 1941.\n\n\"Contractors love to find this stuff,\" Bardelli said. \"The station means something to everybody and everybody has a story. It doesn't matter how old you were or what generation you're from or whether you lived in the city or in Corktown. Every time I meet somebody, the first thing they ask me is how the train station is coming. You can see in people's eyes how much it means to them.\"\n\nWorking on a 100-year-old building restoration after it sat empty for 32 years is daunting, he said. \"But I can see how it's gonna end up. I've had a couple dreams where I'm just standing in the middle of the waiting room and it was this grand place.\"\n\nRose Farrugia Bardelli, Rich Bardelli's mother, grew up in Corktown. She's Maltese, the heritage of many in the community. Farrugia lived at the corner of 12th and Church streets, before 12th was renamed Rosa Parks Boulevard.\n\n\"She just turned 80 in July,\" Bardelli said. \"I brought all her brothers and sisters through the station. Funny thing about it, you don't think you talk to your parents or aunts and uncles about what they were like when they were younger or where they lived. My uncle worked at the old Lincoln brass factory, across from their house. My grandmother worker at the hosiery factory, which is our first Ford building we did.\"\n\nAn intersection of then, now\n\nFord has a clear plan for Corktown. It will be:\n\na workplace for 5,000 Ford employees and partners, with 1.2-million-square-feet of commercial space.\n\nanchored by four key buildings: Michigan Central Station, The Book Depository, The Factory and a new building west of the station.\n\na host of mixed-use spaces, including retail, restaurants, co-working space, office space and hospitality as well as a real-world mobility testing ground that will include the old train tracks behind the station.\n\nconnected with new public spaces that engage with the local community.\n\nWhat's happening now, with COVID-19, makes the investment all the more powerful, said Ted Ryan, Ford's archivist and heritage brand manager.\n\n\"We're so limited in what we can do physically now,\" he said. \"These small moments, it's a way to get interconnected by objects. This is cultural anthropology. We view societies by what they produce and what they cherish. In America, we cherish the small things, like Coke bottles and whiskey bottles and people who brought their train tickets from 1941 back.\"\n\nThey brought light fixtures and fire extinguishers, all of which were reviewed by architectural historians. The station, open to trespass for many years, had been stripped to the bone.\n\n\"Somebody brought in lights used over the elevators, with a globe on the top and bottom that lit up. They weren't apparent on the drawings. And we were able to learn,\" Ryan said. \"The station is bigger than all of us. It so represents Detroit. And everything people find, it gains in significance.\"\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-222-6512 orphoward@freepress.com.Follow her on Twitter@phoebesaid.

A makeshift hospital was organized in the First Methodist Church, and the ill and dying filled hallways, pews and aisles. Among the volunteer nurses tending to patients at the church was Angie Harrison, a relative newcomer to the community.\n\n\"This was the first association between the name Harrison and hospitals in the city,\" the East Bremerton News later remarked.\n\nA new hospital opened in the city that year and Angie and her husband, Benjamin, a hardware store owner, would become its majority shareholders and biggest boosters.\n\nA century later, the Harrison name remains inextricably linked with healthcare on the Kitsap Peninsula, even as the medical center navigates the most ambitious reorganization in its long history. As civic leaders feted Harrison Medical Center and parent company CHI Franciscan Health during a private centennial celebration Thursday in Silverdale, the steel-and-concrete skeleton of a nine-story hospital tower loomed above, signalling the sweeping changes to come.\n\nPast coverage:Rooms with a view: Future Harrison hospital embraces surroundings\n\n\"When you look behind you and see all the building that's happening, we're here developing a campus for the next 100 years, if not longer,\" CHI Franciscan CEO Ketul Patel told the crowd of 200 that gathered on the top floor of a parking garage built to serve the expanded Harrison Silverdale complex.\n\nThe $500 million Silverdale hospital is scheduled to open in 2020. Harrison's hospital in East Bremerton — its flagship facility since the 1960s — will close.\n\nBremerton Mayor Greg Wheeler, who was critical of the relocation project during his campaign last year, struck a conciliatory tone at the celebration Thursday.\n\n\"Harrison is going to be a big part of our lives in Bremerton, and that's not going to change,\" Wheeler said. \"... we are going to close the door and we are going to open another.\"\n\n\"It's all for the good of the community,\" County Commissioner Ed Wolfe added in his remarks. \"This is not just going to serve Central Kitsap, it's going to serve four counties.\"\n\nDeep roots\n\nHarrison opened its doors for the first time in 1918 at the corner of Eighth Street and Chester Avenue, in the heart of Bremerton. Originally called City General Hospital, the humble medical center was later renamed Olympic Hospital and finally became Harrison Memorial Hospital in 1942 as it reorganized as a nonprofit, according to \"Kitsap County: A History,\" published by the Kitsap County Historical Society.\n\nMore:Bremerton respite program gives homeless patients a place to recover\n\nBenjamin Harrison, who guided the organization through its early years, bequeathed his estate to the hospital.\n\n\"It is my desire that Harrison Memorial Hospital shall serve humanity and shall alleviate the pain and suffering of mankind,\" Benjamin wrote in his will.\n\nThe move to Silverdale in 2020 won't mark the first time Harrison has relocated in order to expand in modernize. As the 1960s dawned, the hospital was stretching to serve the region from an outdated building in West Bremerton. The Harrison board bought seven acres in East Bremerton and made a controversial decision to switch sides of the Port Washington Narrows.\n\nA $600,000 fundraising drive helped finance the $3.2 million, 150-bed complex, which opened on Cherry Avenue in 1965, trumpeted as a \"giant stride forward\" for health care in the county. In the decades that followed, Harrison would keep expanding its East Bremerton facility while building a network of satellite offices from Belfair to Bainbridge Island. The system treats more than 90,000 patients a year, according to CHI Franciscan.\n\nUnprecedented change\n\nIndependent for its first 95 years, Harrison joined Tacoma-based CHI Franciscan Health in 2013. The affiliation agreement helped ensure Harrison's long-term stability while providing access to the capital it needed to pursue a full-scale hospital in Silverdale. Plans for the relocation — long in the works — were formally announced a year later.\n\nThe project stoked excitement and angst. Many hailed the prospect of a modern, centralized hospital and the massive capital investment in the county (perhaps the largest commercial project in Kitsap history). Others, including city officials, worried the move would cut off vulnerable Bremerton patients from health care services, and some questioned Harrison's secular status within a Catholic system.\n\nMore:Bremerton residency reunites young MD with the doctor who delivered him\n\nThe state approved a certificate of need for the project last year, largely quieting the debate. The nine-story hospital tower rising above Myhre Road erases any doubt of Harrison's pivot to Silverdale, while plans are still in place for a West Bremerton clinic slated to open in 2020.\n\nAt the centennial event Thursday, which followed events recognizing employees, CHI Franciscan executives said the capital projects are a continuance of Harrison's dedication to West Sound patients.\n\n\"For us, it's about making sure we have the best services in the region,\" Patel said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Gig Harbor) echoed those sentiments in his remarks.\n\n\"This is a big deal for our region,\" Kilmer said. \"... This isn't about a building, as impressive as that building is, it's about the incredible caregivers here in Kitsap County who are committed to the health and wellness of people in this community, it's about a bunch of great jobs, and it's about vital care. And I think the Harrisons would be awfully proud of that.\"\n\nKitsap's hospital history\n\n1903 — Puget Sound Naval shipyard opens the region's first hospital near present-day Dry Dock No. 1 (the navy first offered medical services aboard a ship).\n\n1911 — Bremerton Hospital Inc. forms to provide care to the public, which had been served by small private clinics.

It’s just that the NCAA’s chronic avoidance of defining the name/image/likeness (NIL) issue in college athletics has added layers of legalese and complications to a seismic shift in the amateur athletics model that was supposed to be implemented in time for the 2021-22 school year.\n\nNow there’s no clear timeline.\n\nAnd state legislatures, Congress and the Supreme Court will ultimately likely dictate to the NCAA rather than suggest what the next steps are that need to be taken.\n\nEA Sports doesn’t have a firm timeline either to release its rebranded EA Sports College Football video game, though EA Sports vice president and general manager Daryl Holt told ESPN it wouldn’t happen in 2021.\n\nWhat it has is a plan.\n\nIf name/image/likeness is still unresolved when the game approaches its release date, EA Sports will introduce a watered-down version without the player rosters and likeness of actual players.\n\nModeling real college players and their traits without naming them was part of the appeal of NCAA Football 14, the last version to be released (in July 2013) before EA Sports canceled the video game franchise after former UCLA basketball player Ed O’Bannon won an antitrust class action lawsuit over NIL against the NCAA.\n\nEA Sports, in partnering with collegiate trademark licensing company CLC, plans to proceed, though, with the new iteration by using logos, stadiums, uniforms and gameday traditions from more than 100 college teams.\n\nBut abruptly not Notre Dame. Call it a preemptive strike.\n\nLooking ahead:Which Notre Dame position groups promise the most spring intrigue?\n\nMore:Assessing state of Notre Dame football recruiting\n\n“Notre Dame Athletics welcomes the return of EA Sports College Football, a video game series that has historically helped promote interest in college football,” Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said Monday in a statement.\n\n“Notre Dame will not, however, participate in the game until such time as rules have been finalized governing the participation of our student-athletes. As those rules are developed, it is our strong desire that student-athletes be allowed to benefit directly from allowing their name, image and performance history to be used in the game.”\n\nIrish head coach Brian Kelly tweeted his support on Monday.\n\n\"We are here to support our student-athletes,\" he said. \"Much like we have empowered our players when it comes to providing a platform to speak on racial inequalities & social issues that are important to them, we must support them when it comes to NIL & the work that still needs to be done.\"\n\nNotre Dame has long been a proponent of the NIL movement, and it’ll be interesting to see if other schools follow ND’s lead.\n\n“It’s going on six years ago — at least five — that (university president) Father John (Jenkins) gave an interview with The New York Times,” Swarbrick said in December, “where he said we supported name, image and likeness for the student-athlete, based on the fundamental view that we wanted the experience of the student-athlete to be as much like the experience of the non-student-athlete at this university as possible.\n\n“The implementation is a mess, and sadly so.”\n\nIt’s not as simple as NIL legislation finally taking form and being put into practice. EA Sports would then have to negotiate with the players for compensation, a process still yet to be defined under eventual NCAA guidelines.\n\nAnd there’s so many more facets to the issue than video games.\n\nCollege athletes will be able to sign endorsement deals, hire agents, sponsor camps and monetize their social media influence for instance.\n\n“I think the big issue is that the NCAA has been historically reluctant to make change,” Sportico legal analyst and senior sports legal reporter Michael McCann said on ND Insider’s Pod of Gold podcast.\n\n“We’ve seen that over the years. It’s a static organization. They like things the way they are — to their detriment, to be honest.

Asked to rate the severity of six specific mental health concerns, Americans put the opioid epidemic near the top, with more than two-thirds of people identifying it as a crisis rather than merely a problem. More than half identified mental health issues among children and teenagers as a crisis, as well as severe mental illness in adults.\n\nThe survey captured the perceptions of a nationally representative sample of about 2,000 adults over the summer – 2½ years into the Covid-19 pandemic and amid ongoing public health threats including racism and gun violence.\n\nThe broad concern is well-founded, rooted in both personal experience and national trends.\n\n“The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated numerous social stressors that we know can increase the risk of both substance use and mental illness,” said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nData from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that drug overdose deaths reached record levels in 2021 and suicide rates were back near a record high after two years of decline. And in 2020, mental health-related visits to emergency rooms jumped 31% among adolescents ages 12 to 17.\n\nAccording to the CNN and KFF poll, about half of adults say they have had a severe mental health crisis in their family, including in-person treatment for family members who were a threat to themselves or others, or family members who engaged in self-harming behaviors.\n\nMore than 1 in 5 adults describe their own mental health as only “fair” or “poor,” including extra-large shares of adults under the age of 30, adults who identify as LGBT and those with an annual income of less than $40,000. A third of all adults said they felt anxious always or often over the course of the past year, including more than half of LGBT adults and those under 30. About 1 in 5 adults said they were often or always depressed or lonely over the past year, too.\n\nMajor sources of stress for a third or more of adults include personal finances and current and political events. About 1 in 4 adults also identified personal relationships and work, respectively, as major sources of stress.\n\nAccording to the new survey, about 1 in 5 adults received mental health services in the past year. Earlier data published by the CDC supports that finding and shows that mental health treatment became more common over the course of the pandemic: Nearly 22% of adults got mental health treatment in 2021, up from about 19% in 2019.\n\n“Perhaps one of the only benefits of the pandemic and the shift that our country has been going through is the increase in our willingness to acknowledge and talk about when we might be struggling or in need of support,” said Sarah Brummett, director of the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention’s executive committee.\n\n“People are more willing to roll up their sleeves and talk about it and support folks. And I think that’s progress.”\n\nDespite increased willingness and commonly shared stressors among the public, most adults who have only fair or poor mental health said they don’t feel comfortable talking to loved ones about it – some to maintain privacy and some to avoid the shame and stigma attached to mental health issues.\n\nBut the vast majority – more than 4 out of 5 – of those surveyed say individuals and families should play a major role in addressing mental health problems in the US, equal to the share who say the same of health care providers.\n\nExperts say there is an opportunity to broaden perceptions about how mental health is part of overall physical health and how to respond to mental health crises.\n\n“Not everyone’s a cardiologist, but a lot of people are trained in CPR,” said Justin Baker, a psychologist and assistant professor at the Ohio State University College of Medicine. “If we only rely on the mental health force, we’re going to keep going around in circles and never actually get anywhere. I think we see this as all of our problems.”\n\nNonetheless, the groups most likely to say they need mental health care in the US are also less likely to say they can get it.\n\nNearly 6 out of 10 adults who say their mental health is only fair or poor say they have not been able to get needed care, as well as about half of adults younger than 30 and LGBT adults.\n\nFor those who have gone without help, the most common reasons cited were being too busy or unable to take time off work, being unable to afford the cost, and being afraid or embarrassed to seek care, according to the CNN and KFF survey.\n\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Joe Biden outlined a multipronged strategy to address the country’s mental health crisis, including goals to integrate mental health into primary care, investing in the work force and new approaches to programs that provide care.\n\n“Let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need, more people they can turn to for help and full parity between physical and mental health care,” he said in his address in March.\n\nAccording to the poll, most Americans see those issues as significant problems. A majority, 55%, say it’s a big problem that there aren’t enough mental health care providers, about three-quarters say that insurers not covering mental health the way they do physical health is a significant concern, and 80% say the same about the cost of mental health care.\n\nThrough the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration has invested $5 billion in mental health and substance use programs through the US Department of Health and Human Services, with billions more proposed in future budgets.\n\nOne significant shift came this summer, with the transition of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to a three-digit dialing code: 988. Early data suggests success, with calls jumping 45% in the first month compared with the same time a year before.\n\nBut according to the new survey, there is still work to be done.\n\nThe vast majority of adults (85%) say they would be at least somewhat likely to call the hotline if they or a loved one were experiencing a mental health crisis – and it’s a good alternative to 911, which about a quarter of adults, especially Black and LGBT adults, say would do more harm than good in a mental health crisis situation.\n\nIt also has potential to help Hispanic people and those who are uninsured, who are more likely than average to say they don’t know who to call if there is a mental health crisis and would not know where to find services.\n\nYet more than half of adults in the new poll say they have heard “nothing at all” about the new 988 hotline.\n\n“This can be a preventable public health issue, and we all have a role to play,” Brummett said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe fieldwork for the CNN/KFF Mental Health Survey was conducted by SSRS on July 28 through August 9 among a random national sample of 2,004 adults.

In February, the agency also released a report saying officials have received 116,000 complaints about the devices, with more than 500 of those resulting in death, from people or lawyers who attributed the incidents to Philips' machines. The agency has since clarified that further investigation needs to be done on these claims.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY at the time, Philips denied any link between the deaths and injuries and its machines. The company previously said there were no reports of deaths due to product defects but acknowledged that the risks of particulate exposure could cause \"headache, irritation, inflammation, respiratory issues and possible toxic and carcinogenic effects.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Philips agreed to a consent decree that stopped the company from selling sleep apnea machines in the United States and was ordered to offer a payment option as a part of a remediation plan.\n\nA 2023 investigation into the recall by Pro Publica and the Pittsburg Post Gazette found that Phillips had withheld complaints about the foam for over a decade before warning customers.\n\nRecalled devices\n\nExisting devices manufactured between 2009 and April 2021 are subject to recall, as they may pose a serious injury risk due to the breakdown of the PE-PUR foam used in them.\n\nDevices included in the recall include:\n\nA-Series BiPAP A30\n\nA-Series BiPAP A40 (ventilator)\n\nA-Series BiPAP Hybrid A30\n\nA-Series BiPAP V30 Auto (ventilator)\n\nC-Series ASV (ventilator)\n\nC-Series S/T and AVAPS\n\nDreamStation\n\nDreamStation ASV\n\nDreamStation Go\n\nDreamStation ST, AVAPS\n\nDorma 400\n\nDorma 500\n\nE30\n\nGarbin Plus, Aeris, LifeVent (ventilator)\n\nOmniLab Advanced+\n\nREMstar SE Auto\n\nSystemOne ASV4\n\nSystemOne (Q-Series)\n\nTrilogy 100 (ventilator)\n\nTrilogy 200 (ventilator)\n\nCertain Trilogy Evo ventilators with specific serial numbers.\n\nSome products that were modified in an attempt to resolve the issue have been recalled as well.

The spurs form as pressure is exerted on the neck and spine when looking down at a smartphone, said its researchers.\n\nNevertheless, the researchers warn people should be worried about more than the spurs. \"The bump is a sign of sustained terrible posture, which can be corrected quite simply,” Dr. Mark Sayers said in a statement to 9 News.\n\nWhile the bone spurs are getting newfound attention, many common health issues, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and eye strain stemming from too much computer use, have been amplified in the smartphone age. Here are a few of the more surprising health problems that researchers have connected to smartphone use:\n\nSkull 'horns'\n\nCheck your neck.\n\nAfter inspecting hundreds of X-rays of adults ages 18-30, a study published last year in the Nature Research journal from two Australian researchers found bone growths on the back of nearly half of their heads. Media reports have widely said those growths look an awful lot like horns – an observation echoed by at least one researcher.\n\n“You may say it looks like a bird’s beak, a horn, a hook,\" said Dr. David Shahar, one of the researchers involved, to the Washington Post.\n\nFollowing its widespread media attention, some commentators have critiqued the study's methodology. A spokesperson for the journal in which the study was published told PBS that it is looking into these criticisms.\n\nWhile the spurs don't protrude from the head, they can be felt in some cases.\n\nWhen smart devices watch you:What do they do with the data?\n\nResearchers hypothesized that the \"horns\" form as young people hunch down to use their mobile devices. The pressure this creates on the back of the neck and the head, they note, is three to five times higher than merely sitting up straight.\n\nUntil recently, these growths, called enthesophytes, were frequently associated with aging and were considered unusual for young people.\n\nTech neck\n\nIf you're worried about head horns stemming from smartphone-induced bad posture, you may be suffering from \"tech neck.\" Tech neck is caused by spending too much time in \"text position,\" warned Dr. Evan Johnson from Columbia University in a blog post last year.\n\nThe more you tilt your head forward and down, the more gravity increases the weight to your neck, increasing the pressure exerted. (It's similar to the reason head horns have begun sprouting.) For a person with an average head weight of 10 pounds, a 60-degree tilt is equivalent to 60 pounds of force.\n\nHere's how to tell that you might be facing tech neck: Check your profile sideways in a mirror, says University of California San Francisco associate professor Andrew Lui. If your ears are not aligned with your shoulders, your posture may be causing tech neck.\n\nHome workout:Companies like Peloton, Mirror, FightCamp push remote fitness forward\n\nTexters' thumb\n\nIt used to be called gamers' thumb. But with the ever-increasing popularity of smartphones and tablets, texters' thumb is spreading to the masses.\n\nCaused by too much tapping and swiping, it's a repetitive stress injury that leads to cramping and discomfort in the thumb and lower hand. It can worsen into thumb arthritis, says Robert Wysocki, an orthopedic surgeon at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.\n\nBoth can be painful, but texters' thumb is temporary, while thumb arthritis can require surgery. The latter hasn't been linked yet to smartphone use, however.\n\nMillennials, you've got this all wrong:You need to stop 'saving' for retirement\n\nPhantom vibration syndrome\n\nIf you're worried that you're missing out on a lot of notifications, only to find your phone hasn't vibrated at all, you're not alone. A study from Georgia Tech found nearly 90% of college undergraduates surveyed experienced the phenomenon.\n\nThose who participated, according to the study, weren't exactly bothered by phantom vibrations. But there's some concern that our brains are being rewired to worry about who's tweeting and messaging you.\n\n\"People who are constantly picking up their phone look like they have an obsession,\" said psychologist Larry Rosen to NPR. \"I'm not saying that it is an obsession, but I'm saying that it could turn into one, very easily.\"\n\nResearchers said the phenomenon tends to happen more to people who are reliant on communicating via text message.\n\nContributing: Jennifer Jolly, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/03/07/pfas-guide-chemicals/6652847001/", "title": "What are PFAS? A guide to understanding chemicals behind ...", "text": "PFAS is an acronym for a family of chemicals called per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances that are celebrated for their use in nonstick cookware and water resistant clothing but also feared for their potential toxicity, which has been linked to types of cancer and other harmful effects.\n\nThese chemicals are synthetic and do not appear naturally in the environment. They were originally discovered in 1938, when a chemist working on refrigerants accidentally created a slippery, white substance that would later lead to the creation of the Teflon brand of nonstick pots and pans.\n\nAs of February 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency counted about 12,000 different kinds of PFAS. The common characteristic of all PFAS is that they include a carbon-fluorine molecule bond, one of the strongest known in chemistry. Other molecules cannot break between the carbon-fluorine bond, and instead slide off of surfaces treated with PFAS.\n\nThat same characteristic can also make PFAS harmful, as the chemicals are virtually indestructible and do not fully degrade in the environment or within living tissue. For that reason, they're often referred to as “forever chemicals.”\n\nRED F:Is EPA putting interests of chemical companies ahead of your health? These experts think so\n\nWhich products contain PFAS?\n\nPFAS chemicals are perhaps best-known for their use in nonstick cookware. The Teflon brand revolutionized such products, but the use of PFAS is widespread across many nonstick cookware brands.\n\nPFAS are also often behind any product that boasts waterproof or stain-resistant properties. Such products include clothing, rainwear, furniture, outdoor equipment, tapes, and cosmetics. They are also frequently used in food packaging to minimize the leaking of grease.\n\nPFAS are also frequently used in electronics, medical equipment, and renewable technologies. The military has used them in foams to help douse fires, particularly those that involve oil and can be water-resistant.\n\nWhat are PFOA and PFOS?\n\nPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are perhaps the two most studied PFAS chemicals. PFOA was a product primarily used by DuPont in its product lines, while PFOS was primarily used by 3M.\n\nDue to concerns about their persistence in the environment and potential for toxicity, DuPont, 3M, and other manufacturers reached an agreement with the EPA in 2006 to phase out PFOA and PFOS in the U.S.\n\nThat resulted in the increased use of a new generation of PFAS, still used today in many common products. Concerns have also arisen over their safety, most notably the “GenX” PFAS chemical, which led to significant contamination in North Carolina.\n\nWhat do PFAS do to your body?\n\nResearch is ongoing about how PFAS move through the environment, how Americans are exposed, and what the chemicals may do to our health.\n\nHealth experts become particularly concerned with any persistent chemical that also displays two other characteristics: those that are bioaccumulative, meaning they build up in living tissue, and those that are toxic, which means they harm living organisms, like plants, animals, and humans.\n\nThe degree to which PFAS are bioaccumulative or toxic changes based on both the specific PFAS chemical considered, and the opinion of researchers.\n\nIt is increasingly well established that PFOA and PFOS in particular are likely both bioaccumulative and toxic. Federal testing shows that they are in the blood of more than 98% of Americans and stay in the body years after exposure.\n\nLarge and numerous studies of highly exposed populations have linked them to health effects including ulcerative colitis, diagnosed high cholesterol, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, and pregnancy-induced hypertension.\n\nResearchers are also concerned about exposure to PFOA and PFOS among the general U.S. population, with some studies showing that even typical blood levels could be measurably driving up rates of kidney cancer, weakening immune systems and possibly causing tens of thousands of low-birthweight babies each year.\n\nThe threat posed by the 12,000 types of PFAS as a class of chemicals is a point of contention. Advocates of the chemical industry often argue that each PFAS chemical should be judged separately, and that newer PFAS chemicals are less likely to be harmful due to their chemical structures.\n\nBut advocates for stricter regulation say studies suggest many have shared characteristics and risks. They say testing each PFAS chemical individually is not feasible because of how many exist, and that instead the chemicals should be regulated as a class as a precaution.\n\nWhat’s the solution to PFAS?\n\nBecause the commercial and technological benefits of PFAS are substantial, it would be difficult stop their use. The chemicals also are already widely spread in the environment, even in remote areas such as the Arctic.\n\nIn the U.S., the EPA has laid out plans to learn where PFAS are, how to clean them up, how toxic they are, and which regulations need to be implemented to protect the public.\n\nBut many environmental groups and scientists say that more should be done, up to a complete phaseout of PFAS, except for absolutely essential uses.\n\nA commonly held view among environmental groups is that PFAS should at least be regulated as a single class in drinking water and the environment, to simplify the process of evaluating toxicity and deciding when to filter water.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/opinions/women-in-prison-period-reproductive-health-blakinger/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Why I'll never forget having my period in prison | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Keri Blakinger is the author of the memoir “Corrections in Ink.” She is a staff writer for The Marshall Project whose work focuses on prisons and jails.

It was the first time I’d ever been locked up, so I had to learn the ropes from the women around me.\n\nKeri Blakinger Ilana Panich-Linsman\n\nFor the most part, they were glad to share – but I wasn’t always sure how much of what they said was just jailhouse lore. So when a couple of them griped about how the local lockup always put men’s needs first, I didn’t know whether to believe them.\n\nBut my new neighbors offered examples: The men could sign up for buzz cuts, while we had to trim each other’s hair with toenail clippers. Though we all lived in cells, they also had a lower-security dorm. They had more classes than we did. And they were allowed to have jail jobs and earn privileges.\n\nMost importantly, they were almost never the ones who got sent to another jail when our home jail – in Tompkins County, New York – ran out of space, a transfer that usually meant a few days or weeks in solitary and sometimes months spent further from loved ones who might visit.\n\nStill, I was skeptical. At the time, I did not understand that jails and prisons were made with men in mind – from the fit of the uniforms to the rules designed to control male social structures and violence to the medical services that consistently overlooked women’s basic needs. It is a system where women are often an afterthought. I just hadn’t realized it yet.\n\nThen, I got my period. On the outside, I’d had a very irregular cycle due to years of eating disorders and heavy drug use, the latter of which was what landed me behind bars in the first place. But once I sobered up in the county jail, I started bleeding – and did not stop.\n\nFor roughly six weeks, I bled every day, while repeatedly asking the guards – who were mostly men and often squeamish – for tampons and then cringing as I changed them in my two-person cell, where the toilet was in full view of every passer-by walking down the hallway.\n\nIt felt like a bad place to be a woman, and a particularly bad place to be a person with a period. But I was unsure what to do. Before I got arrested, I had never really thought about how medical care worked behind bars – and I had no idea how bad it could be and often was.\n\nEventually, I asked the jail nurse if there was anything she could do to help. She suggested birth control, which can sometimes help regulate a person’s menstrual cycle. After a consultation and an outside medical trip – in shackles and handcuffs – to the local Planned Parenthood, I decided to try Depo-Provera, a hormonal shot taken once every 90 days, which was easier to manage in jail than a daily pill.\n\nMinutes after I returned from the doctor’s office after getting my first dose, a male sergeant cornered me in my cell, demanding to know why I’d gone on birth control in jail – as if he were some sort of authority on women’s health. I bit my tongue and answered his questions as succinctly as possible, partly out of annoyance and partly to minimize my embarrassment at having to explain my periods as he scowled down at me and narrowed his eyes.\n\nA few days later, the bleeding stopped. It felt like magic – until it came time for my next dose. By then, the nurse who’d suggested I get the first shot had left, and her replacement told me I could not get birth control in jail. In fact, she said the prior nurse should have never let me get it in the first place. Apparently, something as trivial as bleeding every day for weeks didn’t require any treatment.\n\nAs the hormones waned, I began bleeding again. And I kept bleeding and bleeding and bleeding. I bled almost every day for the next six months. That would have been bad enough in the free world, but behind bars it was so much worse.\n\nIn jail, having your period means begging for supplies, putting up with the uneasy jokes from male guards who handed them out, planning ahead to minimize the humiliation during regular strip searches and trying to calculate the best time to change a tampon in a cell without a guard strolling in – or a group of detained men in orange jumpsuits walking by.\n\nFor the first few months, I hoped the bleeding would stop on its own. When it didn’t, I tried putting in more requests for medical attention, sometimes drawing cartoon tombstones or dramatic bloodstains in the margins of the jail’s standard request forms, hoping my gory decorations would attract more attention. (They did not.) Eventually, the bleeding eased up just before I went to a state prison in late 2011.\n\nAt the time, I saw the whole ordeal as an example of just how bad medical care is behind bars. But looking back it seems like something more.\n\nAfter I was released in 2012, I went on to become a reporter who covers prisons. As I spent more and more time studying the system from the outside, I began to understand my experience in a broader context. Though there were more than 150,000 women behind bars in America in 2020, years of research shows prisons fail them – and traumatize them in gender-specific ways.\n\nTime and again people in women’s prisons have had to sue over issues like inadequate access to period products, overly invasive strip searches, a lack of pregnancy care, unequal access to education, fewer work release opportunities and ongoing patterns of sexual abuse by male staff.\n\nSome of those issues are consequences of the economy of scale; because less than 10% of people in jails and prisons are women, there are fewer programs and services for them. As I’d been warned during my first days behind bars, we were an afterthought.\n\nBut even once I understood that, it took me a little longer to realize that some of those issues have nothing to do with something so benign as being an afterthought and everything to do with a fundamental refusal to let prisoners have dignity. Where I did time, sometimes that meant forcing a woman to take out her tampon during a strip search (a practice that the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Services has denied is policy), making prisoners beg to get enough menstrual supplies and toilet paper or letting people bleed for months instead of providing basic reproductive health care. Since then, New York and a handful of other jurisdictions have passed legislation requiring jails and prisons to provide tampons and maxi pads, though experts say access to period supplies is still a widespread problem – in part because some facilities aren’t consistently complying with those laws.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nIn the moment, those individual acts seemed like shame-inducing one-offs. But when they happen enough, those one-offs add up to something more. Looking back, I see how the prison system weaponized our bodies to take away our dignity.\n\nWhen I think about it now – a decade later – I still feel a pang in my stomach, a particular blend of shame and powerlessness I associate most with being locked up.\n\nLately, I’ve been thinking about that feeling a lot more. Until just a few months ago, many people didn’t believe that women and pregnant people would really lose the right to abortion, or that there would ever be serious discussion about losing access to birth control.\n\nBut these developments aren’t quite as surprising to those of my friends who, like me, have done time in women’s prisons. On some level, we already knew that reality too well: Those techniques used to strip people of their dignity have never been and were never going to be confined to the prison system alone. In the end, it’s all of a piece – how we treat people in prison is a reflection of how we are willing to treat people in the free world.", "authors": ["Keri Blakinger"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/healthcare/2020/01/22/flu-toll-up-as-incidence-remains-widespread/1807685007/", "title": "Flu toll up as incidence remains widespread", "text": "G.

We have sent out a summary of the situation, criteria to guide evaluation of patients, and guidance on reporting, testing, and specimen collection. Again, though, these are the routine steps we take in this kind of situation out of an abundance of caution.”\n\nUPDATE: The Coronavirus continues to spread globally as confirmed cases and deaths rise.\n\nThe flu season also apparently has affected blood donations, Kara LeBlanc, marketing communications manager for the Rhode Island Blood Center, told The Journal. Platelet and mobile drive donations are down, she said, and “given we are not dealing with any major weather issues right now that impact blood drives and donor turnout, it must be cold and flu season.”\n\nHealth Department Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott urged potential donors who are healthy and eligible to give blood to step up.\n\n“With Rhode Island seeing elevated flu activity and many blood donors not healthy enough to give, it is imperative that more people start becoming volunteer blood donors,” she said. “Rhode Island Blood Center is the only local community blood center that provides blood products which can be used for direct transfusion for hospitalized patients.”\n\nWendelken said that “if people have not been vaccinated yet, it is not too late. The flu shot is your best protection against the flu. Vaccination is important for everyone older than six months of age. It is particularly important for pregnant women; people with chronic medical conditions such as heart, lung or kidney disease, diabetes, asthma, anemia, blood disorders, or weakened immune systems; people 65 years of age or older; and health-care workers.”\n\nFind more on determining what care to seek and general management of the flu, along with precautions people can take to avoid transmitting or contracting the flu, at health.ri.gov/flu/.\n\n— gwmiller@providencejournal.com\n\n(401) 277-7380\n\nOn Twitter: @gwaynemiller", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/health/abortion-misinformation-social-media/index.html", "title": "Doctors worry that online misinformation will push abortion-seekers ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter a US Supreme Court draft decision on Roe v. Wade was leaked in May, Dr. Joshua Trebach noticed a disturbing turn in the online conversation around abortion.\n\n“I started seeing things on social media, things like TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, people saying ‘oh, if Roe v. Wade does get overturned, here are some secret, sneaky ways that you can drink some tea and have an abortion,’ ” Trebach said.\n\nNow that Roe v. Wade has been overturned and some states are putting strict limits on abortions, there’s widespread confusion about whether the procedures are available and to whom. Physicians and poison control officials say they’re worried that people seeking abortions will turn to ineffective and dangerous methods shared online, potentially delaying or preventing safe, proven abortion care.\n\nSocial media companies told CNN they’re taking a range of actions, including reviewing some abortion-related posts, elevating content from verified sources, and labeling or removing certain posts.\n\nThis type of abortion misinformation is “scary,” said Trebach, an emergency medicine physician and a medical toxicologist in New York City. Some herbs people described may not do anything at all. Others could have a range of medical effects or even be deadly.\n\nTrebach said the online posts he saw came from unverified sources and described substances he learned about only in toxicology training. In the US, many herbs and supplements are regulated as food, not drugs, meaning there isn’t safety or efficacy data to back their use. Negative effects from an herb can’t always be treated easily, he said.\n\n“At the end of the day, nothing – no plant, no herb, no tea, no tincture – is going to be safer or more effective than the current medical standard of abortion, the current medical therapies that we have,” he said. “Nothing is a fair substitute for that.”\n\nJulie Weber, board chair of the American Association of Poison Control Centers, said centers have not seen an increase in exposure calls about people attempting abortions, but they’re preparing for it. People can call the association at 1-800-222-1222 or reach experts at poisonhelp.org if they have questions about a substance and its potential effects.\n\n“When I hear or start seeing questions on social media, I hear of people talking about alternative medications or herbal products or supplements, I do get concerned,” Weber said. “And I am concerned with this, and we do want to get that message out there that this is not necessarily a safe alternative or one that’s even going to be effective.”\n\nTech companies respond\n\nAndrea Miller, president of the advocacy group National Institute for Reproductive Health, has seen abortion misinformation online and said some of it might be coming from “well-intentioned people who are outraged and fearful and want to help right now, but they may inadvertently be sharing information that isn’t accurate or directing people to nefarious resources without realizing it.”\n\nMiller also worries that some posts may be designed to misinform and confuse.\n\n“There has been a calculated, pernicious misinformation campaign that has been many decades in the making from those who are opposed to reproductive freedom, and we anticipate that that is going to be ratcheted up significantly now,” she said.\n\nOne TikTok video – with hashtags such as #womenshealth and #womensrights – listed a range of fruits, herbs and other “DIY” methods that it claimed could induce abortions. It got more than 244,000 likes before CNN flagged it and it was removed by the platform last week.\n\nTikTok says it’s removing videos about abortion that violate its policy against medical misinformation, although it allows other content on the topics, such as videos discussing access to the procedure, according to a spokesperson. The short-form video platform is also redirecting searches for certain hashtags such as #herbalabortion and #naturalabortion to its Community Guidelines rather than showing results.\n\nSimilar posts with misleading, potentially dangerous claims about inducing an abortion have also been shared on Twitter and Facebook, although most appeared to have less reach and engagement than on TikTok.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said that posts about abortion may be reviewed by its third-party fact-checking partners, and content that is rated “false,” “altered” or “partly false” by fact checkers will have its distribution reduced. Facebook pages, groups or accounts that repeatedly share content debunked by fact checkers may also have their reach reduced or lose the ability to advertise or monetize, according to the company.\n\nTwo posts listing potentially harmful claims about self-induced abortion that CNN flagged to Facebook had not been labeled by fact checkers, which choose which content to review, as of Wednesday.\n\nTwitter says it is working to “pre-bunk” misinformation by elevating reliable sources, including on its Trends and Twitter Moments features, according to a spokesperson. Twitter’s rules generally do not prohibit discussion of abortion, contraception or related topics; under the platform’s misinformation policy, it takes action against misleading information related to Covid-19, civic integrity, synthetic and manipulated media, and crisis situations, but the policy does not mention abortion.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the platform had not labeled or removed several posts flagged by CNN that contained advice on using herbs or large doses of medication that toxicologists said could be ineffective or harmful.\n\nMiller advises people seeking abortions or information about the procedure to approach the issue in the same way they would any other health concern: “That is to make sure that they are seeking it out from reputable sources, or if they think ‘hey, that’s an intriguing post, that’s an intriguing thing, I might want to check that out,’ make sure to do some additional research if you’re not confident of the source, even if it’s one of your closest friends and you’re not sure where they got it and they’re not sure where it came from.”\n\nDistraction from truthful information\n\nDoctors CNN spoke with said they’re worried that videos containing abortion misinformation imply there are no paths to legal abortion – which could distract from safe, available options and create more confusion.\n\n“I feel like nowadays, we are lucky that we do have very safe medication abortion options for people, and I’m worried that if people are circulating misinformation, then people will not know that there are ways that they can access safe methods,” said Dr. Jody Steinauer, director of the UCSF Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health.\n\nAlthough there are medications that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to allow abortion to take place at home, some people may assume they can’t access them, Dr. Nisha Verma, a fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and an ob/gyn with a specialty in complex family planning.\n\n“Some people may also turn to unsafe abortion methods when they feel they have no other option or based on information they are gathering on social media,” Verma said.\n\nPosts and content on topics that inspire emotion are much more likely to go viral on social media. And that can be dangerous when they contain false or misleading claims.\n\n“Misinformation can be harmful because it may lead people to try to end their pregnancies in an unsafe way, potentially exposing them to serious bodily harm. While people can self-manage their abortions in a safe way, spreading misinformation about unsafe methods of abortion is incredibly dangerous,” Verma said.\n\nHowever, without a federal constitutional right to an abortion, access to abortion differs from state to state. The Biden administration is working across multiple federal agencies to respond to the Roe v. Wade reversal.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department announced a task force aimed at identifying ways to protect reproductive rights in the wake of the Supreme Court decision that struck down the federal right to abortion. And last week, President Joe Biden signed an executive order aimed at protecting access to reproductive health services. The order attempts to safeguard access to medication abortion and emergency contraception, protect patient privacy and launch public education efforts. It also aims to bolster the security of and the legal options available to those seeking and providing abortion services.\n\nLosing valuable time\n\nEven before the Supreme Court decision, there was evidence that some people tried to self-manage abortions with things like herbs, physical trauma and uterine trauma, said Jenny Higgins, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\n\n“We, of course, know those techniques are ineffective and, in some cases, also harmful,” Higgins said.\n\nWhen it comes to methods circulating on social media, she said, her bigger concern is that they will use up valuable time.\n\n“Someone might look into alternatives such as herbs, spend time trying to gather information, procure that substance, take the herb, take it again, take it again, and by then, they are later in gestation and maybe even less likely to be able to access effective methods,” Higgins said.\n\n“There’s a real-time constraint here,” she said. “The later people are in gestation, the more effort that needs to be involved in the abortion.”\n\nBeing on the border of 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy can make a big difference in whether someone can safely use FDA-approved abortion drugs, she said.\n\nThe available methods for self-managed abortion today are very different from in the pre-Roe era.\n\n“I want people to understand that now we have the very same pills, the very same FDA-approved pills that are used in standard abortion care can be ordered online,” she said. “There are self-managed techniques that are extremely safe and effective.”", "authors": ["Naomi Thomas"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2018/04/08/privatized-medicaid-denying-hundreds-disabled-iowans-medical-equipment/1069296001/", "title": "Iowa Medicaid: Equipment denied to hundreds of disabled Iowans", "text": "© Copyright 2018, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nVINTON, Ia. — Hundreds of disabled Iowans are being denied the medical devices they need, including wheelchairs, shower stools and even nutritional supplements, by private Medicaid providers that routinely refuse to pay for them, the Des Moines Register has found.\n\nThe casualties are patients like 4-year-old Tatum Woods of Vinton, Iowa, who for nearly six months was forced to crawl because a private Medicaid provider said it would pay less than a fifth of the cost of his $3,500 customized walker.\n\nIt’s an experience multiple officials and lawmakers contend is widespread in Iowa, and it's driving Medicaid patients and their families to new depths of frustration.\n\n“These kids shouldn’t have to fight to get their equipment,\" said Kristie Woods, Tatum's mother. \"They’ve already got enough struggles.\"\n\nAt issue is the reimbursement rate the private companies that manage Iowa’s $4.8 billion Medicaid program are paying to medical equipment providers for specialized equipment.\n\nMedical device providers say Iowa's privatized Medicaid managers are willing to pay only pennies on the dollar — if anything at all — for the medical devices that doctors are authorizing for their disabled patients.\n\nIt's another example of what critics say is Iowa's flawed Medicaid system since then-Gov. Terry Branstad turned over management to for-profit companies in April 2016 in an attempt to save money and in his view improve care.\n\nEarlier this year, the Register reported that disabled Medicaid patients who try to appeal their denied or reduced care are being stymied by an appeal process that presents a thicket of administrative and legal roadblocks.\n\nIowa’s Medicaid provides services to 680,000 poor or disabled residents, more than a fifth of the state’s population.\n\nCare Denied:How Iowa's Medicaid maze is trapping patients in endless appeals\n\n20 cents on the dollar\n\nIn Tatum Woods' case, Amerigroup, his Medicaid company, offered to pay $575 of the $3,500 manufacturer cost of the wheelchair-like device known as a gait trainer, which suspends him above the floor and allows him to \"walk\" by propelling himself on wheels.\n\nTatum had outgrown his old trainer in September.\n\nOfficials from Total Respiratory and Rehab in Hiawatha said Amerigroup classified Tatum’s equipment as a “miscellaneous” expense, capping the maximum reimbursement at less than 20 percent of its cost.\n\nTotal Respiratory said Tatum is one of dozens of clients it has been forced to deny equipment in the last year because Iowa's Medicaid system refused to pick up the cost.\n\nThe company — and four other medical equipment providers across the state — have outlined multiple billing problems associated with the Medicaid companies that they say has resulted in underpayment by tens of thousands of dollars and forced them into denying equipment to patients who need it.\n\nEach of the medical equipment companies said they are experiencing problems from both of Iowa’s Medicaid management companies, Amerigroup and UnitedHealthcare.\n\nUnitedHealthcare tends to limit claims or issue blanket denials, while Amerigroup incorrectly codes and underpays, they contend.\n\n“They’re trying to reimburse us well below our cost,” said Jon Novak, CEO of Total Respiratory. “If we dispense the equipment at this cost, we would go broke.”\n\nMore:Iowa mom takes on Medicaid to fight for her dying son — and wins\n\nSeeking to be independent\n\nDurable medical equipment such as the walker sought for Tatum represents 1.2 percent to 2 percent of healthcare spending, according to information from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nThe equipment — including oxygen canisters, feeding tubes and wheelchairs — enables millions of disabled Americans to continue living independently or to avoid more costly and painful procedures.\n\nEach $1 spent allows federal and state governments to avoid spending another $17, according to a 2014 study by Leitten Consulting, a Florida-based business.\n\nIowa since 2016 has paid the for-profit companies a per-person amount to manage the program. The state does not track or report how much those companies spend on medical equipment.\n\nIowa Ombudsman Kristie Hirschman, whose office recently issued a highly critical report of the state's Medicaid appeal process, said her office has taken several complaints about medical equipment.\n\nBusiness officials in one case eventually accepted losses for medical compression socks it provided to a patient after one of the Medicaid companies continued to deny payment because of billing problems.\n\nThe company selling the compression garment told the ombudsman it had been reimbursed $1,200 for the equipment before private companies took over Iowa's Medicaid program in 2016.\n\nIn another case, a medical supply company complained that the Medicaid company's reimbursement rate was less than the company paid for the diabetic supplies it was providing to the Medicaid recipient. That recipient was forced to find another equipment company to sell the supplies as a result.\n\n'It's a money game'\n\nKristie Woods said it took her family and her son’s medical providers months and dozens of hours of their time wrangling with Amerigroup, calls to the Iowa Department of Human Services and contacts with lawmakers and other state or federal offices before the billing issue was resolved and her son received the customized walker.\n\nShe said the issue was compounded by the inability or unwillingness of Human Services, which oversees Iowa's Medicaid system, to become involved. And because Amerigroup had approved the equipment, though at a fraction of the actual cost, she couldn't file an appeal with the state.\n\nMore:Iowa lawmakers stake out positions on state's privatized Medicaid woes\n\nWithout the ability to file an appeal, Woods couldn’t ask an Iowa administrative law judge — an independent party — to help resolve the matter.\n\nTatum Woods, who suffers from a genetic disorder known as Kabuki syndrome, ultimately received the gait trainer on Feb. 19 after Amerigroup agreed to pay Total Respiratory its cost.\n\nKristie Woods said she was never given an explanation from Amerigroup about reasons for the delay, which she believes has hampered her son’s physical development.\n\n“It’s a money game,” Woods said. “Parents and special-needs people should not be put on the wayside.”\n\nAmerigroup declined interview requests. The company issued a three-sentence statement saying it is committed to seeing its consumers have access to medical equipment and believes equipment providers “should be fairly compensated.”\n\n“Depending on the circumstances, we recognize an enhanced level of reimbursement may be warranted when a consumer needs a high cost, medically necessary item,” Amerigroup spokesman Tony Felts said in the statement.\n\n'This is about my son's life'\n\nIn a case involving UnitedHealthcare, Carol Dorsey said her 37-year-old son, Cody Trent, has been denied catheters, and she’s afraid it will result in his death.\n\nTrent, who has Down syndrome, in 2004 had complications linked to another procedure that resulted in him needing to be catheterized regularly or risk infection.\n\nUnitedHealthcare in December told the company it would pay for only one catheter a month, rather than the 12 Trent needs. A medical supply company this month told the family it could no longer afford to go unpaid for 11 catheters.\n\nOn March 19, Trent’s normal catheter treatment was bypassed for the first time. The Greenfield resident, who lives independently, faces an uncertain future, his mother said.\n\nDorsey, searching for online catheter sales companies, estimated the savings for denying payment of 11 catheters is less than $100 a month. Months of wrangling and hours on the phone by Dorsey and her son’s medical providers have been unsuccessful.\n\n“This is not about publicity, this is about my son’s life,” Dorsey said. “If he were to insert a dirty catheter, he could be dead in weeks.”\n\nTaking rulings to court\n\nEven when appeals are possible, cases have been caught in a bureaucratic quagmire that has delayed equipment to some recipients for more than a year, according to Register research.\n\nUnitedHealthcare on at least three occasions has challenged in district court the “final decisions” of Iowa Human Services directors who sided with administrative law judges and ordered the company to pay for specially designed equipment deemed medically necessary.\n\nThose cases include:\n\nA wheelchair for Spencer nursing home resident Ann Carrigan, a 70-year-old with advanced cerebral palsy who can’t walk or talk.\n\nA home platform lift for Barbara Sumers , a 69-year-old Des Moines stroke survivor whose left leg and lower body are paralyzed.\n\nA bariatric wheelchair for Des Moines nursing home resident Mildred Baker, whose multiple ailments have left her unable to walk without assistance.\n\nIn each case, UnitedHealthcare argued that Human Services’ reasoning that justified the specialized equipment was “illogical,” arguing that Iowa’s interpretation of “customized” equipment is flawed.\n\nCarrigan's case has dragged on the longest: An appeal continues after 15 months. A June 29 hearing is set in Sumers' case, which was first denied in May 2017.\n\nOn March 14, Polk County District Court Judge Eliza Ovrom ruled against UnitedHealthcare in Baker’s case, noting that the chair specifications allow the 70-year-old to move independently in the nursing home and is a justified medical expense.\n\nUnitedHealthcare declined to discuss the three cases but spoke broadly about the equipment issues. It attributed at least some of the problems the Register raised to administrative confusion or error.\n\nIn some cases, for example, medical equipment sellers submitted claims to UnitedHealthcare using incorrect codes that can result in payment issues, the company said.\n\nIn August 2016 and March 2017, the company published bulletins to give medical providers information and instructions about how to submit claims for medical equipment, said Jesse Harris, a company spokesman.\n\nThe company has met with Human Services and the Midwest Association for Medical Equipment Services & Supplies to discuss the process and to determine whether companies are giving the UnitedHealthcare the right \"by report\" code, Harris said.\n\n“Please encourage any providers you are speaking with to contact us so that we can work together to resolve,\" Harris said in a statement.\n\n‘Overwhelming evidence’\n\nThe four Iowa medical supply companies that supplied information to the Register are Total Respiratory, Hammer Medical Supply in Des Moines, Mobilis in Council Bluffs and JVA Mobility in Cedar Rapids.\n\nThe Midwest Association for Medical Equipment Services & Supplies — a group that represents about 40 companies in Iowa — conducted a survey in February and found widespread problems.\n\nFor some items, Medicaid companies have been unwilling or unable to justify how they determine the rates being offered to cover equipment, and reimbursements are routinely inconsistent, the survey found.\n\nRose Schafhauser, the equipment association’s director, said UnitedHealthcare and Amerigroup have met with the association's members, but that problems have remained “a vicious cycle since April 2016,” when Iowa shifted Medicaid management to private companies.\n\nShe said her members' experiences, the testimonials of Medicaid recipients and court records provide “overwhelming evidence” of a systemic problem. And she believes it's Human Services' responsibility to fix the problem.\n\n'There's no accountability'\n\nOn March 15, Schafhauser and about 20 of her members met privately with Iowa Human Services Medicaid Director Mike Randol at the Iowa Capitol. She later said Randol appeared to take the issue seriously but made no sweeping promises as she had hoped.\n\n“There’s no accountability back from DHS when these (managed-care) companies are not doing what they’re supposed to be doing,” Schafhauser said. “All our people are asking for is to give us the rules, keep the rules consistent and let us know what we’re going to get paid.”\n\nRandol did not respond to a request for comment following the March 15 meeting.\n\nIf Medicaid recipients can’t obtain the equipment, that would be a good reason to switch to the other management company, Human Services spokesman Matt Highland said in written response to questions.\n\nWhile rare, Medicaid company executives can be held criminally accountable for denying health care or failing to spend money on program recipients as obligated under their state contracts.\n\nThe Iowa contract of Wellcare, for example, was terminated in 2015 even before it began its work after state officials learned of fraud that in 2014 resulted in three of its former executives sentenced to prison in a case involving $30 million that was neither spent nor returned to the state of Florida.\n\n“You see enough of these stories like this, and you have to start to review intent,” said Craig Douglas, vice president of VGM Group, a Waterloo-based company that helps medical equipment providers contract for and buy products.\n\n\"I don’t believe this is just a simple claims error. I believe it’s systematic, and it’s having a detrimental impact on Medicaid beneficiaries.\"\n\nWhat lawmakers are doing\n\nLawmakers from both parties have indicated their discontent with at least parts of Iowa's Medicaid management system.\n\nOn March 8, the Iowa House passed House File 2462, which would make Medicaid companies pay medical providers within the timelines specified in their contract or at least provide reasons for their denials of claims.\n\nThe bill, which contains multiple other fixes, passed 97-0. The full Senate has yet to consider the bill.\n\nA separate bill that also remains under consideration, House File 2483, would require Human Services to review all cases where private management companies cut the long-term care and support services of Medicaid recipients.\n\nHow to get help\n\nMedicaid recipients who have been approved by their doctor for medical equipment but who are having problems finding companies that will sell it to them can't file a formal appeal.\n\nHowever, they can seek assistance through the Iowa Ombudsman by calling (888) 426-6283 or email: ombudsman@legis.iowa.gov.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/12/09/tennessee-tornado-nashville-clarksville-hendersonville-springfield-damage-report/71866535007/", "title": "Tennessee tornadoes: Damage reports from Saturday storms, 6 dead", "text": "Damage is widespread Sunday across Middle Tennessee after severe storms and tornados swept through the region Saturday, Dec. 9.

Abortion will lead to substance abuse, depression, suicidal thoughts; abortion is bad for your health; every woman is going to regret it,” said social psychologist Brenda Major, a distinguished professor emeritus in the department of psychological and brain sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nIn reality, decades of research has shown “the vast majority of women feel they made the right choice, and they don’t experience regret,” said Major, who led a 2008 American Psychological Association task force exploring the science on abortion and mental health.\n\nWomen who had an abortion in the first trimester were no more likely to have mental health problems than women who continued with an unplanned pregnancy, the APA review concluded.\n\nA large, long-term study, called The Turnaway Study, followed the mental health of nearly 1,000 women in 21 states who wanted and received an abortion and women who wanted but were denied an abortion between 2008 and 2010.\n\nThe women were interviewed every six months over the next five years. At the end of that time, 99% of the women who had an abortion believed they had made the right decision – in fact relief was the prominent emotion, one analysis noted.\n\nWomen who received an abortion had similar or lower levels of depression and anxiety than women denied an abortion and were no more likely to experience post-traumatic stress than women who carried their baby to term, according to study results.\n\nThe research also found no difference in mental health outcomes between a first trimester abortion and having an abortion later in the pregnancy.\n\nSources of misinformation\n\nAbortion misinformation might come from friends or family, an article or study read online, or during a mandated pre-abortion counseling session some states put into place during the Roe v. Wade era, experts told CNN.\n\nOf the 33 states that have required patients receive counseling before an abortion, eight routinely included the potential for negative psychological responses as part of the conversation, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research and policy organization that focuses on sexual and reproductive rights worldwide.\n\n“There are states in which women are told that because they’re having an abortion, they’re at increased risk for depression, suicidal ideation, post traumatic stress disorder and more,” said Julia Steinberg, an associate professor of family science at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health.\n\n“Abortion does not cause depression, it does not cause suicide (or) suicidal ideation. It does not cause substance use. It does not cause anxiety disorders,” said Steinberg, who has studied the mental health impact of abortion for years.\n\nIn fact, the best predictor of not faring well after an abortion was a “prior history of mental health issues,” Major said. “The best predictor of substance use after an abortion was if you were already a substance abuser, and the best predictor of depression after abortion was if you’ve been depressed before you had one.”\n\nAbortion misinformation also comes from published studies in academic journals that conclude abortion does cause mental health problems, experts say.\n\n“The studies make it look like there is a debate, but what’s really going on is those studies are very poorly conducted,” Steinberg said. “They are not methodologically rigorous, and they don’t adhere to scientific principles.”\n\nThe 2008 APA task force published a scathing rebuke of the research quality of many studies which found mental health concerns after abortion. Studies often failed to control for factors such as rape, sexual or partner violence, or a woman’s history of prior mental disorders or substance abuse, the task force said.\n\n“We reviewed every legitimate study that had ever been done on this topic,” Major said. “The methodological flaws in so many of the studies that are being cited as showing harm to women’s mental health as a result of having an abortion were just egregious.”\n\nA later 2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine review analyzed studies on abortion’s impact on future fertility and pregnancy outcomes, risk of breast cancer, mental health disorders, and premature death.\n\nMore than half of all abortions in US are done via a two-drug medication combination. Olga Yastremska/Adobe Stock\n\n“Much of the published literature on these topics fails to meet scientific standards for rigorous, unbiased research,” the report stated, concluding that “having an abortion does not increase a woman’s risk of secondary infertility, pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, abnormal placentation (after a D&E abortion), preterm birth, breast cancer, or mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, and PTSD).”\n\nYet this belief that abortion harms women’s mental and physical health has been used to justify “waiting period laws, two-trip requirements (in which women have to come back twice) and telling women inaccurate information around medication abortion,” Steinberg said.\n\nBeing denied an abortion\n\nA 2020 study looked at the short- and long-term impact of being denied an abortion. Results showed women who were turned away were more likely to experience significant anxiety and stress.\n\n“In my research what we found is that the challenges of getting an abortion – finding a place, traveling, having to disclose your abortion to someone you would have preferred not to – increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress,” said study author Antonia Biggs, a social psychologist who is also one of the Turnaway researchers from the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) project at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n“And then at the time of being denied an abortion, those symptoms go even higher. And then over time, they do dissipate,” said Biggs, an associate professor at UCSF.\n\nIn the Turnaway study, women denied an abortion who carried their babies to term were “much more likely to experience physical health issues at the time of childbirth, as childbirth is much more risky than having an abortion,” Biggs said. Two of the women in the study died during childbirth.\n\nA 2012 study found the risk of death associated with childbirth is approximately 14 times higher than the risk from abortion.\n\nAfter five years, the study found women denied an abortion were more likely to “live in poverty and much more likely to suffer economic hardship, including more bankruptcies, debt and challenges meeting basic living needs,” Biggs said.\n\nWomen who were turned away were also more likely to be tethered to a violent and abusive partner, and to have chronic health conditions, Biggs said. “They also lowered their aspirations (for the future), and they were less likely to achieve them,” she added.\n\nIf a woman denied an abortion had existing children under 5, those children were less likely to meet their developmental milestones, more likely to live in poverty, and less likely to have bonded with their mother, the study found.\n\nWill these outcomes affect more women now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned?\n\n“I’m completely overwhelmed with worry,” Biggs said. “I worry about people being able to get wanted care. Some will have to overcome huge amounts of obstacles in order to access care.\n\n“Others will hopefully safely self-manage their abortions by accessing medication abortion pills online, which we know is quite safe,” Biggs said. Before the Supreme Court reversal, over half of all abortions in the US were done via a two-drug prescription medication method, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\n“Then there are some women whom I worry will use other less safe methods to self-manage the pregnancies or carry to term in a situation that they they deem is not ideal for them,” Biggs said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story attributed findings to the Turnaway Study that were from a different study by Antonia Biggs.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/02"}]}

The event also celebrates the opening of the Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibit.\n\nThe Costume Institute is housed in the museum's Anna Wintour Costume Center, named after the Vogue editor-in-chief.

It's everything that's completely artificial and fake and not really what you think it means.\"\n\nExpect the stars who decide to adhere to this year's theme to embrace Sontag's theory of camp and embody its outrageous and exaggerated spirit, which will inevitably result in some truly eye-popping sartorial choices.\n\nDuring Friday's interview, Wintour teased the unusual nature of the requests she's received ahead of this year's gala.\n\n\"I know we've had some very strange requests, people arriving on unusual methods of transport,\" she said, adding that she \"of course\" says yes to the bizarre asks of the celebrity attendees. \"We want them to take risks, to be fearless, to have fun with fashion, and we all need to laugh at ourselves a little bit, too.\"\n\nThe celebrity hosts\n\nSince 1995, Anna Wintour has presided over the event alongside honorary hosts from the worlds of entertainment and fashion.\n\nThe eclectic co-chairs of this year's Met Gala are Lady Gaga, Harry Styles and Serena Williams.\n\nIn 2018, Wintour was joined by Amal Clooney, Rihanna and Donatella Versace as co-hosts.\n\nConsidering how Rihanna stole the red carpet show last year with her papal garb, expect this year's slate of celebrity hosts to also appear on many best-dressed lists the morning after.\n\nLast year's gala\n\nWhile style watchers will likely find plenty to love in the campy looks of this year's Met Gala, the 2018 version was a fashion wonderland, from Lena Waithe's instantly iconic LGBTQ flag cape to the many angels, popes and renaissance artworks that walked the carpet.\n\nOther attendees included the Kardashian, Jenner and Hadid clans.\n\nLast year's Met Gala:Best-dressed looks from Rihanna, Amal Clooney, Lena Waithe and more", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/04/25/met-gala-2024-theme-date-how-to-watch-what-to-know/73382648007/", "title": "Met Gala: Everything to know about fashion's biggest night – and the ...", "text": "Wake up: Met Gala Monday is arriving soon.\n\nThe annual event held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City always meets its promise of being the biggest night in fashion with experimental looks like Zendaya waving goodbye to her Disney roots in a Cinderella ball gown, to Kim Kardashian in in Marilyn Monroe's iconic \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" dress and Jared Leto \"feline\" himself as Karl Lagerfeld's famous Birman cat Choupette.\n\nThis year's benefit is arising the \"sleeping beauties\" of fashion, following last year's gala, which honored Lagerfeld who died in 2019.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the grandiose event.\n\nLIVE: Watch the Met Gala with us, see the best-dressed celebrities and our favorite style\n\nNeed a break?

The \"hautest\" event of the year will air live on E! starting at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala?\n\nThe Costume Institute Benefit, commonly known as Met Gala, is a fundraiser for the museum's Costume Institute. Last year, the event hit a record and raised over $22 million, according to Vogue Business.\n\nMet Gala 2024 theme, explained\n\nIn November, Vogue and the Met revealed the 2024 Met Gala theme is \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" also the name of the accompanying exhibit at the Costume Institute.\n\nThe \"sleeping beauties\" are not inspired by the Disney princess, but rather refer to treasured garments in the museum's collection that are so fragile that they need to be housed in special glass \"coffins\" rather than on mannequins, curators said. Garments will be displayed in a series of galleries organized by themes of nature.\n\n\"More modern, less delicate pieces imbued with the same spirit as the spotlight fashions will be showcased alongside them, and broken up into three sub-themes: Land, Sea, and Sky,\" per Vogue.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala 2024 dress code?\n\nThe theme is different from the dress code, but still related. This year's dress code is \"The Garden of Time,\" inspired by J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story of the same title, per Vogue.\n\n\"Think melancholic florals (as moody florals aren't moody enough),\" the magazine added.\n\nWho's hosting the Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala announced its celebrity co-chairs in January, including Latin music superstar Bad Bunny, actress and singer Jennifer Lopez, \"Euphoria\" actress and Hollywood A-lister Zendaya and \"Thor\" himself, Chris Hemsworth, who will join Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.\n\nHonorary chairs are Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew.

It's unclear if they will give their best on the carpet again this year.\n\nIconic Met Gala carpet moments over the years\n\nThe Met Gala has brought all types of lavish looks to the red carpet from Blake Lively's transformative Atelier Versace gown in 2022 that paid homage to Lady Liberty, to Lady Gaga's four-time outfit change in Brandon Maxwell in 2019 and Diana Ross looking like a vision in a ruffled dress made out of bird feathers in 1981.\n\nSee the best looks in the gallery below.\n\nWhat is the 2024 Met's Costume Institute exhibit?\n\nThe exhibit will be open to the public from May 10 to Sept. 2, 2024.\n\nCurator Andrew Bolton, the mastermind behind the Costume Institute exhibit each year, explained that this year's annual display includes both rare historical garments and corresponding contemporary fashions.\n\nAbout 250 garments and accessories spanning four centuries will be on view. The exhibit will unfold in a series of rooms, each displaying a theme inspired by the natural world. \"Within each space, historical fashions will be juxtaposed with their contemporary counterparts in an immersive environment intended to engage a visitor's sense of sight, smell, touch, and hearing,\" the museum stated.\n\nExamples will include a space decorated with the \"insectoid embroidery\" of an Elizabethan bodice, or a ceiling projecting \"a Hitchcockian swarm of black birds\" surrounding a black tulle evening dress from before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nContributing: Jay Stahl", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/05/01/met-gala-2017-everything-you-need-know-comme-des-garcons-rei-kawakubo/101153952/", "title": "Met Gala 2017: Everything you need to know about fashion's biggest ...", "text": "Maeve McDermott\n\nUSATODAY\n\nThe Met Gala is more than just the fashion world's version of the Academy Awards.

The Costume Institute's choice of honoree often sets the tone for the Met Gala, with attendees expected to match the exhibit's theme with their own fashion choices for the evening.\n\nThis year, party-goers are encouraged to honor the bold, architectural designs of Kawakubo, who is the first living designer to be honored by the Costume Institute since Yves Saint Laurent in 1983.\n\nThe exhibition, which runs from May 4 to September 4, will feature 100+ of Kawakubo’s Comme des Garçons womenswear designs, dating back to her first Paris runway show in 1981.\n\nThe celebrity hosts\n\nEvery year since Anna Wintour's first year as Met Gala chair in 1995, the event has also featured honorary hosts from the worlds of entertainment and fashion.\n\nAlong with Wintour, this year's co-chairs are Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen, with Kawakubo also serving as honorary chair.\n\nAhead of the gala, Perry also appeared on the May cover of Vogue, honoring Kawakubo in a dedicated Comme des Garçons spread.\n\nThe star-studded guest list\n\nOnly Hollywood's biggest award shows boast guest lists that rival that of the invitation-only Met Gala. Wintour has final say over every attendee, and celebrities from A-list entertainers to political heavyweights mingle together at the event.\n\nWhile 2016's Manus x Machina gala hosted stars including Beyoncé and Jay Z, Taylor Swift, Kanye West and the entire Kardashian clan, a spokesperson for the museum told The New York Times that the guest list for this year's event is expected to be slightly smaller.\n\nWho is Rei Kawakubo?\n\nKawakubo, a 74-year-old Japanese designer who founded Comme des Garçons in 1969, is only the second living designer honored by the Costume Institute, along with Saint Laurent.\n\n“Rei Kawakubo is one of the most important and influential designers of the past 40 years,” said Costume Institute curator in charge Andrew Bolton in a press release. “By inviting us to rethink fashion as a site of constant creation, recreation, and hybridity, she has defined the aesthetics of our time.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/05/06/met-gala-red-carpet-live-updates/73557261007/", "title": "Met Gala red carpet recap: Tyla wows, theme sparks floral looks galore", "text": "The celebs of the 2024 Met Gala walked the red, or rather, green and white carpet.\n\nMet Gala sweetheart and co-chair Zendaya departed from the preppy tennis looks she wore promoting \"Challengers\" and embraced her Virgo Earth sign in a show-stopping Maison Margiela gown.\n\nLaLa Anthony in Alexander McQueen joked \"I can't breathe,\" in her dress.

But the blonde's stylist shares all.\n\nCelebrity hair stylist, Glen Oropeza didn't touch Sydney Sweeney's famous hair, except to style it for underneath a wig. He then styled the real-hair wig, as if it were her own, using Kérastase products.\n\nIs the backside the new body part to show off?\n\nThis year was more about the butt than the boobs for the Met Gala.\n\nKim Kardashian, to no surprise, showed off hers. Jennifer Lopez's custom gown also showed off her backside. And Kendall Jenner's Alexander McQueen gown also teased her butt. Perhaps Doja Cat showed the most.\n\nThe Coachella headliner opted for a drenched look on the steps of New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art for fashion's biggest night. The Grammy-winning rapper was draped in a wet white crewneck floor-length T-shirt dress with wrist-length sleeves, which clung to her skin.\n\nSee her daring look:Doja Cat looks like she was caught in the rain at the 2024 Met Gala\n\nNicki Minaj is a work of art at 2024 Met Gala\n\nNicki Minaj showed up to the 2024 Met Gala looking like an art piece in a custom yellow Marni gown that featured a paint-like texture and carefully placed flowers.\n\nCardi B in yards of fabric for 2024 Met Gala look\n\nCardi B never disappoints.\n\nThe \"Up\" rapper took over the floor in a Giambattista Valli Paris gown that took nearly 10 men to assist on the carpet.

The \"Ghost\" actress paired the stunning gown with a Cartier neckless.\n\nAccording to an Instagram story from fashion stylist Brad Goreski, the custom piece was made using \"a 60 year old panel of silk wallpaper with over 11,000 hours of embroidery and hand painted chiffon petals.\"\n\nThe Kardashian and Jenner families kept it low-key for the Met\n\nKim Kardashian rarely misses a red carpet, and she and her family have become staples at the Met Gala − but this year lacked Kourtney Kardashian Barker and Khloe Kardashian.\n\nKendall Jenner opted for a vintage Alexander McQueen gown that had only been shown on a mannequin before she wore it. Kylie Jenner's pale pink gown felt almost understated, even with its cone bust (which reminded us of Madonna's Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra circa 1990).\n\nWhat was Kim Kardashian wearing over her dress?\n\nWhile Kim Kardashian's look in a sheer Margiela by John Galliano dress was in some ways just an excuse to show off her tiny waist, many questioned what she was wearing on top.\n\nWas it a shrug brought back from the early 2000s? A new boyfriend's sweater? Whatever it was, the internet was divided on whether the cozy cashmere accessory was brilliant (and cozy, yes, we are saying that again!) or was a mess added over a gorgeous couture creation.\n\nWhatever. Her dress, topped with a corset, showed off an impossibly tiny waist. And the fabric was gorgeous. Maybe the sweater was an emotional support sweater?\n\nShe explained the look in a video with Vogue, saying the look was meant to represent \"the wildest night of my life in a garden.\" A night when she ran to grab her \"boyfriend's sweater and threw it on and had to get to work, and my hair's all messed up.\"\n\nThe dress didn't cause the stir that her 2022 look did. That's the year she wore a historic dress made famous by Marilyn Monroe. Maybe she can just shrug this one off?\n\nPamela Anderson takes a break from going makeup-free for Met Gala\n\nPamela Anderson was seen at Paris Fashion Week last year with a fresh face, free of makeup. Anderson chose to ditch makeup for herself but said it wasn't to make a \"political\" statement.\n\n\"I would come back from the shows wearing all these clothes and a big funny hat and everything and there were all these paparazzi, and then I went in one door and changed into my jeans and T-shirt and no makeup and walked out the door right through the same crowd that had been chasing me and no one noticed,\" she told Allure at the time.\n\nBut at the Met Gala, the actress had her makeup done by celebrity makeup artist Pat McGrath.\n\n'90s supermodel Linda Evangelista stuns at Met Gala\n\nLinda Evangelista used to be a mainstay on the Met Gala carpet. But she took a step back from public life, after sharing with People magazine in 2022 that a cosmetic procedure left her \"brutally disfigured.\"\n\nThe supermodel said she no longer wants to live in hiding following her claims that a Zeltiq CoolSculpting procedure, an FDA-approved fat reduction process that uses cold temperatures to break fat cells, left her body disfigured and sent her into a \"cycle of deep depression.\"\n\n\"I loved being up on the catwalk. Now I dread running into someone I know,\" she told People at the time. \"I can't live like this anymore, in hiding and shame. I just couldn't live in this pain any longer.

AI images confuse fans\n\nThere have been a few images of Katy Perry on the 2024 Met Gala carpet posted on X, but no images of the pop star have appeared in photo agencies or Vogue to confirm that she is present.\n\nOne AI image that has duped fans (me included) shows Perry wearing a gold corset with a large key over a garden skirt.\n\nAnother AI-generated photo shows the \"American Idol\" judge in a white ballgown with the hem covered in moss and flowers.\n\nPerry has been known to push the envelope — for better or worse — at past Met Gala's, but in this case, we don't know if she'll be attending IRL.\n\nEmma Chamberlain channels inner swamp princess\n\nEmma Chamberlain, the YouTube vlogger-turned-fashionista and businesswoman, returned to the steps of New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art for fashion's biggest night donning a custom dark brown lace Jean Paul Gaultier gown with a goth vibe that gave a self-described \"dark twist\" to the event's dress code.\n\nHer look – an interpretation of this year's exhibition theme, \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" and the dress code of \"The Garden of Time\" – evoked an overgrown garden.\n\n\"This is sort of a fantasy, enchanted-like theme. It’s fun to do a dark twist on it — the underbelly of nature,\" the influencer told Vogue. She also dubbed the vibe her \"swampy mode.”\n\nWho gets invited to the Met Gala?\n\nZendaya, Rihanna, Jared Leto and Colman Domingo have been amongst the recent Met Gala showstoppers. Influencers like Emma Chamberlain and Wisdom Kaye have also been added to the list.\n\nVogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour takes in suggestions for the big night, but ultimately, she has the final say of the guest list.\n\nAll the looks on the 2024 Met GalaRed carpet fashion from Kim Kardashian to Zendaya\n\nColman Domingo pays homage to André Leon Talley, Chadwick Boseman\n\nColman Domingo is looking as fashionable as ever at the 2024 Met Gala.\n\nThe \"Euphoria\" star, 54, stepped out on the red carpet looking dapper in a white and black suit designed by Willy Chavarria. His look was complete with a flowing cape, which Domingo said was a nod to the late André Leon Talley, who served as editor-at-large of Vogue magazine.\n\nKeeping with the Met Gala's dress code of \"The Garden of Time,\" the actor also strutted the red carpet with a bouquet of fresh flowers.\n\nMindy Kaling blooms in draping gown\n\nMindy Kaling perfectly complemented her figure in a blush Gaurav Gupta dress with structured accents to resemble flower pedals. The flowing gown matched the theme without getting too literal.\n\nThe actress and producer said her gown is called \"The Melting Flower of Time.\"\n\nSarah Jessica Parker channels Carrie Bradshaw\n\nSarah Jessica Parker drew interest from her \"And Just Like That\" series with a structural dress from Richard Quinn. This year marked Parker's 12th Met Gala appearance.\n\nThe hat and the bejeweled stockings felt derivative of Carrie Bradshaw, yet the look read dated somehow. More church lady than \"Sex and the City.\"\n\nProtestors near Gala steps\n\nProtesters in support of Palestinians amid Israel's war in Gaza made their voices heard outside of the Met Gala.\n\nStudents from Hunter College, roughly a mile from the Met Gala, marched with signs calling for their university to \"divest\" funding. \"We will not stop, we will not rest,\" the students chanted, per videos shared by reporter Katie Smith on X.\n\nIn another video they chanted, \"There is only one solution.\"\n\nAshley Graham sparkles in crystals\n\nAshley Graham sparkled on the red carpet.\n\nThat’s because her dress was covered in shine. She told E! that it took more than 500 hours to make by designer Ludovic de Saint Sernin.\n\nThe black corset dress created a tiny waist, and the crystals were magnificent in photos.\n\nTyla comes out of the water covered in sand\n\nFrom one South African to another, it was a proud moment seeing Tyla make her Met Gala debut after a huge year in music. The \"Water\" singer wore a nude Balmain dress covered in sand to represent \"the sands of time,\" she told Vogue livestream host LaLa Anthony.\n\nWe particularly loved the moment she reached the top of the stairs and was picked up and carried.\n\nWhat is a co-chair?\n\nMet Gala co-chair's were among the first stars to arrive to the carpet, but what exactly do they do? In short, Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and Bad Bunny are representatives and responsible for pulling in a variety of audiences to fashion's biggest night.\n\nMost of their job happens before the event and of course, we expect a lot from them in terms of fashion.\n\nYes, Chef. Ayo Edebiri of 'The Bear' impresses\n\nAyo Edebiri was definitely the fashion darling of the awards season. And she didn't disappoint at the Met. She looked like pure spring in Loewe. And her makeup was amazing.\n\n\"It’s all these 3D lace flowers, all hand stitched,\" she told LaLa Anthony. \"I think feeling really easy and at the same time very intentional.\"\n\nWe loved seeing her win so many trophies, but just as much, we loved her fashion looks.\n\nEdebiri has looked amazing as she has collected the top awards at the last four big award shows for her work in \"The Bear.\" Forget the EGOT, look what Edebiri has won this season: Globes, Emmys, Critics Choice and SAGs. Could we create a new name for that? GECS?\n\nMet Gala co-chairs Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and Bad Bunny impress\n\nMet Gala royalty Zendaya embraced the \"Garden of Time\" dress code in a dark blue and turquoise Maison Margiela gown donned in fruit with mocking birds floating around the dress. It's a sharp contrast from her preppy \"Challengers\" red carpet looks and exactly the type of risk we'd expect from the actress.\n\nJennifer Lopez wore a figure-hugging Schiaparelli gown, Bad Bunny arrived in a daring black outfit by Maison Margiela and Chris Hemsworth donned an off-white Tom Ford suit.\n\nDid Zendaya wear two dresses at the Met Gala?\n\nWe are completely fine with Zendaya walking the red carpet more than once, especially if she includes and outfit change. We might even put her on our best-dressed list twice!\n\nThe co-chair of the Met Gala changed into a new look, a vintage Givenchy dress – made in 1996, the year she was born, according to Vogue.\n\nMet Gala dress code 'Garden of Time' inspired by J.G. Ballard\n\nThe dress code is \"Garden of Time,\" inspired by J.G. Ballard's 1962 short story of the same title, per Vogue. \"Think melancholic florals (as moody florals aren't moody enough),\" the magazine previously stated.\n\nMet Gala 2024All the looks on the red carpet, from Chris Hemsworth to Anna Wintour\n\nVogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour arrives in Loewe\n\nAnna Wintour doesn't do fashionably late. The Vogue editor-in-chief arrived bright and early to the carpet wearing a white floor-length Loewe dress and black coat with red and yellow floral print.\n\nChris Hemsworth at the 2024 Met Gala\n\nThe \"Thor\" actor, who is serving as a co-chair of Monday's Met Gala, arrived at the legendary steps of the event looking sharp wearing a simple, off-white Tom Ford suit, opting against a more elaborate look. Joining Hemsworth on the red carpet was his wife, Elsa Pataky.\n\nGuess who? Prabal Gurung teases Met Gala 2024 looks\n\nPrabal Gurung will have a strong presence at this year's Met Gala. Ahead of carpet time, the Nepalese–American fashion designer teased some of the looks you should expect stars to be in.\n\n\"She's too cool for the summer. And really hot for the #metgala. Guess who?\" the brand wrote on its Instagram Story along with a close-up of a shimmering silver dress with floral motifs. Many fans guessed Demi Lovato in the comments because of her song \"Cool For the Summer.\"\n\nIn another teaser, the brand showed off a blush pink fabric with several layers of tulle. \"Little girls will scream her name. Guess who?\" Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande were the top answers.\n\n\"Mrs. Bridgerton shimmers in midnight,\" Prabal Gurung wrote alongside a close up of a garment with seafoam green panels and black beads over a sheer black fabric. Naturally, \"Bridgerton\" fans guessed the Season 3 lead Nicola Couglan.\n\nAnd in the spirit of tennis fashion looks (thank you, Zendaya and Law Roach) making a statement on \"The Challengers\" red carpet, Prabal Gurung posted a yellow-green fabric with rosettes. \"It's a serve,\" the brand wrote on their story. Could it be Zendaya or Serena Williams? Fans will have to wait and see.\n\nBad Bunny at the Met Gala\n\nIt's hard to get excited about men’s fashion at the Met Gala.\n\nYes, men have become more daring in their looks – and that isn't counting Jared Leto showing up as a cat.\n\nBad Bunny is relatively new to the Met Gala, with his first appearance in 2022. But his look didn't disappoint in a white Burberry gown with a white jacket and white cape with sculptural flowers.\n\nFirst look at the Met Gala 'red' carpet\n\nSurprise, it's not red. Following the theme of \"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,\" it looks like spring.\n\nWhat does the Met exhibit look like?\n\nWe got a sneak peek Monday morning, with Anna Kaufman walking through the \"Sleeping Beauties\" exhibit.\n\nMet director and CEO Max Hollein shared the internal logic of the exhibit, which seems to be − fashion is to be felt, not just admired, and no number of years passed should preclude that original purpose. While you cannot touch the clothing on display, the museum has created clever ways to allow visitors to experience the fashion through all senses.\n\nDrawn exclusively from the Met's permanent collection, the exhibition houses some 220 pieces dating back to the 17th century, head curator Andrew Bolton told the crowd Monday. Many of the galleries showcase a \"sleeping beauty\" or a dress lying flat, too delicate to even stretch around a mannequin for display.\n\nSee the exhibitThe Met Gala's theme is Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion. Here's what that looks like.\n\nMet Gala attendees 2024\n\nThe list is kept secret each year, but we know the co-chairs of the event are there. Honorary chairs are Loewe creative director Jonathan Anderson and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew. TikTok is the gala's sponsor this year, with support from Loewe.\n\nWe don't know if the Kardashians will all be there. But Kim Kardashian, Blake Lively and Beyoncé – as well as Rihanna are expected.\n\nIs Taylor Swift going to the Met Gala?\n\nAll signs point to no. The singers resumes her Eras Tour in France on May 9. Even with a private jet, it seems the Grammy-winner won't be walking the carpet with Travis Kelce this year.\n\nThe 2016 Met Gala is where Swift supposedly met Joe Alwyn.\n\nWhat is Jennifer Lopez going to wear?\n\nIt’s almost surprising that Jennifer Lopez has attended the Met Gala 13 times – with looks ranging from Catholic chainmail to 18th century lacey goddess.\n\nShe told \"Good Morning America\" that the night isn't about comfort. \"But it’s exciting, it's exciting. It’s a fun night for fashion,\" she said.\n\nMost iconic Met Gala looks from last year\n\nOur eight favorite looks from last year included Rihanna and Dua Lipa.\n\nMore:Met Gala 2023 best dressed: See Rihanna, Dua Lipa, Janelle Monáe, more stars channel Karl Lagerfeld\n\nWhy is Rihanna so important to the Met Gala?\n\nRihanna is known for taking big fashion risks – from her pregnancy announcement to her iconic look at the Met Gala in 2018 that had her dubbed \"Pope Rihanna.\"\n\nShe is known as the unofficial queen of the Met Gala for nailing the themes.\n\nRihanna's evolving red carpet style, including her unforgettable Met Gala looks\n\nWhen is the Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala is the first Monday in May, as is tradition. The exact date for the 2024 event is May 6.\n\nWhen does the Met Gala red carpet start?\n\nThe Met Gala will be livestreamed on Vogue's website and social media channels beginning at 6 p.m. ET. The \"hautest\" event of the year will air live on E! starting at 6 p.m. ET.\n\nWhere is the Met Gala held?\n\nThe Met Gala is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\n\nWhat happens inside the Met Gala?\n\nThe Costume Institute Benefit, commonly known as Met Gala, is a fundraiser for the museum's Costume Institute. Last year, the event hit a record and raised over $22 million, according to Vogue Business.\n\nWe almost all think of the Gala as the red carpet on the giant steps leading to the actual event, which is closed to media. The steps are where we see all the looks, who each celebrity brought as their +1 (if they were granted a +1) and who wore what.\n\nInside, guests can tour the exhibit, have cocktails and then sit down for dinner. There is a strict no-phones policy, so the only photos that we typically see are bathroom selfies.\n\nWhy does the Met Gala matter?\n\nIt is the best night of fashion – far exceeding any awards show or fashion week. You bring together celebrities, designers, fashion people – and art. It's a night to impress – and the looks aren't meant to be wearable, but rather tell a story on the theme of the night.\n\nYou'll see experimental fashion, gowns you cannot sit down in, wild looks and beauty. We saw Zendaya wave goodbye to her Disney roots in a Cinderella ball gown, Kim Kardashian in in Marilyn Monroe's iconic \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" dress and Jared Leto \"feline\" himself as Karl Lagerfeld's famous Birman cat Choupette.\n\nHow much does it cost to go to the Met Gala?\n\nThe Met Gala is invitation only - and Vogue Editor Anna Wintour holds the list.\n\nTickets are $75,000 each, according to The New York Times, and even if you buy a table for $350,000, you don't get to pick where you sit. You can't simply buy your way in. The event holds about 400 people.\n\nWhat is this year's Met Gala theme?\n\n\"Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.\"\n\nThe \"sleeping beauties\" is not inspired by Disney princess, but rather treasured garments in the museum’s collection that are so fragile that they need to be housed in special glass \"coffins\" rather than on mannequins, curators said. Garments will be displayed in a series of galleries organized by themes of nature.\n\nContributing: Anika Reed, Taijuan Moorman, Anna Kaufman, KiMi Robinson, Brendan Morrow, Edward Segarra", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/09/08/met-gala-2021-everything-you-need-to-know/8247197002/", "title": "Met Gala 2021: How to watch, what to know on fashion's biggest night", "text": "Breathtaking, avant-garde ensembles have served as the focal point for the Met Gala's annual celebration of fashion, celebrities and art – but all eyes are on the must-have accessory of the year: a vaccination card.\n\nThe biggest names in Hollywood are set to descend upon the Metropolitan Museum of Art's carpeted stairs in New York this fall, more than a year after the COVID-19 pandemic upended nearly all entertainment events and canceled the 2020 Met Gala.\n\nFashion's biggest night will mark one of the largest red carpet extravaganzas that we have seen in some time, but things may look a little different this year.

We won't know who will attend the Met Gala for sure until the actual event, but where's the fun in knowing ahead of time anyway? Expect to see the \"Who's Who\" of entertainment and fashion.\n\nHowever, one person we know won't be at the Met Gala is Zendaya. During an interview last week with Extra for her movie \"Dune,\" the actress shared she would be working instead of walking the red carpet.\n\n\"I will unfortunately not be able to attend because I'll be working on 'Euphoria.' … I wish I could especially since this fashion icon (Timothée Chalamet) is going to be hosting,\" she said.\n\nWhat are the COVID safety protocols?\n\nThe museum requires all visitors age 12 and older to be vaccinated against COVID-19, in accordance to New York's mandate requiring proof of vaccination for indoor activities.\n\nThe same will apply to this year's Met Gala.\n\n\"Currently, all attendees… must provide proof of full vaccination and will also be expected to wear masks indoors except when eating or drinking,\" a spokesperson for The Met confirmed to People earlier this month. \"We will update these guidelines as needed.\"\n\nHow to stream the Met Gala\n\nThe Met Gala is one the hardest invitations to score, but if you are left on the couch like the rest of us, don't fret. The fashion extravaganza will be exclusively streamed by Vogue on Twitter.\n\nThe livestream, hosted by actresses KeKe Palmer and Ilana Glazer, will feature \"unprecedented access to the Met Gala’s famous red carpet,\" including interviews with high-profile guests and a close look at their attire.\n\nHead over to twitter.com/voguemagazine on Sept. 13 at 5:30 p.m. EST to tune in.\n\nAlready looking forward to next year's Met Gala?\n\nAlthough the blockbuster fundraiser will take place in the fall this year, the 2022 Met Gala will return to its traditional date on the first Monday of the month: May 2, 2022.\n\nThe theme will be a continuation of fashion in the United States, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" the second installment of the two-part exploration.\n\nWhen will the exhibits open to the public?\n\n\"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,\" featuring ensembles exploring fashion in the United States and the \"deeper associations with issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion,\" is slated to open Sept. 18.\n\nPart two, \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion,\" will open in the museum’s popular American Wing period rooms on May 5, 2022.

Do people still care? And should they?\n\nThe answers are complicated.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nMet Gala's 10 best dressed:Rihanna is a mood; Billie Eilish, Megan Fox nail American theme\n\nMet Gala's most outrageous looks:Kim K sparks 'Harry Potter' memes, Grimes wields a sword\n\nThis year's theme of \"American Independence\" is paired with the first of the two-part Costume Institute exhibition \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,\" which \"uses the organizing principle of a patchwork quilt\" and \"serves as a metaphor for the United States and its varied cultural identities,\" according to The Met's description. The Met Gala theme was largely ignored or misunderstood (like it is most years).\n\nDuring NYFW, hints of Americana were sprinkled throughout in subtle ways leading up to the main event. Brandon Maxwell's show opened with the song “Be Your USA” by EASYFUN feat. Iiris, and his finale featured “And the Healing Has Begun” by Van Morrison.\n\nDesigner Prabal Gurung's show had the Statue of Liberty as its backdrop, and he asked in the show notes, \"What is American? And who gets to be it all – or none of it?\" For many attendees, the resounding confusion was clear and disappointing – though it was an accurate depiction of where we are as a country, failing to speak the same language of equity.\n\nNYFW wraps up:The most glamorous fashion week highlights, from Brandon Maxwell to Prabal Gurung\n\nFashion has proven to be a form of escapism and luxury, a necessary outlet for imagination and joy through inescapably tough times. Fashion and its major players and influential figures have also helped illustrate the widening of the gulf of inequity, elitism and racism as the pandemic continues and as the country is engulfed in a variety of tragedies.\n\nWhat could have been a night of subversive fashion statements instead felt frivolous in the face of the world imploding around us and ultimately underwhelming, illustrated in part by police arresting protesters just outside the Met while celebrities traipsed into an evening of opulence.\n\nFew attendees went beyond uninspired (yet beautiful) looks. Outfits adorned with crystals, fashions featuring fur and feathers and quasi-prom dresses were the norm on the Met Gala carpet.\n\nThe bright spots included Lupita Nyong'o, draped in a denim Versace dress and sporting a hairstyle inspired by Brooklyn-born conceptual artist Lorna Simpson; Yara Shahidi, channeling Josephine Baker in a beaded, vintage-style Dior gown; Indigenous model Quannah Chasinghorse, whose presence – and turquoise and silver-adorned look – brought representation to the gala; Gemma Chan, whose Gurung-designed outfit paid homage to Chinese-American actress Anna May Wong; even Lopez and Maluma, leaning into the yeehaw agenda with Western-themed looks by Ralph Lauren and Versace, respectively.\n\nFans and critics alike tuned in to watch the red carpet and see images of the night on social media, though they were of mixed mindsets with what they saw.\n\nOn Twitter, user @parasocialyte wrote that \"overall, this year’s met gala was simply underwhelming. the theme was vague, the outfits were all over the place, and it just did not measure up to the past two galas, besides a few standout outfits.\" Another tweet from user @vxctorvale called the Met Gala \"the biggest confidence booster cuz next time yall feel ugly in your clothes just remember what a-list celebrities wore today.\"\n\nThere was still some excitement for the event: @veryrare1717 tweeted, \"i love seeing everyone’s outfits for the met gala it’s like a celebrity prom.\" Twitter user @CynthetikGaming wrote, \"Not going to lie, I never look forward to it (mostly because i completely forget about it), but damn do I really enjoy Met Gala. Looking at all the crazy gowns and outfits is so much fun.\"\n\nWhen fashion isn't saying something of note or creating a moment of meaning, it's not at its best – and people shouldn't have to engage with fashion that skews boring or rote, especially if it doesn't add anything to the conversation.\n\nThe fashion industry has long touted its exclusivity, and the Met Gala is no different. But the most inventive fashion moments have often happened on the fringes of society, rather than at an event often centered around wealthy, cisgender white people. The Met Gala has always had its shortcomings, but people are taking more notice through the dissection of the event on social media.\n\nThe \"Lexicon of Fashion\" exhibit is meant to look forward to the generation of designers and a newer understanding of fashion, which has veered toward more accessibility, inclusivity, and egalitarian ideas about who gets to enjoy and benefit from fashion.\n\nFormula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton put his money where his mouth was, shelling out the cost of a table at the event (where individual tickets can go for more than $30,000) and inviting emerging Black designers Kenneth Nicholson, Theophilio and Jason Rembert as his guests. Billie Eilish used her platform to convince Oscar de la Renta to stop the use of fur. With their presence, NikkieTutorials, Barbie Ferreira, Leyna Bloom, Valentina Sampaio, Precious Lee and Elliot Page championed size inclusivity and trans representation, which have been historically excluded and ignored at the gala.\n\nPowerful or hypocritical? AOC's 'Tax the Rich' dress at Met Gala draws mixed reactions\n\nTo praise and some criticism, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Carolyn B. Maloney sparked conversations about privilege with their statement-making dresses (AOC's dress was emblazoned with a statement reading \"tax the rich\" while Maloney's dress demanded equal rights for women.) Cara Delevingne and Dan Levy wore outfits that pushed back against the patriarchy and heteronormativity.\n\nThe next Met Gala in May will tap into the past, corresponding with the second and larger part of the exhibit \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\" In looking back, organizers and guests would do well in noting where fashion has succeeded in creating a dialogue around what it means to be American – not just for an elite few at the top, but for all.\n\nMet Gala debut:Kamala Harris' stepdaughter Ella Emhoff stuns in futuristic diamond bodysuit\n\nMet Gala:Nicki Minaj says she refused to get vaccinated for the event, fans respond with research", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2023/11/07/cfda-fashion-awards-2023-winners-honorees/71410655007/", "title": "Serena Williams accepts fashion icon award from Kim Kardashian ...", "text": "NEW YORK – Amid sleek black tie fare and voluminous gowns, a giant walrus watched on while a 94-foot-long blue whale floated overhead.

This year's theme, \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,\" seems ripe for eyebrow-raising choices from its celebrity attendees.\n\nBefore the stars descend on the Met's steps, learn more about the annual event.\n\nWhat is the Met Gala?\n\nCelebrating its 70th anniversary this year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Benefit informally called the Met Gala or the Met Ball, is a black-tie fundraiser for the museum's Costume Institute, with last year's gala raising over $12 million for the Met. The event also celebrates the opening of the Costume Institute's annual fashion exhibit.\n\nThe Costume Institute is housed in the museum's Anna Wintour Costume Center, named after the Vogue editor-in-chief. Wintour has served as the Met Gala co-chair nearly every year since 1995.\n\nThis year's theme\n\nThe Costume Institute's spring 2018 exhibition, from which the Met Gala gets its sartorial theme, will be \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,\" exploring the intersections of fashion with the practices and traditions of Catholicism. The exhibit, which will feature papal robes and accessories from the Vatican alongside designs from names including Coco Chanel and John Galliano, will be the largest in the Costume Institute's history, spanning three of the museum's spaces: the medieval galleries, the Anna Wintour Costume Center and the Met Cloisters uptown.\n\nAs far as celebrity fashions go, the suggested dress code for the event is \"Sunday best,\" a wink at the event's holy theme.\n\nThe celebrity hosts\n\nEvery year since Wintour took the reins in 1995, the event has also featured honorary hosts from the worlds of entertainment and fashion.\n\nAlong with Wintour, this year's co-chairs are Amal Clooney, Rihanna and Donatella Versace, with Clooney making an appearance on the May cover of Vogue ahead of the gala.\n\nThe star-studded guest list\n\nOnly Hollywood's biggest award shows boast guest lists that rival that of the invitation-only Met Gala.

The stars who attended the 2017 gala included Selena Gomez, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Priyanka Chopra, Katy Perry, Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, Madonna and hundreds more, with an estimated 550 people on last year's guest list.\n\nThe Ocean's 8 connection\n\nOcean's 8 is an all-female re-imagining of the Ocean's 11 franchise starring Sandra Bullock, Rihanna and Cate Blanchett, who concoct a plot to infiltrate the Met Gala and steal a diamond necklace from Anne Hathaway's actress character.

As a result, he said he is now recommending against using the vaccines.\n\nIn response to Ladapo's announcement, the FDA reiterated the vaccine's safety and efficacy, pointing to last month's letter issued directly to Ladapo for an explanation it says dispells his concerns.\n\n\"The FDA stands firmly behind the safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality of the approved and authorized COVID-19 vaccines, and respectfully disagrees with the Florida Surgeon General’s opinion,\" the FDA said in a statement shared with USA TODAY Thursday. \"As stated in the letter, the challenge we continue to face is the ongoing proliferation of misinformation and disinformation about these vaccines which results in vaccine hesitancy that lowers vaccine uptake.\"\n\nLower vaccine rates contribute to illness and death caused by COVID-19, the FDA said.\n\nCOVID-19:It's been 4 years since COVID hit. Here's what's happening to prevent the next pandemic.\n\nWho is Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo?\n\nLadapo is a controversial figure who repeatedly has criticized COVID-19 vaccines and issued increasingly stringent recommendations urging various populations not to get them, despite assurances by federal authorities they are safe.\n\nNominated by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Ladapo was confirmed along party lines by the state Senate in February 2022. He received a medical degree and doctorate in health policy from Harvard, and he holds a teaching position at the University of Florida.\n\nShortly after his confirmation, Ladapo made Florida the first state in the nation to recommend against healthy children receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. Then last year he recommended against anyone under the age of 65 getting new COVID vaccine boosters.\n\nSince taking office, he has appeared on podcasts known for having conservative listeners or hosted by anti-vaccine advocates.\n\nOn the podcast \"Liberty Lockdown,\" he called former chief White House medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci \"a complete fraud when it comes to communication.\" During another appearance, he urged listeners to rely on their intuition when deciding whether or not to listen to medical doctors. His podcast appearances have drawn criticism and concern from medical experts.\n\nFlorida vaccine debate:Ron DeSantis is courting anti-vax voters. Florida surgeon general's podcast appearances help\n\nDr. Ladapo raises concerns about COVID mRNA vaccines\n\nLadapo's latest recommendation is his most drastic yet, targeting some of the most popular vaccines such as those made by Pfizer and Moderna. Ladapo's letter to the FDA raises concerns about \"the risks of contaminant DNA integration into human DNA\" through the messenger RNA vaccine and \"the integrity of the human genome.”\n\nMessenger RNA, or mRNA, is a molecule that delivers genetic information from DNA to proteins. DNA \"is the molecule that carries genetic information for the development and functioning of an organism,\" according to the National Human Genome Research Institute.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says mRNA vaccines do not alter an individual's DNA: \"None of the COVID-19 vaccines affect or interact with our DNA.\"\n\nThe FDA letter responding to Ladapo says, \"We would like to make clear that based on a thorough assessment of the entire manufacturing process, FDA is confident in the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines.\"\n\nIt continues, \"The agency’s benefit-risk assessment and ongoing safety surveillance demonstrate that the benefits of their use outweigh their risks. Additionally, with over a billion doses of the mRNA vaccines administered, no safety concerns related to residual DNA have been identified.\"\n\nDr. Ladapo on the campaign trail for presidential hopeful DeSantis\n\nLadapo has joined DeSantis on the presidential campaign trail and held various events with the governor in which scientists and medical professionals with contrarian COVID-19 views have criticized federal health authorities' management of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2023, when he advised against young men getting the mRNA vaccines, a task force of University of Florida medical school doctors concluded he was \"cherry picking results,\" ignoring evidence that contradicted his bias and focusing on \"exceptionally small event rates that distort magnitude of risk and do not consider magnitude of benefit.\"\n\nAccording to a Health Department spokesman, Ladapo stood by his work.\n\nContributing: Jeffrey Schweers, Capital Bureau; Douglas Soule, Tallahassee Democrat; John Kennedy, Capital Bureau", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/11/health/ba-5-hidden-covid-case-increase/index.html", "title": "Undercounted Covid-19 cases leave US with a blind spot as BA.5 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOfficial Covid-19 case metrics severely undercount the true number of infections, leaving the United States with a critical blind spot as the most transmissible coronavirus variant yet takes hold.\n\nThe Omicron offshoot BA.5 became the dominant variant in the US last week, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the subvariant carries key mutations that help it escape antibodies generated by vaccines and prior infection, aiding its rapid spread.\n\nWith that will come “escalating numbers of cases and more hospitalizations,” Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, said on CNNi Monday. “One good thing is it doesn’t appear to be accompanied by the ICU admissions and the deaths as previous variants, but this is definitely concerning.”\n\nBut to look at official case counts, it’s hard to tell.\n\nThe share of cases that are officially reported is at an “all-time low,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and chief science officer at telehealth company eMed. “There’s no doubt about that.”\n\nCovid-19 cases have been undercounted to some degree throughout the pandemic for reasons including a lack of available tests at some points and asymptomatic cases that may have been missed. But as people increasingly rely on rapid at-home tests – and as attitudes toward the pandemic shift overall – the US hasn’t landed on a reliable way to track transmission levels.\n\nAn estimate from the Institute for Health Metrics, a research center at the University of Washington, suggests that actual infection numbers in the first week of July have been about seven times higher than reported cases – which have averaged about 107,000 each day over the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBefore the CDC lifted the requirement for international travelers to test before coming into the country last month, Mina said, it was an “amazing opportunity” to monitor the state of Covid-19 across the US among a group of mostly asymptomatic people. About 5% of travelers were testing positive throughout the month of May, which he says probably translates to at least 1 million new infections every day in the broader US population – 10 times higher than the official count.\n\nNow that BA.5 is here, “we know that there is going to be a wave in the fall – there’s almost no doubt about that – if not before. So you just have to be really cognitive that that is what might happen,” Mina said.\n\nBut with so many variables at play, it doesn’t necessarily make sense to compare the current state of things to other points in the pandemic.\n\n“We really don’t have a good sense of what the baseline is,” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “To say ‘here’s where we are, at this time in 2022, compared to 2021’ – that’s not a fair comparison.”\n\nTo assess your individual risk of Covid-19 as a new variant takes hold, a personal accounting of cases among friends and family may be a better gauge than official data, experts say.\n\n“People are asking one another, they’re sharing stories, and that’s probably not a bad source of evidence,” said Baruch Fischhoff, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and founding chair of the US Food and Drug Association’s Risk Communication Advisory Committee.\n\nOur social networks have probably stayed more consistent than national surveillance systems, he said, and “if more people that you hear about in your circle are getting the disease now than were getting it in the past, and the size of your circle is about the same, then presumably there’s much more disease now than there was before.”\n\nSevere outcomes don’t tell the whole story\n\nAt White House Covid-19 Response Team briefings – the most recent of which was held more than two weeks ago – CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has presented case trends without referencing these important caveats to the data.\n\nMonths ago, the CDC shifted away from Covid-19 transmission levels that categorized risk based on case counts and test positivity rates to focus on Covid-19 Community Levels that rely more heavily on metrics related to hospitalizations.\n\nDuring this winter’s Omicron surge, hospitalizations and deaths didn’t follow the same steep trend line as cases – an important shift from earlier waves of the pandemic.\n\nBut the fact that severe outcomes are still happening at all is enough reason to keep paying attention to cases, experts say.\n\n“If we ever got to a state where people were getting infected but it wasn’t causing any severe illness anymore – maybe it’s a new variant that is much less severe, or it wasn’t causing long Covid – if there were no really significant adverse health outcomes, then we would no longer care as much about cases,” said Jason Salemi, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of South Florida.\n\n“But let me be clear, we’re not there yet.”\n\nThere’s no evidence that BA.5 causes more severe disease, but studies have shown BA.5 can evade antibodies from vaccination or previous infection – even from another Omicron subvariant. Vaccines are still expected to provide protection against severe disease, and for fall, vaccine makers are developing updated booster shots that incorporate Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 strains.\n\nThere are treatments available, such the antiviral pill Paxlovid, that sharply reduce risk of death or severe disease. And high-quality masks, ventilation, physical distancing and quarantine and isolation can still help reduce spread from any variant, including BA.5.\n\nBut currently, more than 5,000 people are being admitted to the hospital with Covid-19 each day, CDC data shows, and more than 300 are dying each day, according to JHU data.\n\nFocusing on these “lagging indicators” costs “meaningful time in which to start to curb people’s behavior and prevent a lot of morbidity and mortality,” Salemi said.\n\nIf 1 in 5 Covid-19 infections results in long Covid and true infections are seven times higher than reported, the number of people with long Covid could be growing by 100,000 each day.\n\nWorking around blind spots\n\nFor now, the US is in a “sustained management phase,” with continued efforts to keep things under control compared with “what was much more of a reactive, emergent – and emerging – approach of the past,” Plescia said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut the federal government recently reallocated resources away from testing because Congress did not approve additional Covid funds, a move that Mina says will leave the US “pretty blind as we move into the fall.”\n\nSome surveillance programs are ongoing, such as wastewater monitoring that tracks the amount of virus present in sewage. But he says they’re “minimal,” and “generally, they’re not really not giving us a good picture of what’s really happening across the United States.”\n\n“We kind of just floated through this major outbreak,” Mina said, referring to previously dominant Omicron subvariants. “But we should not let our guard down, I would say, because with BA.5, I expect it will be a very different story.”", "authors": ["Deidre Mcphillips"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/12/30/fact-check-cdcs-pcr-test-withdrawn-after-dec-31/9053100002/", "title": "Fact check: CDC is withdrawing its PCR COVID-19 test, but not ...", "text": "The claim: CDC withdraws use of PCR test, admits it can't distinguish between flu and COVID-19\n\nA widely shared claim on social media has brought the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's decision to retire its PCR test for COVID-19 back into the spotlight.\n\n\"CDC Withdraws Use of PCR Test for COVID and Finally Admits the Test Can Not Differentiate Between the Flu and COVID Virus,\" reads the screenshot of a Gateway Pundit headline posted on Instagram on Dec. 29.\n\nThe Gateway Pundit article, posted the same day, refers to the CDC's decision in July to withdraw the PCR test in 2022 that the agency created.

But that's nonsense. Gateway Pundit was misunderstanding the use of the term differentiate.\n\nIn an August news release, the CDC wrote the PCR test was specifically designed only to detect the viral genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 – not influenza, which causes the flu.\n\n\"It does not detect influenza or differentiate between influenza and SARS-CoV-2,\" the website states.\n\nIn other words, it's not that the test can't tell the two apart, it's that the test was designed only to detect COVID-19. The CDC spelled this one by noting someone with the flu would not create a false positive for COVID-19 with this test.\n\nFact check: Made-up Jen Psaki statement on inflation started as satire\n\nExperts told USA TODAY in July it's \"technically impossible\" for the CDC's PCR test to confuse SARS-CoV-2 and the influenza virus.\n\nPCR tests identify and amplify converted viral RNA until the virus's genetic makeup can be detected and analyzed.\n\nIn this case, since the CDC's PCR test was made to only identify SARS-Cov-2, it cannot detect or confuse the genetic sequences of another virus such as influenza, according to Dr. Petros Giannikopoulos, medical director of the Innovative Genomics Institute’s COVID-19 testing consortium.\n\nCDC withdrawing PCR test to focus on other goals\n\nOn July 21, the CDC announced it would withdraw the request for an emergency use authorization for the agency-developed PCR test after Dec. 31.\n\nThe test will be removed because the Food and Drug Administration, which is in charge of approving the use of medical devices and vaccines, has authorized \"hundreds\" of other COVID-specific tests similar to the CDC's, the agency said in an Aug. 2 clarification after the announcement sparked confusion.\n\n\"CDC began distributing the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to fill a gap,\" the release said. \"The wide availability of other SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests means that the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is no longer filling an unmet need.\"\n\nThe discontinuation, which only applies to the CDC-manufactured test and not other diagnostic tests authorized for use by the FDA, would also let the CDC \"focus its resources on public health surveillance testing and other response activities,\" according to the release.\n\nFact check: Chris Wallace's CNN+ show has not yet debuted\n\nJasmine Reed, a CDC spokeswoman, told USA TODAY in July the agency also wanted to encourage laboratories to start using tests that can detect the influenza virus and COVID-19 in the same swab to conserve time and resources.\n\nThe CDC has its own test that can detect and differentiate COVID-19 and the influenza A and B viruses. That test is not being withdrawn.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the CDC for comment.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that the CDC withdrew the use of its PCR test and admitted it can't distinguish between the flu and COVID-19. The CDC is withdrawing the test, but it has nothing to do with the flu. The agency-created PCR test simply isn't needed because hundreds of tests from private companies have addressed this need and been approved by the FDA. The CDC test properly showed positive results only for COVID-19; a person with the flu could not test positive for COVID-19 using the CDC test, experts say.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Yet many don’t realize help is available, and some notable programs that offer financial assistance are underused.\n\nA few examples: Nearly 14 million adults age 60 or older qualify for aid from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (also known as food stamps) but haven’t signed up, according to recent estimates. Also, more than 3 million adults 65 or older are eligible but not enrolled in Medicare Savings Programs, which pay for Medicare premiums and cost sharing. And 30% to 45% of older adults may be missing out on help from the Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy program, which covers plan premiums and cost sharing and lowers the cost of prescription drugs.\n\n“Tens of billions of dollars of benefits are going unused every year” because older people don’t know about them, find applications too difficult to complete or feel conflicted about asking for help, said Josh Hodges, chief customer officer at the National Council on Aging, an advocacy group for older Americans that runs the National Center for Benefits Outreach and Enrollment.\n\nMany programs target older adults with extremely low incomes and minimal assets. But that isn’t always the case: Programs funded by the Older Americans Act, such as home-delivered meals and legal assistance for those facing home foreclosures or eviction, don’t require a means test, although people with low incomes are often prioritized. And some local programs, such as property tax breaks for homeowners, are available to anyone 65 or older.\n\nEven a few hundred dollars in assistance monthly can make a world of difference to older adults living on limited incomes that make it difficult to afford basics such as food, housing, transportation and health care. But people often don’t know how to find out about benefits and whether they qualify. And older adults are often reluctant to seek help, especially if they’ve never done so before.\n\n“You’ve earned these benefits,” Hodges said, and older adults should think of them “like their Medicare, like their Social Security.”\n\nHere’s how to get started and some information about a few programs:\n\nGetting help\n\nIn every community, Area Agencies on Aging, organizations devoted to aiding older people, perform benefits assessments or can refer you to other groups that conduct these evaluations. (To get contact information for your local Area Agency on Aging, use the Eldercare Locator, a service of the federal Administration on Aging, or call 800-677-1116 on weekdays during business hours.)\n\nMany older adults qualify for food stamps but haven't signed up for benefits despite high grocery costs. kupicoo/E+/Getty Images\n\nAssessments identify which federal, state and local programs can assist with various needs – food, housing, transportation, health care, utility costs and other essential items. Often, staffers at the agency will help older adults fill out application forms and gather necessary documentation.\n\nA common mistake is waiting until a crisis hits, and there’s no food in the refrigerator or the power company is about to turn off the electricity.\n\n“It’s a much better idea to be prepared,” said Sandy Markwood, chief executive officer of USAging, a national organization that represents Area Agencies on Aging. “Come in, sit down with somebody and put all your options on the table.”\n\nOlder adults who are comfortable online and want to do their own research can use BenefitsCheckUp, a service operated by the National Council on Aging, at benefitscheckup.org. Those who prefer using the phone can call 800-794-6559.\n\nAid with food expenses\n\nSome aging organizations are adapting to heightened demand for help from older people by focusing attention on core benefits such as food stamps, which have become even more important as food inflation runs around 10%.\n\nThe potential to help older adults with these expenses is enormous. In a new series of reports, the AARP Public Policy Institute estimates that 71% of adults age 60 and above who qualify for SNAP benefits haven’t signed up.\n\nIn some cases, older adults may think benefits are too small to be worth the hassle. But those who lived alone received an average of $104 in food stamps per month in 2019. And at least 3 million adults 50 and above with low incomes would receive more than $200 a month, AARP estimates.\n\nTo combat the stigma that some older adults attach to food stamps, AARP has launched a marketing campaign in Atlanta and Houston explaining that “food prices are rising and we’re all trying to stretch our grocery budgets,” said Nicole Heckman, vice president of benefit access programs at the AARP Foundation.\n\nIf the effort alters older Americans’ perception of the program and increases enrollment, AARP plans to do a major expansion next year, she said.\n\nAid with health care expenses\n\nAARP also is working closely with community organizations in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi that help older adults apply for Medicare Savings Programs and low-income subsidies for Part D prescription drug plans. It plans to expand this program next year to as many as 22 states.\n\nSome older Americans may be missing out on subsidies to help reduce prescription drug costs. alvarez/E+/Getty Images\n\nThe value of these health care benefits, targeted at low-income older adults, is substantial. At a minimum, Medicare Savings Programs will cover the cost of Medicare’s Part B premiums: $170 a month or $2,040 annually, for most. For older adults with the lowest incomes, benefits are even broader, with cost sharing for medical services also covered.\n\n“Even if you think you might not qualify, you should apply because there are different rules across states,” said Meredith Freed, a senior policy analyst for the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Program on Medicare Policy.\n\nLow-income subsidies for Part D prescription drug plans, also known as Extra Help, are worth $5,100 annually, according to the Social Security Administration. Currently, some older Americans get only partial benefits, but that will change in 2024, when all older adults with incomes below 150% of the federal poverty level ($20,385 for a single person in 2022) will qualify for full Extra Help benefits.\n\nBecause these health care programs are complicated, getting help with your application is a good idea. Freed suggested that people start by contacting the State Health Insurance Assistance Program in their state (contact information can be found here). Other potential sources of help are the Medicare hotline (800-633-4227) and your state’s department of aging, which can direct you to community organizations that help with applications. A list of the state departments can be found here.\n\nOther kinds of assistance\n\nBe sure to check out property tax relief programs for older adults in your area as part of a broader “benefits checkup” process.\n\nThose with low incomes also can get assistance with high energy bills through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Your local utility company may also provide emergency relief to seniors who can’t pay their bills. It’s worth making a call to find out, advised Rebecca Lerfelt, retired assistant director of a Chicago-area Aging and Disability Resource Center. These resource centers help people seeking access to long-term care services and are another potential source of assistance for older adults. You can find one in your area here.\n\nFor veterans, “this may be the time to take a look at using your (Veterans Administration) benefits,” said Diane Slezak, president of AgeOptions, an Area Agency on Aging in suburban Cook County, Illinois. “I run into a lot of people who are eligible for veterans benefits but not taking advantage of them.”\n\nBarriers to getting help\n\nAdvocates for many programs note that agencies serving older adults are facing staff shortages, which are complicating the efforts to provide assistance. Low pay is a commonly cited reason. For example, 41% of Area Agencies on Aging report staff vacancies of up to 15%, while an additional 18% report vacancies up to 25%, according to Markwood. Also, agencies have lost significant numbers of volunteers during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAt the same time, demand for help has risen, and clients’ needs have become more complex because of the pandemic and growing inflation.\n\n“All of this is being amplified by the financial strains older adults are feeling,” Markwood said.", "authors": ["Judith Graham"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/politics/hillary-clinton-coronavirus-positive/index.html", "title": "Hillary Clinton tests positive for Covid-19 | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nHillary Clinton announced Tuesday that she has tested positive for Covid-19 and is experiencing mild symptoms.\n\n“Well, I’ve tested positive for COVID.

If you feel caught off-guard, you aren’t alone.\n\nAfter the Omicron tidal wave washed over the United States in January and the smaller rise in cases in the spring caused by the BA.2 subvariant, it might have seemed like the coronavirus could be ignored for a while. After all, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in December that nearly all Americans had been vaccinated or have antibodies from a past infection. Surely all that immunity bought some breathing room.\n\nBut suddenly, many people who had recovered from Covid-19 as recently as March or April found themselves exhausted, coughing and staring at two red lines on a rapid test. How could this be happening again – and so soon?\n\nThe culprit this time is yet another Omicron offshoot, BA.5. It has three key mutations in its spike protein that make it both better at infecting our cells and more adept at slipping past our immune defenses.\n\nIn just over two months, BA.5 outcompeted its predecessors to become the dominant cause of Covid-19 in the United States. Last week, this subvariant caused almost 2 out of every 3 new Covid-19 infections in this country, according to the latest data from the CDC.\n\nLab studies of antibodies from the blood of people who’ve been vaccinated or recovered from recent Covid-19 infections have looked at how well they stand up to BA.5, and this subvariant can outmaneuver them. So people who’ve had Covid as recently as winter or even spring may again be vulnerable to the virus.\n\n“We do not know about the clinical severity of BA.4 and BA.5 in comparison to our other Omicron subvariants,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House Covid-19 Response Team briefing Tuesday. “But we do know it to be more transmissible and more immune-evading. People with prior infection, even with BA.1 and BA.2, are likely still at risk for BA.4 or BA.5.”\n\nA ‘full-on’ wave\n\nThe result is that we’re getting sick in droves. As Americans have switched to more rapid at-home tests, official case counts – currently hovering around 110,000 new infections a day – reflect just a fraction of the true disease burden.\n\n“We estimate that for every reported case there are 7 unreported,” Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, wrote in an email.\n\nOther experts think the wave could be as much as 10 times higher than what’s being reported now.\n\n“We’re looking at probably close to a million new cases a day,” Dr. Peter Hotez said on CNN. “This is a full-on BA.5 wave that we’re experiencing this summer. It’s actually looking worse in the Southern states, just like 2020, just like 2021,” said Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nThat puts us in the range of cases reported during the first Omicron wave, in January. Remember when it seemed like everyone everywhere got sick at the same time? That’s the situation in the United States again.\n\nIt may not seem like a very big deal, because vaccines and better treatments have dramatically cut the risk of death from Covid-19. Still, about 300 to 350 people are dying on average each day from Covid-19, enough to fill a large passenger jet.\n\n“That is unacceptable. It’s too high,” Dr. Ashish Jha, coordinator for the White House Covid-19 Response Team, said at Tuesday’s briefing.\n\nDaily hospitalizations are also climbing in the United States. The fraction of patients needing intensive care is up by about 23% over the past two weeks. And other countries are experiencing BA.5 waves, too.\n\n“I am concerned that cases of Covid-19 continue to rise, putting further pressure on stretched health systems and health workers. I am also concerned about the increasing trend of deaths,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, at a news briefing Tuesday after the agency’s decision to maintain its emergency declaration for Covid-19.\n\nThe pandemic, he said, is “nowhere near over.”\n\nWhat’s at stake with continued spread\n\nThere are also more insidious health risks to consider. A recent preprint study that compared the health of people who’d been infected one or more times with Covid-19 found that the risk of new and sometimes lasting health problems rose with each subsequent infection, suggesting that reinfections are not necessarily benign.\n\nAlthough vaccination reduces the risk of getting long Covid, a certain percentage of people have lasting symptoms after a breakthrough infection.\n\nThat’s another reason why high numbers of Covid-19 cases are a big deal: Because the virus is still spreading wildly, it has every opportunity to mutate to make even fitter and more infectious versions of itself. It’s doing this faster than we can change our vaccines, leaving us stuck in the Covid-rinse-repeat period of the pandemic.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, pleaded with Americans to use all available tools to stop the spread of the virus, including masking, ventilation and social distancing.\n\n“We need to keep the levels of virus to the lowest possible level, and that is our best defense. If a virus is not very robustly replicating and spreading, it gives it less of a chance of a mutation, which gives it less of a chance of the evolving of another variant,” Fauci said in a news briefing.\n\nIn fact, this is already happening.\n\nMeet BA.2.75\n\nEven as the US comes to terms with BA.5, variant hunters around the world are closely watching another Omicron descendant, BA.2.75. It’s been detected in about 10 countries, including the United States, and seems to be growing quickly in India.\n\nBA.2.75 has nine changes in its spike region that distinguish it from BA.2 and about 11 changes compared with BA.5, according to Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London.\n\nSeveral of the mutations in BA.2.75 are in a region of the spike protein known to be an important place for antibodies to bind to stop the virus, said Ulrich Elling, a scientist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences who monitors coronavirus variants for that country.\n\nThere’s little information to go on: It’s still not known, for example, how BA.2.75 may compete against BA.5 or whether it causes more severe illness. But experts say it has all the hallmarks of a variant that could go global.\n\n“It spread to many different countries already, so we know that it has some sort of staying power,” said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease for Helix Labs, which decodes virus samples for the CDC and other clients.\n\nBecause of that, and because of changes in the region of the virus that our antibodies look for to shut it down, “we sort of know ahead of time that this one will cause some trouble,” Luo said.\n\nBased on what we know now, she expects that this subvariant could drive a fall Covid-19 wave in the United States.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn the meantime, Jha said, people should get boosters that are available to them to keep their immunity as strong as possible. US health officials emphasized that people who are boosted now will still be able to get an updated shot this fall that includes the BA.4 and BA.5 strains.\n\nJha specifically urged Americans who are 50 and older, “if you’ve not gotten a vaccine shot this year, go get one now. It could save your life,” he said.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/health/ba-2-covid-severity/index.html", "title": "Coronavirus: As BA.2 subvariant of Omicron rises, lab studies point ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe BA.2 virus – a subvariant of the Omicron coronavirus variant – isn’t just spreading faster than its distant cousin, it may also cause more severe disease and appears capable of thwarting some of the key weapons we have against Covid-19, new research suggests.\n\nNew lab experiments from Japan show that BA.2 may have features that make it as capable of causing serious illness as older variants of Covid-19, including Delta.\n\nAnd like Omicron, it appears to largely escape the immunity created by vaccines. A booster shot restores protection, making illness after infection about 74% less likely.\n\nBA.2 is also resistant to some treatments, including sotrovimab, the monoclonal antibody that’s currently being used against Omicron.\n\nThe findings were posted Wednesday as a preprint study on the bioRxiv server, before peer review. Normally, before a study is published in medical journal, it is scrutinized by independent experts. Preprints allow research to be shared more quickly, but they are posted before that additional layer of review.\n\n“It might be, from a human’s perspective, a worse virus than BA.1 and might be able to transmit better and cause worse disease,” says Dr. Daniel Rhoads, section head of microbiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Rhoads reviewed the study but was not involved in the research.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is keeping close watch on BA.2, said its director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky.\n\n“There is no evidence that the BA.2 lineage is more severe than the BA.1 lineage. CDC continues to monitor variants that are circulating both domestically and internationally,” she said Friday. “We will continue to monitor emerging data on disease severity in humans and findings from papers like this conducted in laboratory settings.”\n\nBA.2 is highly mutated compared with the original Covid-causing virus that emerged in Wuhan, China. It also has dozens of gene changes that are different from the original Omicron strain, making it as distinct from the most recent pandemic virus as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants were from each other.\n\nKei Sato, a researcher at the University of Tokyo who conducted the study, argues that these findings prove that BA.2 should not be considered a type of Omicron and that it needs to be more closely monitored.\n\n“As you may know, BA.2 is called ‘stealth Omicron,’ ” Sato told CNN. That’s because it doesn’t show up on PCR tests as an S-gene target failure, the way Omicron does. Labs therefore have to take an extra step and sequence the virus to find this variant.\n\n“Establishing a method to detect BA.2 specifically would be the first thing” many countries need to do, he says.\n\n“It looks like we might be looking at a new Greek letter here,” agreed Deborah Fuller, a virologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who reviewed the study but was not part of the research.\n\nMixed real-world data on subvariant’s severity\n\nBA.2 has been estimated to be about 30% more contagious than Omicron, according to the World Health Organization. It has been detected in 74 countries and 47 US states.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 4% of Americans with Covid-19 now have infections caused by BA.2, but many other parts of the world have more experience with this variant. It has become dominant in at least 10 other countries: Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Denmark, Guam, India, Montenegro, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippines, according to World Health Organization’s weekly epidemiological report.\n\nHowever, there’s mixed evidence on the severity of BA.2 in the real world. Hospitalizations continue to decline in countries where BA.2 has gained a foothold, like South Africa and the UK. But in Denmark, where BA.2 has become the leading cause of infections, hospitalizations and deaths are rising, according to WHO.\n\nResistant to monoclonal antibody treatments\n\nThe new study found that BA.2 can copy itself in cells more quickly than BA.1, the original version of Omicron. It’s also more adept at causing cells to stick together. This allows the virus to create larger clumps of cells, called syncytia, than BA.1. That’s concerning because these clumps then become factories for churning out more copies of the virus. Delta was also good at creating syncytia, which is thought to be one reason it was so destructive to the lungs.\n\nWhen the researchers infected hamsters with BA.2 and BA.1, the animals infected with BA.2 got sicker and had worse lung function. In tissues samples, the lungs of BA.2-infected hamsters had more damage than those infected by BA.1.\n\nSimilar to the original Omicron, BA.2 was capable of breaking through antibodies in the blood of people who’d been vaccinated against Covid-19. It was also resistant to the antibodies of people who’d been infected with Covid-19 early in the pandemic, including Alpha and Delta. And BA.2 was almost completely resistant to some monoclonal antibody treatments.\n\nBut there was a bright spot: Antibodies in the blood of people who’d recently had Omicron also seemed to have some protection against BA.2, especially if they’d also been vaccinated.\n\nAnd that raises an important point, Fuller says. Even though BA.2 seems more contagious and pathogenic than Omicron, it may not wind up causing a more devastating wave of Covid-19 infections.\n\n“One of the caveats that we have to think about as we get new variants that might seem more dangerous is the fact that there’s two sides to the story,” Fuller says.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe virus matters, she says, but as its would-be hosts, so do we.\n\n“Our immune system is evolving as well. And so that’s pushing back on things,” she said.\n\nRight now, she says, we’re in a race against the virus, and the key question is, who’s in the lead?\n\n“What we will ultimately want is to have the host be ahead of the virus. In other words, our immunity, be a step ahead of the next variant that comes out, and I don’t know that we’re quite there yet,” she said.\n\nFor that reason, Fuller says, she feels like it’s not quite time for communities to lift mask mandates.\n\n“Before this thing came out, we were about 10 feet away from the finish line,” she said. “Taking off the masks now is not a good idea. It’s just going to extend it. Let’s get to the finish line.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/09/10/republicans-attack-bidens-covid-vaccine-plan-plan-court-challenges/8272271002/", "title": "Republicans attack Biden's COVID vaccine plan, plan court challenges", "text": "WASHINGTON – Republican candidates and conservative activists are planning to attack President Joe Biden's COVID vaccine mandates in court and on the campaign trail, but they face uphill battles in trying to block the plan.\n\nConservatives in the House Freedom Caucus on Friday denounced Biden's plan as \"another attempt by the Biden Regime to expand its control over Americans' daily lives,\" according to a statement issued by the group's chairman, Rep.

Vance, part of a crowded field of candidates seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat in Ohio, even called for \"civil disobedience\" regarding the Biden plan.\n\n\"If all of us ignore this garbage they won’t be able to enforce it,\" Vance tweeted Friday.\n\nDemocrats predicted that voters would punish the Republicans for their resistance to vaccine mandates. In a statement, the Democratic National Committee said their opponents \"are once again brazenly siding with COVID and attempting to prolong the pandemic.\"\n\nA recent poll authorized by the COVID States Project, a multi-university group of scientific researchers, said nearly two-thirds of Americans support government requirements for vaccines in order to defeat the pandemic.\n\nTim Miller, a former Republican political strategist, said the mandate issue could appeal to voters who are already upset with Biden over the problems with the military withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nConservatives now have \"the same energy to oppose Biden that existed for Clinton/Obama,\" Miller said, \"and so that will help with voter engagement.\"\n\nMiller said Republicans \"are on the wrong side of public opinion\" when it comes to vaccines.\n\n\"So that energy might be offset by continued bleed among the college educated suburban voters that decided the 2020 election.\"\n\nRepublican strategist Liz Mair said GOP candidates could have success by appealing to voter concerns about government abusing its powers. But, given the dangers of COVID, Mair added that the Republicans \"need to be careful in terms of how they talk about this.\"\n\nThe conservative opposition to the Biden mandates is simply \"playing to the base,\" said Jack Pitney, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California.\n\nPitney said that \"many core Republican voters think that just about anything Biden does is illegitimate,\" especially with respect to the COVID pandemic,\n\n\"The GOP's problem is that the vaccinated majority takes a different point of view,\" Pitney said.\n\nContributing: Courtney Subramanian", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/harris-covid/index.html", "title": "Kamala Harris remains asymptomatic and is working after testing ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nVice President Kamala Harris does not have Covid-19 symptoms a day after testing positive for the coronavirus, according to a White House official on Wednesday.\n\nHarris has been working from the Naval Observatory, where an official said Tuesday she would isolate.\n\n“The vice president remains asymptomatic.

He and Michael Jordan are the only players to claim those honors and also a Defensive Player of the Year award.\n\nHe also joins Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only Bucks players to have won regular-season and Finals MVPs. They are two of just 17 players to earn that distinction in league history.\n\nAntetokounmpo is also the fifth international player to win the award (Hakeem Olajuwon, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Dirk Nowitzki).\n\nNBA FINALS:Bucks finish off Suns for first championship in 50 years\n\n\"I remember the summer after I won my first MVP, I was happy. I was happy with my family, but at the same time I was miserable,\" Antetokounmpo said, cradling the MVP and Larry O'Brien trophies. \"Like everywhere I went, it was like, MVP. It's done. It's over with. It's done. It's in the past. Got to do it again. And I was able to do it again. This year I wasn't able to do it. I don't know why, but okay.\n\n\"But this, this is a feeling, like this is an addictive feeling. I love playing in the playoffs. I love playing in the Finals. This is the moments I want to chase. I want the team to build off this and hopefully we can do it again.\"\n\nIt seems improbable to believe that even playing in the Finals was a real question for Antetokounmpo. He suffered a hyperextended left knee in the Eastern Conference finals June 29 and somehow found a way to play in Game 1 on July 6. He played 35 minutes in his Finals debut, scoring 20 points on 54.5% shooting, pulling down 17 rebounds and handing out four assists.\n\n\"For him to be back in a game in the Finals in general was freakish,\" Pat Connaughton said. \"And then for him to do what he did throughout this Finals was incredible.\"\n\nHe followed it up by making history in every game afterward:\n\nGame 2\n\n42 points (68.2% shooting), 12 rebounds, 4 assists\n\nIt was his 10th game of the playoffs with at least 30 and 12, joining Shaquille O'Neal, Olajuwon, Elgin Baylor and Abdul-Jabbar as the only players to have that many in one postseason.\n\nHis 20 fourth-quarter points were the most points scored in a Finals season since Michael Jordan had 22 in 1993 vs. the Suns.\n\nHe joined O’Neal as the only players to have at least 40 and 10 in consecutive Finals games.\n\nGame 3\n\n41 points (60.9% shooting), 13 rebounds, six assists\n\nJoined Bob Pettit (1957) as the only players to average at least 30 and 14 through the first three games of his first three Finals games.\n\nBecame one of seven players to score 40 points with just one turnover in a game.\n\nHad the fourth most points scored in his first three Finals game with 103.\n\nGame 4\n\n26 points (57.9% shooting) and pulled in 14 rebounds and handed out eight assists – and he came up with the signature defensive play of his career and one of the best in Finals history with a fourth-quarter block of Suns center Deandre Ayton.\n\nIt was the first block of a dunk attempt in clutch time of Finals over the last 25 seasons, per ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nHe joined O’Neal as the only players to average 30 points per game on 60% shooting through his first four games since 1955.\n\nGame 5\n\n32 points (60.9% shooting) with nine rebounds and six assists. He also called for the ball on a soaring alley-oop dunk over Chris Paul at the end of the game.\n\nJoined Larry Bird, Dennis Johnson, Kevin Durant and LeBron James as the only players to score 30 and have at least five rebounds and assists and not turn the ball over since 1978.\n\nHe is the first player in Finals history to average 30 points, 10 rebounds and five assists on 60% shooting.\n\nGame 6\n\nSaving his best for last, Antetokounmpo turned in a virtuoso performance. He emptied the whole bag, using a pump-fake on a three-pointer to blow by Ayton and finish with a spin move. He knocked down a three. He made 17 of his 19 free throws. He hit jumpers, layups and finished at the rim to clinch the series with 50 points, 14 rebounds and five blocks.\n\n\"I don't know how many words you need to use beyond 50 points in a close out game in an NBA Finals,\" Bucks center Brook Lopez said. \"Pretty much sums it all up.\"\n\n\"It's kind of as Brook said, it's awesome to have a front row seat to it and awesome to watch it and it's incredible because he's an even better human being than he is a basketball player,\" Connaughton added. \"We've all seen what he does on the biggest stage now after winning his first NBA Finals championship and being the Finals MVP, but he's an even better person.\"\n\nIt was his 12th game of this postseason with 30 points and 10 rebounds, tying Elgin Baylor for second-most in a single playoff of NBA History.\n\nHe joined O'Neal (2000) as the only players with three or more 40 and 10 games in a single NBA Finals.\n\nHe became the first player with 40 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks in any playoff game since O'Neal (2001).\n\nHe became the first player to record multiple 30-point halves in a single NBA Finals over the last 40 years.\n\nWith 35.2 points, 13.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.8 blocks, he became the first player in NBA history to average 30 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and one block on 50% shooting in a single playoff run.\n\nAntetokounmpo averaged 35.2 points (on 61.8% shooting), 13.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.8 blocks and 1.2 steals per game.\n\n\"It's hard to find more words to describe what Giannis does,\" Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer said. \"But the way he made his free throws, the way he did everything, stepped up, the poise, the confidence, the leadership. He has been working on it. We say we want Giannis to get to the free throw line. We believe. We talked about it this past summer. To win a championship, you've got to make free throws and you've got to make shots. He's made shots throughout the playoffs. He's made free throws throughout the playoffs.

I think, in a game like this, you know it's going to be pretty loose, and you're going to get your opportunities.

After that, it was just like I'm going after it. So that was it.\"\n\nLillard was the star of All-Star Weekend. He won 3-point contest for the second consecutive time Saturday and claimed the MVP Sunday, becoming just the second player since Michael Jordan to win a Saturday event and MVP in the same year.\n\nAnd by the time the East topped the West 211-186 – and MVP voters submitted and then resubmitted their votes on deadline – Lillard earned his first NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant MVP award.\n\n\"Any time you're mentioned in the same category as Mike, it's an honor, and it's a major accomplishment, even if it's All-Star Weekend,\" Lillard said. \"If it was that simple, more people would have done it since 1988. So that's a major compliment for me to be mentioned in the same conversation as far as that.\"\n\nIt was not a popular decision with Indiana Pacers fans booing the decision. Controversy usually doesn't accompany All-Star MVP decisions but it did when when the Pacers star was snubbed in the host city. It was a close vote: Lillard received seven of 12 votes; Haliburton received the other five.\n\nFor a while, it looked like Haliburton would win the award. He opened the game by making his first five 3-pointers in the first 3½ minutes of the game and was 7-for-9 on 3s through two quarters, and when he made a 3 that made the East the first team to reach 200 points in a All-Star Game and followed that up with another 3 and a dunk, Haliburton seemed like the ideal MVP.\n\n\"I was just going to keep shooting until I missed,\" said Haliburton who is managing a strained left hamstring. \"Having fun playing basketball. I didn't know how many minutes I was going to play, didn't know how my leg would feel. I felt good today, even after the one-leg dunk.

A gangly, 6-foot-9 teenager born to Nigerian immigrants in Greece, he was relatively new to basketball and it was anyone's guess what he would become when the Milwaukee Bucks selected him 15th in the 2013 NBA draft.\n\nWhat he has become, after six years in Milwaukee, is the NBA's Most Valuable Player for the 2018-19 season, an accomplishment that became official on Monday night at the NBA Awards in Santa Monica, California, where Antetokounmpo took home the Maurice Podoloff Trophy. In earning the honor, he beat out last year's MVP James Harden of the Houston Rockets as well as Paul George of the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nLeading up to the event, the 24-year-old had confidently told his family he wouldn't be emotional if he were to win MVP. Instead, he'd speak from the heart -- he didn't prepare a speech -- about what the achievement meant to him while thanking everyone possible.\n\nAntetokounmpo did just that on Monday night and his words were heavy with gratitude. But in a memorable, moving six minutes, he broke down in tears multiple times, drawing applause and support for the audience.\n\n“I want to thank God for putting me in this amazing position that I’m in today,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Everything I do, I do it through him and I’m extremely blessed. ...\n\nAll things Bucks: Latest Milwaukee Bucks news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n“I want to thank my team. First of all, I want to thank my teammates. It takes more than one person to win 60 games. Every time I walked into the locker room I saw my teammates, they were ready to go, to fight. They were ready to go to war with me, to lace up their shoes. They went out there and they gave 100%. ...\n\n“I want to thank the coaching staff for teaching us, pushing us every day, every single day believing in us, teaching us what it takes to win. ...\n\n“I want to thank the city of Milwaukee, I want to thank my countries Greece and Nigeria for always supporting me.”\n\nAntetokounmpo's speech reached its emotional crescendo when he began talking about his family.\n\nThe Antetokounmpo family came from nothing, settling in the Sepolia neighborhood of Athens after parents Charles and Veronica immigrated from Nigeria. Giannis shared sneakers with his older brother Thanasis and often slept in the local gym where he trained. Giannis and Thanasis sold sunglasses and trinkets to help put food on the table, supplementing the earnings of Charles and Veronica, who supplied plenty in love what they didn't have in money.\n\nGiannis tearfully expressed his love for his brothers, but was even more poignant when discussing his father, who surprisingly passed away on Sept. 29, 2017, following a heart attack at the age of 53.\n\n\"Two years ago I had the goal in my head that I’m going to be the best player in the league, I’m going to do whatever it takes to help my team win and I’m going to win the MVP,\" he said.\n\n\"Every day that I step on the floor I always think about my dad and that motivates me and it pushes me to play harder and move forward. Even when my body’s sore, even when I don’t feel like playing I’m always going to show up and I’m always going to do the right thing.”\n\nHis mother, Veronica, stood proudly at a table close to the stage as she listened to her son call her his hero.\n\n“I want to thank my amazing mom,\" he said. \"She’s my hero. ... As a little kid, you don’t see the future right? If you have a good parent, your parent sees the future for you. She always saw the future in us, she always believed in us, she was always there for us. She’s the foundation of this family. You’re my true hero. You’re my true hero.”\n\nAntetokounmpo etched his name in the history books as the Bucks' first MVP since 1974 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar – a three-time MVP in Milwaukee – took home the award. During the NBA Awards show, it was Abdul-Jabbar who introduced Antetokounmpo as an MVP finalist. Antetokounmpo also joined Hakeem Olajuwon (Nigeria), Tim Duncan (U.S. Virgin Islands), Steve Nash (Canada) and Dirk Nowitzki (Germany) as the only international MVPs.\n\nThe storybook rise from the streets of Sepolia didn't happen overnight. Rather, the transition came the way Antetokounmpo runs the court, with long stride after long stride that make onlookers question what they're seeing.\n\nThe foundation of every step, though, was clear. Antetokounmpo has spent his whole career – if not his whole life – working hard and pushing himself to the limit.\n\nIn his first year, Antetokounmpo arrived in the United States, in Milwaukee, for the first time as an 18-year-old away from his family for the first time. He was lonely and dealing with a tremendously difficult transition.\n\nYet, he didn't let that detract from his mission at hand to establish himself as an NBA player. On many occasions, then-coach Larry Drew would get to the Cousins Center early to get in a workout by himself only for Antetokounmpo to come sauntering into the building before anyone else, hungry to develop his body and skills.\n\nIn that first season, Antetokounmpo grew two inches and got stronger, beginning his development from a string bean to one of the league's most relentless forces. He's now nearly 50 pounds heavier, chiseled with muscle and a high-flying, highlight machine.\n\n“I see things on a nightly basis where it’s just, wow,\" Bucks teammate Brook Lopez said. \"Each and every game he does something that amazes me, that I’ve never other players do or can’t even think of another player that could do that.\n\nDriven by his desire to improve, Antetokounmpo continued to earn more opportunities, each time demonstrating that the Bucks needed to continue to focus their rebuild around him. Over time he developed into a do-it-all superstar, earning three straight all-star berths, including the captaincy of his own all-star team in February.\n\nThis season, he was unanimously named all-NBA first team after carrying the Bucks back into the conversation among the NBA's elite teams for the first time in decades.\n\n\"I want to thank the front office, the ownership for believing me when I was 18 years old back in Greece,\" Antetokounmpo said in his acceptance speech, repeating the line twice as he fought back tears. \"They allowed me to lead this team and trust me.\"\n\nWhile Harden, the defending MVP, put up incredible offensive numbers with 36.1 points per game with stellar efficiency this season, Antetokounmpo was astounding in his own right in earning the MVP with 78 of 101 first-place votes. He averaged 27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.5 blocks and 1.3 steals. His player efficiency rating was a league-best 30.9, buoyed by his 73.7% shooting inside the restricted area – the place on the court everyone knows he wants to go, though they can't stop him from getting there.\n\nAntetokounmpo, in Budenholzer's new system, became the focal point of Milwaukee's new-look offense and proved himself to be capable enough as a passer to find shooters and facilitate the Bucks' let-it-fly attack.\n\n“What’s made him so good this year – and it’s continued in this series – is his passing,\" Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens said during the playoffs. \"If all he did was lower his head and drive … you’d be able to sink in, help, take charges. You wouldn’t feel good in the morning, but you’d do it. But his passing is just really good.”\n\nAlong with his offensive gifts, Antetokounmpo also stood out at the other end. A first-team all-defensive selection, Antetokounmpo was the best defender on the NBA's best defensive unit. He was strong and agile enough to defend virtually every position and often roved along the back side, stepping in with perfect timing for dozens of blocks and steals along with countless contests with his massive outstretched arms.\n\nAntetokounmpo's hard work and impact all over the court is what made him the MVP this season. It's what helped him accomplish the challenge set out for him by Kobe Bryant in the summer of 2017. It's also what put him into the conversation with superstar LeBron James, who like Antetokounmpo, won his first MVP award during his sixth season at the age of 24 in 2008-'09.\n\n\"Coming into the league, I never saw myself as one of the best players in the league and being that LeBron type of player,\" Antetokounmpo told the Journal Sentinel in March. \"That’s the truth. I could say, ‘Yes, I always thought I could be like LeBron James or better or whatever,’ but that’s not the truth.\"\n\nAny further comparisons to James will now entail team success. The Bucks led the NBA with 60 regular-season wins, but they bowed out of the playoffs short of their ultimate goal with four straight losses to the Toronto Raptors after going up 2-0 in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nAntetokounmpo, firmly in the MVP conversation all season, has consistently balked at opportunities to talk about himself outside of that one on-court outburst against the Washington Wizards in which he proclaimed himself the MVP. Instead, he's always pointed to team success – particularly a championship -- as the only thing he cares about.\n\nEarning the league's MVP award is an incredible accomplishment, but the hard work won't end for Antetokounmpo now that he's won it. There's still more to do and more to accomplish.\n\nAntetokounmpo's father used to tell him to \"always want more but never be greedy.\" This kid from Sepolia who has spent his life working hard and honoring his family plans to heed those words in the pursuit of a championship.\n\n\"Definitely the journey hasn't ended yet,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"There are a lot of goals that I have set for myself and for the team also, and I'm a guy that whenever I set goals I try to accomplish them, no matter what.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I'm going to stay hungry. I have the guys that support me on a daily basis, and as long as they're there for me, I'm going to stay hungry and chase my dreams, and I'm always going to chase my goals because that's what my family wants me to do, and that's what people that know me want me to do.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/sport/michael-jordan-mvp-nba-trophy-intl-spt/index.html", "title": "Michael Jordan: The NBA has renamed its MVP trophy after the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBasketball great Michael Jordan can add another accolade to his mighty list of accomplishments – but this time, rather than receiving the trophy, he is the trophy, after the NBA unveiled the Chicago Bulls legend as the face of its latest Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.\n\nThe Michael Jordan Trophy, which will be awarded to the NBA’s regular season MVP, is one of six newly designed awards created to honor “the league pioneers who helped define the standards of excellence that these trophies represent,” the NBA said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nJordan won the MVP award five times during his career, which spanned 15 NBA seasons in total: 13 with the Chicago Bulls (1984/85 through 1992/93 then 1994/95 through 1997/98) and two seasons with the Washington Wizards (2001/02 and 2002/03).\n\nWidely considered to be the best basketball player ever, Jordan played in 1,072 NBA games, racking up 32,292 regular season points, 6,672 rebounds, 5,633 assists and 2,514 steals.

They tossed the ball between themselves for a play in the fourth quarter. It was a game of hot potato as neither one dribbled between passes.\n\nOnce they finally got to the basket, the Denver Nuggets center tipped it off to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who hopped up for an easy basket. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nEast steamrolling West through three quarters\n\nWith the East crushing the West on 3-pointers and Damian Lillard and Tyrese Haliburton continuing to put up points, the East took a 160-136 lead after three quarters.\n\nLillard has a game-high 33 points, and Haliburton has 24 points – all on 3-pointers – and scoring help from Giannis Antetokounmpo (17 points), Jayson Tatum (20 points) and Jaylen Brown (23 points) has put the East in solid position headed into the fourth quarter. Lillard and Brown each had 11 points in the third.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver had hoped for a more competitive game, and the West has some to make up in the final 12 minutes to make that happen. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leads the West with 23 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns has 19. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nLuka Doncic stuffed by rim, Damian Lillard hits 3-pointer from half court\n\nLuka Doncic got stuffed by the rim on a dunk attempt. Damian Lillard got the ball and as he approached the center court logo, you could sense what he was about to do: launch a 3-point shot from half court.\n\nDame Time swished it, giving the East a 27-point third-quarter lead. It gave Lillard a game-high 33 points – and perhaps a slight edge in the NBA All-Star Kobe Bryant MVP award race.

On his home court and in front of Pacers fans at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Haliburton made the first five 3-pointers he attempted and gave the Eastern Conference All-Stars an early first-quarter lead over the Western Conference All-Stars.\n\nThe East ended the first quarter with a 53-47 lead.\n\nFor the second consecutive night at All-Star Weekend, 3-point shot was on display.

LeBron James, who is making his record 20th All-Star appearance, won all but one of the six games that were done playground draft style. He was a captain every time and returns as captain again. The West also won six of the past seven matchups before the game switched formats with Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis receiving two of the MVP awards. Both are back on the West roster this year alongside rising star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Finals MVP Nikola Jokic.\n\nThe winner of the Kobe Bryant MVP award will be Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. With a return to the East-West format and this season featuring the in-season tournament, it feels like a new era for the NBA. So it’s time for a new star to shine. The Oklahoma City Thunder guard is second in the league with an average of 31.1 points per game and he’s proven to be clutch. He will carry on the torch that former Thunder stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook ignited with four MVP titles between the two of them.\n\nTyrese Haliburton will have a double-double in front of his home crowd. The Indiana Pacers standout is an All-Star starter for the first time. He had 18 points in his first appearance as a reserve last season. Part of what’s made his game so electric this year is how he’s set multiple records with his assists. He steps up in the bright lights, like in the in-season tournament, and this will be another opportunity for him to show the country what he’s made of. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — As Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James prepared for his NBA record 20th All-Star Game, he acknowledged he is contemplating what the end of his playing career will look like and expressed a desire to finish it with the Lakers.\n\n“I have not mapped out how many seasons I have left.

But I know I'm a lucky dude.” — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nWho won the NBA 3-point contest?\n\nIt was Dame Time yet again in NBA All-Star 3-point contest.\n\nOne of the clutch players in the game, Milwaukee Bucks guard Damian Lillard needed to make the final shot of the event to edge Atlanta’s Trae Young and win his second consecutive 3-point contest. He also needed to make his final shot last year to win the event.\n\nLillard had 26 points in the final round, slipping past Young’s 24 points.\n\n\"When I got to the final rack, I didn't know my exact score, but when I missed a couple, I heard the crowd just oohing and aahing. Once they kept doing it over and over, I knew I was still alive because I knew they would have stopped if it had been over for me,\" Lillard said. \"The next two balls, I missed again, and then I grabbed the next one and I knew I needed that to win.\"\n\nIn the showcase 3-point contest between Stephen Curry and Sabrina Ionescu, the Golden State Warriors guard won, 29-26. — Jeff Zillgitt, Victoria Hernandez\n\nNBA All-Star Game rules, format\n\nThis year, it’s a return to the traditional East vs. West format instead of two captains picking teams.

(He was named one of the NBA's 75 all-time greatest players as part of the league's 75th Anniversary last year). Here’s what you need to know about the 34-year-old Durant's career path, which now brings him to the Phoenix Suns:\n\n2005-07: High school and college\n\nDurant grew up in Maryland, and was a McDonald’s All-American in high school, highly recruited out of Montrose Christian School his senior year in 2005-06. He committed to the University of Texas to play his college ball, though he was heavily recruited by more established powerhouse programs such as North Carolina, Kentucky, Connecticut, Duke and Louisville.\n\nDuring his freshmen season at Texas in 2006-07, Durant averaged 25 points a game and 11 rebounds, leading the Longhorns to a 25-10 record and NCAA tournament berth. Texas was knocked out in the second round, but Durant became the first freshman to win every major player of the year award, including the Naismith College Player of the Year Award and John R. Wooden Award. Not surprisingly, he declared for the NBA draft after his one year at Texas.\n\n2007: Trivia time\n\nHere are a couple of fun trivia questions involving Durant: He was picked second in the 2007 NBA draft. Who was first? (Answer: Greg Oden of Ohio State, who played in the NBA until 2014). Another: Which team drafted him? (Answer: The Seattle Supersonics, a team longtime Suns fans will remember well. He played his first season with Seattle before the franchise relocated to Oklahoma City for the 2008-09 season).\n\nAll things Suns: Latest Phoenix Suns news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n2008-16: Thunder road\n\nIt was in OKC that Durant blossomed into an NBA star, teaming with Russell Westbrook, and for a few seasons James Harden, to build the franchise into a contender. He helped lead the Thunder to the Western Conference Finals in 2011, where OKC lost to Dallas. Durant averaged 27 points a game that season. The following season, the Thunder defeated the Mavericks, Lakers and Spurs in the playoffs before losing in the NBA Finals to Miami. Durant averaged 28 points a game that year, and 30 points a game in the finals. In the 2013-14 season he averaged nearly 36 points a game and was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player.\n\n20016-19: Golden years\n\nAt the end of the 2015-16 season, the Thunder again made it to the NBA Western Conference finals, where they ran into the defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors coming off a 73-win regular season. The Thunder were on the verge of a major upset, going up 3-1 in the series before falling to the Warriors. After that, Durant was ready to move on and, in an era where building NBA ‘’super-teams’’ was becoming common, he announced after the season he was leaving Oklahoma City to sign with the Warriors, a move that drew widespread criticism.\n\nFor Durant and the Warriors, the move paid off big-time. Durant quickly meshed with established stars Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. The Warriors returned to the NBA finals in 2017 and again in 2018, winning both times. And both times, Durant was named finals MVP. The following season, the Warriors returned to the finals, but the injury bug surfaced for Durant. He suffered a strained calf in the semifinal playoffs. He returned during the finals against Toronto, which the Raptors won, but suffered an Achilles tendon injury.\n\n2019-23: Brooklyn bound\n\nDuring the 2019 off-season, Durant went to Brooklyn in a sign-and-trade deal, but it would be more than a year before fans saw him play in a Nets uniform, as he opted to sit out the 2019-20 season recovering from his injury. He finally returned to the court in December 2020, during the Covid-shortened NBA season. During his time with Brooklyn, the Nets never made it to the NBA finals, even when Durant was paired alongside Kyrie Irving and for one season, James Harden. The closest they came was in 2021, losing Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals in overtime to the Milwaukee Bucks. Durant scored 48 points in the loss. The Bucks went on to defeat the Suns in the NBA Finals.\n\n2023-?: By the time he got to Phoenix\n\nSpeculation ran high last summer that Durant, who had signed a four-year, $198 million extension with Brooklyn last year, could end up with the Suns, after word leaked out that he was itching to leave Brooklyn and Phoenix was a preferred destination. Previous connections with Monty Williams while playing for USA Basketball and when Williams was an assistant coach at Oklahoma City were factors. Plus, he got to know Suns' All-Star Devin Booker during the Olympics and had long admiired Booker's play. It didn't hurt that the Suns had just come off an NBA- and franchise-best 64-win season. Why not join a contender?\n\nThat talk eventually died down, but things changed over the past week as the Feb. 9 NBA trade deadline approached: Brooklyn dealt Irving to the Mavericks. And the NBA gave final approval to Mat Ishbia's purchase of the Suns. Ishbia wasted no time giving the green light to the Durant deal, sending popular players Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson to Brooklyn along with Jae Crowder, who has sat out all season, and four draft picks (Brooklyn later sent Crowder to Milwaukee). The Suns get Durant and T.J. Warren, who spent five years previously in Phoenix. Durant last month suffered a knee sprain and has been sitting out, but he's expected to return after the NBA All-Star game.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/09"}]}

The court ruled the short-term rental ordinance violates state statute by requiring owners to register with the city to rent their properties.\n\nThe city of Wilmington decided not to appeal the decision to the state's Supreme Court.\n\nThe April ruling made waves in Wilmington and beyond.\n\nHere in the Port City, while it is unclear exactly how many short-term rentals operate, some owners of this type of real estate have reported seeing online a rise in the number of such units this summer.\n\nAdditionally across the state, the ruling forced other major municipalities like Asheville to review and adjust their own rental regulations. The debate over short-term rentals has raged nationwide over the past decade since the launch of online home rental platform like Airbnb and Vrbo.\n\nThe appeals court's opinion partly affirmed a 2019 decision from a New Hanover County judge. But, instead of striking down the entire rental ordinance as the New Hanover judge did, the appeals court ruled parts of the ordinance not tied to permitting or registration can remain in place.\n\nThe amended ordinance, which was adopted at the city council's August 2 meeting, eliminated yearly registration requirements, removed a clause requiring 400 feet of separation between short-term rentals, and got rid of a limit that capped short-term rentals at 2% of the residential lots inside the city's 1945 corporate limits and 2% outside of the limits.\n\nMore:How occupancy tax is supporting tourism in New Hanover County\n\nMore:Wilmington not to appeal ruling for short-term rentals registration\n\nMore:Court ruling: Wilmington can't force owners to register vacation rentals\n\nThe separation and cap requirements meant rental operators needed to register their properties with a system created by the city, which gave out the registrations by lottery.\n\nThe ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by David and Peg Schroeder, a couple who operated a short-term rental in a townhome they owned in Wilmington when the ordinance was approved in January 2019. They tried to register their property but ended up losing out because another property within 400 feet drew a lower number.\n\nThey appealed to the Wilmington Board of Adjustment, which upheld their registration denial. They then filed a lawsuit in New Hanover County in October 2019.\n\nThat court struck down the ordinance in its entirety but dismissed the Schroeder's constitutional claims. The city of Wilmington then appealed the ruling to the state court of appeals, as did the Schroeders.\n\nWhile the court of appeals ruling prohibits registration requirements for short-term rentals, the possibility of regulating rentals through the city's zoning and land use regulation remains, according to Adam Lovelady, an associate professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's School of Government.\n\nLovelady authored a blog post in the wake of the appeals court ruling that breaks down its impact on short-term rental regulations for local governments. As long as registration and permitting isn't required, cities have the ability to impose some other types of regulations, Lovelady writes.\n\nWilmington, for example, can keep parts of a rental ordinance that requires owners to provide at least one parking space for every bedroom, to post emergency numbers and other information inside the rental unit, to prohibit cooking in bedrooms and restrict whole-house lodging in certain zoning districts.\n\nThere is room for refining the basics of the ordinance, city attorney John Joye told the Wilmington City Council before its vote to amend the rental rules, but first he suggested the city come into compliance with the court ruling.\n\n\"This doesn't necessarily end the inquiry,\" he said. \"We can roll up our sleeves and look at it.\"\n\nJoye noted that gathering the data needed to support new regulations in certain districts would take time and said there's potential for the state legislature to take up the issue during their next session.\n\nAhead of the council's vote, several residents with homes in Wilmington's downtown historic district asked city leaders to explore restrictions for short-term rentals in residential neighborhoods.\n\nJoe Pawlik has lived in the historic district near the corner of 2nd and Ann Streets for 32 years and has been a advocate for short-term rental restrictions in Wilmington.\n\nAs short-term rentals gained traction in Wilmington in the mid-2010s, a home near Pawlik's was converted into a short-term rental, which meant more noise and trash in the neighborhood on the weekends and an largely empty home during the week. When the rental restrictions went into effect in 2019, Pawlik said he noticed a marked improvement.\n\nAhead of the council's vote, Pawlik sent a letter to each member of the city council, encouraging them to vote down the amendments and instead ask city staff to follow the city of Asheville in banning whole-house rentals -- something he said he's been pushing for all along.\n\n“We told them at that time, ‘Use Asheville’s regulations. They're tried and true.’ But the city decided to pursue its own compromise measure, which is what got them into trouble,” he said.\n\nAlthough the city has options for regulating rentals, Pawlik doesn't see much urgency behind the push to update regulations.\n\n“When they did deal with the issue, it was because city council chambers were full of people that were furious about short term rentals in their neighborhood,\" he said. \"And we don't currently have that, and we probably won't have that for a while.”\n\nIt's unclear just how many short-term rentals operate in the Wilmington area, but in July city zoning administrator Kathryn Thurston told the Wilmington Planning Commission the city recorded 772 rental units earlier this year.\n\nJordan Giovannucci and her husband Christopher Russell operate three short-term rentals through Airbnb. One is attached to their home and located outside of city limits. The two other units are located in a house near downtown.\n\nThe two began hosting through Airbnb in 2019 after the rental restrictions and lottery had taken effect. The regulations, especially the 400-foot separation requirement, complicated their hunt for a home to house their downtown rentals.\n\n“It was a crazy scenario,\" Giovannucci said. \"It made everything kind of difficult when we were looking for that second house.”\n\nThe two started hosting through Airbnb as a way to pay for the mortgage on their first house, and Giovannucci said starting a short-term rental is like opening a small business in a neighborhood.\n\nSince the rental regulations were lifted, Giovannucci said she's seen an uptick in the number of short-term rentals that are coming online. She typically monitors short-term rental sites closely and said she's seen new rentals popping up downtown and outside city limits in areas like Kings Grant and Murrayville.\n\n“It's definitely growing a lot faster than it did with the restrictions in place,” she said.\n\nReporter Emma Dill can be reached at 910-343-2096 or edill@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/02/21/airbnb-vrbo-laws-will-likely-bring-legal-battle-county-attorney-says/72657891007/", "title": "Airbnb, Vrbo laws could bring legal battle, county attorney and rental ...", "text": "ASHEVILLE - The Feb. 19 Buncombe County Planning Board meeting on possible forthcoming short-term vacation rental regulations aimed to hash-out the specific legal language for the ordinance, which could ban the practice in parts of the county.\n\nHowever, the meeting also led to a conversation about the county possibly facing legal trouble if they pass regulatory measures.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/09/20/short-term-rental-restrictions-cost-wilmington-taxpayers/69499285007/", "title": "Short-term rental restrictions cost Wilmington taxpayers $500,000", "text": "A lawsuit brought against the City of Wilmington two years ago came to an end last week a judge for the New Hanover County Superior Court ordered the city to pay the plaintiffs’ legal fees.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought forward by Dave and Peg Schroeder, questioned short-term rental regulations put in place by the city several years ago. The judge ordered the city pay more than $300,000 to the Schroeders, and signed off on a final judgement to close the issue.\n\nThis comes months after a state Court of Appeals deemed the city’s registration requirements for short-term rentals to be out of compliance with state laws. The city enacted the ordinance that regulated short-term rental units through a registration process in January 2019.\n\nMany Wilmington residents supported more restrictions on short-term rental units, the StarNews reported, because they created issues like noise and trash in neighborhoods on the weekends, while many homes stood empty during the week. But individuals operating the rental units took a financial hit because of the restrictions\n\nThe Schroeders operated a short-term rental unit in a Wilmington townhome, and their registration in 2019 was denied because there was another short-term rental unit within 400 feet of their property.\n\nThe couple filed a lawsuit in New Hanover County in October 2019.\n\nPast coverage:Debate continues over Wilmington's new short-term rental rules as market evolves\n\nCourt ruling:Wilmington can't force owners to register vacation rentals\n\nRestrictions end: Wilmington not to appeal ruling for short-term rentals registration\n\nNearly three years later, in April of this year, the North Carolina Court of Appeals ordered the city to cease its registration requirement and other provisions related to it. Soon after, the Wilmington City Council amended its ordinance to be in compliance with state law, ultimately eliminating its registration requirement. This included removing the required 400-foot separation between rental units and the capping of short-term units to 2% of residential lots within the city’s corporate limits and 2% outside those limits.\n\nSome provisions do still remain in the ordinance, including parking and insurance requirements, bedroom maximums, ground floor restrictions in certain areas, local manager requirements and nuisance-related requirements.\n\nShort-term rentals gained popularity in Wilmington in the mid-2010s and have continued to grow in the Port City as rental apps like Vrbo and Airbnb see widescale use.\n\nAccording to a news release, the city issued refunds to individuals who registered their units or made other payments because of the city’s short-term lodging program, including 6% interest and credit card fees. It also refunded citations to anyone who failed to register.\n\nUltimately, the ordinance, which was out of line with state law, cost the city more than $500,000 in taxpayer dollars.\n\nContact reporter Sydney Hoover at shoover@gannett.com or on Twitter @sydneymhoover.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/05/02/wilmington-wont-appeal-short-term-rental-ruling-nc-court/9613823002/", "title": "Wilmington won't appeal short-term rental ruling by N.C. court", "text": "Wilmington has decided not to appeal a ruling that struck down key parts of the city's rental ordinance last month.\n\nNot appealing means the city will abide by a unanimous decision from the N.C.

Court of Appeals ruling\n\nThe April ruling centers around an ordinance the Wilmington City Council approved in February 2019 in an effort to limit the impact of short-term rentals on the city's neighborhoods and housing market, some city leaders and residents said at the time.\n\nSupporters of the ordinance expressed concerns that rentals could disrupt residential neighborhoods by bringing in new people and potentially reducing housing options for permanent city residents.\n\nPrevious coverage:Court ruling: Wilmington can't force owners to register vacation rentals\n\nHot city for renters:They keep coming: Wilmington now among top 20 hottest U.S. cities for renters\n\nThe debate over short-term rentals has raged over the past decade since the launch of the Airbnb online home rental platform.\n\nAs of April 1, New Hanover County was home to more than 1,800 short-term rentals with an occupancy rate of 47%, according to AllTheRooms, a company that provides short-term rental data and analytics.\n\nThe ordinance passed in Wilmington required at least 400 feet of separation between short-term rentals. It also capped the percentage of short-term rentals at 2% of the residential lots inside the city's 1945 corporate limits and 2% outside of the limits.\n\nThe separation and cap requirements meant rental operators needed to register their properties with a registration system created by the city, which gave out the registrations by lottery.\n\nIn North Carolina, state statute prohibits local governments from requiring \"permits and permissions to lease or rent\" and \"registrations of rental properties.\"\n\nTrying to register a property\n\nDavid and Peg Schroeder operated a short-term rental in a townhome they owned in Wilmington when the ordinance was approved in January 2019. They tried to register their property but ended up losing out because another property within 400 feet drew a lower number.\n\nThey appealed to the Wilmington Board of Adjustment, which upheld their registration denial. They then filed a lawsuit in New Hanover County in October 2019.\n\nThat court struck down the ordinance in its entirety but dismissed the Schroeder's constitutional claims.

An amended ordinance is expected to come before the Wilmington Planning Commission in June and will be considered by the city council in July.\n\nWilmington is also working to refund the registration fees paid by rental owners. Since the ordinance was put in place, the city collected $443,428 in registration fees. That money along with $10,189 in related processing fees and $57,867 in accrued interest, which Wilmington calculated at a rate of 6%, will be paid back to rental owners.\n\nIn all, the city is set to pay $511,484 to rental owners from its general fund. The Wilmington City Council will consider an ordinance appropriating money for the refunds at their Tuesday meeting.\n\nReporter Emma Dill can be reached at 910-343-2096 or edill@gannett.com.\n\nStatewide reporter Brian Gordon contributed to this story.

Instead, Trotman said, municipalities could use “good old fashioned” zoning to regulate short-term rentals.\n\nShe gave a few options for regulations, including regulating by zoning district and putting in place occupancy limits.\n\nChip Craig, owner of Greybeard Realty, also gave a presentation to give some more concrete numbers behind short-term rentals in Buncombe County and Black Mountain in particular.\n\nHe said less than 3% of total housing units in the county are short-term rentals.\n\nUsing AirDNA, a company that calls itself “the world’s most trusted resource for vacation rental research,” Craig said he was able to pull data for the 28711 zip code, which includes Black Mountain.

Still, Craig said doing away with or over-regulating short-term rentals would have a negative impact on the economy.\n\n“I highly encourage you to look at the economic impact on Black Mountain because we have very few hotels,” Craig said. “Most of our overnight stays are going to be in short-term rentals and it will, in my opinion, have a devastating effect on the economy.”\n\nTrotman said the Buncombe County TDA reports 2.2 million people visiting the town each year. She also said Black Mountain has 334 hotel rooms and 35 rooms at bed and breakfast hotels. A new boutique hotel is currently under construction that will add six rooms. There is no data indicating the exact number of short-term rentals in town limits.\n\nMayor Michael Sobol said he does not believe that regulating short-term rentals will have a large negative economic impact on the town. He said he has lived in the town nearly all of his life, and he has seen the town change.\n\n“Short-term rentals have changed Black Mountain,” Sobol said. “There needs to be some regulations and some guardrails put on this thing.”\n\nCouncil member Bill Christy agreed the town has changed, but said he would not attribute the change to short-term rentals. Council members Pam King and Doug Hay, as well as Vice Mayor Archie Pertiller agreed with Christy.\n\n“I have difficulty putting regulations on how an individual can operate his own property,” Pertiller said. “I’m stuck there.”\n\nPertiller said the council should be careful with what they do, if anything, and that more investigation needs to be done.\n\nMore:Ideas for remaining Black Mountain ARPA funds: firetruck, parks, Tomahawk, garbage toters\n\nCouncil member Alice Berry said she is concerned with the larger housing market.

Berry said she would like to look more at affordable housing and how it interacts with short-term rentals.\n\nHay said he has a short-term rental on his property and will thus participate in discussion surrounding the topic but will not vote on any topic relating to short-term rentals.\n\nWhen asked for specifics on what town staff should prepare to bring to council to vote on, the council agreed to hear draft language.\n\n“A new regulation should be proportionate to the problem and it’s easier to start small than go really far and try to reel it in,” Trotman said. “That’s a dangerous place to be in.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/30"}]}

John Carney's emergency order, Point-to-Point was officially scrapped.\n\nTicketholders were offered a full refund and the ability to carry their tickets over to next year or donate the cost to Winterthur.\n\nWhile Winterthur will lose the proceeds from the event, that's not the biggest hit it will take when it comes to the cancellation, Nardone said.\n\n\"The important thing about Point-to-Point is the awareness it raises for the institution — the good times it provides,\" he said. \"It's a big part of the spring traditions in the area, so culturally it's more important than the money.\"\n\nOpinion:Our doors are shut, but you can help the arts weather the coronavirus crisis\n\nIf Point-to-Point were happening this weekend, visitors would notice a few changes.\n\nIn the offseason, five new track crossings were built following last year's rainy event, which went ahead with the tailgating, but canceled the races due to the conditions. A new traffic pattern was also to be in place, which would have allowed the races to continue if bad weather struck.\n\nTicket buyers also noticed something new when they purchased their tickets: an updated online sales platform that allows buyers to manage their own RSVP lists.\n\n\"We were ready, but now the focus is on welcoming visitors back safely to Winterthur,\" said Abbott, also senior events planner for Winterthur.\n\nHowever, one little slice of Point-to-Point still occurred in 2020.\n\nIrénée du Pont II, the oldest son of former DuPont president Irénée du Pont I, drove to see Abbott with his check for his tailgate spot earlier this month, just like he does every year when tickets first go on sale.\n\nKnowing he had turned 100 years old in January, Abbott was prepared for his annual visit.\n\nShe bought party glasses with \"100\" on them along with a cake and a hat that read, \"100 never looked so good\" for the longtime Winterthur supporter and lifetime-rights owner. A planned birthday surprise for him at his tailgate this weekend will not happen, however.\n\n\"He's such an incredible sport, he put it all on,\" she said. \"I just wanted to honor and recognize him.\"\n\nWhile du Pont will be home this weekend, work will start on planning next year's hopeful return.\n\nOne of the biggest questions remaining about Point-to-Point's first-ever cancellation is how it will affect next year's event, which is scheduled for May 2, 2021.\n\nWill they call it the 42nd annual Point-to-Point or the 43rd?\n\n\"That's a really good question,\" Nardone said with Abbott adding, \"We're going to have to talk about that.\"\n\nAnd if you want to have your own little Point-to-Point celebration this weekend, discounted merchandise is on sale at winterthurstore.com/category/289/Point-to-Point.html.\n\nGot a tip?

Welcome to 2017, Point-to-Point.\n\nAfter last year's introduction of a smartphone app and the event's first online ticket sales, this spring has seen the debut of a new intuitive online ticketing system that utilizes drone footage of Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library.\n\nFor the first time, users can go online and pull up an aerial photo of the Point-to-Point grounds. Customers can zoom in, skip over the tailgate spots colored in red that have been purchased and choose from the still-available green spots.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nThe process is now similar to buying a concert ticket or a reserved seat at a movie theater.\n\n\"It was a great time-saver. I had my glass of wine, my husband and I sat down at the computer and we found our spot. It was so easy,\" says longtime Point-to-Point attendee Greenberg. \"I didn't have to run up to Del. 52 to get my tickets. And less than a week later, they came in the mail.\"\n\nThe new system is available on both Point-to-Point's desktop site, as well as the upgraded app, which is also packed with features like the race schedule, a photo contest and, most importantly for some, a car finder that allows revelers to find their ride after a day under the sun.\n\nJill Abbott, senior events planner at Winterthur and Point-to-Point race director, says the improvements have already transformed how customers buy their tickets. And even though the technology has been around for years, it's cutting edge in the steeplechase world: Abbott says Point-to-Point is the only National Steeplechase Association-sanctioned race using a pick-your-spot system.\n\n\"I gave a presentation at our annual race directors meeting about this because nobody else is doing it. Hopefully, other races will jump on board, no pun intended,\" Abbott says. \"We just got to the point where we found the right vendor and it's already invaluable.\"\n\nWith partly sunny skies and temperatures reaching into the mid 60s, this year's edition won't quite match the perfect weather of last year with a high of 70 and sunny skies dotted with white clouds.\n\nEven so, the expected crowd of 16,000 will still be dressed to impress, hovering over ornate tailgate food spreads, placing friendly wagers on horse races and bumping into long-lost friends with cocktails in hand.\n\nWhile those traditions stand strong, the ticketing system isn't the only new addition for the 39th annual steeplechase and tailgate. Here are a few more:\n\n-- The Dogfish Head hospitality tent is gone after a five-year run, replaced by a new private tent co-sponsored by Wilmington restaurant Kid Shelleen's Charcoal House & Saloon and Tito's Handmade Vodka. The loss of Dogfish didn't seem to hurt sales. Demand was so high that all the $100 tickets for the Kid Shelleen's and Tito's Outpost on the rail sold out in less than a month. If you have a ticket, expect a Texas Hill Country barbecue theme with gourmet tacos, along with Tito's American Mules and Bloody Marys.\n\n-- Following the April 2016 death of George \"Frolic\" Weymouth, who traditionally led Point-to-Point's carriage parade, the race honored him with a tribute last year. This year, he'll receive another posthumous honor. The carriage parade that he loved so dearly will be re-named the George A. \"Frolic\" Weymouth Antique Carriage Parade. \"We have probably 30 coaches coming this year, so all the people who have participated in the past are coming in his honor,\" Abbott says.\n\n-- After last year's pair of competing Point-to-Point after-parties in Wilmington (Montana Wildaxe at the Queen Theater and Santa Fe Mexican Grill's outdoor party), the longtime tradition of after-parties seemed to be alive and well. But with the Queen dark this Sunday and Santa Fe currently being demolished at Galleria Shoppes on Pennsylvania Avenue as part of a redevelopment project, both spots are out this year. Seeing an opening, 8th and Union Kitchen (801 N. Union St.) has announced their own after-party. Starting at 3:30 p.m., Wilmington reggae trio Spokey Speaky will perform as bartenders sling everyday specials like $2.50 Bud Lights, $2.50 Yuenglings and $3.50 Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum drinks. \"It looked like there was nothing else going on and we thought it was kind of crazy that no one else was doing anything,\" says Brian Ashby, 8th & Union's owner.\n\n-- If you roam the grounds, you'll notice a lot more corporate tents this year. Last year's Point-to-Point had three corporate tents and there are seven this year. This year's tents range from St. Francis Healthcare and Capital One to the University & Whist Club and Marriott.\n\nEven with the changes, tradition will continue to rule. It's what keeps attendees like Wilmington's Elise Martin coming back year after year since the late '90s.\n\nIn her first years at Point-to-Point, her children were crawling in the grass. These days, they still come, but they \"do their own thing with their friends.\"\n\n\"It's fun because you have your group and you know you'll see certain other people there, but then there are also a lot of people you run into that you haven't seen in a long time,\" says Martin, whose tailgate is expected to be 20 people strong this year.\n\nWhile there is plenty of attention focused on Sunday's 39th annual event, planning is already underway for Point-to-Point to turn the big 4-0 next spring.\n\nWinterthur tends to go all out for big Point-to-Point anniversaries, holding a gala in Winterthur's Sundial Garden for its 20th in 1998 or hosting a record-breaking carriage parade in 2008.\n\nFor now, Abbott is mum on plans for 2018.\n\n\"I wish I could tell you. Just know that I've been working hard already,\" she says. \"There are a lot of things we're looking at for the 40th.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Over the last two decades, the race director has discovered multiple generations of families attend this racing event, which attracts some guests from as far away as the West Coast.\n\nCreating memories with friends and family has a new meaning now because of the pandemic. And Point-to-Point is a venue that allows fresh memories to be made.\n\n“Over my 23 years I can't tell you how many personal stories have been shared with me about someone meeting their significant other, buying their kids their first sundress and hat, having either kid take their first pony ride, and having multigenerational tailgates,” Abbott said.\n\nNot to mention, a number of engagements and weddings have happened at Point-to-Point, too. “I mean, that's one of the beauties of this event,” Abbott said.\n\nPoint-to-Point this year will focus on the National Steeplechase Association-sanctioned racing action.

Cadou, employees were told their jobs were being eliminated because Winterthur's operations have been \"heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nCadou said in the letter that Delaware Gov. John Carney's \"stay-at-home order and the economic climate have impacted our revenue, endowment, membership, and donations.\"\n\n\"As part of our response to those developments, we have made the difficult decision to eliminate positions within the organization,\" she wrote.\n\nDocuments obtained by The News Journal that list the jobs and the ages of employees eliminated show 27 positions were cut.\n\nJob losses came from Winterthur's museum engagement, facilities services and visitor engagement divisions as well as its public safety department. All were regular, non-seasonal and non-temporary employees, documents show.\n\nThe workforce reduction includes the 69-year-old director of public safety as well as 15 public safety officers and two public safety supervisors, employees whose ages range from 35 to 82, according to the documents.\n\nAccording to documents, other Winterthur employees let go included a 70-year-old specialist in art handling; a 44-year-old facilities assistant director; a 67-year-old interior designer; a 62-year-old associate director of events; and a 57-year-old supervisor of visitor services.\n\nWinterthur's human resources department said that three positions were eliminated due to a change in operations at the museum. Seven people in the public safety department elected to retire, the museum said, and 11 others in public safety who were laid off due to reorganization \"will be encouraged to apply for positions in the newly structured department within eight weeks.\"\n\nSix layoffs also came in retail due to the closure of the museum stores. But museum officials said, \"when we are fully operational and the COVID-19 crisis has passed, we will be posting open positions and any of these employees will be encouraged to apply.\"\n\nCadou also has taken a salary cut, the museum said, but it did not say how much.\n\nWinterthur Museum, Garden & Library off Kennett Pike between Greenville and Centreville is centered around a grand 175-room mansion on a 1,000-acre estate in “Chateau Country,” Delaware’s most exclusive region and for generations the home of extended members of the du Pont family.\n\nIn June, Winterthur had 334 employees. It also is supported by 350 volunteers who serve for free in many departments, supporting paid staff.\n\nThe museum postponed all public events, programs and tours and closed all of its buildings on March 13 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLike other tourist attractions in Delaware, Winterthur has counted on visits by day-trippers, bus tours and other sight-seers. Since the coronavirus, sales revenue from its cafe and museum gift shops and income from space rental has dried up.\n\nCadou said attendance is down 60 percent from this time last year and the cost of tickets has been decreased by 25 percent because of capacity restrictions.\n\n\"A double whammy,\" she said.\n\nThe museum also had to cancel 130 programs, large scale events and more than four months of summer wedding receptions. Cadou said the museum usually hosts two or three weddings each weekend in the summer.\n\nCOVID-19 has caused financial pressures for museums across the nation. The American Alliance of Museums has estimated museums are losing at least $33 million a day due to closures.\n\nMuseums of all sizes are experiencing closures, attendance free-fall, canceled events, and layoffs, the organization said.\n\nCadou said COVID-19 has had an \"absolute devastating effect\" on Delaware's arts and culture industry that contributes $1 billion to Delaware’s economy. \"The arts are in dire shape,\" she said.\n\nSpring and summer are usually the most lucrative seasons for the arts and culture industry and Delaware groups are now projecting $13.9 million in losses through August, according to a June report from the Delaware Arts Alliance.\n\n\"More than half of Delaware arts organizations are risking closing their doors permanently,\" Cadou said.\n\nHowever, Winterthur is not one of them.\n\n\"Fortunately, we are not going to close our doors,\" said Cadou adding she plans to move forward with an operating model that will allow Winterthur to continue for future generations.\n\nShe said there are no plans to sell any Winterthur property or objects in the collection.\n\n\"No, absolutely not. First, we don't need to. Second of all, it's not in concert with our mission.\"\n\nCadou said when Winterthur was closed from March 13 until July 1 it was \"operating with a skeleton crew\" with most employees working virtually.\n\nCapacity at the museum remains restricted and few shuttle buses are operating. With less visitors expected and no large events on the horizon, new business models for staffing were needed for such areas as retail and security, Cadou said.\n\nIn late June, some Winterthur employees were told during video conference meetings with a director and human resources personnel they would be losing their jobs.\n\nWhen Winterthur reopened to the public, with restrictions, on July 1, employees received an emailed letter from Winterthur director Cadou reiterating their jobs were being eliminated.\n\nCadou has been director and CEO of Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library since 2018. She was the former Senior Vice President of Historic Preservation and Collections at George Washington’s Mount Vernon, 13 miles south of Washington, D.C.\n\nCadou succeeded David P. Roselle, who retired after 10 years as executive director, the longest term of any Winterthur chief executive.\n\nPreviously, Roselle served as the 25th president of the University of Delaware from 1990 until retiring in 2007.\n\nIn April 2018, Winterthur announced it had surpassed its goal to raise $50 million, 18 months ahead of schedule. The campaign resulted in the addition of more than $26 million to Winterthur’s endowment, $8 million in gifts-in-kind and pledges, and more than $15 million in bequests.\n\nWinterthur’s endowment decreased by approximately $30 million in March due to the market response to the COVID-19 pandemic, museum officials said.\n\nWinterthur, off bucolic Delaware Route 52, was the country estate of Henry Francis du Pont, a horticulturist who also was known for his collection of nearly 90,000 decorative arts, including furniture, textiles, paintings and ceramics.\n\nDu Pont opened the estate as a public museum in 1951. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy to ask him to head her renovation of the White House in 1961. Du Pont died in 1969.\n\nWinterthur is well-known for hosting its annual Point-to-Point steeplechase races, a museum fundraiser since 1979 that is held on its rolling meadows in early May.\n\nThe races, which attract thousands of visitors who pay admission ranging from $25 to $40, were canceled this year due to the coronavirus.\n\nWinterthur, in recent years, has been trying to reach a broader audience, Cadou said.\n\nFrom March 2014 to Jan. 4, 2015, the museum more than doubled its usual annual ticket sales when more than 200,000 visitors walked through an exhibition of the \"Costumes of Downton Abbey,\" featuring designs from the award-winning PBS TV series.\n\nMore excitement surrounded Winterthur last June when the Emmy-nominated PBS TV series \"Antiques Roadshow\" filmed three episodes on site. More than 17,000 people entered a lottery to obtain tickets to the show. Episodes aired this past January.\n\nWinterthur also worked to drum up visitors by banking on the popularity of another pop culture TV show. It displayed 40 costumes from the Netflix series, \"The Crown,\" that is based on the life of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe exhibition ran from March 2019 until Jan. 5 with about approximately 120,000 visitors coming to see the regal displays.\n\nWhile Winterthur can usually accommodate up to 60 people every 30 minutes for guided tours and up to 75 per half hour during its popular Yuletide at Winterthur, the museum has had to reduce capacity due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe garden and first-floor galleries are opened to visitors, but restrictions are currently in effect.\n\nReservations are required for visitors who must wear face masks in all indoor areas, on trams tours, and on guided walks. A general admission ticket for adults is now $20.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/21/winterthur-director-behind-downton-abbey-exhibition-leaving-museum/5200672001/", "title": "Winterthur director behind 'Downton Abbey' exhibition leaving ...", "text": "J.

Created by former Wicomico County State’s Attorney and current Circuit Court Judge Matt Maciarello, the group was formed to keep kids off the streets and introduce them to a new sport.\n\nEach Tuesday and Thursday from March to May, Maciarello and several law enforcement officials and community members would bring sticks, balls and lacrosse equipment to the park, hoping to garner some interest among the Doverdale youth.\n\nThe program had taken years to develop, but with support from elected officials, county employees and police officers, the judge’s dream finally became a reality.\n\n“The kids are really enjoying themselves, they’re learning through sport, and this is a valued lacrosse program,” Maciarello said. “We’re teaching them more than lacrosse — it’s all about leadership, it’s all about character, it’s all about ethics and it’s about family.”\n\nA year later, the Doverdale Hawks are back for their second season, bringing several new additions to the community-funded program.\n\nWith an increase in numbers and now girls trying their luck in lacrosse, the Doverdale Hawks have become Wicomico’s latest success story in the goal to show commitment toward youth sports.\n\n“It’s just continuing to grow,” said Barbara Duncan, Salisbury’s Police Chief. “It’s really inspiring, and it’s inspiring for kids knowing they have people who are out there rooting for them. When you’re able to instill a positive goal in a kid … you know they’re going to meet it.”\n\nBut the Doverdale Hawks’ success didn’t come overnight.\n\nWhen brainstorming ideas, Maciarello hoped the program would help cut down on youth crime in the area. Through school officials, the judge had been told behavioral problems spiked during the spring, due to the absence of popular sports like football and basketball.\n\nWith few kids having interest in baseball or other spring activities, March through June served as a period when many students ran with free reign.\n\nBut once the Doverdale Hawks were introduced to the youth, nearly 20 kids signed up in the first year, hoping to learn a new sport and skills that could help pass the time.\n\nGrowing tired of waiting on the basketball court, Saintil recruited some friends and opted to give Maciarello’s idea a chance.\n\n“I wanted to try new things,” Saintil said. “Lacrosse is similar to basketball. We learn teamwork and how to pass the ball.”\n\nREAD MORE:How lacrosse is uniting Doverdale youth, community leaders\n\nREAD MORE: Doverdale lacrosse, other youth sports programs honored at 1st Good Sports Awards\n\nIn the next several months, the Doverdale Hawks became a well-known group in the community, drawing recognition from several organizations.\n\nIn January, the program received the Community Impact Award at the first ever Good Sports Awards, an event designed to honor youth sports organizations throughout the county.\n\nAt the end of their season, Doverdale played against the Fruitland Falcons, while also taking field trips to watch the Salisbury University men’s lacrosse team in action.\n\nIt was a dream come true for Maciarello as he watched nearly two dozen athletes laugh and smile while learning the sport the judge grew up playing.\n\nWith the help of Duncan, Board of Education employee Mark Thompson, Wicomico County Recreation Superintendent Andy Kitzrow, County Executive Bob Culver, Salisbury Mayor Jake Day, Acting State’s Attorney Ella Disharoon and countless police officers and volunteers, the Doverdale Hawks were officially part of the community.\n\n“We feel the community behind us,” Maciarello said. “People are constantly coming by, donating equipment that we’re able to give to the kids for practice. Even older kids are behind us. They’ve said to me they wish there was something for them in this park when they were coming up.”\n\nComing back for Year 2, Maciarello and his team incorporated new aspects that have given the players more opportunities to enhance their game.\n\nFor the first time, girls were welcomed to join the Doverdale Hawks, with a solid group of four normally present at practices.\n\nWhile Maciarello and others coach the boys, Lindsay Tayman, a drug court coordinator for the Circuit Court in Wicomico County, works with the girls. The lacrosse enthusiast teaches the basics of the game, while also offering advice to the athletes.\n\n“I didn’t envision it to be as much as it is — I thought it’d be kind of like ‘The Sandlot,’ ” Tayman said. “It’s remarkable seeing the community partners come together and pull resources to make this opportunity available for the kids.”\n\nAnother addition has been multiple stations that give athletes the ability to work on their skills, depending on where they are in the learning process. Different drills include faceoffs, scooping, passing and bounce-pad catching.\n\nSince he can’t be everywhere at once, Maciarello has recruited help from nearby high schools, bringing in lacrosse players from Bennett, Parkside and other teams to act as assistant coaches.\n\nOne coach who knows Maciarello well is his son Jonathan, who is a defender for the Rams’ varsity squad. Knowing how hard it can be to master the sport, the Parkside junior said he does his best to encourage the players and guide them towards a future in lacrosse.\n\n“I really like seeing the kids happy,” Jonathan Maciarello said. “They really seem to enjoy the sport and want to stick with lacrosse. They seem to work harder when I tell them that if they stick with it, in the future they can be on a varsity lacrosse team. That seems to really motivate them.”\n\nBut it’s not always easy for the players who have made the transition to a lacrosse lifestyle.\n\nMORE SPORTS:Salisbury University women's lacrosse team hopes to end championship drought\n\nPractices take place just a few yards away from the basketball court Saintil and others were so accustomed to playing on for years. Giving up basketball for lacrosse, while also hanging around several law enforcement officials, sometimes make the Doverdale Hawks targets for scrutiny.\n\n“(The basketball) players say some things, but we don’t pay attention to them,” Saintil said. “We’re more focused on lacrosse than what those guys have to say.”\n\nMaciarello said the mouthing-off from players on the basketball court has gotten better in the past year. Last spring, the Salisbury Police Department put up new nets, hoping to end the divide between youth and law enforcement.\n\nWhile there are still some Doverdale youth that are not too keen on several officers inhabiting the area, the relationship between the two groups has continued to improve.\n\n“We want to make sure their time is spent in a healthy activity, like lacrosse, instead of all the other diversions that teens can find themselves in,” Maciarello said. “I can’t wait to see our first group go to high school and play lacrosse. Kids who never thought of the sport, but are now trying out for the team and playing competitively.”\n\nWith less than a month remaining in the Hawks’ season, Maciarello said he's excited by the progress that has been made in the second year and can’t wait to start preparing for 2019.\n\nAs more athletes join, the judge said he could see Doverdale competing more often against surrounding lacrosse squads, with the possibility of eventually transforming into a travel team.\n\nNo matter how much it grows, community officials agreed it will never take away from the program’s core mission — to teach youth athletes lacrosse while keeping them off the streets and away from trouble.\n\n“They’re so impressionable at this age, and watching them soak all this up … I think that’s one of the coolest things,” Tayman said. “We just encourage them to be on the right path, be around positive influences and things like that. To see these folks come together and recognize this is where we need to start in order to shape our future is huge.”\n\nAs for Saintil, he’s counting down the days until he can finally tryout for the Wicomico High School lacrosse team.\n\n“Most definitely I’m going to play,” he said. “I’m going to work on my stances, my throws and just try to be the best on the team.”\n\nMORE SPORTS:Trainer Cody Revel creates The Athlete Academy for Shore athletes\n\nMORE SPORTS:Sheriff's office mourns death of deputy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/04/26/how-avoid-online-vacation-rental-scams/553927002/", "title": "That cheap beach vacation rental on Craigslist could be a scam", "text": "Taylor Goebel\n\nThe (Salisbury, Md.) Daily Times\n\nThe rental listing looked like Rhiana Scholz's Ocean City, Maryland condo, with the same balcony overlooking blue ocean and promises of hot sun, boardwalk fries and lazy beach days.\n\nThe ad for Scholz's condo was posted on Craigslist.\n\nThe Baltimore woman doesn't use Craigslist to advertise.\n\n\"I was just furious,\" Scholz said of the rental scam that hit her in July 2016. \"My first thought was a family showing up for their vacation, excited, with all their luggage, and security telling them someone had already rented it.\"\n\nThat summer, a man wanting to take his granddaughter on a beach trip had seen Scholz's place on Craigslist for a suspiciously low weekly rate of $1,100, with a $300 security deposit.\n\n\"It was NOT available that week and my rate was $1,750 plus $200 deposit,\" Scholz wrote in an email.\n\nProperty owners like Scholz and unassuming vacationers get scammed every year. As technology advances throughout the world, online crime has expanded, allowing criminals to remotely attack, stripping victims of their money and making justice difficult to pursue.\n\nMore:Travel scam or 'the way things work'?\n\nMore:More fraudsters are scamming senior citizens through technology — and it's costing them millions\n\nThe scam artist in this case copied a local real estate agent's email signature but changed the phone number. Ironically, it was a Baltimore number, where Scholz lives.\n\nThey also grabbed Scholz's photos from her building's management website and plugged them into the ad.\n\n\"It's a total violation,\" she said.\n\nThe copy-and-paste method has proven successful for many scammers. It's designed to convince a stranger to fork over a hefty security deposit or even a large percentage of the rental cost before the scam artist disappears, sometimes without so much as an identifying email address.\n\nLast year, Ocean City police received 20 complaints of rental fraud — the highest number since at least 2011. Eighty-six percent of those cases originated on Craigslist.\n\n\"These aren’t some kids in a basement, saying, 'Hey, let’s make a little extra money,' \" said Sgt. Todd Speigle of Ocean City Police Department. \"These are professional criminals and this is typically the second or third layer of a greater scheme.\"\n\nThat \"greater scheme\" means vacation rental scams are increasingly a global crime.\n\nOf the 94 cases the Ocean City Police Department received since 2011, victims lost an average of $1,000, with some losing up to $2,800.\n\nWhen the would-be renters arrive in Ocean City, they typically find themselves at an already-occupied space or searching for a property that doesn't exist.\n\nWhile vacation rental scams usually stop victims right at the door, victims of residential rental fraud can live inside for months, paying rent to the scammer.\n\nSo-called \"home takeover\" scams occur when a con artist either moves into a vacant home or leases the residence to an unsuspecting renter, unbeknownst to the real owner. Often, the con artists break in, change the locks, present keys and legal documents to their victims.\n\nThis happened to one family in Wilmington last year, when they arrived to the door — suddenly with different locks — of a home they'd been renting for 10 months, along with police warning them that if they entered, they would be arrested for trespassing.\n\nBut like a typical vacation rental scam, when they called the man who leased them the home though a Craigslist advertisement, his phone number had been disconnected.\n\nCraigslist is not new to such scams. The classified advertisements website failed \"to identify more than half of scam rental listings,\" according to a 2016 study from New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering. Researchers analyzed over 2 million rental listings in 21 major markets.\n\nAccording to the study, some of the listings stayed online for as long as 20 hours before being removed. In competitive resort markets like Ocean City, 20 hours gives scammers plenty of time to strip victims of hard-earned, vacation-bound cash.\n\nRental fraud reaches beyond just Craigslist and Ocean City.\n\nRental scams hit big vacation markets like Florida. In particular, victims recently reported being scammed through Craigslist in Naples. This year, rental companies in Clearwater warned incoming tourists of fake websites.\n\nRick Rose, co-proprietor of Palm Beach Vacation Rentals, said con artists copied his company's logo, combined it with photos from a random unit, and put it on Craigslist.\n\nThe best bet, Rose said, is to deal with licensed and insured agencies.\n\n\"The vacation rental industry is not very regulated,\" he said, adding that there are roughly 60 hotels in his area, versus 1,500 vacation rental units. \"There are not enough human resources to ensure every single vacation rental is being operated legally. In terms of municipal resources, what are you going to regulate?\"\n\nA recent study from the American Hotels and Lodging Association found that 55 million bookings a year are made on websites posing as online travel agencies or emulating hotel websites. The incidents of travel fraud jumped 16 percent in 2017, according to a fraud attack index published by Forter, the e-commerce fraud prevention company that works with several Fortune 500 retailers.\n\nLaw enforcement offices often rely on preventative measures in warning the public of scams. In early April, Delaware Attorney General Matthew Denn warned residents of vacation rental scams.\n\n\"Ultimately the best tool is education,\" said William McDermott, Worcester County's interim state's attorney.\n\nRental scams are growing in sophistication. The cyber crime plagues websites like Craigslist, and they are difficult to prosecute, according to Rehoboth Beach, Ocean City and Delaware state police.\n\nMcDermott pointed to an ordinance Ocean City Town Council will consider in a few weeks that requires rental licenses to be shown on any online listing.\n\nOcean City Councilwoman Mary Knight said the sole intent of that ordinance is to collect tax revenue. However, it could serve as an added layer of protection for folks who want security and legitimacy before they book.\n\n\"Asking who the rental license belongs to could be an easy way to do that,\" McDermott said.\n\nAuthorities can do little\n\nMcDermott's office has cross-jurisdictional power but only in the state of Maryland.\n\nIf someone committed rental fraud outside Maryland, which is often the case, there is little law enforcement can do other than transfer the case over to the correct jurisdiction.\n\nWhen rental fraud lacks a physical location, it creates a gray area for local jurisdictions: Who can investigate crimes committed online?\n\n\"We need help from our federal brothers and sisters,\" McDermott said. \"And having the allied help of the Department of Homeland Security is always a benefit.\"\n\nSpeigle said he couldn't think of an Ocean City vacation rental fraud case that was successfully prosecuted. That's because the crime didn't technically occur on Ocean City grounds, leaving the agency out of jurisdiction and victims in a nightmarish online limbo.\n\nScammers have many ways to block law enforcement.\n\n\"Anybody could go on and create a Gmail or Yahoo account,\" Speigle said. \"There’s really no way for us to tell who that person is. They can put anything in there.\"\n\nDetectives could try to determine from a location connected to an IP address, but the perpetrators often use coffee shops and other businesses to connect to the internet, masking their identity.\n\nWhen Speigle started, the internet was still gaining in popularity, he said, and perpetrators were usually physically in Ocean City when committing their crimes.\n\n\"They would be stealing a six-pack of beer from 7-Eleven or breaking into someone’s vacation home in the winter when they weren’t there, and stealing the TV,\" Speigle said. \"And that would leave clues and give us something to investigate.\"\n\nNow, someone could commit fraud halfway around the world — without a trace.\n\n\"When somebody’s in eastern Europe and they’re sitting in an internet cafe, it’s going to be kind of hard for an Ocean City detective to No. 1 figure out who he is, and No. 2, to get the money back and bring him to justice.\"\n\nThe majority of cases Speigle sees are committed from across the country or are international. Email is usually the only form of communication, and payments are typically sent through a Western Union transfer or Moneygram.\n\n\"Once that money is sent out, it's hard to trace,\" Speigle said. \"We’ll also see money wired from one bank account to another, which by the time we get the report and catch up with it, that bank account doesn’t even exist anymore.\"\n\nScammers are professional disappearing acts.\n\n\"The only nexus to Ocean City is an address, but in reality, no actual crime has been committed here,\" Speigle said of the majority of rental scam cases the department handles.\n\nIn 2011, Speigle thought he tracked down a rental scammer. A family had come down for vacation, knocked on the door of their rental and realized someone was already in the house.\n\nThey sent the Western Union transfer to a 74-year-old man in New Hampshire. Speigle contacted the man, who revealed he had sent close to $200,000 to someone in Nigeria.\n\nBewilderingly enough, the man had received an email from the scammer, who told him his great-uncle was a prince somewhere in Africa, and had left him millions of dollars worth of inheritance.\n\nThe man would keep 5 percent of whatever he sent overseas and had no idea what was going on in Ocean City.\n\nSpeigle hadn't caught the perpetrator, he had found another victim.\n\nAfter speaking to the man, Speigle discovered multiple people from different jurisdictions were sending the scammer money, and that typically, they were older.\n\n\"He’s giving a bunch of his money away, and he believed it,\" Speigle said. \"He was vulnerable. He ended up being a bigger victim than whom the initial case came from.\"\n\nAvoid the scam\n\nScholz's condo is one of 390 units at Atlantis in Ocean City. She rents her place out for the summer season.\n\nThe grandfather who saw the Craigslist ad was able to contact Scholz. He hadn't booked the place, and Scholz reported it to Craigslist, which removed the post.\n\nOcean City broker Grace Masten calls the fraud a \"witch's hunt,\" because even if the ad is reported as spam and gets shut down, it can pop back up on a different site.\n\n\"Get down here and look at the property,\" Masten said. \"Make sure the people are actually who they say they are.\"\n\nIf folks can't do that, they should contact a local, reputable real estate agent, Masten added.\n\nAccording to Craigslist, 99 percent of scam attempts can be avoided with local, face-to-face contact.\n\n\"If you're six hours away, you're not going to check a place out,\" Speigle said.\n\nThe listed phone number can be telling of someone's location, he added: \"If some guy from Arizona is trying to rent out a condo in Ocean City, well that’s a little strange.\"\n\nRental fraud is popping up on vacation sites like HomeAway and Vacation Rentals By Owners, according to Lynn Mauk, the branch vice president for Coldwell Banker in Ocean City.\n\nScammers will grab listings of agents and market their for-sale properties as rentals. Mauk said this happened to one of her agents this year.\n\n\"The best thing is to recommend to a potential renter that they really need to do their homework,\" Mauk said. \"There’s a way they can go online and see if that’s the actual owner, to protect their interest.\"\n\nalike sites like airbnb1.com or airbnb.bya.com. The main body should always be \"https://www.airbnb.com\" and users should never pay outside that platform.\n\nMore:Here's how South Lake Tahoe became home to the $2,000 parking fine for Airbnb renters\n\nMore:Book an online vacation rental?

She will call the property owner, double check the pricing — anything to ensure her trust in booking.\n\nFor her Ocean City condo, Scholz checks Craigslist regularly to make sure no one is compromising her listing. A lot of her business comes from her own neighborhood by word of mouth, but she also uses social media to advertise.\n\n\"It’s such an electronic world now,\" Scholz said. \"It’s really hard to know who people say they are, but it’s how we function.\"\n\nUSA TODAY's Christopher Elliott and The News Journal's Xerxes Wilson and Christina Jedra contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Taylor Goebel on Twitter @TaylorGoebel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/03/30/bill-would-make-marijuana-legal-delaware/99815040/", "title": "Delaware legislators say they have votes to legalize pot", "text": "Scott Goss\n\nThe News Journal\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article inaccurately stated Colorado's tax revenue from marijuana sales. The state has collected about $200 million in tax revenue on more than $1 billion in sales.\n\nDelaware took a major step Thursday toward becoming the ninth state to legalize recreational marijuana use.\n\nState legislators unveiled a bill that would allow people 21 and older to purchase up to an ounce of cannabis from dozens of stores that would be authorized to sell marijuana manufactured at a number of Delaware grow operations.\n\n\"House Bill 110 creates an entirely new industry in our state,\" said Rep. Helene Keeley, D-South Wilmington. \"As the only state in a seven-hour drive to have legalized marijuana, we would become a destination that would attract out-of-state sales, which would have a benefit to our Delaware businesses.\"\n\nKeeley and fellow chief sponsor, state Sen. Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington, estimate legalized recreational marijuana could generate $22 million in tax revenue for the financially strapped state in the first year that the proposed program is up and running.\n\nThe legislators insisted that their proposal is not aimed at filling the state's current $386 million budget hole.\n\n\"We see it as a social justice issue,\" Henry said, describing the legislation as an effort to reform the criminal justice system by legalizing \"something that people always have done and are doing.\"\n\nRELATED STORY: Medical marijuana dispensary set to open near Lewes\n\nRELATED STORY: Rally for marijuana legalization held in Newark\n\nLocal advocates for legalization, including Delaware NORML and the Delaware Cannabis Advocacy Network, cheered the bill as a victory for common sense policy.\n\n\"Delaware cannot afford to wait to end this failed costly policy,\" said Zoe Patchell, executive director of the cannabis network. \"We spend $22.3 million annually arresting people like me who choose a healthier, safer alternative to alcohol.\"\n\nJude McDonald, a 62-year-old Newark resident perhaps best known as the owner of the former Jude's Diner in Newark, is a medical marijuana card holder and a self-described recreational user who began using cannabis after being diagnosed with hepatitis C. McDonald said she supports the legislation because it would end the criminalization of otherwise law-abiding residents.\n\n\"How many family members do you know who have used cannabis in your life?\" she asked. \"I volunteer at a homeless shelter, and none of those people are in that situation because of marijuana. They often find themselves homeless because of legal drugs like opiates that are far more harmful.\"\n\nA poll conducted by the University of Delaware last year found that more than 60 percent of state residents support full legalization of marijuana.\n\nGov. John Carney, however, is not one of them.\n\nThe state, his office noted, is still working to get the 6-year-old medical marijuana program fully operational and approved a law decriminalizing marijuana in 2015, downgrading possession of an ounce from a criminal offense to a civil violation, like a parking ticket.\n\nCarney has said he also wants to allow more time to study the impact of legalization efforts in the eight other jurisdictions that have approved such measures, including Colorado, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.\n\nAt least 14 legislators had signed on to co-sponsor the Delaware Marijuana Control Act, including Sen. Colin Bonini, R-Dover, who last year proposed legalizing cannabis while running for governor. Keeley said she is confident the measure will get votes from two-thirds of the Senate and House members needed to pass a bill that contains new criminal penalties. In this case, those penalties relate to fines for underage consumption.\n\n\"This is where the grassroots support starts,\" Keeley said. \"For advocates, now is their chance to call their legislator and tell them they want this.\"\n\nWhile the legalization movement in Delaware took a major step Thursday, a great deal of uncertainty still remains over how the Trump administration plans to deal with state-led marijuana initiatives. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law, even for medicinal use.\n\nPOLL: Should marijuana be legalized in Delaware for anyone 21 or older?\n\nThe White House has indicated it may be willing to allow medical marijuana programs to continue unfettered while signaling a potential crackdown on states that have legalized cannabis for recreational use. The National District Attorney's Association has created a policy group to advise the White House.\n\nColorado, which passed its law in 2014, has generated close to $200 million from marijuana sales taxes, according to that state's revenue department.\n\n\"It generates revenue, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about it,\" said Jeffrey Horvath, executive director of the Delaware Police Chiefs' Council. \"Unfortunately, there's a lot of negatives that also come with it, and we're against the bill.\"\n\nHorvath said the Colorado law enforcement officials he's spoken with have warned that state oversight needed to properly monitor the new drug law has been difficult to implement.\n\n\"They tell me the black market is stronger there today than it has ever been,\" he said. \"And they've had a real issue with edibles, which tend to look like gummy bears, cookies and candy, getting in the hands of children. Teen marijuana use also has increased.\"\n\nThe Delaware Fraternal Order of Police has not yet taken a position on the legalization of recreational marijuana.\n\n\"The General Assembly's job is to enact laws, and our role is to enforce whatever is on the books,\" said Fred Calhoun, the union's president.\n\nNearly 2,750 Delawareans are currently licensed to purchase medical marijuana from the state's lone dispensary near Wilmington. A second dispensary is expected to open near Lewes in the coming weeks with a third in Kent County moving toward operation this fall.\n\nSome of the state's medical marijuana patients have recently argued that the limited access currently available has led to exorbitant prices and the strains they rely on frequently being sold out.\n\nLegalization advocates argue that allowing shops catering to recreational use would address many of those issues through free market competition.\n\nThe NAACP Delaware State Conference is joining those advocates in lobbying the General Assembly to pass a legalization bill. They say the war on drugs has created a racially biased criminal justice system that results in the disproportionate arrest of African-Americans.\n\n\"We believe it's time to direct attention and resources towards reducing heroin and opioid-related deaths and crime,\" Delaware NAACP President Linwood Jackson said in a release. \"Tax revenue generated from cannabis sales will benefit our citizens and state.”\n\nThe proposed Delaware Marijuana Control Act would create a commission to regulate, license and tax the state's marijuana business. Consumers would be required to pay a $50-per-ounce excise tax, while retailers would be charged a $5,000 application fee and a $10,000 annual licensing fee.\n\nUp to 40 retails stores could be licensed to sell marijuana under the bill, with medical marijuana dispensaries given the first opportunity to open retail operations.\n\nKeeley and Henry noted the bill would not allow people to consume marijuana in public, grow their own plants or prohibit any employer, public or private, from requiring routine drug screenings.\n\nMoney generated from taxes and fees, they said, would first be directed toward covering administrative costs. The remaining funds would be allocated toward education, programs aimed at helping prisoners re-enter society, drug abuse rehabilitation and prevention programs and initiatives aimed at training police officers to recognize whether drivers are under the influence of marijuana and other drugs.\n\nAAA Mid-Atlantic says its research shows an alarming increase in the proportion of drivers involved in fatal crashes in states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use. Other studies dispute that finding.\n\nThere is no test to determine the intoxication level of drivers who ingest marijuana comparable to breathalyzers that gauge blood-alcohol content.\n\n“For whatever marijuana might raise in revenue, its legalization comes at a potentially high cost to society and safety, including new threats on our roads,” said Cathy Rossi, vice president of public and government affairs for AAA Mid-Atlantic.\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/31/tuskegee-monument-sugar-water-potato-problems-news-around-states/118486586/", "title": "Tuskegee monument, sugar water: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Shakespeare Festival, which began in a high school auditorium in 1972, is undergoing a $1.6million renovation in advance of its 50th season. Located in east Montgomery, the theater is upgrading an entrance lobby and enclosing an outdoor area. It also is adding restrooms, constructing a new gift shop and making other additions. While the theater received $1.18 million in federal pandemic aid as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, spokeswoman Layne Holley said the renovations will not use that money, and officials have yet to decide how to use the funding. Indoor shows are scheduled to resume Nov. 27 with a production of “Cinderella.” Executive director Todd Schmidt said the theater has survived the pandemic and made plans for a return in part because of strong community backing. “We had to reduce our staff and our overhead,” Schmidt said. “It’s been a tough time, but luckily we’ve had great support.” Initially staged at Anniston High School, the company relocated to Montgomery and is housed in a theater constructed in 1985.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Federation of Natives has postponed its annual convention because of a rise in COVID-19 cases in the state, officials said in a statement. The convention has traditionally been the largest gathering of Alaska Natives in the state. It had been scheduled for Oct. 21-23 but is now delayed until mid-December in Anchorage, the organization said in a statement. Organizers said they will continue planning for an in-person convention at the Dena’ina Convention Center in downtown Anchorage with a virtual option. However, the statement said the board will make a decision by mid-October on whether to maintain the in-person part. Organizers encouraged Alaskans to get vaccinated and wear masks so the convention can be held. One notable celebration this year will be the observation of the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The act was the largest land settlement in the nation’s history when President Richard Nixon signed it into law Dec. 18, 1971, and settled Indigenous land claims in Alaska. “Postponing until December provides us an opportunity to gather in person on the 50th anniversary of ANCSA, but it all hinges on everyone’s willingness and ability to get vaccinated,” said Sealaska chairman and Alaska Federation of Natives co-chair Joe Nelson.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A tribe that didn’t sign a revised gambling compact with the state earlier this year has filed a lawsuit alleging that a new law is unconstitutional and left some rural tribes in the cold by excluding them from negotiations hamming out the legislation.

The lawsuit said the state presented the tribe with an amended compact “as a non-negotiable, ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ proposition.” The lawmaker who sponsored the gambling legislation defended it as fair and equitable. The legislation signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey last spring expands the types of gambling allowed at tribal casinos, lets tribes and pro sports teams take bets on sport evenings, and licenses six operators to sign up players for betting on fantasy virtual games. A judge scheduled an emergency hearing for next Friday on the suit.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has scheduled the retrial of a former state senator on bribery and fraud charges for the first week of October. Court records, first reported by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, show U.S. District Judge Judge Price Marshall on Friday scheduled the trial for Gilbert Baker, a Republican former senator and one-time state GOP chairman, to begin Oct. 4. A federal jury earlier this month acquitted Baker of conspiracy in the case in which he allegedly conspired to bribe an ex-judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The jury, however, deadlocked on charges of bribery and wire fraud against Baker, and prosecutors on Thursday filed notice of their intent to retry those counts. Baker was accused of conspiring with former state Judge Michael Maggio, who admitted to accepting campaign donations from a nursing home operator, then reducing a judgment against that company by $4.2 million. Michael Morton, the nursing home operator, has not been charged with any crimes and has denied wrongdoing. Maggio was sentenced in 2015 to 10 years in prison.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBlythe: California farmers near the Arizona border with the oldest rights to Colorado River water will reap $38million over three years to not plant some of their fields and leave extra water in the rapidly declining Lake Mead reservoir. Located roughly halfway between Los Angeles and Phoenix, growers near the city of Blythe in Riverside County have first priority to the river water. They hold rights that stretch back to 1877, superseding 40 million customers in eight states who also depend on it. But with continued drought and overuse, a first-ever shortage in the river system was declared in recent weeks by federal authorities, triggering cuts to Arizona, Nevada and Mexico’s supplies next year. In response, farmers who control the Palo Verde Irrigation District voted unanimously this month to agree to cancel planting some of their crops for three years. They will be paid about $925 per acre this year via federal drought response funds and water ratepayers in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, with 2% increases each year after that. Bart Fisher, a PVID trustee whose family owns the 11,500-acre Fisher Ranch, said he and others were acting not because they want the money but because they want to help others and try to guarantee continued water supply for all.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s secretary of state filed a lawsuit Monday to remove a rural county’s election clerk who is accused of allowing a security breach of the county’s voting equipment that is currently being investigated by the FBI. The lawsuit filed in Mesa County district court by Secretary of State Jena Griswold seeks to formally remove Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters as the designated election official. The suit also calls for the appointment of former Secretary of State Wayne Williams to replace Peters and Sheila Reiner, former Mesa county clerk and recorder, to serve as the elections supervisor for the county’s upcoming November elections. The Board of County Commissioners praised the changes in a statement Monday, saying Mesa County will have “arguably the most secure and transparent election system in the United States.” Peters has claimed that the investigation led by Griswold – who is a Democrat – is an attempt to take over one of the few remaining conservative counties in Colorado. Griswold said initial investigation findings show images of election management software used by the county’s elections equipment were obtained by conspiracy theorists and posted on far-right blogs. Griswold’s office also said it believes one of the images was taken from a secure room.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Schools around the state looking to upgrade aging ventilation systems to improve air quality and help fight the airborne spread of the coronavirus may find themselves short on funds, even with federal pandemic aid. The Connecticut Mirror reports a state policy restricts aid for heating, air conditioning and air quality control projects. The policy could be reviewed again by legislators, but likely not before the 2022 General Assembly session in February. “There are some districts that haven’t touched their schools in 40 years,” said Kostantinos Diamantis, the state’s budget director who also has overseen the state’s school construction program for the past six years. “The local level needs to belly up to the bar. The cities have an obligation to maintain those buildings.” Connecticut reimburses communities for between 10% and 71% of new construction and large renovation projects designed to last 20 years or longer, the Mirror reports. But the cost of smaller projects such as replacing or upgrading a heating and ventilation system must be absorbed by the town. For the town of Coventry, which wants to replace ventilators in its middle and high schools and make roof repairs, that would mean a bill of more than $2 million even after unused federal pandemic aid is applied.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Preliminary necropsy results show that a young fin whale that beached itself and died at Cape Henlopen State Park last week was riddled with parasites. “There was a lot going on,” said Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute Executive Director Suzanne Thurman. Measured by MERR to be 57 feet long, the whale first showed up in Lewes on Thursday, stuck on a sandbar in the Harbor of Refuge. It was able to free itself when the tide came in, but a short time later it beached itself again on the oceanside of The Point. Around noon Aug. 27, after many onlookers had come to catch a glimpse of its tail flapping in the surf, and just moments after Virginia Aquarium representatives had arrived to provide palliative care and possible euthanasia, the whale stopped breathing, according to a MERR Facebook post. The whale had to be cut into several pieces to move it out of the water for necropsy.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Dozens of people marched to the White House on Sunday calling for support of Afghan women. Organized by the nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership, the group is calling on President Joe Biden and other U.S. leaders to prioritize the evacuation of women out of Afghanistan and to help permanently protect women’s rights inside the country following the crisis inside the country and the Taliban takeover, WUSA-TV reports. Protesters wore shirts and held signs emblazoned with “I stand with Afghan women” as they marched from the Vital Voices headquarters on 16th Street through Black Lives Matter Plaza and to Lafayette Square, eventually gathering in front of the White House. The deadline to evacuate U.S. citizens from Afghanistan is Tuesday. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Sunday that for those U.S. citizens seeking immediately to leave Afghanistan by the looming deadline, “we have the capacity to have 300 Americans, which is roughly the number we think are remaining, come to the airport and get on planes in the time that is remaining.”\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Sugar growers are suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over proposed reservoir water levels they say will be far too low. The federal lawsuits filed last week by Florida Crystals’ Okeelanta Corp., U.S. Sugar and the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative say the current Corps plan won’t supply enough water for their fields. “Farmers need a secure supply of water, and all farmers need certainty as we plan and manage our planting schedules and crop rotation,” said Jaime Vega, vice president of agriculture at Florida Crystals. Jacksonville Commander Col. Andrew Kelly defended the Corps’ work, saying the agency will balance water supply for both the environment and farmers. The project in question is the Everglades Agricultural Area reservoir intended to cleanse tainted water so more can flow south as crucially needed toward Everglades National Park and Florida Bay. In the lawsuits, Sugar Growers say the still-under-construction reservoir should be kept at higher water levels than what is currently envisioned in a Corps of Engineers plan. Everglades restoration advocates say the growers are simply putting their priorities ahead of others.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Atlanta Black Pride organizers say the annual celebration will happen Labor Day weekend as planned with some precautions to protect against the spread of COVID-19. The larger Atlanta Pride festival and parade planned for October were canceled Wednesday because of concerns about the pandemic. But leaders of Atlanta Black Pride, which celebrates the African American LGBTQ community, say they plan to go forward, with fewer indoor gatherings, while encouraging people to wear masks and maintain social distance. Amber Moore, COO and vice president of Atlanta Black Pride, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that COVID-19 vaccines and coronavirus testing will be offered. The celebration, marking its 25th anniversary this year, is to feature events around the city. In addition to parties, that includes a fashion show, a session on empowering women, an awards ceremony for the transgender community, a virtual film festival and a health expo. Vaughn Alvarez, who is helping to promote some of the events at Piedmont Park, told the newspaper that Atlanta rapper and radio host Da Brat and fiancee Jesseca “Judy” Dupart, CEO of Kaleidoscope Hair Products, will be honored for “bravery and courage with their love story.” The two star in “Brat loves Judy” on WE-TV.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A county affordable housing committee has voted to recommend approval of a rental project on Lanai, where no new affordable homes have been built in 30 years. The Hokuao 201H Housing Project, proposed by billionaire Larry Ellison’s company Pulama Lanai, includes the development of 150 two-bedroom rental homes on former pineapple fields. About half of the units will be market-rate priced. The project will be developed under the state’s fast-track approval process for affordable housing. The Maui County Council’s Affordable Housing Committee voted 8-0 to recommend giving the project the green light after multiple meetings packed with public testimony and hours of discussion over concern about the project’s number of market-rate homes, The Maui News reports. Council Chairwoman Alice Lee said the project is “desperately needed.” Pulama Lanai had sought an exemption for sidewalks in the future subdivision, saying including them would cost about $2 million. Sharon Thom, senior vice president of development and construction for Pulama Lanai, said the sidewalks would change the “look and feel” of Lanai City. But Committee Chairman Gabe Johnson argued to include sidewalks, saying the county needs to advocate for pedestrian safety and accessibility.\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: The hot, dry, smoky growing season has left some potato farmers bracing for a poor crop. Randy Hardy, of Oakley, told the Idaho State Journal that his harvest will likely be the worst of his career. Statewide, spud farmers conducting test digs or early harvests are uprooting plants supporting no tubers. Where there are potatoes, there are fewer than normal, and most of the tubers are undersized and misshapen. “I’ve never had this happen before, and I’ve got an agronomist who works with me on potatoes, and he’s been doing it for over 20 years, and he said he’s never seen a worse crop than this,” said Hardy, who raises spuds for the fresh market and is chairman of the board of Sun Valley Potatoes. Hardy isn’t scheduled to harvest until Sept. 20, and he’s hoping the extra time will allow his tubers to add a bit more bulk. United Potato Growers of Idaho asked growers to submit results from Aug. 1 test digs and will gather follow-up data in person during harvest. Hardy said the average number of tubers in the test digs was down 30% from last year. Weight was also down substantially, he said. Many fields lacked deep soil moisture when the potatoes were planted. Then the state was hit with record-high heat in June, contributing to fewer potatoes growing beneath each plant, and smoke-filled air from Western wildfires.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: From a waterpark resort to a public school, seven finalists have been named in a design competition to repurpose a much-maligned state government building downtown. State officials are trying to sell the James R. Thompson Center, which was designed by famed architect Helmet Jahn. They say the 17-story curved-glass structure that opened in 1985 is inefficient and requires hundreds of millions of dollars worth of repairs and updates to keep it running. The building houses offices for the governor and employees of state agencies, who are scheduled to move next year to another building on the city’s Near West Side. Illinois officials are seeking bids for a developer and have not committed to any preservation ideas. Officials have said they want to sell the building by February 2022. Architecture buffs have pushed for preservation, an effort that’s been renewed in the wake of Jahn’s death in May. The finalists were named last week. A group of design and preservation experts picked the finalists from 59 entries. A winner will be chosen Sept. 14.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A coalition of voting rights groups is sponsoring a contest for Hoosiers to draw new maps for congressional and legislative election districts. The group All IN for Democracy said the contest is aimed at finding “fair” proposed election maps to present to legislators before they vote in late September on the once-a-decade redistricting based on population shifts from the U.S. census. Voting rights activists have complained that the GOP-dominated Legislature isn’t involving the public enough in the redistricting work and that partisan gerrymandering has helped Indiana Republicans gain outsized power in state government. The organization is providing an online site where residents can compile maps based on the 2020 census data. Proposals submitted by Sept. 13 will be judged, with the winning map for Indiana’s nine congressional districts getting $1,000, with $2,000 for the best districts for the 50 Indiana Senate seats and $3,000 for the fairest map of the 100 Indiana House districts. The group said its judging will be based on how well the maps keep communities of interest together, maintain whole cities and counties in the same district, and maximize the number of politically competitive districts.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Black applicants are 2.6 times more likely to be denied a conventional home loan than similarly qualified white applicants in the Des Moines/West Des Moines metro, according to an analysis of 2019 data by The Markup, a nonprofit newsroom. Des Moines has the fifth-greatest likelihood of denial for Black applicants out of 71 U.S. metro areas that The Markup found had statistically significant disparities in home loan approvals. The newsroom found that nationally, mortgage lenders are 80% more likely to reject Black applicants; 70% more likely to deny Native American applicants; 50% more likely to turn down Asian/Pacific Islander applicants; and 40% more likely to reject Latino applicants. For its analysis, The Markup examined more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications, accounting for 17 independent variables, including debt-to-income ratio and combined loan-to-value ratio. It did not take into account credit scores, which are not publicly available through Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. John Sorensen, president and CEO of the Iowa Bankers Association, said in a statement that while the organization “firmly believes that discrimination has no place in the mortgage market,” the data used by The Markup doesn’t give a full picture as to why these disparities exist.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of the biggest gun dealers in south-central Kansas is the city of Wichita, but it actually received less than half the proceeds from the sales because it works with several online companies to auction off the firearms. Since a new state law allowing the gun sales was passed in 2015, Wichita has sold 2,082 guns that were seized during crimes for which the criminal cases were complete. The city generated $196,000 on the gun sales that went into a fund that pays for miscellaneous police equipment. But The Wichita Eagle learned the city received less than half of the $425,000 in total sales generated because the companies that handle the sales take a significant chunk of the proceeds. The city contracts with Propertyroom.com, which sells the guns through a partnership with a major gun retailer that operates an online auction site. The city finance director said officials last took proposals for the gun contract two years ago and got no better offer. Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell, who wrote the law, said it’s no different from police departments selling off other seized property, and any gun purchases require background checks. Former Rep. Jim Ward, who also used to work as a city prosecutor, said he knows it’s impossible to keep all the guns off the street, but he never wanted the government in the gun business.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: An instructional assistant at an eastern Kentucky elementary school died from COVID-19 as the fast-spreading delta variant has sparked coronavirus outbreaks in several school districts. Heather Antle, an aide at Lee County Elementary, died Sunday. Antle was an involved member of the school community who “brought great joy to the students and staff that she worked with,” Lee County Superintendent Sarah Wasson said in a statement posted to social media. The Lee County district canceled in-person classes until Sept. 7 in response to coronavirus cases among students and teachers. Virus outbreaks have caused disruptions since the school year began. Several other districts have shut down classes for multiple days due to outbreaks. Gov. Andy Beshear, while expressing condolences to Antle’s family, urged Kentuckians to get vaccinated and wear masks to prevent the virus’s spread in schools. “There was a time when some argued COVID did not spread in schools,” the governor said on social media. “That time should be over. ... We must do everything in our power to prevent the spread of this virus in our schools, and vaccinations and masks are our greatest tools. Let’s do what’s right for our teachers.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A couple who met in a gross anatomy class as Tulane University undergraduates have given Tulane Medical School $5 million for an endowed professorship. Drs. Philip and Cheryl Leone, of Naples, Florida, are now retired pathologists and current members of the School of Medicine Board of Governors, a university news release said Wednesday. Their endowment will support a medical school professor who will also hold a joint appointment in another school or unit and will focus on areas such as public health, immunology, parasitology or anthropology, the university said. The Leones have worked in both academia and private practice. “Tulane University has played a major role in our lives and the lives of our family members,” Phil Leone said. “Our son graduated from Tulane, and Cheryl’s siblings earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from the university.” “Endowing a Presidential Chair with an emphasis on interdisciplinary academic study allows us to contribute to the university in these challenging times,” Cheryl Leone said. “We hope our gift will strengthen the medical school and help train future physicians who can significantly advance the field of medicine.”\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: More than 125 boats participated in a weekend protest against plans for an aquaculture operation in waters near Acadia National Park. Commercial and recreational vessels comprised the “Save the Bay” flotilla that motored around Frenchman Bay on Sunday. Some people on land also participated by holding signs stating their opposition. American Aquafarms has proposed raising 66 million pounds of Atlantic salmon annually at a pair of 15-pen sites off the coast of Gouldsboro in Frenchman Bay. The company didn’t immediately return a telephone message. Ted O’Meara of Frenchman’s Bay United likened the scope of the project to ”some huge hog farm from the Midwest and plucking it right in the middle of one of the most beautiful parts of Maine.” He said that “our first goal is to stop this project, and our second goal is to look at changing some of the rules that allow people like this to think they can just come here and plug something like this down in our waters.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The first new Catholic school built in the city in roughly 60 years opened its doors Monday to hundreds of youngsters, who entered the gleaming new building with a mix of enthusiasm and first-day-back jitters. The state-of-the-art Mother Mary Lange Catholic School was built on the site where a notoriously rough public housing high-rise once stood. In a U.S. city steeped in Catholicism like few others, the new 65,000-square-foot building near downtown Baltimore is somewhat of an anomaly in the national education landscape as the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the shuttering of many Catholic schools. It’s named after Mother Mary Elizabeth Lange, a Haitian American who started a Catholic school for Black children in 1828 – the first U.S. Catholic school for African American youth. She co-founded the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore in 1829. The Vatican is reviewing Lange for possible canonization. Archbishop of Baltimore William E. Lori said the new school, which goes from preschool to eighth grade, is not only a benefit to the students and their families but also an asset to the surrounding neighborhood. The school’s playing fields and gym will be accessible, as appropriate, to the city community. “They say a rising tide lifts all boats. And I think the opening of this school has put a spring in the step of all of our Catholic educators,” Lori said in a phone interview.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A public marker to remember the enslaved Africans forced to journey across the ocean to toil in the Americas was formally dedicated Sunday on the downtown waterfront. The Middle Passage Port Marker was installed last October at the end of Long Wharf looking out onto Boston Harbor. It is meant to acknowledge Boston’s history of slavery and honor the Africans who were forced into the the trans-Atlantic voyage known as the Middle Passage. The Sunday ceremony included remarks from Michael Creasey, superintendent of the National Parks of Boston, and officials from the downtown Museum of African American History. Names of enslaved members of Boston’s oldest churches were read aloud, and there was a traditional balafon performance by Balla Kouyate as well as a land acknowledgement statement delivered by Elizabeth Solomon, a member of the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag. Millions of Africans were sold in the Caribbean and in American cities such as Boston and Newport, Rhode Island, from 1619 to 1865, according to event organizers. Native Americans from local tribes, including the Massachusett, Wampanoag and Nipmuc, were also enslaved after being taken as prisoners of war, the organizations said.\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Huron: A monument dedicated to Tuskegee Airmen who died in Michigan during World War II training was unveiled Saturday near the international Blue Water Bridge. Michigan served as an advanced training ground for many graduates of the Tuskegee University pilot training program in Alabama. Surviving Tuskegee airmen and their descendants attended the event in Port Huron, part of a three-day celebration that recognized the accomplishments of America’s first Black military pilots. Fifteen Tuskegee airmen were killed while training in Michigan, including five pilots lost in Lake Huron and one in the St. Clair River, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Wreckages from two planes have been found in the river and the lake. In 2014, the remains of a P-39 aircraft were found in Lake Huron, 70 years after it crashed. The body of 2nd Lt. Frank Moody washed ashore a few months after the April 1944 crash. A dive team spent a week in Lake Huron in 2015 surveying the wreckage. The plane’s wing, landing gear, engine block, tail, propeller, cockpit door, instrument panel, .50-caliber machine guns and ammunition are being restored and will become an exhibit sponsored by the National Tuskegee Airmen Museum in Detroit.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A write-in campaign for a prehistoric giant beaver that weighed more than 200 pounds has secured it a spot on a list of possible candidates for state fossil. The write-in campaign has been so successful that the beaver, or Castoroides ohioensis, is now in the lead among possible state-fossil candidates proposed by the Science Museum of Minnesota. The fossil, found in St. Paul, dates back to the Pleistocene epoch and is estimated to be anywhere from 2.58 million years to 10,150 years old, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. Minnesota is one of just seven states without a state fossil, said Alex Hastings, the Phillip W. Fitzpatrick Chair of Paleontology at the Science Museum of Minnesota, who is leading an effort to designate one. Hastings put together a list of eight candidates – representing different creatures, different parts of the state and different geologic times – for consideration. As of last Tuesday, more than 2,100 people had voted, he said. The entry for Castoroides ohioensis notes that it had “buck teeth and aquatic lifestyle” and “was the size of a small bear,” according to officials with the St. Paul museum. It almost became Minnesota’s state fossil back in 1988, but the measure failed in the Legislature. Voting ends Oct. 1, after which legislators will get involved.\n\nMississippi\n\nYazoo City: A white father and son have each been sentenced to four years in prison for convictions related to chasing and shooting at two Black teenagers who were riding all-terrain vehicles on a country road. Some of the charges were prosecuted as hate crimes, which strengthened the punishment. Wade Oscar Twiner, 49, of Yazoo City, and his son, Lane Irvine Twiner, 23, of Jackson, were sentenced Friday in Yazoo County. Jurors on Wednesday convicted each man of two counts of simple assault and one count of malicious mischief. The district attorney’s office said the penalty for each simple assault conviction was increased because the men’s actions were deemed hate crimes under Mississippi law, which allows stronger penalties for crimes motivated by the victim’s actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, national origin or gender. The men were arrested after the Sept. 27 chase in rural Yazoo County. The two teenagers were not injured, but they told investigators they were frightened for their lives. The teenagers were riding ATVs on a country road close to Wade Twiner’s home, said Chief Deputy Joseph Head of the Yazoo County Sheriff’s Office. The father and son got in a pickup and chased the teens, firing several shots and bumping into one of the ATVs with the truck.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Officials face a tall order to get all the state’s nursing home workers vaccinated because fewer than half of them have received the shots. By that metric, Missouri’s 48% ranks third-lowest in the nation, trailed only by Florida and Louisiana, both at 47%. Yet some 82% of Missouri’s nursing home residents have been vaccinated, which is just behind the national average of 83%. That worries residents like Michael Williams, who has diabetes and is on kidney dialysis at the Crestwood Health Care Center in St. Louis. “It’s fine if they (staff) don’t want to take it, but then don’t work around us. We all have underlying conditions here,” Williams told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “They are out in the casino, and they are rolling the dice, but the sad thing about it is it’s other people’s lives they are playing with.” Some workers have already quit rather than face a mandate. Earlier this month, the Biden administration said it would require nursing home staff be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments – revenue on which nearly all skilled nursing facilities depend. But details of that plan still haven’t been released. Data analyzed by the Post-Dispatch shows 20 facilities statewide had staff vaccination rates of 20% or less as of Aug. 15.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University has announced a $101 million donation to its College of Nursing, believed to be the largest donation ever given to a college of nursing in the United States, school officials said. The donation, announced Monday, comes from Mark and Robyn Jones, founders of Goosehead Insurance, based in Westlake, Texas. “It is hard to put into words how moved and excited all of us are at Montana State University by the generosity of the Joneses, who are helping to address some of the most critical health care disparity issues in Montana, particularly in the state’s rural areas,” MSU President Waded Cruzado said in a statement. The money will be used to fund new facilities and state-of-the-art simulation labs at MSU College of Nursing campuses in Bozeman, Billings, Great Falls, Kalispell and Missoula. The donation will also create five faculty professorships, helping MSU attract top faculty talent as the nation faces a nursing faculty shortage. MSU’s College of Nursing will also create an endowed scholarship fund and a nurse midwifery program for doctoral-level nurses to provide maternal health in rural and remote communities.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The bones of the city’s next outdoor performance space have risen in the Gene Leahy Mall downtown. Metal arches that will one day form a performance pavilion have gone up in the mall in recent weeks, part of a $400 million public-private renovation of the mall, Heartland of America Park and Lewis & Clark Landing. When the pavilion is finished – likely sometime next spring – three white arches cascading in size will cover a stage. The Omaha World-Herald reports the space will be used for all manner of performances, from concerts, symphony performances and music festivals to movie nights and dance competitions. “It’s exciting seeing it start to come out of the ground,” said Katie Bassett, vice president of parks for the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority, which is managing the park renovations for the city. Stretching out from the pavilion to the west will be a 42,000-square-foot green lawn that will be able to host thousands of people for shows and offer a recreation space the rest of the time. Officials say the venue will be reminiscent of the iconic Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, which has a similar arch-shaped covering over the stage. At night, the pavilion will be lit from underneath to create a glow effect, which Bassett said will offer “an iconic” addition to Omaha’s downtown.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The nation’s fifth-largest school system has begun using ultraviolet light as a classroom germ-killer in a bid to stop the spread of COVID-19. “This doesn’t have any chemicals. It’s just light,” said Grant Morgan, chief executive and co-founder of Utah biosafety startup R-Zero, during a demonstration of the disinfection system at an elementary school in suburban Henderson. The blue-light-emitting tower can disinfect a 1,000-square-foot indoor space in seven minutes, destroying more than 99.99% of surface and airborne pathogens, Morgan told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. It is designed to be used while a space is unoccupied but has no lingering effects when people enter a room after treatment, he said. The Clark County School District bought one Arc unit for each of its 372 campuses using $7.4 million in federal coronavirus relief money to cover the $20,000 per-unit cost, the Review-Journal said. The district has more than 310,000 students. Classes began Aug. 9.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is asking employees who have not yet returned to campus to keep working remotely until Oct. 4. The previous plan was for workers to return at the start of September, but the college is adjusting its plans as COVID-19 cases increase regionally and nationally, said Scott Bemis, chief human resources officer. Many of those who have already returned “can continue to work on-site,” Bemis said in an email to the community Friday. He said the date is being pushed back a month “to help slow the increase in the density of people on campus, with the goal of interrupting COVID-19 transmission wherever possible.” Bemis also said that weekly coronavirus surveillance testing will be conducted for vaccinated employees, instead of every 30 days. Unvaccinated employees who are coming to campus are still required to test twice a week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: About half a million residents stand to lose a $300 federal unemployment benefit when it expires Saturday. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday during a COVID-19 news conference that it would cost the state more than $1 billion a month to pick up the unemployment insurance tab from the federal government. “The proper way to extend federal UI benefits is through federal action, not a patchwork of state ones,” he said. “The reality is that continuing the $300-per-week benefit through state resources would be cost-prohibitive.” The expiration will affect about 500,000 people, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor. Federal jobless aid was first approved in 2020 when COVID-19 outbreak hit, sending jobless to record highs amid pandemic-related shutdowns. The state has administered $33.7 billion directly to 1.6 million residents since the start of the pandemic, the governor said. The lion’s share – $25 billion – has come from the federal government. To those unemployed residents affected by the expiration of the federal benefit, Murphy pointed to the state’s minimum wage, which will rise to $13 an hour in the new year from $12. He also pointed to the state’s paid sick and family leave programs, along with other social safety net aids.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland married her longtime partner, Skip Sayre, on Saturday night in her home state. Haaland wore a dress designed and sewn by her sister, said Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz. The ceremony incorporated elements honoring her Native American ancestry. The former New Mexico congresswoman is a member of the Laguna Pueblo. According to Schwartz, guests had to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend and wear masks per U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and New Mexico guidelines. But pictures on social media that show some people, including Haaland, not wearing masks indoors the whole time have drawn criticism. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A “sequence of failures” in the city’s subway system following a brief power outage disrupted half of the system for several hours and stranded hundreds of passengers, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hochul said in a statement that a Metropolitan Transportation Authority review of Sunday night’s subway breakdown “uncovered a sequence of failures that resulted in some backup systems not providing power as designed last night, including an additional failure to quickly diagnose the underlying cause.” The unprecedented breakdown affected more than 80 trains on the subway system’s numbered lines plus the L train from shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday to about 1:30 a.m. Monday, Hochul said at an earlier news conference. The restoration of service was delayed because passengers on two of the stuck trains walked out onto the tracks by themselves rather than waiting for rescuers from agencies including the police and fire departments to help them, Hochul said. “We never, ever want riders to do that,” she said. “It is dangerous, and it caused a delay in the restoration of power.” Speaking outside a lower Manhattan subway system, Hochul promised a thorough investigation. “Let me be very clear,” she said. “Last night was unacceptable.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: State environmental regulators say a plant that for years discharged so-called forever chemicals into the air and water is not currently in compliance with its air permit. In its letter to Chemours, the Department of Environmental Quality warned that it is preparing an enforcement action against the company’s Fayetteville Works plant in Bladen County, which has been exceeding its GenX air pollution limits for much of 2021. Officials said the company could be facing up to a $25,000 fine per day. In a statement, Chemours said the site experienced a temporary increase in air emissions this year from one of its carbon adsorption units. “The issue was quickly resolved when the carbon was replaced in this unit, and emissions returned to their usual low levels,” the statement said. “However, the data results from that one emissions sampling caused an exceedance of the site’s calculated 12-month rolling air emission allowance.” Chemours, a spinoff of DuPont Co., plans to take corrective action to fix the issue in the long term, according to its statement. GenX, a type of PFAS, has been found in drinking water wells near the plant and also the municipal utility serving the city of Wilmington, about 100 miles downstream.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A new quarterly report from North Dakota State University says the state’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has slowed a bit. The outlook predicts declines in the gross state product, which is the measurement of the state’s output, labor force participation, and total wages and salaries. “The overall economic outlook for the state had been improving amidst the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the most recent data shows a state economy that is at risk of declining economic growth and a shrinking labor force,” said NDSU economics professor Jeremy Jackson, director of the Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise. Total wages and salaries are expected to hold steady with a slight decline in the third quarter of this year, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The labor force is predicted to decline in the third quarter, with that trend continuing into next year. The unemployment rate is projected to have a slight increase in the third quarter and then return to its declining trend. North Dakota’s gross state product grew 1.8% in the first quarter of 2021, up from 1.3% in the previous quarter, but gross state product is forecast to decline heading into 2022. Despite the forecast decline, the model predicts relative stability in total tax collections.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Supporters of a proposal to legalize marijuana got the green light Monday to collect signatures to place the measure before state lawmakers. The Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol’s proposed statute was approved as a single issue by the Ohio Ballot Board, a panel of legislative appointees led by Secretary of State Frank LaRose. The group will soon begin collecting the 132,887 signatures of registered Ohio voters needed to submit the proposed law to the Legislature. If the Legislature doesn’t pass or passes an amended version of the bill, supporters can collect another 132,887 signatures to put the proposal before voters, likely in November 2022. The proposal would allow adults age 21 and older to buy, grow, possess and consume marijuana. Proceeds of a 10% tax on marijuana would go to education, addiction treatment and municipalities with marijuana businesses. Municipalities could limit or ban marijuana businesses within their borders. Ohio’s medical marijuana businesses, several of which are backing the plan, could automatically get licenses for the recreational side. The bill establishes 40 new cultivation licenses and 50 additional dispensary licenses for economically and socially disadvantaged “social equity” applicants. Additional licenses could be granted two years later.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Hospitals are again overwhelmed as the spread of COVID-19 is surging through the state, but this time, they’re facing the wave with even further strain on health care workers. The state has dealt with a nursing shortage for at least two decades, Oklahoma nursing leaders said. But the pandemic has worsened it, with the stresses driving some burned-out nurses out of the industry or to other states, amid greater demands on the health care system. “The pandemic has brought on some extra stresses that we had no way of predicting, and that has impacted our retention rates enormously,” said Shelly Wells, president of the Oklahoma Nurses Association. “For example, I don’t think that humans were meant to see as much death as our nurses have seen, personally, in the last 16 months.” A nurse working in a hospital in normal times might expect to care for a dying patient once a week, Wells said. “These patients are dying much more frequently,” she said. “There’s no family support, so the nurses are having to double as family and offer that support” on top of caring for the patients themselves. And it can be especially troubling to care for someone your age or younger “that you know is probably not going to live,” said Elain Richardson, regional chief nursing officer with SSM Health St. Anthony.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Record-low numbers of steelhead are returning to the Columbia River this year, prompting conservationists and anglers alike to call for a halt to recreational fishing for the sea-run fish. As of last week, just 29,000 steelhead passed the Bonneville Dam since July 1 – the fewest ever recorded, less than half the average of the past five years, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. A coalition of conservation and fishing groups sent a letter to the Oregon, Washington and Idaho agencies that manage fish and wildlife requesting an immediate closure of recreational steelhead fisheries on the Columbia River, the Lower Snake River and their tributaries. “This is a really, really dire year for steelhead – especially wild steelhead – in the Columbia River Basin,” said Rob Kirschner, legal and policy director for The Conservation Angler, which advocates for protection and restoration of wild fish in the Pacific Northwest and Kamchatka, Russia. “We are trying to protect every eligible spawner,” he said. “Every one of these fish counts.” Steelhead on the Columbia and Snake rivers are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Their population has been devastated by habitat destruction, including construction of hydroelectric dams, as well as overfishing and climate change. High water temperatures have also been detrimental.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Hundreds of thousands of residents will lose federal pandemic unemployment benefits after this week, including an extra $300 per week, an extra 13 weeks of benefits and coverage for the self-employed. Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said Monday that there are sources of help for people who need it once their jobless aid runs out, including federal rental assistance through counties, Medicaid, food stamps and temporary cash-assistance for low-income families. In the first week of August, roughly 640,000 people were receiving the extra $300, according to figures from the state Department of Labor and Industry. About 388,000 of them were in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for freelancers or the self-employed, and almost 175,000 were receiving an extra 13 weeks of assistance through the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. About 78,000 people were receiving benefits through the state’s regular 26-week unemployment compensation program, which will continue running, but without the extra $300 federal benefit on top. The American Rescue Plan Act, signed by President Joe Biden in March, extended those federal benefits and set them to expire after this week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee’s chief of staff, who is under scrutiny for whether he used his political clout to push through a development approval on some wetlands owned by his family, has stepped down, the governor’s office announced Monday. Anthony Silva maintains he did nothing wrong in the approval process, but the issue had become a distraction, the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Tony and I reached a mutual agreement that it is in the best interest of the administration for him to retire from state government effective immediately,” the statement said. “Right now, his situation is a distraction from the critical work we have ahead. I appreciate that Tony understands the need to remove the distraction to ensure we can continue serving Rhode Islanders effectively.” Silva once had an agreement to purchase the property in Cumberland – where McKee was once mayor and Silva was police chief. After the state Department of Environmental Management issued the necessary approvals, the property was purchased by Silva’s son, Ross. Town officials as well as neighbors oppose building on the land, saying developing it would exacerbate flooding problems in the area, and were concerned that Silva and his family got preferential treatment from the state environmental agency.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in the state has the Department of Motor Vehicles changing how it gives road tests for driver’s licenses. The agency started requiring masks for both new drivers and examiners Wednesday. As of Monday, it is again requiring appointments for driving tests, and on Sept. 7 the department will go back to how it handled testing at the start of the pandemic, with the examiner outside the car, the DMV said in a statement. The modified skills test evaluates the same abilities as the regular test, with the examiner scoring the test from outside, the DMV said. The agency is encouraging but not requiring masks inside its branches. Officials also said many basic services, like driver’s license renewal, can be done online.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers tasked with redrawing the state’s political boundaries set a framework Monday that will allow them to speed through the once-in-a-decade process on a tight schedule this year. The two committees responsible for drawing the new legislative districts began their work in earnest Monday after the U.S. Census Bureau released detailed data earlier this month. Lawmakers only have about 10 weeks to propose districts before a special session of the Legislature convenes Nov. 8. The Census Bureau’s data was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re in for a very compact and a very intense schedule over the next two months to get all this accomplished,” Republican Sen. Jim Bolin told the committees, which met jointly Monday. Republican lawmakers cited the shortened process in setting two parameters that will guide their work: keeping new legislative districts between a lower threshold of 24,066 residents and an upper threshold of 26,600 people, and restricting access to the Legislature’s map-drawing software to committee members only. Legislative research staff said they were worried their work would get bogged down if the general public were allowed to propose maps through its software and said people could create their own proposals with other open-source applications.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Cummins Falls State Park has been named state park of the year. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation honored the Cookeville park for effectively managing an increase in visitors and overcrowding while enhancing safety measures, the department said in a news release Thursday. The 306-acre park in middle Tennessee used social media to inform people of river conditions, scheduled programs and activities. It also conducted more than 250 interpretation programs, held day camps for children and school programs, and hosted a weekly home-school group, officials said. Cummins Falls also has removed invasive plants, planted native species, built two greenhouses, and grown and processed sorghum, officials said. Cummins Falls is one of 56 state parks in Tennessee. It is one of several state parks honored with a 2021 Award of Excellence at a recent park management conference at Pickwick Landing State Park.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Black arts community is pushing to create a cultural center at the music venue Kenny Dorham’s Backyard, amid broader work for equity in the city’s cultural arts programs and historic preservation in East Austin. “Everybody says the words equity, sustainability. But it turns out, if there’s no intention, no action behind it, it means nothing,” City Council Member Natasha Harper-Madison told a diverse crowd of arts supporters in July as they gathered to celebrate the return of Black contemporary dance company Ballet Afrique to East Austin. “We have so much work to do to make this a truly equitable and truly inclusive city that lives up to our progressive reputation.” In 2019, the city contracted with an outside consultant, MJR Partners, to conduct a review of city-allocated cultural arts and heritage funding. An interim report released in June outlines strategies to achieve greater equity, as well as some of the challenges the city will face. The report notes that “traditional and white-led institutions struggle to accept that historic inequities exist in the city.” “I think the city is really trying,” said Carl Settles, director of the nonprofit E4 Youth, which aims to build bridges between underprivileged area youths and Austin’s creative and tech industries.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: Two recently married Utah women were found dead from gunshot wounds after reports of a “weirdo camping near them” and a four-day search in Moab, about an hour away from Arches National Park. On Wednesday, 38-year-old Crystal Turner and 24-year-old Kylen Schulte were found by a family friend in the South Mesa area of La Sal Loop Road, where they had been camping. Schulte and Turner went missing Aug. 14, four days before they were found dead from gunshot wounds, according to the Grand County Sheriff’s Office. Schulte’s father had posted on Facebook that they hadn’t been to work, hadn’t called, were not in the hospital and were not in jail. “Kylen and Crystal told close friends that there was a weirdo camping near them that was freaking them out !!! And that they should move campsites. Now they have been missing for over 4 days and nights!” Sean-Paul Schulte posted. The couple’s bodies were transported to the Medical Examiner’s Office, which determined the cause of death to be gunshot wounds, the Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nVermont\n\nVergennes: The city is planning to erect a monument to the state’s first known black sheriff and chief of police. The city of Vergennes is planning to unveil and dedicate the monument to former Sheriff Stephen Bates on Oct. 3. Bates was first elected sheriff and chief of police in Vergennes in 1879. Bates had been formerly enslaved in Virginia. He gained his freedom and served Union soldiers during the Civil War. He first came to Vergennes in 1866 with Vermont U.S. Rep. Frederick E. Woodbridge. Bates served as sheriff of Vergennes for 25 years. He raised a family in the city before his death in 1907, and some of his descendants will be attending the event. A local team of historians and others spent the past year researching Bates’ life and rediscovering his story in Vergennes.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe has asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Virginia Republicans that seeks to remove him from the ballot in this year’s closely watched race for governor over an alleged paperwork error. In a filing Friday evening, attorneys for the former governor now running for a second term against GOP nominee Glenn Youngkin said the suit was based on a “legal lie” and would effectively invalidate hundreds of thousands of votes cast in the Democratic primary. The complaint filed last week by the Republican Party of Virginia against state election officials argued that McAuliffe should be disqualified from running in the November general election because of the omission of his signature on an official form declaring his candidacy. McAuliffe argued in his filing that nothing in Virginia code requires a candidate to sign the declaration of candidacy. Further, the filing said: “Even if there were a technical defect with the declaration of candidacy – and there is not – it would provide no basis for removing McAuliffe’s name from the general election ballot and preventing Virginia’s voters from choosing him as their next Governor. The declaration of candidacy is a prerequisite for placement on the ballot in the primary election, not the general election, and the primary election has already concluded.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Hundreds of people gathered at the state Capitol on Saturday to protest Gov. Jay Inslee’s vaccine mandate. Announced in early August, Inslee’s order requires most state workers, health care workers and school employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 18 or face losing their jobs. Inslee has said getting people vaccinated is essential for getting Washington past the pandemic. Organizers of the rally Saturday warned that a large segment of state workers, including many firefighters, sanitation workers and bus drivers, won’t get the vaccine – as much as 30% to 40% statewide, they said. It wasn’t clear what that estimate was based on. “If the Governor refuses to rescind his mandate, it will mean that multiple areas of the state will be severely reduced or shut down completely,” Tyler Miller, of the group Liberty, At All Hazards, said in a news release. “The Governor is unnecessarily threatening the genuine safety and well-being of the citizens of Washington if he forces his mandate to stand.” Inslee spokesman Mike Faulk defended the need for the mandate. “Employees are losing their lives to COVID. Hospitals are filling up. Communities are stressed by the pandemic’s impacts. The safest and most effective way to get beyond these tragic circumstances is vaccination,” Faulk said in a statement.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Residents who landscape for wildlife use can have their land designated a “wild yard.” The program already has 300 members around the state and is operated through the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources to create more natural habitat for wildlife around the state. “It’s such a wonderful program to get involved in,” Rebecca Linger, who owns a certified wild yard, said in a news release from the agency. “And you get the added benefit of creating an environment around your house where you can enjoy seeing wildlife coming and going. It really is delightful.” Jim Fregonara, a wildlife biologist with the division, said landowners who apply, provide a habitat plan and demonstrate that their property meets the needs of native wildlife will be added to a register of wild yards. They also receive a certificate for participating in the program and a sign post to display in the yard. “We want to encourage private citizens, whether they have a little bit of property or own a lot of land, to help wildlife thrive by providing them with food, water, shelter and space,” Fregonara said.

Tony Evers said Monday. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have criticized the vetting process and warned about terrorists being allowed into the country. After a tour of the Wisconsin base last week, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson questioned whether the refugees at Fort McCoy had been fully vetted and called White House assurances about the process “lipstick on a pig.” Evers also toured the base last week and met with refugees. He said Republicans criticizing the vetting of those refugees are “vastly uninformed.” “Or they like to raise that specter of maybe some of those little kids I saw at Fort McCoy are terrorists, or maybe those adults that I saw at Fort McCoy who were working hand in hand with our soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan, somehow they are terrorists even though they’ve been vetted four or five or six times even before they left Afghanistan,” Evers said. “To me, it’s dog whistle crap, and we don’t need any of that.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Donations are pouring in for the widow and unborn child of a U.S. Marine killed in a bombing in Afghanistan. Rylee McCollum, 20, was among 13 service members killed by a suicide bomb attack Thursday at the Kabul airport. The troops were providing security as the airport was overwhelmed with people trying to leave the country amid the U.S. withdrawal and Taliban takeover. McCollum was from Bondurant and expecting his first child in three weeks, according to his family. Almost $687,000 had been raised through two online fundraising campaigns, one for the child’s future education costs and one for McCollum’s widow, as of Tuesday morning. McCollum was on his first deployment and manning a checkpoint at the airport when the attack happened, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. McCollum attended Jackson Hole High School and competed as a wrestler. He graduated in 2019 from Summit Innovations School in Jackson.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/13/golden-spike-anniversary-lake-monster-mister-rogers-news-around-states/39474531/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The funeral for one of the first black members of the state Legislature will be held in the same church where his daughter died in a racist bombing in 1963. A service for Chris McNair will be held Friday at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. McNair’s daughter, Denise McNair, was among four black girls killed when Ku Klux Klansmen bombed the church Sept. 15, 1963. A surviving daughter, Lisa McNair, said Friday that her father planned his funeral and wanted it held at the church. She says he appreciated the historical significance of the church. Chris McNair became one of the first African-American members of Alabama’s Legislature since Reconstruction when he was elected in 1973. He died Wednesday at age 93.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The mysterious animal people say they see in Iliamna Lake is dark, longer than 15 feet, with a long head and tail and distinct fins. It isn’t a whale or a seal, and it often vanishes quickly. Fishermen have tried hooking it. The Anchorage Daily News once offered $100,000 for proof of its existence. But so far, nobody has photographed the creature some call the Iliamna Lake monster. Palmer resident Bruce Wright, a former marine ecologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, hopes to solve the riddle once and for all this summer by sinking an underwater video camera to the bottom of the sprawling, sparsely lake, the largest and one of the deepest in the state. People call Iliamna Lake an inland sea. It’s 80 miles long, with a rare population of freshwater harbor seals that scientists believe moved in from the ocean long ago, and an old legend that something large lives in its 1,000-foot depths.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The public is sending mixed messages to the U.S. Forest Service about the future of a popular but primitive recreation area in central Arizona. Some people are calling for more infrastructure improvements at Fossil Creek near Camp Verde, while others want more solitude. The Arizona Daily Sun reports Forest Service officials are analyzing the nearly 220 public comments submitted for the development of a long-term management plan. It’s expected to be complete early next year. Fossil Creek project manager Marcos Roybal says some people want more parking, restrooms and other infrastructure projects, while others are concerned about the possible negative effects of increasing visitor numbers. According to agency data, Fossil Creek averages nearly 8,000 visitors a month between May and October when permits are required.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: The state’s first dispensary has opened two and a half years after voters approved a measure legalizing medical marijuana for certain qualifying conditions. About 100 people lined up in the rain outside Doctor’s Orders RX in Hot Springs on its first official day of business Saturday, as wait times and confusion about the dispensary’s hours frustrated some people. Despite reports that the dispensary was scheduled to open at 8 a.m., employees said they didn’t plan on opening until 10 a.m. One employee also said he expected to process no more than six patients an hour through the state-required electronic tracking system. Some people said they’d been in line since before dawn. On Friday, the state approved another dispensary, Green Springs Medical, and owner Dragan Vicentic has said he plans to open Monday morning.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOjai: This artsy Southern California city is so safe that a single attempt by teens to steal beer accounted for the majority of its violent crimes last year. Sheriff’s Capt. James Fryhoff says that “a beer run that went bad” accounted for four of the six crimes. The teens allegedly went into a gas station mart to steal beer and used a skateboard to beat an employee who confronted them and hit a witness who called 911. That tallied up as two robberies and two assaults with a deadly weapon. Fryhoff serves as police chief of Ojai, a community of just under 7,700 residents in a scenic valley northwest of Los Angeles. It’s best known for galleries, boutiques and outdoor recreation that draw tourists.\n\nColorado\n\nAlamosa: Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve has been recognized for its unpolluted views of the night sky. KOAA-TV reports the International Dark-Sky Association announced Thursday that it has designated the southern Colorado park as an International Dark Sky Park. Park Superintendent Pamela Rice says the park is an ideal place to view the stars because of its dry air, high elevation and lack of light pollution. The park is planning to hold a celebration of the recognition this summer.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: A school violence prevention program started by parents whose children were killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre is receiving a $25,000 donation. The gift from the Wireless Zone Foundation will be presented to Sandy Hook Promise on Monday. The donation is earmarked to support the training of youth and adults in Sandy Hook Promise’s Know the Signs program, which is designed to help decrease violence, bullying and other forms of victimization, while strengthening school communities. More than 7.5 million people in more than 14,000 schools and youth organizations have gone through the training, learning techniques to reduce bullying and cyberbullying and help identify those as risk to commit violence, including school shootings.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes Beach: Residents of this beach community have the usual concerns about parking and littering as the summer tourism season begins. But the residents of Lewes Beach are also concerned that beach visitors will continue using the dunes as an outhouse. Lifelong resident JuneRose Futcher says residents are “very worried about the public toileting.” She says the city of Lewes needs to look after residents first. When residents confront people going to the bathroom in the dunes, Futcher says they don’t care. Town officials say there’s no room for more parking or public bathrooms. Resident Mark Schaeffer says a comprehensive land use plan would help Lewes Beach, which has homes ranging from quaint coastal cottages to waterfront villas that list for about $2 million.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A Jordanian American writer is facing a backlash after she posted a picture on Twitter of a public transit worker eating on a Washington Metro train and reported details about the employee to her bosses. Natasha Tynes apologized a day later on Twitter and deleted her post before making her account private. But people online were upset that someone who calls herself a “minority writer” would shame a black woman and possibly cause her to lose her job. The Washington Post reports the publishing house distributing her debut novel dropped her, and her publisher delayed the book’s planned release. Union officials say the woman was on the train to get to another assignment and had just 20 minutes to eat. Tynes told the Associated Press on Sunday that she didn’t want to talk.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed a bill that would have prevented local governments from banning plastic straws. DeSantis rejected the environmental regulation bill Friday, marking his first veto since taking office this year. The legislation originally addressed issues with contaminated recyclable materials but was amended to include a moratorium on local regulations of single-use plastic straws until 2024. A legislative analysis of the bill lists 10 Florida cities with straw bans, including Miami Beach, St. Petersburg and Fort Lauderdale. DeSantis wrote in the veto that the bans hadn’t frustrated any state policy or harmed state interests. He said the Florida Department of Environmental Protection is encouraging residents to reduce plastic straw use, and residents who oppose the bans should elect new city commissioners.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Executives from three production companies say they won’t film in the state because of its “heartbeat” abortion ban. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports they include David Simon of Blown Deadline, Christine Vachon of Killer Films and Mark Duplass of Duplass Brothers Productions. The boycotts aren’t likely to have an immediate effect because the companies don’t regularly work in Georgia. Killer Films and Duplass Brothers Productions specialize in independent films. Simon’s company has produced HBO series such as “The Wire.” The Georgia law will ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually about six weeks into a pregnancy. Critics say it’s unconstitutional and have vowed to sue. The Motion Picture Association of America represents major studios and is taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Legislation meant to protect the state’s shark population was altered at the 11th hour to remove the apex predators from the bill amid concerns from the scientific community. West Hawaii Today reports the bill was intended to extend protections already in place for manta rays to include all rays and sharks. It would have made it illegal to “capture, take, possess, abuse, or entangle any shark, whether alive or dead, or kill any shark, within state marine waters,” the measure says. There were exceptions for academic research, but the scientific community found them inadequate. University of Hawaii shark researcher Kim Holland said that researchers would be forced to apply for state permits from personnel without scientific expertise and that the bill was too ambiguous in defining terms like “harassment.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s the perfect time of year for morel mushrooms to start springing up in the state as soil temperatures warm, and already competition to find the tasty, coveted fungi is heating up. Members of online Idaho morel-hunting groups have been posting their finds for a few weeks, the Idaho Statesman reports. Excited commenters will ask at what elevation the honeycomb-capped mushrooms were found and perhaps what region of the state. But there’s one question you’d better not bother asking: Where’d you find them? “If you have to ask … you will never know,” one commenter wrote in a Facebook group for Idaho morel hunters. In the world of morels, much like in fishing, game hunting or even huckleberry picking, the whereabouts of fruitful caches are kept secret.\n\nIllinois\n\nEvanston: An escaped pet snake that apparently slithered into a suburban Chicago family’s washing machine ended up smelling like fabric softener after going through the wash. Sanela Kamencic tells WMAQ-TV she was “totally creeped out” when the snake turned up Wednesday in the washing machine in Evanston. Police Officer Pedro Carrasco and Animal Control Warden Jason Pound brought the reptile to the Chicago Exotics Animal Hospital. Carrasco says it was “peeking its head out of the washing machine” when it was found. Pound says it “smelled like Downy” after surviving the wash cycle. Veterinarian Melissa Giese tells radio station WBBM the snake was “in pretty good shape” and “really feisty.” The animal hospital says the corn snake, named Penelope, belonged to a 12-year-old boy who lives nearby. They were reunited afterward.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An elephant at the Indianapolis Zoo has tested positive for a virus that killed two other elephants at the zoo in March. Kedar, a 13-year-old male African elephant, tested negative for elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus until May 6, the zoo said. Zoo staff had been testing elephants twice a week for the virus since the deaths of Kalina and Nyah. “Kedar is receiving aggressive treatment to help him fight the virus,” said Dr. Rob Shumaker, president of the zoo, which is now conducting daily blood tests on all the elephants in its herd. The virus causes fatal hemorrhagic disease in elephants, mainly Asian elephants. It is one of the most devastating viral diseases in elephants. There is no vaccine for it, and it is not preventable. It has an 85% mortality rate.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A new building in the East Village neighborhood is the first in the U.S. built using a unique type of mass timber – an eco-friendly material becoming more popular as developers look to reduce their carbon footprints. Mass timber is made by pressing smaller planks of wood together. It can be glued or nailed. In this case, the timber was pressed together using dowels. There are about 200 mass timber buildings across 36 states, but the Des Moines building was the first to use the dowel-laminated product. About 11% of global carbon emissions each year come from concrete and steel manufacturing, says Mark Wishnie, director of forestry and wood products for The Nature Conservancy, and “you also create a new carbon storage pool” with mass timber. During photosynthesis, trees absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The carbon stays in the wood, even after the tree is cut down.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A government report forecasts a bountiful winter wheat harvest in the state. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported Friday that this year’s wheat crop is expected to be up 17% from a year ago. It predicted Kansas growers would bring in 323 million bushels. The agency forecast the state’s average yield at 49 bushels per acre, up 11 bushels from last year. It also anticipated that grain would be harvested from 6.6 million acres in Kansas, down 700,000 acres from a year ago. The government’s estimate is a bit more optimistic than the one put out by participants in last week’s winter wheat tour who estimated the size of the Kansas crop at 306.5 million bushels.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A historic commission says a Confederate statue can be removed from a prominent location. The Louisville Metro Landmarks Commission voted 5-3 on Thursday to allow removal of John B. Castleman’s monument from a neighborhood traffic circle. Hours later, the statue was vandalized with paint for the fifth time since a 2017 deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The commission’s decision is final unless it’s appealed to a Circuit Court within 30 days. Castleman was a Confederate soldier and later a U.S. general. He helped found Louisville’s park system. Mayor Greg Fischer’s administration has pushed to relocate the statue because of Castleman’s ties to the Confederacy and support of slavery. The city is working to move the statue to Cave Hill Cemetery, where Castleman is buried.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Hank Williams’ iconic “Jambalaya (On the Bayou)” won’t become one of the state’s official songs. Republican Sen. Norby Chabert, of Terrebonne Parish, told The Advocate he’s shelving the proposal for this legislative session. Louisiana already has two official state songs: “Give Me Louisiana” and “You Are My Sunshine.” Chabert’s proposal chafed some who objected to adding another song, particularly those who love “You Are My Sunshine.” It was sung by Jimmie Davis, a country singer from Jackson Parish who served two terms as governor. Williams released “Jambalaya” in 1952, and it was the best-selling record for 14 weeks. It’s often played at Louisiana functions, particularly in southern parishes, because of its celebration of the region’s culture.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state is turning 200, and officials want to make sure the Pine Tree State celebrates the big birthday with the best flag possible. Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap is asking the public for input on three proposed designs for the commemorative flag, which will be on display around the state in 2020. Maine became a state in 1820. Dunlap is charged with presenting a final decision about the flags to the Legislature and Maine Bicentennial Commission. The state says the result of the public vote will play a major role in Dunlap’s decision. Dunlap says the voting has begun, and it is scheduled to end at 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Ever since a townhome developer in the 1980s dug up a cemetery on the former grounds of the county’s first African-American church, two skeletons have been sitting in boxes archived in a museum. After searching for decades, historian Janice Hayes-Williams’ new mission is to get the remains back to their proper resting place in Annapolis and restore dignity for black families whose neighborhood was destroyed by gentrification. The plan for the return relies on extracting DNA and matching it with the living ancestors of those buried on the property that is now home to City Gate Lane townhouses. County Executive Steuart Pittman and Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley plan to ask Gov. Larry Hogan to put Maryland State Highway Administration Chief Archaeologist Julie Schablitsky on the case.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A performing arts group has found the child who was literally wowed by a recent classical music concert. The Handel & Haydn Society had just finished a rendition of Mozart’s “Masonic Funeral” at Symphony Hall when a youngster blurted out: “WOW!” The group was so charmed that it launched a search for the “Wow Child” with the help of audio of the moment captured by WCRB-FM. The child is 9-year-old Ronan Mattin, of New Hampshire, WGBH-FM reports. He attended the concert with his grandfather Stephen, who saw a report on TV about the society looking for the child. Stephen Mattin said Ronan is on the autism spectrum and expresses himself differently from how other people do. He said his grandson is a huge music fan. The society will invite Ronan and his family back to the venue in October, when the 2019-2020 season opens, for another Mozart performance.\n\nMichigan\n\nMuskegon: A museum housed on a World War II-era warship is bringing a massive anti-aircraft gun aboard. The USS LST 393 Veterans Museum in Muskegon is adding an 18,000-pound anti-aircraft cannon to its landing ship tank this summer. The Muskegon Chronicle reports that the Bofors twin-barreled anti-aircraft cannon is currently being restored. The museum aims to have the gun lifted onto the ship ahead of the celebration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day, which will be held June 1-2. Board member John Stephenson says the museum has searched for a Bofors cannon since 2005. The warship would’ve carried multiple Bofors when entering battle during World War II. It was part of the Allied Forces’ D-Day invasion in Normandy, France, that weakened the Nazi’s hold on Western Europe in 1944.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The top Republican in the state Senate, who helped defeat a proposed ban on so-called gay conversion therapy for minors, sent his daughter to a therapist opposed to gay relationships after suspecting she had a same-sex attraction when she was a teenager, the Star Tribune reports. Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a conservative Christian from Nisswa, led his caucus in voting down a Democratic proposal May 1 against the practice of trying to turn gay people straight. Genna Gazelka, 30, who uses the pronoun “they” and now identifies as bi-gender, recalled being sent to a therapist who decried same-sex relations. The therapist was Marcus Bachmann, the husband of former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a fiery conservative Christian who ran for president in 2012. “This is harassment, and it is tantamount to what could be said of torture or sexual torture,” Genna Gazelka said of conversion therapy.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A total of 28 counties and cities in northeast Mississippi have criminalized the possession and sale of kratom, a legal but unregulated herbal product. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the governments are being urged to action by the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics and a Columbus-area anti-Kratom group. Bills to ban the substance statewide failed this year in the Legislature. Kratom is produced from the leaves of a tropical tree and consumed as a powder, a liquid or capsules. Supporters of kratom say it provides safe, non-addictive pain relief and can also combat anxiety disorders. Some kratom users also say it manages the withdrawal symptoms of potent opiate drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the substance may be addictive and prone to abuse.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city’s school district has found its public and charter schools are increasingly racially segregated, expensive to operate and losing high school students. KCUR-FM reports the district released a new analysis showing that 78% of schools in the Kansas City system were racially segregated by 2017, well over the 32% of schools in 1999. The report says it’s in part due to white families opting out of the system. Only 10% of the city’s public school students are white. The analysis also says Kansas City spends $80 million more on administration, transportation and overhead than the comparably sized Springfield district. The report attributes high costs to inefficiencies from operating 83 schools, compared to Springfield’s 53. Public schools have been losing nearly half of all students between kindergarten and 12th grade.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock signed a series of bills Friday that allow for spending nearly $400 million on buildings, bridges and water systems across the state – an effort aimed at creating jobs, boosting the state’s economy and clearing up a backlog of needed work. The bills include money to repair or replace 14 bridges and 51 water, wastewater and sewer projects. Overall, the 2019 Legislature passed $2.7 billion in infrastructure projects, including highway projects. Other projects include $25 million for long-sought renovations to Romney Hall at Montana State University; a dental hygiene lab at Great Falls College; and backlogged maintenance at state buildings, including $2 million for the state Capitol complex.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A new report says a nearly $200 million decline in the state’s agricultural exports in 2017 was driven by President Donald Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The Nebraska Farm Bureau report attributes the drop to decreases in soybean and corn exports, while beef and pork exports both increased in 2017. The bureau’s senior economist, Jay Rempe, says Trump’s talks of tariffs in January 2017 caused a decline in soybean and other commodity prices. Rempe points out that China’s retaliatory tariffs didn’t occur until May 2018. Rempe says Nebraska’s agricultural community will continue to face pressure unless the administration resolves its trade disputes with China, Mexico and other countries.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The governor signed a law Friday opening the books on those awarded lucrative licenses to sell recreational marijuana, prompting the state tax department to reveal that just 16 applicants won all 61 new pot dispensary licenses awarded last year. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said the measure ushers in a “new era of transparency that will benefit the industry and the public alike.” The new law makes public the identity of marijuana license applicants and the method the state uses to score and rank bids. The licensing process has faced complaints from companies who say it is not clear what criteria officials used to award licenses. In lawsuits, the companies accuse the state of unconstitutionally picking winners and losers for the marijuana licenses. Sisolak declined Friday to comment on specifics of the pending litigation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: The Department of Environmental Services has closed the state’s ocean coastline and Hampton-Seabrook Harbor to shellfish harvesting because of a toxin that comes from what’s known as red tide. New Hampshire Public Radio reports the DES found high levels of the toxin, which causes paralytic shellfish poisoning. It was recently found in mussel samples. Chris Nash, shellfish program manager at the department, says it comes from toxic algae. The waters will be closed for the rest of May, which will affect soft shell clamming season. Some oyster harvesting areas remain open in Great Bay and Little Bay. The DES says paralytic shellfish poisoning is a life-threatening syndrome. It says the onset of symptoms is rapid, usually within two hours of consumption. Symptoms include tingling, burning, numbness, drowsiness, incoherent speech and respiratory paralysis.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A microorganism that played a role in treating tuberculosis is now officially recognized as the state microbe. Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill Friday giving the distinction to Streptomyces griseus. The microbe was discovered in New Jersey soil in 1916. In 1943, researchers from Rutgers University used the microbe to create the antibiotic streptomycin. Tuberculosis death rates in the U.S. plummeted. They fell from about 194 deaths per 100,000 people in 1900 to about 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 1955. Rutgers researcher Selman Waksman was awarded the 1952 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering the microbe and creating the antibiotic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRio Grande del Norte National Monument: Rafting and angler guides are predicting a good season for Rio Grande tourism in the state thanks to strong runoff generated by a good snowmelt this year. A healthy snow patch this winter is feeding the Rio Grande with much-needed water after long dry spells stemming from drought, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. This year, the National Weather Service in Albuquerque predicts runoff to be at least 148% of normal through June. Water levels were 50% of normal in 2018. Parts of rivers were bone dry or only inches high. Fish – such as trout in the Pecos River – died off, and long sandbars formed along once-wet areas. In addition to tourism, strong runoff is predicted to help the ecosystem around the river and its banks. University of New Mexico biology researcher Rebecca Bixby says the increased flow will help the endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow lay eggs and spawn.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The workers who spent their time helping with recovery efforts at ground zero are being commemorated on special-issue transit system MetroCards. The cards will be available starting Wednesday at 10 subway stations, mostly in the area of the World Trade Center site, the Daily News reports. The special MetroCards are connected to the upcoming opening of a glade at the national Sept. 11 memorial that pays tribute to the rescue and recovery workers. The 9/11 Memorial Glade is scheduled to formally open May 30, the anniversary of the day in 2002 when the recovery effort was officially ended. The MetroCards include images of four different people who worked at the site.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNew Bern: Almost 2,000 students will receive scholarships to take a field trip to Tryon Palace, the state’s first permanent capitol. Tryon Palace officials say 1,775 students at 16 Title I schools will receive scholarships to visit the historic site. Title I schools meet certain guidelines for the number of students who are economically disadvantaged. The Tryon Palace Foundation raised the money for the field trips with donations from individuals. The foundation president says the field trips are important because experiencing history is different from merely reading about it. Most of the schools receiving the scholarships are in eastern North Carolina. Applications to attend a field trip next year will be accepted Aug. 15 through Sept. 30.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: An imitation B-52 bomber and an oil derrick will be showcased in the proposed Magic City Discovery Center, according to recently unveiled concept plans. The Minot Daily News reports that the children’s museum’s board president, Mark Lyman, says the project has raised nearly two-thirds of the $7 million needed for the three-story, 22,000-square-foot facility. Lyman says groundbreaking will happen on a gill just south of the Minot airport once the project has raised 75% to 80% of the intended funding target. Paul Orselli, chief instigator with POW!, detailed a 35-foot climbing structure with a B-52 at the top that will be viewed through the multi-story, glassed-in atrium.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: French and American teams are working together again on a D-Day project, this time to allow some virtual time travel back to that decisive moment in world history. Visitors to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton can use French-developed tablet technology when the museum begins its commemorations of D-Day on Monday. Events include paratroopers dropping from a vintage plane flying overhead and showings of movies about the June 6, 1944, assault that helped end World War II. Tablets called HistoPads let users contrast current views of historic sites with detailed re-creations of them, enhanced in this case with video footage, photos and maps from 1944. This will be the first U.S. site for HistoPads.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Department of Corrections is asking federal lawmakers to authorize the use of cellphone signal jamming technology after being bombarded by an overflow of smuggled cellular devices they say gangs use to commit crimes inside and outside prison. The Oklahoman reports that since 2011, the Corrections Department has seized over 48,500 prohibited cellphones, including almost 1,800 since January. In 2016, correctional officers removed a record high of 9,766 cellphones. Corrections officials across the U.S. have cited cellphones as a reason for violent crimes behind bars and on the streets.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state Supreme Court disagreed with more than 50 years of state case law by ruling that Oregonians retain a privacy interest in the garbage they leave on the curb for pickup. That means police can’t simply rummage through it even after a truck hauls it away. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the court wrote Thursday that the state’s residents have a reasonable expectation that after they leave their trash in opaque bins covered with a lid, no one will inspect it without a warrant. The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Tracy Lynn Lien and Travis Allen Wilverding, who shared a home and were convicted of methamphetamine dealing after police from Lebanon asked the community’s garbage hauling company, Republic Services, to pick up and set aside the contents of the pair’s garbage on collection day in 2014.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLatrobe: Residents of Fred Rogers’ home state will be encouraged to exhibit acts of kindness in honor of the beloved PBS children’s show host. Gov. Tom Wolf said Friday that the state’s website will share stories of good deeds and kind gestures May 23 for “1-4-3 Day,” named for Mister Rogers’ favorite number. Rogers used the number 143 to say “I love you,” as each digit reflects the number of letters in each word in the phrase. May 23 is the 143rd day of the year. The Fred Rogers Trail highlights locations in his hometown of Latrobe and in Pittsburgh, where “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” was produced. The show aired from 1968 to 2001. Rogers, an ordained minister, is buried at Latrobe Presbyterian Church. He died in 2003 at age 74.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: The yogurt company Chobani plans to pay the school lunch debts of low-income families with students attending a district that made headlines by announcing children who owe money would get cold sunflower butter and jelly sandwiches instead of a hot meal, the mayor’s office confirmed Friday. Mayor Joseph Solomon’s office said it’s coordinating with Chobani to accept nearly $50,000, the amount owed by low-income families with children in Warwick Public Schools. Chobani founder and CEO Hamdi Ulukaya tweeted Thursday that as a parent, the news broke his heart. Access to nutritious food should be a right, not a privilege, he said. Chobani was but one of the businesses and organizations that offered to donate money to the district, officials said. After a public backlash, Warwick Public Schools reversed the cold-lunch decision last week.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The city’s police agency says it is using technology to combat and reduce gun violence. During a news conference Friday, the Columbia Police Department announced it’s using ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection technology that uses acoustics to detect, locate and alert law enforcement about gunfire in real time. Officials say data is transmitted wirelessly and verified, triangulated and reported to police within approximately 45 seconds. Police Chief Skip Holbrook says the city council approved the department’s acquisition of the technology in September 2018, and it has been implementing the system north of the capital city. He says it’s currently the only agency using the technology. Holbrook says police have received 131 alerts, detected 339 shots and seized 11 firearms since deploying the technology April 18.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: An animal rights group is asking Gov. Kristi Noem to reconsider her decision to shoot off fireworks at Mount Rushmore for the Fourth of July celebration in 2020. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said Friday that its president sent a letter to Noem suggesting she consider replacing the fireworks with a drone show. The letter from Ingrid Newkirk said fireworks can scare animals and start wildfires, among other hazards. Newkirk said drone shows are safer and don’t cause pollution. Noem spokesman Joshua Shields called PETA’s suggestion “puzzling” and said forest animals might not react well to “hundreds of drones buzzing and blinking” around the monument at night.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Supreme Court has ruled that city school districts don’t have to share money they receive from liquor taxes with county governments. News outlets report the opinion this week settles five lawsuits filed by Blount, Bradley, Sullivan, Washington and Coffee counties. State law calls for the Department of Revenue to keep half the proceeds from liquor-by-the-drink taxes for general education funds and return the other half to the originating city or county. The counties argued that the state law required cities to share the revenue with counties. The Supreme Court disagreed. Justice Holly Kirby wrote that since cities make the money, they are entitled to the proceeds. The ruling applies to all 95 counties and 43 cities that operate independent school districts.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Federal Aviation Administration has not passed a new safety regulation that legislators say would fortify supervision of the hot-air balloon industry and help avoid fatal crashes similar to a crash that killed 16 people in the state almost three years ago. The agency’s indecision triggered an irritated response from Texas U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who sent a letter to the FAA’s acting administrator asking what was causing the extended delay, the Houston Chronicle reports. Doggett helped create bipartisan legislation that requires medical exams for commercial balloon pilots, who have been exempt from health screenings since the 1930s. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the balloon’s pilot was as impaired by prescription medications as a drunk driver when he ignored weather warnings and flew the ride into a power line.\n\nUtah\n\nPromontory: Music, bells and cannon fire rang out Friday at a remote spot in the desert where the final spikes of the Transcontinental Railroad were hammered 150 years ago, uniting a nation long separated by vast expanses of desert, mountains and forests. An estimated 20,000 people swarmed to the celebration at Golden Spike National Historic Park northwest of Salt Lake City – the signature event of several days of festivities marking the railroad’s anniversary. Visitors came from as far as China, many decked out in old-fashioned dresses, top hats, bonnets and scarves. The event included a re-enactment of an iconic “champagne toast” photo of railroad workers perched atop facing stream locomotives giving cheers to the epic feat. The festivities also highlighted the vital contribution of the Chinese workers who put in long hours in brutal conditions and haven’t always received their proper due throughout history.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Queen City doesn’t get a lot of sunlight but makes up for it in other ways. The city is nestled in Chittenden County, which gets some of the lowest average levels of sunlight per day, according to AccuWeather. However, Burlington manages to take advantage of as many sun rays as possible using solar panels. The city takes the fourth spot on a list by AccuWeather of solar energy per capita. Honolulu took the highest place. AccuWeather points out that the city managed to earn the title of “America’s First All-Renewable-Energy,” according to Politico.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Hershey Company has picked the state for a major expansion of its manufacturing operation. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Thursday that the candy maker plans a $104 million expansion at its facility in Augusta County. The expanded facility will manufacture a type of fudge and peanut cream. The new project is expected to create 65 new jobs. Northam approved $1 million in state grants for the project. Hershey brands include Reese’s, Kit Kat and Jolly Rancher.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state is set to become the first to enter the private health insurance market with a universally available public option. A set of tiered public plans will cover standard services and are anticipated to be up to 10% cheaper than comparable private insurance, thanks in part to savings from a cap on rates paid to providers. Unlike existing government-managed plans, the Washington plans are set to be available to all residents regardless of income by 2021. The Legislature approved the measure creating the plans last month, and Gov. Jay Inslee is scheduled to sign it into law Monday. The move also thrusts the state into the national debate over the role of government in health care, with a hybrid model that puts it to the left of market-only approaches but stops short of a completely public system.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: He’s a billionaire who owns mines, farms and a resort. But how Jim Justice spends his time as the state’s 36th governor has largely been a mystery. Since taking office in 2017, critics have said Justice is rarely at the Statehouse and called his business portfolio distracting. He’s pushed back on those claims. His schedule for the past seven months was recently released to the Associated Press through an open-records-law request. It shows he rarely meets with his Cabinet, rarely is at the Statehouse and was largely missing at one of the legislative session’s most critical points. His office said Justice wasn’t available for an interview but released a statement. Justice says his calendar doesn’t reflect the time and work he puts in as governor. His lawyer says Justice doesn’t log most of his office time.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Medical College of Wisconsin is looking for ways to fight racial disparity in cancer deaths in the state. The National Cancer Institute reports that black residents in Wisconsin get cancer at a 22% higher rate than do white residents. Factors leading to cancer disparities for African Americans include stress, income, lifestyle and poor diet. Biological differences and medical access also contribute. Lauren Matthews has focused on the problem for three years as a community program coordinator at the college. Wisconsin Public Radio reports that the college has launched a program offering free prostate screenings for black men. The program also provides community education about cancer screening. The college also is studying breast cancer, colorectal cancer and smoking with funding help from the Greater Milwaukee Foundation.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Volunteers are clearing dead trees and repairing fences along a former railroad right of way that’s been converted to a trail in southern Wyoming. The Laramie Boomerang reports the Friends of the Medicine Bow Rail Trail group is working with the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest to maintain the route, which winds 21 miles from Lake Owen to the Colorado border. The lake is 40 miles southwest of Laramie. Friends of the Medicine Bow Rail Trail President Dave Nelson says he and other cyclists frequently encountered dead trees on the trail, many killed by beetles. Members have been volunteering on the trail for years, and last year they formed a nonprofit that can accept donations and apply for grants. Forest Service spokesman Aaron Voos says such groups do invaluable work for the agency.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/13"}]}

Margaret Rose Henry, and county council President Karen Hartley-Nagle are running for county executive in 2024.\n\nCurrent county Executive Matt Meyer is running for Delaware’s governor.\n\nHenry has over 20 years of experience in public service and has worked for the past three county executive administrations, including as the general manager of the county Department of Community Services under Meyer and a brief stint as the county’s economic development director.\n\nHe has publicly stated his intention to bring transparency to the position and ensure that the county remains “a safe and flourishing home for residents, and an attractive destination for visitors.”\n\nHartley-Nagle has served as council president for the past six years, with two left in her current term.\n\nShe previously served as a board member of Delaware Common Cause and the Coalition for Open Government and was a member of the New Castle County Board of Adjustment. She has publicly stated that as county executive, her main focus would be on core services such as public safety, parks and recreation, libraries, land use and infrastructure.\n\nHartley-Nagle has come under scrutiny from her fellow council members in the past, and was under investigation for hostile work environment claims. As council president she has focused on uplifting the county’s senior population and attracting business development to the area.\n\nVal Gould pursues run for New Castle County Council president\n\nFormer policy analyst Val Gould, a New Jersey native and University of Delaware alum, announced intentions to run for county council president.\n\nGould currently teaches music at George Read Middle School. Before teaching, they worked as a legislative fellow for the State House Majority Caucus during the 2021 legislative session and as a policy analyst for the Delaware State Senate Majority Caucus during the 2023 legislative session.\n\nGould plans to run on the promises of advocating for sustainable development, creating more affordable housing and ensuring that land use decisions are designed to benefit historically neglected communities.\n\nIf elected, Gould would be the County Council’s first queer and nonbinary member.\n\n“I hope to make my family, friends, community, coworkers and neighbors proud by leveraging my privilege to encourage responsible development and positive, impactful change for those who need it most,” Gould said. “I truly believe that, if we strive to uplift everyone, our communities and businesses will thrive.”\n\nWilmington mayoral races take shape\n\nFormer city treasurer Velda Jones-Potter was the first to announce a run for Wilmington mayor in March 2023.\n\nJones-Potter unsuccessfully ran for the city seat in 2020, trailing incumbent Mayor Mike Purzycki by just over 1,000 votes in the Democratic Primary. Purzycki captured 42.9% of the total vote, compared to Jones-Potter’s 35.6%. Former City Councilmember Justen Wright also vied for the Democratic nomination, garnering 21.5% of the vote.\n\nIn October, Purzycki announced he would not seek a third term, citing his age and desire to spend more time with family. That opened the door for Delaware Gov. John Carney to consider a run for office.\n\nCarney is unable to seek a third term as Delaware governor due to term limits. City mayor has a limit of three terms.\n\nThe governor has not said whether he’s officially running for Wilmington mayor, but year-end campaign finance reports show Carney’s mayoral campaign fundraising outpaced those of Jones-Potter.\n\nThe former city treasurer’s mayoral campaign touts a focus on making neighborhoods safer, empowering Wilmington residents and using city resources efficiently.\n\nMORE:Carney expresses interest in Wilmington mayor after Purzycki announces he won't run in 2024\n\n3 Democrats, 2 Republicans vie for Delaware governor\n\nThree Democrats and two Republicans are running in Delaware’s gubernatorial race.\n\nMeyer, who has been county executive since 2016; Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, who has spent two decades in public office; and Collin O’Mara, a former Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary and current CEO of the nonprofit National Wildlife Federation, are all running on the Democratic line in September.\n\nO’Mara was the first democrat to file his candidacy in the race for governor on March 13. Meyer filed two weeks later. Hall-Long filed for candidacy April 16 and, if elected, she would be the state’s second female governor, following Ruth Ann Minner, who served in the early 2000s.\n\nLongtime police officer Jerrold Price filed his candidacy for Delaware governor on the Republican line in December, and remains the only Republican gubernatorial who has officially filed.\n\nCAMPAIGN FUNDRAISING:Meyer leads among Democratic gubernatorial candidates, raising over $675K in donations\n\nPrice is a retired New York Police Department officer, who moved to Delaware’s coast about 20 years ago and resides in Lewes. According to his campaign website, he later joined the Rehoboth Beach Police Department and has an extensive career in law enforcement.\n\nDelaware GOP chair Julianne Murray and current House Minority Leader Mike Ramone recently said they also intend to run for governor on the Republican line. But Murray changed her mind on Monday, May 6, saying that she wouldn't run for governor since Ramone filed for candidacy.\n\nLATEST:State Rep. Mike Ramone won't seek reelection. He plans to run for Delaware governor\n\nThree spar for lieutenant governor\n\nThree candidates familiar to Delaware politics are seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor.\n\nState Sen. Kyle Evans Gay, who represents North Wilmington; state Rep. Sherry Dorsey Walker, who represents the city of Wilmington; and Debbie Harrington, a retired U. S. Army colonel and state Democratic Party vice-chair, are running for Delaware lieutenant governor.\n\nGay was elected to the legislature in 2020, when she flipped a Republican-held seat. The senator worked as deputy attorney general in the Delaware Department of Justice before going into private practice. Her campaign video, which featured her two young daughters, focused on parenting.\n\nThe representative ran for the seat in 2016, coming second to now Lt. Gov. Hall-Long in the 2016 Democratic primary.\n\n“As Lt. Gov. I will continue to be a boots-on-the-ground advocate for all Delaware citizens,” Dorsey Walker said in her announcement last year. “My decision to announce on Juneteenth is symbolic of the advancements made by people of color, women, and those who seek the freedom that comes with change for the advancement of all mankind.”\n\nHarrington, a Middletown resident who served in the Army for 25 years, became an advocate for children with disabilities in her retirement. Her daughter is visually impaired.\n\nHarrington has run unsuccessfully for other elected offices. She is a vice chair of the state Democratic Party, vice chair of the Middletown Police Advisory Board and part of Delaware State University's Board of Trustees, according to her website.\n\nDorsey Walker or Harrington could become the state’s first Black woman to serve in the role if elected.\n\nRepublican challenger enters U.S. Senate race\n\nWilmington resident and businessman Eric Hansen is the latest candidate for Delaware's soon-to-be-vacant U.S. Senate seat.\n\nHansen, who built his career at Proctor and Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Walmart, is seeking the Republican nomination for the post, which is being vacated by U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, a Democrat, who has decided to retire.\n\nBlunt Rochester, if elected, would become the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the fourth Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nREAD:Lisa Blunt Rochester, Delaware's sole congresswoman, will run to fill Carper's Senate seat\n\nBlunt Rochester announced her intentions to run shortly after Carper announced his retirement plans in May last year. Carper publicly called on the congresswoman to run — admitting she probably should have done so years ago.\n\nDr. Mike Katz, an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator, has filed to run as an Independent in the U.S. Senate race. Katz, a former Democrat, created the Brandywine Valley National Scenic Byway Advisory Board, according to his campaign website, and helped restructure the Delaware Health Information Network.\n\nKatz is running on a platform of dismantling partisan politics and what he calls \"America's two party problem.\" If elected, Katz would be Delaware's first Independent U.S. Senator.\n\nWith candidates on three different party lines, they all will face off in the general election Nov. 5.\n\nU.S. House race down to two Democrats, one Republican\n\nThe race for Delaware's at-large U.S. House of Representatives seat has narrowed down to three contenders, with two Democrats vying for a spot on the general election ballot.\n\nRepublican Donyale Hall, a veteran, Dover resident and small business owner, is the sole Republican nominee running for the seat formerly held by Blunt Rochester, and is guaranteed a spot in the general election.\n\nHall, who is biracial, has run for political office before. She said she brings a “unique” perspective to the seat having served in the U.S. Air Force in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm; being a survivor of domestic violence; and overall understanding others who feel as though they have been forgotten or overlooked.\n\nThe Democratic Primary has narrowed to two contenders after state treasurer Colleen Davis withdrew from the race in February, citing personal and family health concerns. She has since endorsed state Sen. Sarah McBride, who will face former Delaware State Housing Authority Director Eugene Young in the primary.\n\nYoung has been viewed as a rising star in Delaware politics for years. If elected, he would be the first Black man to represent Delaware in Washington, D.C.\n\n—If McBride — the country's highest-ranking transgender elected official — were elected to the Congressional seat, she would become the first trans person elected to federal office, catapulting the already nationally known politician to an even bigger stage. She would also be the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nRELATED:Democratic primary for US House seat down to 2 candidates after Davis drops out\n\nThe race got slightly less crowded in February when state Treasurer Colleen Davis, who had intentions to run for the U.S. House seat, dropped out of the race due to health issues and family obligations.\n\nFirst candidate enters Insurance Commissioner's race\n\nKayode Abegunde, a member of New Castle County's Financial Advisory Council, is the first candidate to officially file as a candidate in the insurance commissioner's race.\n\nAbegunde, a Democrat, previously lost in the primary to incumbent Trinidad Navarro, who has served in the role since 2016. The two will likely face off again in the primary, though Navarro has not yet filed his candidacy with the Department of Elections. In his announcement, Abegunde said would \"bring more insurance products\" to Delaware and provide more options to veterans.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/11/feuds-history-makers-whats-stake-delawares-primary/5757281002/", "title": "From feuds to history-makers: What's at stake in Delaware's primary", "text": "Watching Delaware's Joe Biden run as the Democratic nominee against President Donald Trump isn't the only reason the 2020 elections matter for the First State.\n\nTuesday's primary features other important contests, especially in areas where Democrats' advantages mean the primary winner will almost automatically win in November.\n\nSeats on all three county councils are up for grabs, and a divided crowd of Democrats are vying for Wilmington's mayoral and City Council seats.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/10/02/delaware-parents-gop-candidates-rally-urge-carney-reopen-schools-full-time/5878371002/", "title": "Delaware parents, GOP candidates rally to urge Carney to reopen ...", "text": "DOVER – Since her children started the school year online, Cindy Meisinger said every day has been torture.

He still says he hates school,\" Meisinger, whose kids are in the Caesar Rodney School District, said. \"To expect a 6-year-old to sit at a computer screen for five and a half hours of the day is unrealistic.\"\n\nMeisinger along with many other parents, children and GOP candidates gathered Thursday evening outside the Department of Education in Dover to protest virtual and hybrid learning, asking Gov. John Carney to allow public and charter schools to reopen for in-person instruction.\n\nThe push for schools to fully reopen comes as most move toward offering hybrid options by mid-October. In some districts, parents continue to await what that might look like. In others, like Red Clay Consolidated School District, hybrid plans were met with more questions than answers.\n\nMore:Red Clay's hybrid learning plans leave parents with more questions than answers\n\nLisa McCulley, the leader of Stand Up Delaware, helped organize the protest with Appoquinimink School District parents Tristan and Terran Germann, who started the Facebook group Delaware Students Deserve to Be in School.\n\nMcCulley is a Middletown resident whose son would have been a senior at Appoquinimink High School this year. But she decided to enroll him in an online private school instead after the district announced its plans for remote learning.\n\n\"Because the online learning was terrible, the first week we pulled him out and now he is doing an online curriculum that is a proven curriculum, rather than one that is thrown together,\" she said.\n\nSchool reopening is the latest in a string of pushes to reopen the economy in Delaware during the pandemic.\n\nIn May, protesters in Dover called on Carney to lift emergency restrictions made in light of the pandemic. Last month, parents gathered to urge the Appoquinimink School District to offer full-time in-person learning. That same day, parent pressure pushed the state to change course and approve the start of fall high school sports.\n\nJessica Rosser, who has three children in the Cape Henlopen School District, said she struggles to make sure her kids are focused and do their schoolwork.\n\n\"I go to work overnight. I come home at 7 a.m., and I am expected to stay awake all day and get my kids to stay online.

Let them have hands-on experience with chemistry and biology and technology classes. Open our schools.”\n\nOutside the Bancroft School in Wilmington, Brady called for changes to Delaware’s educational system in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Give poor parents the ability to choose to educate their children at home or in their church or with a group of other parents,” Brady said. “Allow them to make choices that are best for their children.”\n\nAddressing the crowd in Dover, Republican candidate for governor Julianne Murray said she told Carney the state shouldn't be focused on stopping the spread of COVID-19 but should stop \"spreading hysteria and fear.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/03/election-2020-latest-delaware-polls-open/6059667002/", "title": "Election 2020: The latest in Delaware as the polls open", "text": "President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden headline the ballot, but Delaware voters are also choosing their next governor, U.S. Senator, U.S. House Representative and several local officials.\n\nHere is the latest on what's happening in the First State on Election Day.\n\nElection FAQ | Delaware Online Voters Guide | How to vote | Delaware races to watch | Presidential race updates\n\n1:20 a.m. Biden speaks in Wilmington\n\nWith many states still counting votes, Joe Biden early Wednesday morning said he believes he is “on track” to beat President Donald Trump and win the 2020 election.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“We knew, because of the unprecedented early vote, it was going to take a while,” Biden said in front of supporters in Wilmington. “It ain’t over until every vote is counted.\"\n\nThe president had not addressed supporters as of 1 a.m. but posted the following Tweet shortly after Biden's speech:\n\n\"We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election.

I wonder if there’s lights?” she said as she walked across the field.\n\nPeople were bundled up in blankets to wait in line.\n\nLater, the line at Maple Lane Elementary in Claymont started to get longer as people made it to the polls after work.\n\nNearby, the patriotic lyrics of a country song rang out from a passing motorcycle.\n\nOutside, Senate candidate Sarah McBride greeted voters at one of her many polling place stops of the day.\n\nEven facing two-hour waits, she said, voters had been welcoming and excited.\n\n“There’s clearly a lot of of excitement, this morning in particular,” McBride said.\n\nMcBride is one of many Democratic newcomers on Tuesday’s ticket, hoping to push the party toward more progressive policies.\n\n“One of the great things about the candidates running this year is that we represent the full diversity of Delaware,” McBride said. “All of us feel a deep sense of urgency about the issues we face.”\n\nOutside the school, Liam Fleetwood nervously thought about what would come of the day. He wants “the best person for the country, long-term,” he said.\n\nWatching Democratic leaders in bigger cities and blue states, he hasn’t been impressed.\n\n“How are we going to make it through COVID?” he asked. “People need to get back to work.”\n\nSimilarly to North Star, the line of hundreds of voters at The John Dickinson School in Marshallton was snaking around the athletic fields after 5:30 p.m., when the estimated wait time was around an hour and a half.\n\nA voter at Dickinson said it usually takes 15 minutes at that location.\n\nThere were no issues with lines at Downes Elementary School in Newark at 5:45 p.m. with five active polling booths.

He said, 'I can grab your p***y, because I'm rich.'

He will now head to Wilmington, where he will watch the results roll in.\n\n\"People are turning out at home,\" Biden said as he prepared to leave Philadelphia. \"As much as I love Pennsylvania and I'm a Pennsylvania guy, I love Delaware.

John Carney said turnout on Tuesday was \"unlike anything he'd ever seen\" as he traversed the First State speaking with voters.\n\nCarney said 80,000 Delawareans voted before 10 a.m., a striking number, he said, considering more than 160,000 voted by absentee or mail before Tuesday.\n\n\"I would say that it is going to break all of the records and that’s a good thing for Delaware.\"\n\nCarney started his day at Cape Henlopen High School, where lines snaked around the building to the athletic fields. He said he saw similar crowds at the Cheswold Fire Company and Middletown High School. The line at Thurgood Marshall Elementary School near Bear was \"incredibly long,\" Carney said.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\n1:30 p.m. 29-year-old first-time voter casts ballot in Talleyville\n\nTatyana Mozol, who waited in a roughly 40-minute line at Aldersgate United Methodist Church in Talleyville, said at 29, she's never voted before. This was her first time.\n\n\"I used to think it really didn't matter, and my vote wouldn't do much, but my husband is really into politics,\" Mozol said. \"He showed me that I should, and it matters, especially because a lot of things are changing recently.\"\n\nShe said she expected the wait to vote — her husband had voted Tuesday morning and said the line was even longer then. But neither of them minded the line.\n\n\"At this point, I think every vote counts.\"\n\nThose waiting to cast their ballots at the church were of all ages and races, and though many were in line by themselves, they chatted with the voter ahead of behind them. Parents brought their children, too, who, although too young to vote, relished the experience.\n\n\"I'm really, really excited to be here,\" said 6-year-old William Schloss, who accompanied his mom, Johanna. \"I wanna vote when I'm older.\"\n\nSmiling, Johanna nodded approvingly.\n\n\"I definitely brought him on purpose, because I wanted him to see that it's important for us to vote,\" Johanna Schloss said. \"That men and women have a voice.\"\n\nJohanna Schloss said though she's been voting for years, in this election, it was \"incredibly important to get out and vote.\"\n\n— Isabel Hughes\n\n12:30 p.m. Gubernatorial candidates speak with voters\n\nGov. John Carney and Republican nominee Julianne Murray made appearances at the polls Tuesday morning. Carney spoke with voters, offering elbow and fist bumps in lieu of handshakes, at Cape Henlopen High School in Lewes before arriving at the Elsmere Fire Hall.\n\nRead more: Gov. John Carney easily defeats Democratic challenger, faces Republican who is suing him\n\nMurray cast her vote at Seaford High School around 9:30 a.m. with her husband Patrick Murray. Both sported American flag T-shirts under their jackets.\n\n\"I'm the worse half of the next governor of Delaware,\" Patrick Murray joked.\n\n— Shannon Marvel McNaught, Brandon Holveck\n\n11:55 a.m. First-time and long-time voters cast ballots in Dover\n\nCars streamed into a packed parking lot at the Dover Elks Lodge.\n\nThe line stretched along the building and had been steady since 7 a.m., but voters said they were \"surprised\" and \"delighted\" to discover how quickly the line was moving.\n\nVoters Paula Gannon and Delores Bishop said it only took 5 minutes to get near the front of the line.\n\nGannon said she believes people woke up motivated to vote.\n\n\"I just wanted to get the ball rolling,\" she said.\n\nA first-time voter in Delaware, Calvin Jeffrey said he didn’t know what to expect. He is originally from the Bronx.\n\n\"I thought this was the norm,” he said. \"I’ve never seen a line this long in my life.\"\n\nPatty Carney came to the polls with multiple members of her family, and she said she did notice one difference from voting here her whole life.\n\n\"It’s the first time I can remember having a police officer in the parking lot,\" she said. \"I’m glad they’re here in case anyone wants to start anything.\"\n\nOther voters said they wanted to come out today to make sure their vote was counted, or because they simply want a say in the state and national leaders.\n\n— Emily Lytle\n\n10:50 a.m. Early lines in Sussex County\n\nDozens of people waited in longer-than-usual lines at polling places across Sussex County Tuesday morning.\n\nAround 100 people were in line to vote at North Laurel Early Learning Center at 10:50 a.m. There, Laurel resident Lance Wheatley said he \"proudly\" cast a vote for Trump and the Republican ticket.\n\n\"The policies are right,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the morning, there were lines at Seaford Middle School, Seaford High School, the Laurel Middle School/High School campus and the Rehoboth Firehouse, among other polling places.\n\nAt Greenwood Fire Hall, a line curved down the side of the building. People in line did not seem to be maintaining 6 feet of distance until they got inside where there were markers on the floor.\n\nInside, one Trump supporter was asked to turn his Trump shirt inside out, which he did willingly.\n\n— Shannon Marvel McNaught, Andrew Sharp, Brandon Holveck\n\n10:10 a.m. Glasgow voter shares excitement, anxiousness\n\nCool temperatures and a long line outside Glasgow High School wasn’t going to deter Yvonne George from voting Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Newark-area resident said she wanted change.\n\n\"Oh I am excited. I am also anxious,\" George said after voting. \"And I hope we have some change today. We need change.\"\n\nGeorge said she voted for Biden because she is sick and tired \"of what’s been going on in this country for the last four years.\"\n\nShe added that the nation is too divided and there needs to be change to bring the country back together.\n\nElsewhere in the Newark area, long lines were reported at McVey Elementary School in the early morning.\n\nAbout a 25-minute drive north, there was no line at the Hockessin PAL Center shortly before 10 a.m., but a steady stream of cars pulled in and out of the parking lot. A line formed outside around Thomas McKean High School, which is less than 5 miles from Biden's home.\n\n— Esteban Parra, Kevin Tresolini, Patricia Talorico\n\n10 a.m. Cool temperatures and long lines in Wilmington\n\nWhen Wilmington's Alison Ruggiano woke up and logged onto social media Tuesday morning to find photos of her friends waiting in long lines to vote, she didn't pull the covers over her head as a cold wind blew outside.\n\nInstead, the school teacher bundled up, strapped on her blue mask and headed to Lincoln Towers, her polling place located behind Trolley Square Shopping Center.\n\nShe took her place behind about 70 others in a line that stretched from North Dupont Street around to Gilpin Avenue, going past Conaty Park and to the entrance of Brandywine Park.\n\nPeople stood silently as strong wind gusts made it feel even colder than the 47-degree temperature.\n\nWith voters in front of the line reporting a nearly hourlong wait, Ruggiano wasn't deterred.\n\nA supporter of Biden, she says she was energized by both the high early turnout across the country and the memory of the sting of Hillary Clinton's surprise loss four years ago.\n\n\"The more I doom scroll Twitter, the more I wonder about what's going to happen so I wanted to get out here,\" she said.\n\nFurther ahead in line near the entrance was Wilmington's Felicia Harrington with her hands tucked inside her coat, clutching a bottle of hot tea. She had been waiting for an hour.\n\n\"I did not expect a line this long,\" the Biden supporter said before pulling out her bare hands. \"I wish I brought gloves instead of tea to keep my hands warm. But I'm really excited to see people coming out to vote given the importance of this election.\"\n\nWaits of around 45 minutes to an hour were reported at several polling stations in the city.\n\n\"I would have waited three hours in the rain to get Trump out of office,\" said Ed Rogers as he left P.S. duPont Middle School, where more than 300 people were lined up waiting to vote.\n\nHe lined up shortly before the polls opened at 7 a.m. and waited about two hours to cast his ballot.\n\n\"It is one of the most important elections and I love the atmosphere out here,\" he said.\n\nSome people played music on their phones, some called for their family members to bring them breakfast and some held others' place in line so they could go fetch chairs for the wait.\n\nA poll worker at the location said the long line was partially down to precautions over COVID-19 and partially due to two of the polling place's six machines being down.\n\nTraditionally, polls are always busiest in the mornings and evenings as people try to get their ballots cast either before or after work.\n\nThere was a similar, if shorter, line outside Harlan Elementary School less than a block away. Richard King said he waited one hour and 45 minutes, but added that is better than four more years of Trump.\n\n\"It is important for our rights and our future,\" he said leaving the polling place.\n\nAt Bancroft School, music blasted from speakers outside, keeping voters in high spirits while they waited. Dotting the road, campaigners handed out flyers, trying to win over voters up to the last minute.\n\n\"We’ve got to get him out,\" voter Beverley Thomas she said of the president, after submitting her ballot.\n\nJames Gibbs has always voted in person, and wanted to do so again this year. Waiting in line offered a chance to mingle and discuss issues with other voters, he said.\n\n\"We all have similar struggles,\" he said. \"Everyone is suffering, except the rich.\"\n\nGibbs votes “to make a difference,” he said. He hopes his vote will send certain politicians out of office.\n\n\"We’ve got to vote some people in that are going to help,\" he said. \"They’ve got to do their job. They work for us.\"\n\n— Ryan Cormier, Xerxes Wilson, Natalia Alamdari\n\n9 a.m. Smyrna voters prioritize COVID-19\n\nAs the polls opened in Smyrna and Clayton, voters faced lines ranging from about 35 to 45 people at Smyrna Middle School and the Levin Center, to more than 120 waiting outside the Clayton Firehouse.\n\nAt the firehouse, a few minutes before 7 a.m., before the polls opened, the line was nearly two blocks long, stretching from the fire hall entrance on East Street to Railroad Avenue, past the post office to Main Street, with some people along Main Street. After the doors opened, the line shrank a bit and by 7:45 a.m., it was only on East Street and Railroad Avenue, not quite to Main Street anymore.\n\nAt Smyrna Middle School on Duck Creek Parkway at 7:20 a.m., there were 37 people waiting in line outside the school, but by 7:25 a.m., the number had grown to 47.\n\nAt the Levin Center on Main Street in downtown Smyrna, the line stretched nearly a block to near Commerce Street with 46 people waiting outside at 7:35 a.m.\n\nVoter Ralph Murray, 51, of Smyrna, said the top issue for him was \"the handling of the coronavirus\" which led to other problems.\n\n\"The economy for small businesses, the little man who’s suffering, businesses are closing and there’s no relief in sight,\" Murray said. \"It’s important for someone to take action. There’s no time for all the fighting and arguing, just get it done.\"\n\nSerena Alexander, 23, of Smyrna, said the top issue for her in the election is \"definitely COVID.\"\n\n\"We need some type of health plan in place to deal with it,\" she said.\n\nCasting her ballot the Clayton Firehouse, Alexander said she had never seen a line as long to vote before.\n\nScott Bradley, 65, of Clayton, said the lack of a plan for dealing with the coronavirus was the number one issue.\n\n“Do something, anything. Don’t deny it,\" Bradley said.\n\n— Ben Mace\n\n7:45 a.m. Large early turnout in Wilmington\n\nMore than 100 people were in line at Harlan Elementary School before polls opened at 7 a.m. Long lines at Stubbs Elementary School surprised some voters, who said voting there is usually quick.\n\nWaiting in line with her grandson, PierAngeli Bronson said the long lines are thrilling to see and reminiscent of when Barack Obama ran. She said if she didn't vote, \"my ancestors would haunt me.\"\n\nAnother takeaway? It was cold. With winds near 20 mph, the real feel temperature was around 40 Tuesday morning in Wilmington. People in line joked about lighting fires to warm up and several neighbors thanked others for coming out.\n\n— Jeanne Kuang, Brandon Holveck\n\n7:30 a.m. Biden to address the nation from Wilmington\n\nJoe Biden will spend election night in his hometown of Wilmington, where he will address the country, his campaign confirmed Saturday.\n\nIn the past few days, crews have been setting up a stage with large digital screens in front of the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. It's the same location where the longtime Delawarean formally accepted the nomination in August.\n\nBiden will be joined by wife Jill and running mate Sen. Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff.\n\nRead more: Biden to deliver election night remarks in Wilmington\n\n— Meredith Newman\n\n7 a.m. Polls open throughout Delaware\n\nPolls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nThose who applied for an absentee ballot or a mail ballot but have not returned it should not mail it today. Ballots must be received by 8 p.m. to count. Absentee or mail ballots can be submitted at designated boxes in Wilmington, Dover and Georgetown, depending on the county in which you are registered.\n\nThose who applied for an absentee ballot or a mail ballot may also still vote in person.\n\nAccording to the Department of Elections, \"When you arrive at your polling place, an election officer (poll worker) will confirm via the pollbook that your Vote By Mail (VBM) ballot has not been returned to the Department. Your unreturned VBM ballot will be voided, and you will be allowed to vote in person at the polling place.\"\n\nAbsentee and mail ballots cannot be submitted in person at polling stations.\n\nAs of Monday, about 160,000 people in the First State had cast early ballots, which is about seven times the total absentee ballots cast for the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDelaware does not share a breakdown of the early ballots by party. In battleground states that provide breakdowns, ballots cast by Democrats have outnumbered those by Republicans roughly 3-1.\n\n— Brandon Holveck\n\nContact Brandon Holveck at bholveck@delawareonline.com.

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the order previously issued by U.S. District Judge Abdul K. Kallon that lifted the absentee ballot rules for voters 65 and older with an underlying medical condition. The appeals court left in place an order allowing counties to offer “curbside voting” if local officials choose to do so. The stay came after Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill appealed the ruling that loosened absentee ballot rules. He called the ruling a “win for the people of Alabama.” The court left in place part of the ruling allowing curbside voting, a method plaintiffs argued would be a safer way for people with health concerns to vote.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s biggest ski resort is set to operate this season with a new operations plan that includes health precautions like mandatory face coverings. Alyeska Resort in Girdwood cut the last ski season short because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Alaska Public Media reports. “No mask, no service here at Alyeska Resort,” Marketing Director Ben Napolitano said. “That includes all public spaces, that includes lift lines, and that includes being inside the aerial tramway as well.” Skiers will be allowed to temporarily remove masks only while moving down the slopes, Napolitano said. Skiers will no longer be allowed to get close to strangers on chairlifts or while using the resort’s tram system. Lines to board the lifts and tram will be configured to encourage social distancing. Reservations will be required for equipment rentals, and the gear will be sanitized daily. Alyeska’s day lodge will be closed this winter, and the resort will limit cash transactions.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and two advocacy groups have agreed to put an early end to an extension of the state’s voter registration deadline that was ordered by a judge after pandemic restrictions led to a decrease in people signing up to vote. If the deal announced Tuesday is accepted by an appeals court, voter registration in Arizona would end late Friday night, instead of Oct. 23. Hobbs, Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich and GOP groups had asked the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to put the ruling on hold while they appealed it. The state’s original registration deadline was Oct. 5, but U.S. District Judge Steven Logan had extended it to Oct. 23 after finding the pandemic has undermined election integrity by preventing a portion of the population from registering to vote and concluding that pushing back the deadline would let the voices of those people be heard.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday ruled out rolling back the state’s reopening despite a recent surge in coronavirus hospitalizations and 25 more deaths from the illness caused by the virus. The Republican governor extended for another 60 days the emergency declaration he issued because of COVID-19, which has now killed 1,611 people in the state. The Health Department reported 680 new confirmed and probable cases of the virus. “There’s not really an option to go back on our opening of businesses,” Hutchinson said at his weekly news conference on the outbreak. “We’re way past that in Europe and the United States, here in Arkansas.” Hutchinson, instead, said the focus needs to be on following the state’s mask mandate and other safety guidelines because of the virus. Arkansas was among a handful of states that never issued a stay-at-home order because of the virus but had closed bars, restaurants and other businesses.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBeverly Hills: The city has banned trick-or-treating this Halloween to try to prevent spread of the coronavirus. The action was taken in an urgency ordinance approved by the City Council on Tuesday night. The ordinance bars trick-or-treaters from going house-to-house or car-to-car, which is described as “trunk or treating.” People also may not provide candy or other Halloween treats to any person outside their own household. People are prohibited from spraying shaving cream on others, except inside their own homes. Licensed barbers are exempted so that they may shave customers. The city is also banning pedestrians and vehicles from certain streets Oct. 31, excluding residents. California has not enacted a statewide restriction on Halloween but is strongly discouraging traditional activities and urging families to plan alternatives including virtual celebrations.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state is experiencing another surge of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, prompting Gov. Jared Polis to plead Tuesday with residents to wear masks, stay home as much as possible and maintain social distancing practices. As of Tuesday, Colorado’s three-day average positivity rate – the percentage of total tests coming in positive – was 5.4%, and the state recorded 1,000 newly confirmed cases both Saturday and Monday, the highest daily numbers recorded during the pandemic, Polis said. About 290 people were hospitalized for COVID-19 on Tuesday, the highest total since May 31, The Denver Post reports. During a briefing on the pandemic, Polis didn’t suggest he was contemplating renewed mandatory restrictions on business or other activities to stem the surge. But he insisted: “If this continues, our hospital capacity will be in jeopardy.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nAvon: Coronavirus outbreaks at two long-term care centers have been linked to a resident of one of the facilities and staff who work at both locations, health officials said Wednesday. The state Department of Public Health launched an investigation. Two dozen residents and 16 staff at the Avon Health Center nursing home recently tested positive for the virus, said Jennifer Kertanis, director of the Farmington Valley Health District. About 4 miles away, 11 residents and three staff at the Residence at Brookside tested positive recently, said Ted Doyle, a spokesman for the assisted living facility. The outbreak appeared to originate from a Brookside resident who went on an outpatient visit and contracted the virus, Kertanis said. Health officials learned of the resident’s positive test Oct. 1 and said all of Brookside residents and staff were tested. Two Brookside residents who tested positive died, but one was already in hospice care, Dolye said.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: The state’s response to the coronavirus pandemic was on center stage when Democratic Gov. John Carney and his Republican challenger faced off in a virtual debate. GOP candidate Julianne Murray argued Tuesday that the governor has overreached since the pandemic hit in March, saying the state’s virus safety measures have had a negative effect on businesses and people, news outlets report. Carney pushed back, saying in one of his remarks during the night that the virus is the most pressing issue. The two also held opposing views on Delaware’s mask mandate, with Murray describing the measure as unnecessary and an infringement on personal liberties, Delaware State News reports. She also said the coronavirus was “not fatal.” “I can’t liken it to the chickenpox, but it’s less deadly than the flu in many circumstances,” she said. Health officials widely agree the coronavirus seems to be at least several times more lethal than seasonal flu.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ford’s Theatre Society and the National Park Service have announced a phased reopening schedule for Ford’s Theatre and the Ford’s Theatre Museum beginning Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. The society said following the initial opening, Ford’s Theatre and its museum will operate with a modified schedule for daytime visitation Wednesdays through Sundays with required advance tickets. Tickets will be available each Friday for the following Wednesday-Sunday. Adhering to capacity policies set forth by DC Health, a maximum of 25 visitors per hour are permitted in the building during this stage of reopening. Visits to Ford’s Theatre are self-guided. National Park Service ranger talks will not be scheduled during this initial reopening stage. The Petersen House and the Aftermath Exhibits at the Center for Education and Leadership remain closed.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Florida A&M University’s position as a key center in combating the spread of the coronavirus in underserved communities got a major financial boost Tuesday from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s largest investors in COVID-19 research. Foundation representatives said $15 million is being invested over the next three years for historically Black colleges and universities to serve as hubs, providing rapid COVID-19 testing for students, faculty and staff, as well as processing test specimens submitted from other HBCUs across the country. FAMU will be receiving $1.5 million over three years to hire staff and operate its hub that will be opening in the next few weeks at its Center for Viticulture & Small Fruit Research in eastern Leon County. Collected specimens will be tested in the center’s 340-square-foot laboratory, the university said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: The number of COVID-19 cases reported by the University of Georgia rebounded this week, though the numbers are still far from their peak in August. The tracking page at the UGA University Health Center lists 92 cases of coronavirus infection in the week ending Oct. 9, including 80 students and 12 employees. That’s up from the previous week, when 68 students and employees either tested positive at UGA or reported having tested positive somewhere else, but still much lower than UGA’s peak in the week ending Aug. 31, when the university reported 1,490 cases. The number of UGA students and employees who volunteered to be tested at Legion Field increased over the previous week to 1,944. That was the second-highest weekly total since UGA began its fall semester Aug. 20 with a goal of testing up to 500 people a day.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s public schools will stop using a distance learning program after parents complained about racist and sexist content. The state Department of Education completed a review of Acellus Learning Accelerator, and reviewers recommended discontinuing its use as a primary curriculum resource “due to its inconsistency in quality and rigor,” Superintendent Christina Kishimoto said in a letter to parents Monday. Schools across the nation use Acellus, according to the Missouri-based company. Parental complaints have prompted schools in other states to drop the program. Complaints included misspelling and mispronunciation of Queen Lili’uokalani – the last monarch to rule the Hawaiian Kingdom – and racist depictions of Black Americans and Islamophobic stereotypes. Some have also complained the program lacks rigor.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Health care experts say coronavirus is increasing as kids are returning to school – but most of the new infections aren’t happening in school buildings. Instead, it’s likely infections are spreading because many people are treating the return to school like a return to normalcy and slacking off on precautions such as social distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing that can slow the spread of the coronavirus, said Dr. Joshua Kern, vice president for medical affairs for St. Luke’s hospitals in Jerome, Twin Falls and Ketchum. “It’s not necessarily in-school spread because they’re always wearing masks there,” said Kern, part of a panel of health care experts discussing the coronavirus online. Kern’s region is again becoming a coronavirus hot spot, with numbers “kind of relentlessly marching up,” he said. The area was one of the first in the state hit by the pandemic in March, when the Sun Valley region had among the highest per-capita infection rates in the country.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Low-income immigrants ages 65 and older in the state will be eligible for health care coverage that is similar to Medicaid despite their immigration status. Hayley Burgess of the National Immigration Law Center said Illinois is the first state to fully fund a program of this nature for noncitizen immigrant older people, The Chicago Tribune reports. The Illinois Legislative Latino Caucus supported the program in response to data showing uninsured older people who contracted the coronavirus could be at risk for more severe complications, resulting in more medical bills the state would pay for, said Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Chicago. The program is expected to cost the state $5 million, said Evan Fazio, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services. Advocates say that’s a small amount compared to how much noncitizen immigrants pay in taxes.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A statewide mask order will remain in place, but tougher restrictions on businesses and crowd sizes aren’t being reinstated, despite recent sharp increases in COVID-19 hospitalizations and rates of new infections in the state, Gov. Eric Holcomb said Wednesday. Holcomb, a Republican, said some people were showing disregard for the safety of others, putting the ability of schools to remain open and the health of those most at risk of severe illness from the virus in jeopardy. “Those inactions are costing, just to be blunt, health care costs, lost wages, business failures. Don’t kid yourself, we’re all paying this bill,” Holcomb said. “Throwing caution to the wind, ultimately ends up costing us all. It is the literal definition of whistling past the graveyard, pretending this isn’t around us.” The state’s health commissioner, Dr. Kristina Box, also announced that she, an adult daughter and young grandson tested positive for the coronavirus on Tuesday.\n\nIowa\n\nWest Des Moines: The family of the Indian Hills Junior High School special education assistant who died this month from COVID-19 released a statement Tuesday saying she was exposed at school. Jennifer Crawford, 53, died Oct. 3. She had worked at Indian Hills since 2017. According to the statement, Crawford’s last day at school was Sept. 2. She then traveled to Indiana to be with her mother, who was having surgery. Two days later, on Sept. 4, Indian Hills Principal Dr. Shane Christensen called Crawford and said she had been exposed to COVID-19 and should be tested, the statement said. Crawford was tested and began having symptoms shortly after the call. She was notified Sept. 8 that she had tested positive, according to the statement. Crawford was hospitalized Sept. 14 after her symptoms became worse. She died about two weeks later. Crawford’s mother contracted the virus from her daughter, the statement said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly said Tuesday that she doesn’t plan to have the state health department use its power to manage disease outbreaks by shutting down businesses or imposing other restrictions in local coronavirus hot spots. The Democratic governor’s statement went further than a public promise she made last month to top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature not to issue orders to close businesses statewide, as she did in the spring. She said that although the state will work with local officials in areas with big outbreaks to help them check the spread of the virus, it won’t dictate the steps they’ll take. “A much more effective way is to have the local buy-in,” Kelly said. “The better way to do it rather than using the hammer is to continue to work closely with local officials, local public health officials.”\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: This year’s Kentucky Bourbon Festival that was postponed and then moved online gets underway this week. Registration is free and open for online programs on topics ranging from food and whiskey pairing to the art of whiskey making and putting together cocktails with ordinary supermarket ingredients. There’s also a VIP package available for $150. Last year’s festival drew some 50,000 visitors from 40 states and more than 20 countries for its activities and concerts, organizers said. For this year’s 29th annual festival, the board decided to shift to a virtual experience because of the coronavirus pandemic. The festival runs Thursday through Sunday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell came to the state Capitol on Tuesday to ask for money to help the city’s coronavirus-damaged budget, but Republican lawmakers questioned her economic reopening decisions rather than offering her promises of aid. The Democratic mayor told the House Appropriations Committee the city faces a $150 million budget gap. City employees are being furloughed to save money, but that’s not nearly enough. Cantrell said the city, the earliest epicenter of Louisiana’s COVID-19 outbreak, has allocated dollars to protective equipment and other expenses because of the pandemic. In addition, she said the city economy – heavily dependent on tourism and the hospitality industry – has been damaged by the steep drop in visitors. Republicans peppered Cantrell with questions about why she continues locally tougher restrictions on businesses and activities than what Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards has allowed statewide.\n\nMaine\n\nAuburn: About 30 inmates at the Androscoggin County Jail held a short-lived hunger strike to demand more testing for the coronavirus, officials in Maine said. Jail administrator Jeffrey Chute said the inmates refused meals from Monday morning through Tuesday afternoon. The central issue for inmates was testing for COVID-19, according to the Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition, a nonprofit working to improve conditions for incarcerated Mainers. Some inmates feared a lack of social distancing in housing units, lax mask-wearing and infrequent tests could lead to an outbreak similar to what happened at the York County Jail, where dozens of inmates became infected, said Joseph Jackson, the coalition’s director. Prisoners were also upset about the quality of bedding. The strikers’ issues were resolved, and they began eating bag lunches “right away,” Sheriff Eric Samson said Tuesday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Less than half of the state’s residents would agree to get a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available, new Goucher College Poll results show. The statewide poll is just the latest sign of faltering public trust in a potential COVID-19 vaccine. It mirrors recent national polling that has found just 50% of Americans say they intend to get the vaccine when it becomes available. The pace of COVID-19 vaccine trials, along with the politicization of the pandemic during a contentious election year, have contributed to the public’s uncertainty. The Goucher poll found that 48% of Marylanders said they would agree to be vaccinated if a free, FDA-approved vaccine were available today, and 49% said they would not. Black Marylanders were more likely to distrust a potential vaccine, according to the poll, with 61% saying they would not be vaccinated. A majority of white Maryland residents, 54%, said they would agree to receive the vaccine.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A recent uptick in COVID-19 cases in the state doesn’t amount to a new surge of the disease caused by the coronavirus, Gov. Charlie Baker said Tuesday. “This is something we planned for and anticipated,” the Republican said during a Statehouse press conference. Baker said that “there’s no question that there will be more cases this fall” but that the state has done the needed work to prepare for any increase in the coronavirus. At the height of virus in the spring, there were up to 4,000 people hospitalized with the disease in Massachusetts. On Monday, the state reported about 500 people hospitalized with COVID-19. The state has also built a robust health care infrastructure, according to Baker. He said the state will soon be able to administer up to 100,000 tests a day with a turnaround time of about two days. The state has also created a contact tracing program and is continuing to stockpile personal protective equipment.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state’s chief health officer warned Tuesday that the state could be beginning a second wave of the coronavirus as cases rise along with the number of people in hospitals. Michigan had 89 new cases per 1 million people per day, up from 81.6 cases last week, the health department said. About 700 people with COVID-19 were in hospitals, up about 20% from last week. The rate of positive tests has ticked up to 3.6% from 3.4%. It was under 3% in June. “It is very possible this is the beginning of a second wave,” said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan chief medical executive. “The virus has not changed. It is an opportunist. If people are not wearing masks, if people are gathering, if people are not washing their hands, it will spread.” The Upper Peninsula is a hot spot. Nick Derusha, a health officer in four U.P. counties, said there’s “pandemic fatigue” among some residents. “We need all Yoopers to wear your mask,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state will expand its offering of saliva tests for the coronavirus into a statewide mail-in program that will be available free to all residents, Gov. Tim Walz announced Tuesday. The state opened a semi-permanent saliva testing site in Duluth three weeks ago that has already conducted about 8,000 tests. It will open nine others this month, but the state also plans to expand that strategy into a statewide program that, when fully implemented, would let any Minnesotan get tested without leaving home, Walz said in a briefing for reporters. People who request the saliva tests would send their samples via UPS to a lab that the state will open soon in Oakdale that’s projected to eventually double the state’s testing capacity to 60,000 per day. The specific saliva test that the state is using is very nearly as accurate as the nasal swab diagnostic tests now in common use, but without the discomfort, Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi State Department of Health is making free rapid testing available at its drive-thru community test sites, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs announced Monday. Rapid test results will be returned within 15 minutes, but it’s unclear how accurate they will be, Dobbs said. Rapid tests are done in the “front of the nose,” as opposed to the deeper PCR tests MSDH has been using, he said. If people choose to take the rapid test, they will also receive a PCR test, the results of which will be returned within a few days, he said. They can also choose to take the PCR test only. Dobbs said there’s not enough data to know what the rapid tests’ false negative rates are. So far health officials have seen that rapid tests work well on symptomatic individuals, he said. However, some people who were exposed to COVID-19 but were not experiencing symptoms have had negative rapid test results and positive PCR test results.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The state is outsourcing contact tracing to private companies as part of the effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the state approved contracts this week with nine companies to help track down people who may have been in contact with those who test positive for COVID-19. The outsourcing comes as the state continues to resolve problems with its COVID-19 dashboard that allows the public to keep track of new cases, hospitalizations, deaths and other factors related to the coronavirus. The website has not been updated since Saturday, when it showed 144,230 confirmed cases, including 5,066 reported that day. By Sunday, the state acknowledged the one-day increase was wrong and said it was working to resolve the problem. State health department spokeswoman Lisa Cox said the aim was to have the dashboard functional again by Wednesday.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock announced Tuesday that he would provide resources to counties to increase enforcement of coronavirus-related restrictions, including a statewide mask mandate, as Montana experiences one of the largest COVID-19 case outbreaks in the nation. According to a White House Coronavirus Task Force report on Montana dated Oct. 11, Montana had the third-highest rate of new cases per capita last week and the second-highest test positivity rate in the country, at 10.1%. Montana had 332 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week, compared with the national average of 100 per 100,000, according to the report. Bullock said enforcement of existing statewide mandates has been lacking, and he would provide education resources and coronavirus relief funds to county health departments and attorneys to investigate health-order violations and pursue legal action against businesses that do not comply.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus continues to grow as the state reports large numbers of new COVID-19 cases. Nebraska set another new record for COVID-19 hospitalizations Wednesday with 315 people being treated for the virus in hospitals across the state. That number exceeds the record set last weekend and remains well above the spring peak of 232 set May 27, according to the state’s online virus tracker. Officials with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services have said they are monitoring hospital capacity closely, but so far hospitals are managing the patient load OK. The state said 24% of Nebraska’s intensive care beds and 76% of the state’s ventilators remained available Wednesday. Nebraska continues to have the nation’s seventh-highest rate of new cases, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: State health officials said they would resume the use of rapid “point of care” tests after federal health officials chided them for banning their use and accused them of violating federal law. Dr. Ihsan Azzam, Nevada’s chief medical officer, doubled down on his insistence that too many questions remained about the accuracy of rapid antigen tests. He said his team was “disappointed” in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “We are not saying the tests have no use, we are just saying pause for further review and additional training,” he said in a statement. Late last week, Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told reporters that federal law prohibits states from imposing a ban like the one that Nevada health officials ordered Oct. 2. He said Nevada is the only state to do so.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Two elementary school students who were kicked off a school bus last week for not keeping their faces covered will be allowed to return to the bus. The Monroe Consolidated School Board convened an emergency meeting Monday to say that JPI Transportation had backed down from its decision to ban the two boys, ages 9 and 10, from the bus for the rest of the school year, the Caledonian-Record reports. Going forward, a student caught not wearing a mask will be banned from the bus for five days. A second offense will bring a 10-day ban, and a third offense will lead to a meeting between the bus company and school officials to determine the next penalty. Meanwhile, a court has thrown out a lawsuit by Democratic legislative leaders to stop Republican Gov. Chris Sununu from spending federal COVID-19 relief funds without their permission.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHillsborough: State officials aren’t aware of any COVID-19 outbreak stemming from the campaign fundraiser President Donald Trump held recently at his Bedminster golf club, Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday. More than 200 donors and staff were at the Oct. 1 event, just hours before Trump announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus. The Democratic governor said state and county officials have been working to contact all attendees but have not heard of any cases that trace back to the event. The White House said last week that the president did not have any contact with anyone that would be considered close, based on CDC guidelines. Murphy has said officials were trying to contact some nearly 200 attendees as well as 19 club staff members, who all live in New Jersey.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Tuesday that she will renew public health restrictions and warned that more stringent rules could be imposed because of a rise in COVID-19 cases. The updated regulations will take effect later this week. They will include limiting gatherings to five people or less, a mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors from states deemed high-risk, reduced hotel capacities, and a 10 p.m. closing time for food or drink establishments serving alcohol. Lujan Grisham said the virus is spiking in New Mexico right now, and the state has experienced some of the worst increases in the U.S. so far this fall. Without a vaccine, she said officials have only a few tools to fight the virus – such as making people wear masks, staying home as much as possible and avoiding groups of people.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo condemned the federal government’s coronavirus response and lauded his own leadership efforts in a new book released Tuesday that offers a few new details – but not many – about New York’s battle against the pandemic. The Democrat’s book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” delivers a retelling of his efforts to contain the virus as it ravaged his state in spring. In it, Cuomo describes trying to placate President Donald Trump in order to get needed hospital beds, ventilators and other supplies for New York. He details the state’s success at rapidly ramping up testing capacity and his worry that New Yorkers wouldn’t heed calls to stay at home to help avoid a catastrophic surge in hospitalizations. As for his mistakes, Cuomo concedes only a few. Among them, he said, he waited too long to mandate that New Yorkers wear masks.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Weeks from the end of the election, three of the state’s most populous counties are often taking two weeks or more to send absentee ballots out to voters who request them, an Associated Press analysis shows. Understaffing, outdated technology and voter registration groups are straining a system that has struggled to handle an unprecedented surge of requests as many seek to avoid the risks of in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic. Data obtained by the AP shows that in Wake County, the state’s largest, it took 15 days on average from when voters requested ballots via mail or an online portal to when the county printed and mailed out ballots during a period from Sept. 1, when the state launched its online portal, through Oct. 5. Average processing times for Buncombe and Forsyth counties were 14 days and 11 days, respectively, according to the data provided by the State Board of Elections.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials on Wednesday confirmed 713 new positive COVID-19 cases and 159 new active cases, along with eight additional deaths. The update came after the COVID Tracking project reported that the state topped 900 new cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, based on numbers collected through Tuesday. That ranks first in the country for new cases per capita, ahead of No. 2 South Dakota’s figure of more than 832 new cases per 100,000 residents. It was the state’s seventh straight day of record active cases, putting the total at 4,750. Hospitalizations fell by 26, to a total of 132. There were three deaths from LaMoure County, a county of about 4,000 people in the southeastern part of the state. A total of 44 counties showed new cases in the past day.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: In the spring, when the pandemic darkened nightclubs and live music venues, local guitarist Carl Fichtenbaum called on other local musicians he knew and organized “Quarantunes,” a one-time live Facebook concert. But the raves of friends and fans pushed “Quarantunes” to become a monthly series, and the eighth concert is scheduled for 8p.m. Saturday. The musicians, though, all have day jobs that have worked them hard through the pandemic at UC Health or the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. Fichtenbaum, a guitarist and singer since boyhood with a musicians’ union card, is a UC Health infectious-disease doctor treating coronavirus patients at the UC Medical Center. He also is leading a clinical trial for a promising vaccine candidate.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state remains in the red zone for newly reported coronavirus cases, according to the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which recommends residents wear masks among the ways to slow the virus’s spread. “Community spread continues in Oklahoma in both rural and urban areas,” according to the task force report released Wednesday by the Oklahoma State Department of Health. There were 749 people hospitalized Wednesday, down from a record-high 760 reported Tuesday, the health department said. There were an additional 1,121 confirmed cases, bringing the total to 102,614 since the pandemic began. Health officials reported 13 additional deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the disease, bringing the death toll to 1,132. The true number of coronavirus cases is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state marked a grim milestone Tuesday as health officials announced it had surpassed 600 deaths from COVID-19 since the pandemic began. Six more people have died, bringing the statewide total to 605 fatalities, the Oregon Health Authority said. There were also 321 new cases diagnosed statewide, bringing the total number of cases in Oregon to 37,780. “Each death is a reminder to the rest of us of the severity and danger of COVID-19,” OHA Director Patrick Allen said. “OHA sends its condolences to every Oregonian who has lost someone to COVID-19.” The deaths were in Malheur, Multnomah, Yamhill and Marion counties. The counties with the highest number of new cases Tuesday were all in the Portland metropolitan area: Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is “at the start of the fall resurgence” of COVID-19, the health secretary said Wednesday, urging residents once more to take steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Wednesday marked the ninth consecutive day that Pennsylvania’s daily case count surpassed 1,000, and the average daily number of new confirmed cases is up by more than 50% over the past two weeks, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Though some of the increased caseload is due to expanded testing, the state’s hospitalization and test positivity rates are also rising. That indicates increased viral spread, Dr. Rachel Levine said. Pennsylvania is more prepared to handle the influx than it was in the spring – with a contact tracing program in place, increased supplies of personal protective equipment, and a sufficient number of hospital beds at the ready, Levine said at a news conference.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo is appealing to the state’s retired teachers to get back in the classroom to address a severe statewide shortage of substitutes brought on by the pandemic. “I’m putting a call out to all retired teachers – we need your help,” she said. Substitutes are particularly needed for virtual learning, she said. She also encouraged anyone looking for a career change to apply for the state Department of Education substitute teacher training program. Qualified candidates can take a free 10-hour course that includes training in child development, curriculum development, engagement strategies, classroom management and other skills.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Supreme Court will give six hours of training credit to any attorney who volunteers to be a poll worker on Election Day. Lawyers must work the entire day Nov. 3, from 7 a.m. poll opening to 7 p.m. poll closing, minus regular breaks, and can’t take any payment to get the continuing legal education credit, according to an order from the state’s highest court. Attorneys are required to get additional training periodically to maintain their legal license. The court said in its order allowing the credit that finding poll workers is especially important because some people who traditionally work elections are opting out because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The polling place is required to be in South Carolina, and judges are not eligible for the credit.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday blamed the state’s recent surge in coronavirus cases on an increase in testing, even as the state saw a new high in the number of people hospitalized by the virus. There are currently no open general-care hospital beds in the southeastern part of the state, which contains the two largest hospitals, according to the Department of Health. “We have triple the amount of testing that we are doing in the state of South Dakota, which is why we’re seeing elevated positive cases,” Noem said. “That’s normal, that’s natural, that’s expected.” The Republican governor did not explain how an increase in hospitalizations would be connected to an increase in testing. The state has also seen one of the nation’s highest positivity rates for testing in the past 14 days, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. The roughly 23% positivity rate is an indication there are more infections than tests are indicating.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee announced Wednesday that he is in quarantine after a member of his security detail tested positive for the coronavirus. The governor’s office released a statement saying the Republican had tested negative and was “feeling well” but would be in quarantine as a precaution with first lady Maria Lee. No other information about the security staffer’s exposure was immediately available. Earlier Wednesday, Maria Lee had posted to social media that she was visiting a middle Tennessee elementary school with Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn. The two were photographed wearing masks while interacting with children. The governor, meanwhile, had attended a fundraiser the night before. Lee has long encouraged the public to wear masks and maintain their social distance in order to protect themselves from the virus. However, he has also resisted calls to implement a statewide mask mandate.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State health officials reported the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus broke through the 800,000-case level Tuesday amid a new surge of cases. The 5,209 new cases reported Tuesday were the most this month so far, and 80 previously unreported cases were also added. The newly reported cases raised to 800,415 the total caseload reported in Texas since tracking and tracing of the pandemic began in March, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported. An estimated 77,126 of those cases are active, an increase of almost 2,100 since Monday, and 4,053 of those cases required hospitalization. That was 183 more cases than Monday and the first time more than 4,000 COVID-19 cases required hospitalization since early September. The state reported 64 COVID-19 fatalities Tuesday, raising the state’s pandemic death toll to 16,622.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state is implementing a new strategy to fight the coronavirus pandemic as the number of confirmed cases and hospitalizations continues to surge, state officials announced Tuesday. The state will move away from its color-coded health system and instead place counties under restrictions based on their COVID-19 transmission rates, Gov. Gary Herbert said. Each county will be listed as a high-, moderate- or low-level transmission area. Salt Lake, Utah, Cache, Garfield, Juab and Wasatch counties have been designated as high-transmission areas. Masks will be required in all indoor settings in these counties, and social gatherings must be limited to 10 people or fewer, said Rich Saunders, acting director of the Utah Department of Health. In moderate transmission areas, gatherings will be limited to 25 or fewer unless masks are worn, he said. Maskless gatherings will be limited to 50 or fewer in low-transmission areas. The state ranks fifth in the country for newly confirmed infections per capita, according to data from Johns Hopkins.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Health officials are encouraging Vermonters to limit travel outside the state at a time when new coronavirus cases are increasing around New England. New COVID-19 cases in the Northeast rose by 3% in the past week, with hospitalizations also on the rise, Vermont Public Radio reports. Deputy Health Commissioner Tracy Dolan told VPR’s Vermont Edition on Tuesday that people should carefully consider any upcoming travel. “And as we move into the holidays, this might be a time to hunker down and have some smaller family events and really think twice about either visitors coming in or going out of state,” she said. The number of counties in the Northeast from which Vermont allows visitors to come without having to quarantine is shrinking, according to a map the state developed to show case counts in the region.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Enrollment at the state’s colleges and universities declined 1.3% this year. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the figure amounts to a large sigh of relief because university leaders and state officials feared a drop of as much as 20% as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia said there are 6,658 fewer students at Virginia’s public and private institutions of higher education this fall. The biggest drop was at community colleges, where enrollment fell 10%. Enrollment at public four-year schools was essentially flat. Private schools had an increase mainly because of large gains made by Liberty University. The enrollment figures illustrate the durability of colleges and universities despite the daunting economic challenges of the pandemic.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee says five counties in central and eastern Washington still under the tightest COVID-19 restrictions will be allowed to resume more activity and open more services. At a news conference Tuesday, the governor said Yakima, Benton, Franklin, Douglas and Chelan counties will be moved from modified Phase 1 into Phase 2. “They’re not out of the woods yet; we know that,” Inslee said. “But these counties and their people have made tremendous progress.” Under Phase 2, counties are allowed to resume some adult and youth sports as well as outdoor recreation with more than 12 people. Also, more business activity will be OK’d, like movie theaters at limited capacity, restaurants with limited seating and indoor fitness centers with reduced numbers of people allowed. There have been more than 93,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Washington since the start of the pandemic and more than 2,100 deaths.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The last county in the state to report a confirmed case of the coronavirus is now deemed the most critical by health officials as the number of weekly cases statewide reached a record high. Doddridge County on Wednesday became the only county in the red category on the state’s color-coded map. That’s the most serious of five colors, indicating substantial community transmission of the virus. Under the red category, public schools are prohibited from conducting in-person classes, while sports events and other extracurricular activities are postponed. Schools in the county were closed starting Oct. 6 due to the rise in cases. Dr. Ayne Amjad, the state’s health officer, said Wednesday that she visited Doddridge County and was told that despite a statewide order for residents to wear masks at indoor public places, “a lot of people were not privy to wearing masks.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Department of Corrections says there’s been another coronavirus outbreak in a state prison. The Racine Correctional Institution/Sturtevant Transitional Facility had 124 active COVID-19 cases among prisoners as of Tuesday, according to the DOC. Two other prisons, Kettle Moraine Correctional Institution and Oshkosh Correctional Institution, are still in the midst of large outbreaks. As of Tuesday, Kettle Moraine had 352 active cases among inmates, and Oshkosh had 347. Sturtevant is a small unit of Racine Correctional and is located adjacent to the larger prison. The facilities are counted as one prison on the DOC’s data dashboard. Among staff, 37 Racine Correctional employees have self-reported testing positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. Across all adult institutions, DOC reported 1,055 active COVID-19 cases among inmates and 145 among staff, the Wisconsin State Journal reports.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson Hole: There will be no guest lodging at Yellowstone National Park’s largest concessionaire for the winter due to the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. More than 100 guest units are closing for the rest of the year and for the winter to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, park officials said in an announcement on the park website last weekend. Another consideration is that there are very few medical services in that area of the park. During the winter, Yellowstone is accessible only by snowmobiles and vehicles called snowcoaches that transport people. Xanterra Travel Collections, which operates accommodations in the park, will also close the Madison Campground a week earlier than normal. The Old Faithful Inn operated by Xanterra was not open this summer because of staffing issues related to the pandemic, the Jackson Hole News and Guide reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/05/18/unlimited-free-testing-canyon-roaming-beach-crowds-news-around-states/111793148/", "title": "Unlimited free testing, Canyon roaming: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus neared 500 on Saturday. The Alabama Department of Public Health reported there have been more than 11,500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state and at least 485 deaths. That’s 12 more deaths than were reported Friday. Three counties – Mobile, Jefferson and Montgomery – accounted for 41% of all case growth in the last day. Meanwhile, the annual Memorial Day celebration at Veterans Memorial Park in Tuscaloosa has been canceled. PARA and the Veterans Memorial Park Association said there are plans to hold a joint Memorial Day/Veteran’s Day celebration in November. And in Auburn, city officials are working on a phased plan to reopen all city facilities by June 1. The move comes a few days after Opelika city officials announced they will open all city buildings Monday, under new guidelines to limit exposure to the coronavirus.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state lawmaker on Friday defended asking whether stickers that individuals may be asked to wear as part of a Capitol coronavirus screening process will be “available as a yellow Star of David.” Republican Rep. Ben Carpenter of Nikiski said he was serious in making the comment in an email chain with other legislators. He was responding to proposed protocols aimed at guarding against the virus as lawmakers prepared to reconvene Monday. The protocols suggest stickers be worn to confirm someone at the Capitol had been screened. “The point is, tying it to the Star of David shows, who amongst the human population has lost their liberties more than the Jewish people?” he said in an interview. “And if there were more people standing up for the loss of liberties prior to World War II, maybe we wouldn’t have had the Holocaust.” Rep. Grier Hopkins, a Fairbanks Democrat, responded by calling the remark “disgusting. Keep your Holocaust jokes to yourself.”\n\nArizona\n\nGrand Canyon National Park: Tourists appeared ready to roam Grand Canyon National Park again after it partially reopened Friday, despite objections from Navajo officials and others that it could hurt efforts to control the coronavirus. By 7:30 a.m., more than two dozen people were enjoying viewpoints along the South Rim. Among them were friends Jack Covington from Texas and Judy Smith from Tucson. They had planned their trip to the Grand Canyon a year ago since Covington had never seen it. They changed their plans and were visiting other places in northern Arizona when they found out the park would be open. “We figured we’d go for an adventure, and we got lucky,” Smith said. The Grand Canyon had been closed since April 1, one of the last big national parks to shut down completely to visitors. At the time, health officials in Coconino County said keeping the park open put employees, residents and tourists at risk.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state program that was created to process unemployment applications for self-employed individuals or gig economy workers appears to have been illegally accessed and has been shut down, officials announced Saturday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he learned Friday evening that an applicant for the program is believed to have somehow accessed the system, prompting an investigation of a possible data breach. The probe will determine if any personal data from applicants was obtained. If any individuals had their data compromised, they will be notified, and steps will be taken to address the situation, including possible credit monitoring, Hutchinson said. An outside IT expert was brought in to review the system. “We want to make sure that the system is in good shape before it goes back online,” the governor said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: With ample coronavirus tests and not enough sick people seeking them, the mayor recently did something on a scale no other major U.S. city had done: allow anyone with or without symptoms to be tested as often as they want. A website to book a test was quickly swamped by residents in the nation’s second-largest city and the surrounding county who couldn’t get tested under more stringent guidelines and were concerned they were infected or could be asymptomatic carriers unwittingly exposing others. But despite overbooking to compensate for a third of the people who didn’t show up, the city still has thousands of tests that aren’t being used each week, according to figures provided to the Associated Press by the mayor’s office. “Wasted tests at a time when we still have insufficient testing is really unfortunate,” said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, a San Diego-based medical research partnership. “I applaud what they’re doing. The more people tested the better.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis says he expects to see many K-12 public schools open this fall in his state and elsewhere despite the coronavirus threat, though “it’s not going to look like any other school year.” Polis told “Fox News Sunday” that Colorado schools will likely run in a “hybrid” fashion that limits social interactions in hallways and during lunchtime and has up to 20% of kids continue with online classes at home if that’s their parents’ preference. The Democratic governor said schools also may close periodically when “there’s an inevitable outbreak.” President Donald Trump has urged K-12 schools to reopen, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told Congress last week that it may be reckless to rush kids back before doctors have a better sense of the dangers.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A federal judge is set to hear arguments this week in a lawsuit that attempts to force the state to take new measures to protect prison inmates from the coronavirus. U.S. District Court Judge Janet Bond Arterton will hold the hearing by video conference next Friday. The ACLU of Connecticut is asking the court to order emergency actions that could include releasing more inmates to protect them from the pandemic. Dan Barrett, the ACLU of Connecticut’s legal director, said the organization is upset that many inmates, including some who are most at-risk for catching the virus, are still being housed in dormitories where social distancing is impossible. On Friday the Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers, which houses inmates in both dormitories and cells, was locked down after 105 asymptomatic inmates tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A man is suing Democratic Gov. John Carney in federal court over restrictions he has imposed on access to the state’s beaches and his ban on short-term rentals. Patrick J. Murray argues in a complaint filed Friday that the restrictions imposed by Carney because of the coronavirus deprive him of his liberty and his property in violation of the Constitution. Murray is seeking restraining orders prohibiting Carney from restricting access to beaches in any way other than requiring face coverings and from continuing a blanket ban on short-term rentals and commercial lodging. Murray is being represented in the case by his wife, Georgetown attorney Julianne Murray. He swore in an affidavit that he will suffer irreparable injury if he is unable to rent the couple’s Dewey Beach condominium starting Memorial Day weekend because the rental income from the summer pays the mortgage for the year.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Metro and Metrobus riders will soon be required to wear masks or other face coverings in an effort to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Washington Post reports the requirement begins Monday. Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said that bus and train operators had asked for the requirement. Customer surveys found that riders supported the idea as well. Wiedefeld said the mask policy will not be enforced with any criminal sanctions. But he said the agency is trying to determine if it has enough masks to provide to passengers if there are disputes over the policy. He said he hopes riders take responsibility and consider the health of others. Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689, which represents most of Metro’s workers, tweeted: “This is necessary to keep transit workers and riders safe!”\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Guests flocked to a theme park shopping district, a casino fired up its slot machines, and businesses prepared for serving customers Sunday. In Orlando, it was the first weekend since Universal CityWalk reopened Thursday. The Orlando Sentinel reports visitors entered wearing obligatory face masks, having their temperatures taken by workers as stickers marked the 6-foot space required between guests. The spinning Universal Studios globe at the far end of CityWalk was a typical selfie spot as guests flocked to take photos, many removing their masks to flash their smiles. On Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a “full Phase 1” reopening of the economy, which include gyms, starting Monday. Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure remain closed along with other central Florida theme parks as state officials and business leaders continue to evaluate before deciding when to reopen.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Officials reported Friday that the state has surpassed 300,000 coronavirus tests, though that still represents a small fraction of Georgia’s overall population. The state health department had received just under 301,900 test results as of Friday afternoon. Of those, roughly 36,700 were positive for the virus. The state’s death toll from the virus was just over 1,550. Gov. Brian Kemp said the state was “moving the needle on testing” everyday. Georgia went from 200,000 reported tests to 300,000 in a matter of ten days, according to Kemp. But the latest testing figure still represents less than 3% of the state’s population. And an Associated Press analysis found Georgia was among 41 states that are falling short of the COVID-19 testing levels that public health experts say are necessary to safely ease lockdowns and avoid another deadly wave of outbreaks.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Lawmakers plan to set aside more than half of the money the state received in federal coronavirus relief money to bolster the state’s unemployment insurance fund. The House Finance Committee on Friday approved legislation sending $635 million, out of $1.25 billion allocated by the U.S. Congress to Hawaii, to the state’s rainy day fund for this purpose. The bill next goes to the House floor for a vote. Committee Chairwoman Rep. Sylvia Luke said this money is needed because the surge in joblessness during the coronavirus pandemic has severely depleted the unemployment insurance fund. It held $550 million before the pandemic hit, but the state has already distributed $200 million of that as claims have jumped, she said. At the current rate, the money will be depleted by the end of next month.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is holding an entirely mail-in primary for the first time as it works to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Ballots must be requested by Tuesday and returned by 8 p.m. June 2 to local county elections offices, with results announced that evening. The Idaho secretary of state’s office said 320,000 ballots have been requested and mailed out, with about 100,000 returned in what could be a record turnout. “It’s looking like equal or better than the presidential primary” in March, said Secretary of State Chief Deputy Chad Houck. Democratic voters will see one high-profile name on their ballot: Former 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Paulette Jordan of Plummer is running against former congressional candidate Jim Vandermaas, a retired law enforcement worker from Eagle, for a chance to challenge GOP Sen. Jim Risch in November.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: State officials announced Friday that people working essential jobs can get tested for the coronavirus regardless of whether they show symptoms of COVID-19. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state has been able to conduct at least 11,000 tests daily since April 24. He said that total has nearly doubled in recent days, allowing tests for anyone with symptoms or working an essential job under the statewide stay-at-home order, including first responders and those working in nursing homes, grocery stores, restaurants, correctional facilities and child care centers. Anyone exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient also can get tested, state officials said. “Testing, testing, testing,” Pritzker said. “That’s what every epidemiologist, every immunologist, every responsible business owner and everyone who cares about safely opening up our economy says we must do to successfully maintain a high standard of protection.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Forty-six more residents have died from coronavirus illnesses, putting the state’s pandemic death toll from confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 above 1,700, health officials said Saturday. Meanwhile, there was a line of vehicles as long as 3 miles as people drove up to get boxes of meat, fruit and vegetables at the state fairgrounds. “It was worth the wait, honestly. It’s been very helpful for my family,” said Lyneca Sims, 37, who was put out of work when many retailers were required to shut down. “It’s really nice that they’re offering the fresh fruits instead of the canned.” Officials say people with symptoms of COVID-19 or who need a test to return to work after being exposed to the virus can be tested at state-run sites. The state also is encouraging those without symptoms but considered high-risk because of their age or health conditions to get tested.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: University of Iowa researchers warned that the coronavirus would continue spreading through the state even before Gov. Kim Reynolds reopened restaurants and churches, a move they said would exacerbate the problem, documents released Friday show. The researchers, including some of the state’s top epidemiologists and infectious disease experts, also warned that hundreds more residents would likely die through the end of May even if widespread business closures remained in effect. Reynolds has downplayed the importance of such models and continued her push to reopen the economy, despite surging numbers of deaths last week. Restaurants, gyms, barbershops and salons reopened Friday in 22 counties, including the state’s largest metropolitan areas, where they had been closed for two months. Reynolds also warned that not reopening the state would have a “social cost,” including high unemployment, rising domestic abuse and food insecurity.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Data on COVID-19 infections that had been trending downward, leading Kansas to begin reopening its economy, is beginning to fluctuate and flatten, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said Friday. “It demonstrates that the disease is still spreading in our communities,” Kelly said one day after slowing the reopening of the state’s economy by ordering bars and bowling alleys to remain closed at least through the end of the month. She said she hoped to stick with the state’s reopening plan as much as possible. “But,” she added, “I have always said that until a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, manufactured and widely distributed, our future remains subject to the whims of this virus.” Some of the state’s biggest problems have been in meatpacking facilities, with 1,791 cases and four deaths, and in prisons, with 917 cases and five deaths, said Dr. Lee Norman, the top administrator at the state health department.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State parks will start reopening soon as Kentucky continues to ease restrictions amid the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Friday. The parks will reopen June 1 in an effort to revive tourism revenue, Beshear said at his daily briefing. People can make park reservations starting Tuesday, he said. Visitors will be expected to follow social distancing and health guidelines, he said. Reopening to the public will be state resort parks, recreational parks, lodges and cabins beginning June 1, he said. State resort parks designated to house some coronavirus patients won’t reopen to the public June 1, Beshear said. Those are Lake Cumberland, Lake Barkley, Blue Licks Battlefield and Buckhorn Lake.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: After weeks of shuttered businesses and houses of worship, the city took its first steps Saturday to loosen restrictions in place for two months to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The rest of the state took that step Friday with many businesses and houses of worship allowed to reopen at 25% capacity. New Orleans is slightly more restrictive. Restaurants and certain other businesses such as nail salons are also required to take reservations. The city has also imposed caps designed to keep houses of worship and movie theaters at fewer than 100 people. Casinos, video poker, live entertainment and bars are still closed. Kirk Estopinal, one of the owners of Cane & Table in the French Quarter, opened Saturday afternoon after the two-month forced hiatus. To reduce contact as much as possible, guests can order their food when they make a reservation online, they’re asked to wear masks when they come, and the staff will do the same.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state Department of Education secured internet access and devices for all of the more than 20,000 students who needed them to continue their learning from home, Gov. Janet Mills and Education Commissioner Pender Makin announced Friday. The effort was launched to help students who didn’t have the tools to participate in online learning after the suspension of classroom-based instruction because of the pandemic. “It is our responsibility to ensure that Maine’s teachers, and all students, have the tools they need to stay connected during these unprecedented times,” Mills said in a statement. It was a combined effort of the Department of Education, Department of Administrative and Financial Services, ConnectME, and business and philanthropic entities. Makin said the pandemic drew attention to “extreme inequities” during the educational disruption. “The emergency provision of connectivity to all students allows for educational continuity,” she said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: State residents wanting to get married may now apply for marriage licenses by email, regular mail or at a drop-off as courthouses remain closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The one-page applications, which require couples to provide personal information such as Social Security numbers and any past marriages, are mandatory for couples to have their marriages recognized by the state, The Baltimore Sun reports. That information must be sworn under oath either before the clerk, by video conferencing or by an affidavit included with the application. Applications submitted by email should not include Social Security numbers. Applicants will later have to provide Social Security numbers by phone or video conference. Before the pandemic, couples were required to fill out applications in person.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker is urging companies to let as many employees as possible work from home to help limit the spread of the coronavirus, even after the state begins to restart the economy. About half of executive branch state employees who work under the governor’s office have been working remotely, Baker said Friday during a press conference. He said he’s extending that for the foreseeable future. Companies that call workers back into the office will have to demonstrate they can maintain social distancing in the workplace. “You need to respect the virus,” Baker said. Several large companies including Raytheon, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Takeda and Wayfair have successfully allowed many of their employees to work from home, the Republican governor said. He is set to unveil a plan Monday to reopen some businesses in the state.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Nasal swabs, not wheel alignments, will be performed at a former Sears auto repair shop in the city. Sparrow Health System is opening a drive-thru coronavirus testing site in the vehicle bays. Sears closed earlier this year at Frandor Mall. “This is just a godsend,” Sparrow chief executive James Dover said. Starting Monday, people can drive up and be tested for the coronavirus or tested to see if they were already infected and have antibodies. No one needs to leave a vehicle, and health staff are protected from the weather. Sparrow can also take other routine blood samples. A doctor’s order isn’t necessary but would make the process faster, Dover said. People can provide insurance information or pay immediately. Antibody testing is $50, and the nasal swab is $70. Sparrow’s lab can run between 1,200 and 1,600 tests a day, said lab director Jon Baker.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state took further steps Friday to turn the dial on easing its restrictions meant to slow the coronavirus pandemic and to honor the victims of COVID-19. The state’s infectious disease director, Kris Ehresmann, told reporters in the department’s daily briefing that it’s important with the state’s stay-at-home order expiring Monday and some businesses reopening to continue to follow social distancing guidelines. “We want you to enjoy the weather, we want you to look forward to Monday, but we want you to stay 6 feet apart, wear a cloth mask when you’re outside of your home, and don’t gather in groups any larger than 10,” she said. Gov. Tim Walz ordered that flags at state and federal buildings in Minnesota to be flown at half-staff from sunrise to sunset Tuesday and on the 19th of every month through 2020 “to remember, mourn, and honor lives lost due to COVID-19.” He encouraged individuals, businesses and other organizations to join in.\n\nMississippi\n\nOcean Springs: Federal agents seized more than 280,000 masks from a pharmaceutical company last month under a law prohibiting the hoarding of in-demand equipment needed by health workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recently unsealed search warrant. FBI agents raided Gulf Coast Pharmaceuticals Plus LLC in Ocean Springs on April 17 and confiscated the supply of more than 6,500 N95 respirator masks, as well as thousands of lab coats, face shields, gloves and more, The Sun Herald reports, citing the warrant unsealed in U.S. District Court. The company is owned by developer Kenneth Ritchey. His attorney, Erich Nichols, said that they are working with the government in the investigation and that Ritchey has donated “hundreds, if not thousands, of PPE” to two local health systems.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: City officials are handing out at least 75,000 masks as the region prepares to relax stay-at-home orders. Over two days, city officials say they handed out 42,000 masks to more than 30 senior living facilities, including nursing homes, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Each employee and resident of the senior centers will receive five masks, Mayor Lyda Krewson said during a briefing Friday. The city also has distributed 15,000 masks to the city Housing Authority for its residents and 18,000 to the city’s Human Services Department, which is giving them to the people it serves. That includes recipients of its home-delivered meal program for the elderly.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., voted against the $3trillion COVID-19 package passed Friday by the House, saying it was “careless” and a liberal wish-list. The bill, which would cost more than the four previous COVID-19 bills combined, has little chance of becoming law as written but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November’s presidential and congressional elections. The proposal would bring almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals, and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service, the Associated Press reported. “Montana businesses, desperate to reopen, shouldn’t have to compete with expansive unemployment benefits that run through next spring,” Gianforte said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state will require long-term care centers to develop formal plans outlining how they’ll keep the coronavirus from spreading among the vulnerable residents who live in those facilities, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Friday. Facilities such as nursing homes and assisted living centers will have to submit plans to state regulators explaining how they intend to identify ill people and deal with visitors for the rest of the year. They’ll also have to discuss their disinfection protocols. The announcement comes as state officials scramble to keep the virus from spreading among long-term care facilities, whose residents are generally older and have underlying health problems. Long-term care residents are among the hardest-hit population groups in Nebraska, accounting for at least 75 of the state’s 113 coronavirus deaths. At least 82 long-term care facilities have reported coronavirus cases in Nebraska, including 35 with cases among residents.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The city has announced that downtown restaurants and businesses operating under the first two phases of state reopening orders are allowed to extend operations to the sidewalk during regular business hours. Outdoor dining and sidewalk sales are now permitted. But each business must continue implementing social distancing measures by keeping tables, chairs and other furniture 6 feet from pedestrian paths, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Nonessential businesses stopped operations in March after Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak implemented a stay-at-home order and required essential businesses to follow additional guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The city added its own restrictions, including limits on the size of the public sidewalk frontage, maintaining access to fire hydrants, building entrances and exits, and sanitation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Lawmakers say they’re returning for legislative sessions in June but meeting outside their respective chambers at the Statehouse – the first time since the Civil War. Instead of meeting at Representatives Hall, the 400-member House will meet at the Whittemore Center at the University of New Hampshire in Durham on June 11. The arena is home to the UNH Wildcats Hockey and is used for other large events. “We need a place that is large enough to allow us to socially distance while not being so large as to create its own logistical problems,” Speaker of the House Stephen Shurtleff said in an announcement Friday. He said each member will have a temperature check prior to entering the arena. Also, per UNH guidelines, each member will be given an N95 respirator mask. Members will have to wear them inside, Shurtleff said. The 24-member Senate will meet in Representatives Hall. Lawmakers are working on a date.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration is citing a 2005 emergency powers law enacted after Hurricane Katrina to block some information about the state’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Under New Jersey’s open records law, the Associated Press sought reports that Murphy required under a March executive order calling for hospitals and nursing homes to disclose their capacity and supplies during the outbreak. The AP also sought records on any commandeered medical supplies authorized under another order. Both requests were denied citing the 2005 Emergency Health Powers Act, which says reports and other records made during an emergency are not considered public. Other news organizations have been denied on the same grounds, including the USA TODAY Network. The state denied the network records showing how the state worked with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as on how it managed protective gear.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The loosening of some restrictions imposed on nonessential businesses by the governor two months ago to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak took effect Saturday, along with a new edict that people wear masks in public under most circumstances. The loosening of restrictions applied to most of the state but not in the northwest region, where McKinley and San Juan counties are located along with Cibola County. Under the new guidelines, retailers and many services along with houses of worship could reopen at limited capacity. Also, in a new move to combat the spread, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham ordered that face masks be worn in public, but with exceptions that included eating, drinking and exercising. Wearing masks is needed to help produce “a safe environment,” but police will not ticket people not wearing some sort of face covering, she said Friday.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: People who flouted coronavirus restrictions for a weekend night on the town got the mayor’s wrath Sunday. Mayor Bill de Blasio admonished people seen crowding outside bars, many with drinks in hand but no masks on their faces, for putting lives in danger. Officials may go so far as to shut down establishments that are violating social distancing rules, de Blasio said, asking residents to call 311, the city’s non-emergency hotline, if they see this type of crowding. Bars and restaurants in the city have been restricted to takeout and delivery service since mid-March, when coronavirus cases started to soar, but some in Manhattan were allowing people to dine and drink inside Saturday. Meanwhile, after a rash of violent social distancing arrests involving people of color, the city eased up on social distancing enforcement this week by no longer having police officers break up small groups of people or confront citizens about failing to wear a mask.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A federal judge on Saturday sided with conservative Christian leaders and blocked the enforcement of restrictions that Gov. Roy Cooper ordered affecting indoor religious services during the coronavirus pandemic. The order from Judge James C. Dever III came days after two Baptist churches, a minister and a Christian revival group filed a federal lawsuit seeking to immediately block enforcement of rules covering religious services within the Democratic governor’s executive orders. Dever agreed with the plaintiffs, who argued that the limits violate their rights to worship freely and treat churches differently from retailers and other secular activities. Dever said he does not doubt that Cooper “is acting in good faith” to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but the restrictions applied to one group and not another do little to help the goal and burden religious freedom.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: While a task force of state and local officials wrestles with high COVID-19 numbers in the Fargo area, one shuttered business in the city is set to reopen Monday: a medical marijuana dispensary. The facility in North Dakota’s largest city closed down in early April when its operators cited slow sales and regulatory delays due to the coronavirus. It was the first of eight dispensaries in the state to open after voters approved medical marijuana in November 2016. The dispensary formerly known as The Botanist has new owners and a new name, Pure Dakota Health. Meanwhile, the effort to test targeted areas in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, metropolitan area bumped the coronavirus numbers to new daily highs in Saturday’s report, North Dakota health officials said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Recent law school graduates will have the ability to temporarily practice law in the state under the supervision of an experienced attorney while they wait to take the bar exam, the state’s highest court has decided. The Ohio Supreme Court’s announcement Thursday came on the heels of its decision to postpone the bar exam originally scheduled for July until Sept. 9-10, due to risks surrounding the new coronavirus. Recent law graduates can apply to use the supervised practice option beginning June 15. The attorney or attorneys who supervise them must be in good standing and have practiced for at least three years. Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor said in a statement that delaying graduates’ ability to practice law would create significant financial hardship for many. She said providing flexibility also acknowledges the need for lawyers in certain critical areas during the pandemic.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state reopened bars Friday and allowed weddings, funerals and organized sports to resume under the next phase of Gov. Kevin Stitt’s statewide reopening plan. Stitt said last week that data supports moving forward, including a continuing decline in hospitalizations for COVID-19 and a steady decline in the percentage of positive tests since the state started to reopen April 24. “I want Oklahoma to be the first state in the nation to get its wings back and serve as an example,” Stitt said. Phase two of the governor’s reopening plan still calls for employers to close common areas, enforce social distancing, and wear protective equipment such as masks and gloves when interacting with the public. Not all employers were following the state guidelines. At the Capitol on Friday, members of the House and Senate met in large groups, frequently shook hands and violated social distancing guidelines. Most did not wear masks.\n\nOregon\n\nPacific City: Two motel owners in the city are suing Tillamook County, saying coronavirus restrictions that stopped their businesses from fully operating in the past two months violate their constitutional rights. The motels contend the county’s March 22 resolution halting most overnight lodging violates Fifth Amendment protections against the “taking of property without just compensation,” as well as their due process rights, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The county lacked authority to issue the restrictions and adopted them in an “illogical and irrational” manner, the lawsuit says. The resolution called for closing all transient lodging – hotels, motels, bed-and-breakfasts and short-term rentals including condos – “to all visitors who are not providing essential services or are here for commercial reasons such as construction, trucking, etc.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State health officials are being “misinformed” about the availability of personal protective equipment inside hospitals, one of the state’s largest nurses’ unions alleges in a letter that says hospitals have “resorted to severe rationing” even as they resume elective surgeries. The 8,500-member Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals said in a letter to the state health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine, that working conditions inside hospitals remain unsafe because of lax COVID-19 guidance issued by the Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Pennsylvania health care professionals are scared, exhausted, starting to get sick, and some are dying,” wrote Mark Warshaw, the union’s co-executive director. “The CDC and DOH guidance have given hospitals an excuse and enabled them to ignore basic protections and safety standards for health care workers, and we are the ones suffering.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nCentral Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit Friday seeking the release of dozens of detainees at a federal lockup where it says the virus is spreading “uncontrollably.” The number of detainees who have tested positive for the virus has more than doubled in recent days at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls from 15 to 38, the civil rights group’s Rhode Island chapter said. Ten staff members have also tested positive. The lockup can hold as many as 770 inmates, but it’s not clear how many are currently held there. Detainees include those in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The ACLU argues in its suit filed in federal court in Providence that it’s not possible for detainees to follow social distancing guidelines because they’re in cells that measure 5 feet by 9 feet.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With the reopening of close-contact businesses imminent, the governor urged the state’s residents to patronize local businesses shuttered for weeks during the coronavirus outbreak, albeit with appropriate safety precautions. “Be safe, but go,” Gov. Henry McMaster said Friday. “Our economy is not made to be shut down.” But the governor went on to note, “This virus is still here. It is still highly contagious.” McMaster spoke with reporters during a break in Friday’s meeting of a component of his committee tasked with making recommendations for reopening the state following shutdowns during the outbreak. Monday marks the date on which businesses like hair salons and fitness centers can reopen across South Carolina, where more than 486,000 unemployment claims have been filed in the past two months.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials reported 28 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Sunday but no new deaths tied to the coronavirus. Health officials said 3,135 of the state’s 3,987 coronavirus cases have been reported in Minnehaha County, which is South Dakota’s most populous county and the location of a large outbreak at a pork processing plant. Health officials said the number of deaths tied to the coronavirus remained at 44 on Sunday. The number of hospitalized patients was 77 on Sunday, up two from the previous day. A total of 312 cases have required hospitalization. Health officials have warned the the actual number of infections is higher because many people may not display symptoms or have not sought testing for mild symptoms.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Restaurants and retail stores throughout the majority of the state will no longer need to limit capacity starting late this week. In addition, large attractions, including racetracks, amusement parks, waterparks, theaters, museums and auditoriums, will be allowed to reopen starting Friday, provided they practice appropriate social distancing to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Such changes will be allowed in 89 of Tennessee’s 95 counties, with the remainder – Davidson, Shelby, Knox, Hamilton, Madison and Sullivan – following their own reopening plans. Gov. Bill Lee, along with the state’s Economic Recovery Group, made the announcement Friday, saying that “Tennesseans have worked incredibly hard to do their part and help slow the spread of COVID-19 so that our state can begin to reopen.” Despite the new guidance for large attractions, Lee said restrictions on social gatherings of 10 or more people will remain in place.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: More than 3,000 nursing home residents in Texas have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to data released by the state Friday. The 3,000 positive tests represent about 4% of the estimated number of Texans living in nursing homes, the Houston Chronicle reports. By comparison, about 0.15% of Texas residents have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday ordered coronavirus testing for all Texas nursing home residents and staff after the White House urged governors to do so as deaths mount nationwide. While nursing home residents in Texas make up about 6% of the state’s positive cases, they account for about 38% of the state’s deaths related to COVID-19, the newspaper reports.\n\nUtah\n\nKaysville: A Republican mayor will allow a country music concert protest event later this month, defying newly loosened health rules aimed at slowing the coronavirus pandemic. Kaysville Mayor Katie Witt acknowledged the May 30 event would violate current state directives but told the Salt Lake Tribune: “I believe I need to support people’s First Amendment rights.” She is also running for Congress, and her opponents questioned whether her approval of the show by well-known singer Nashville-based Collin Raye was politically motivated and could prove risky for public health. The event is sponsored by Utah Business Revival, which has also backed other protests calling on the state to lift restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the virus. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert relaxed many of those restrictions and allowed businesses to reopen across much of the state Saturday outside of some hot spots.\n\nVermont\n\nMarshfield: Gov. Phil Scott relaxed his order for Vermonters to stay home and announced Friday that lodging and campgrounds may open May 22 if they abide by safety guidelines and cleaning requirements while also limiting the number of people allowed in. At the same time, the Republican governor extended a state of emergency until June 15 to continue to fight the spread – albeit at one of the slowest rates in the country – of the coronavirus pandemic in Vermont. “Because of the success we’ve had, we’re now asking Vermonters to be smart and stay safe,” he said at a news briefing, adding that “staying close to home and limiting the number of people you’re in contact with is still really important.” People over age 65 or with chronic conditions should still remain at home as much as possible, he said. The order encourages face masks in public but doesn’t require them, Scott said. Municipalities may implement stricter requirements, he said. Vermont has the lowest average three-day growth rate of coronavirus cases in the country, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Warm weather drew crowds to the Virginia Beach oceanfront even though the beach is considered closed under the state’s stay-at-home directives. Families ordered snow cones, bought hermit crabs and cramped gift shops while bikers pedaled on the boardwalk Saturday, the Virginian-Pilot reports. Tents, umbrellas and beach blankets were set up near the water. Under Gov. Ralph Northam’s first phase of a gradual reopening plan, retail stores are reopening with limited capacity, but indoor gyms remain closed, beaches are still off-limits, and restaurants cannot provide indoor dine-in service. The newspaper reports the beach was not jammed, and groups maintained their distance. Many people on the boardwalk wore masks. Kayla Thomas, serving scones at an oceanfront concession stand, said the crowds looked like those she might see at the beginning of summer. “I’m just shocked by the amount of people,” Thomas said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Two people in the state who recall being sick in December have since had blood tests showing they developed antibodies for the coronavirus, but health officials aren’t counting them in their official case counts. The positive serology tests can’t determine whether the people had the coronavirus in December, weeks before the disease was officially detected in the United States. They may have been exposed after the first recorded case. One of the people had lunch with a hospital nurse in Kirkland, for example, site of a large outbreak in a nursing home. “They are being considered ‘probable,’ ” Heather Thomas, a Snohomish Health District spokeswoman, told The Seattle Times. If any Washington cases predated the first known case, there were probably very few that didn’t multiply, Dr. Jared Roach, a senior research scientist at the Institute for Systems Biology, a Seattle-based biomedical research firm, told the newspaper.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice stressed Friday that medical experts are leading his plan to lift coronavirus restrictions, days after he widened his strategy at the request of business owners. The Republican governor has expanded the most aggressive stage of his reopening plan to allow the reopening of gyms and tanning salons next week after he said the businesses bombarded his office with calls. Still, he said it’s “way out in left field” to suggest he is making decisions based on political pressure. “That noise or that pressure is not going to influence a decision in any way, no possibility,” he said. The governor has timed several reopenings around Memorial Day weekend. Gyms can open Monday. On Thursday, tanning salons, restaurants at half-capacity, big box stores and all-terrain vehicle rental businesses can reopen. Campgrounds can open for in-state residents Thursday, as can the Hatfield-McCoy trails, whitewater rafting and zipline businesses. The Greenbrier, a private resort Justice owns, is also set to reopen Friday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Local health officials across the state began rescinding their stay-at-home orders Friday after attorneys warned the mandates could be vulnerable to legal challenges after the state Supreme Court wiped out Gov. Tony Evers’ statewide order. The Wisconsin Counties Association posted a message on its website after the court ruled Wednesday saying it’s unclear whether local orders mimicking the statewide mandate would stand up in court. Health officials in Kenosha County withdrew their stay-at-home order Thursday night in light of the WCA warning. Brown and Manitowoc counties as well as the cities of Cudahy and Appleton dropped their orders Friday afternoon. The ruling led bars, restaurants, hair salons and other businesses to open immediately or begin making plans to reopen. Fearing infections might spike as people begin moving around again, about a dozen counties issued their own stay-at-home orders.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A ski hill that shut down in March due to the coronavirus pandemic plans to reopen starting Memorial Day weekend. Snow King Mountain has developed an operations plan and will open for summer season as scheduled May 23, officials at the ski hill in Jackson announced Thursday. The announcement came as Wyoming prepared to ease up on public health measures. Starting Friday, people could gather in groups as large as 25, up from 10 previously, and dine in at restaurants where servers wear masks and keep tables widely separated. Summer offerings at Snow King will include a scenic lift, mini golf, ropes course and zip lines. The Kings Grill restaurant will open for prepackaged snacks and drinks.

That’s among 230 public schools in statistics compiled by USA Today.\n\nLittle Delaware isn’t such a lightweight, apparently, when it comes to splurging on sports in a bid to become more relevant in its conference and even nationally. Delaware allocates a greater amount of university-derived money toward athletics than most schools.\n\nBlue Hens teams did begin to turn the corner in 2019-20, logging a 147-99-4 record before the coronavirus pandemic forced a premature end to winter and spring athletics in March.\n\nCLASSES TO RESUME: UD announces fall semester plans, changes\n\nThe $38.23 million in athletic funding that came directly from the institution in 2017-18, the most recent school year for which information is available, was considerably more than any of Delaware’s FCS counterparts, according to the Knight Commission.\n\nNext, were conference football rivals Rhode Island ($20.48 million) and Stony Brook ($17.22 million).\n\n“They stand out because there was an investment,” Rawak said of those financial figures. \"I don't think there is anything wrong with that, especially if we are producing.\"\n\nBut is that investment too significant?\n\nOnly one FBS athletic program received more in government/institutional support – the United States Air Force Academy ($39.8 million), according to the Knight Commission's 2017-18 data.\n\nThe subject came up last fall at a UD board of trustees’ committee on student life and athletics summit. Meeting minutes describe “a robust discussion” on the topic of spending “finite” resources on athletics and concerns about “the potential return” on the investment.\n\nIt was initiated by Matt Robinson, head of the UD sport management program who had been the interim athletic director in the first half of 2016 before Rawak’s hiring. Robinson had raised concerns about the university’s considerable subsidization of athletics with Rawak during the meeting.\n\nWhile acknowledging the discussion took place, Robinson, who is also UD Faculty Senate president, preferred not to comment further on the topic when recently asked by Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nAssanis had responded to Robinson’s concerns by expressing that he and other university presidents share the wish “to elevate their institutions through success in athletics,” meeting minutes reported.\n\nSurely, sports accomplishments are attention-getters that can fuel enrollment and fund-raising, though UD’s strong academic reputation and picturesque campus have long been powerful lures in their own right.\n\nRawak described athletics as “a window to the broader public” that could “drive the success of the entire university,” according to board of trustees meeting minutes.\n\nBut college athletics is also a costly venture.\n\nDivision I schools away from the Power Five bloc, which includes the Big Ten, Big 12, ACC, SEC and Pac-12 with their lucrative TV packages and wealthy donors, have a particularly difficult time finding outside funding sources.\n\nALL IN: CAA announces all teams will qualify for postseason tournaments\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has cast additional light on those high costs and athletic spending often viewed as frivolous, such as coaches’ salaries, staffing, scheduling and travel, especially from far-flung conference alignment. It has forced many to rethink their approaches and ensure spending is efficient and frugal.\n\nIn April, UD announced the pandemic had left it with a $65 million overall budget shortfall because of the switch to online learning after students were sent home and all university events were canceled in mid-March.\n\nAthletic financial losses were not severe but certainly impactful, Rawak suggested. The only cuts announced so far affecting athletics have been some part-time positions. Staff development, travel and scheduling are areas where budgets will be trimmed, Rawak said.\n\nThe basketball teams staying overnight at hotels before games at nearby Drexel and Towson and the football team sleeping in a hotel the night before home games are potential cost-cutting targets. This fall, the soccer, volleyball and field hockey teams are playing fewer games that involve significantly less travel.\n\n\"We're in a different time now,\" Rawak said of COVID-19's impact on college athletics and the need to adjust.\n\nA slew of Division I schools have recently dropped sports: Old Dominion (wrestling); Cincinnati (men’s soccer); Furman (baseball and men’s lacrosse); Central Michigan (men’s track and field); Akron (men’s cross country, men’s golf, women’s tennis); East Carolina (men’s and women’s tennis, men’s and women’s swimming); Florida International (men’s indoor track); Appalachian State (men’s soccer, men’s indoor and outdoor track and men’s tennis); Wright State (men’s and women’s tennis and softball); Connecticut (men's cross country, swimming and tennis and women's rowing); and Brown (11 sports). Before those cuts, Brown's 38 teams were more than any school nationally except Harvard and Stanford.\n\nExcept for FCS-level Furman and Brown and non-football playing Wright State, all are FBS schools in Group of Five conferences. Commissioners from that collection of leagues, which do not reap the economic windfall of Power Five schools, recently requested a reduction in the NCAA requirement that they field a minimum of 16 teams. The NCAA Division I Council denied it.\n\nDelaware, which fields 21 athletic teams, had $44.32 million in athletic funding and expenses in the most recent 2017-18 fiscal review, according to the Knight Commission, including that $38.23 million in university backing. The $44.32 million was the figure that ranked 70th nationally in USA Today’s accounting.\n\nBy contrast, 34 football-playing schools from the FBS Mid-American Conference, Conference USA and Sun Belt Conference – all in that Group of Five – had lower operating expenses on athletics than Delaware, including sport-killers Central Michigan, Akron, FIU and Appalachian State.\n\nFBS schools may award 85 football scholarships compared with 63 for FCS schools such as Delaware, a significant additional expense.\n\nRawak, however, dismissed the Knight Commission math, claiming it gives a false impression that, she said, makes Delaware stand out more than it should in relation to its Division I peers.\n\nFor example, she said, sports medicine operates out of the Carpenter Center and is counted as part of the funding supporting athletics but is actually overseen by UD Student Health.\n\nShe also said some schools do not count the significant cost of athletic facility groundskeeping, as Delaware does, in figures given to the Knight Commission.\n\n“How everybody counts money is very different,” she said, including scholarships in those accounting variances. “It creates more questions.”\n\nThe Knight Commission, founded in 1989, is a panel of experts in education and athletics that aims to ensure college sports function within the academic framework of the institutions. The Collegiate Athletics Financial Information Database aims to improve the accountability of public Division I institutions by making their spending and earning more transparent.\n\nDREAM COMES TRUE: UD pitcher Sullivan signs with Phillies\n\n“I would guarantee you there are a lot of universities that are supported the way we are but they don’t count it so it’s not an accurate interpretation,” Rawak said, adding that includes fellow Colonial Athletic Association members.\n\nIn an email response to questions, Amy Perko, the Knight Commission’s chief executive officer, wrote that “the NCAA has made changes over the years to improve definitions and comparability but there may continue to be differences in how institutions report the data.\"\n\n\"That said,\" she added, \"these audited reports represent the most accurate athletics financial reports available and the data are used by the NCAA to produce ‘dashboard metrics’ that institutional leaders use to assess their athletic programs’ financial health. These institutional data are rarely seen by the public.”\n\nThe Knight Commission employs financial data that schools are required to submit to the NCAA that is “subject to agreed-upon procedures performed by a qualified independent accountant,” according to the commission, and approved by university presidents or chancellors.\n\nPerko added that “the Knight Commission has always believed that – at their best – intercollegiate sports provide important educational opportunities for college athletes and benefits for the entire university community. We also believe that more effective disclosure of finances – and of financial priorities – will enhance the long-term prospects of college sports by ensuring they remain part of, not apart from, the core mission of universities.’’\n\nMajor increase in athletic spending\n\nWhatever differences there may be between how schools do their accounting, there is no doubt Delaware has seen a huge increase in athletic expenditures and university support since Assanis and Rawak appeared in the spring of 2016.\n\nFor the 2015-16 school year, the last before they arrived, Delaware had $34.31 million in athletics funding, with $28.05 million, or 82%, coming from UD coffers.\n\nIn just two years, Delaware’s annual spending on athletics increased $10 million, all provided by the university.\n\n“I was looking for the best person to take the athletics program here to the next level,” Assanis said when Rawak was hired. “ ... The first thing we need to be is the best within the [Colonial Athletic Association].”\n\nRawak, who came to Delaware from the University of Michigan, was determined to build a stronger foundation upon which championship seasons could be constructed. Assanis provided the financial resources, with the board of trustees’ support.\n\n“If you were to look at each of the different programs and how they’ve achieved, my answer would be ‘Yes,’” Rawak said when asked if Delaware was making good on that investment. “They’re all in different places.”\n\nBLUE HENS BACK: First group returns to use athletic facilities\n\nIn that board of trustees' committee on student life and athletics meeting, Rawak described her intentions to make Delaware a “Cinderella story” in college athletics, suggesting the Blue Hens had to rise from wretched depths to reach championship heights. It’s why her strategic plan for athletics is titled “Project Glass Slipper.”\n\nIn actuality, Delaware seems miscast for that role.\n\nThe Blue Hens have hardly been viewed by collegiate counterparts as forlorn or deserving pity despite the ups and downs of their teams, making the rags-to-riches fairy-tale comparison suspect. Delaware has often been held in high regard by sporting peers, though many would agree that its teams could fare better overall in the conference.\n\nIn the few years before Rawak came, UD women’s basketball teams, thanks to Elena Delle Donne’s presence, went to the 2012 and 2013 NCAA tournaments. Their male counterparts followed in 2014.\n\nMen’s soccer, having not reached NCAA play since 1970, made the 2011 and 2013 NCAA brackets. Field hockey began its run of CAA titles and NCAA berths in 2013. Women’s track won the 2014 CAA title.\n\nBefore that, the football team reached national title games in 2003, 2007 and 2010, winning the first. Men’s lacrosse was in four NCAA tournaments from 2005-11, including a Final Four appearance in 2007; and volleyball made four NCAA trips from 2007-11.\n\nBut to enhance its championship chances, Delaware has spent more.\n\n\"It's allowing us to do something really special here for what I believe is a really special place and has the ability to achieve,\" Rawak said.\n\nOLYMPIC STAND RESONATES: Smith's, Carlos' 1968 protest still goes unheeded\n\nJMU, which has five fewer teams and 100 fewer athletes than Delaware, had $51.72 million in funding for 2017-18 with $41.7 million from institutional/government sources, most from mandatory fees imposed on students.\n\nThe USA Today data reveals FBS members Air Force Academy ($40.2 million) and Connecticut ($39 million) as the only others allocating more university-derived funds for athletics than Delaware.\n\nDelaware receives 86.25% of its athletic funding from the university, ranking it ninth among the 230 Division I schools in the USA Today compilation. Among the eight ahead of Delaware was CAA rival Towson (87.17%).\n\nThough it comes under the heading of “institutional/government support,” UD officials insist the university, not state taxpayers, provides the economic sustenance for Blue Hens sports. The Senate Joint Finance Committee approved $125 million in 2020-21 annual funding for UD on June 5.\n\nState Rep. John Kowalko, whose 25th district includes UD's campus, doubts the contention that taxpayer dollars are not being used to support athletics.\n\n“I’m saying, ‘Prove it,’” Kowalko said. “That money could be intermingled dramatically. … Until they agree they are willing to support the repeal of their FOIA, so I can look at these numbers, I don’t believe them.”\n\nKowalko was referring to the University of Delaware being exempt from state records laws, including most Freedom of Information Act requests. That means the university does not need to provide the public with details of its accounting.\n\n“I believe that they are co-mingling taxpayer money,” Kowalko added, suggesting some operational dollars from the state likely do support athletics. “It’s the same pot of soup.”\n\nIn response to a FOIA request submitted by The News Journal seeking more data on athletic funding, UD's associate vice president and deputy general counsel, Jennifer M. Becnel-Guzzo, wrote the “athletic department is not supported with public funds. Therefore, the university has no public records responsive to your request.”\n\nWhile one UD athletic official did compare Delaware’s institutional funding to those required student fees charged at JMU and many other schools, such as UConn, Rawak said that is not correct.\n\nShe said athletic funding comes from general university resources that are drawn from various reserves but that students and their families are “not paying for athletics.”\n\nDelaware also spent $11.77 million on athletic aid for its 600-plus student-athletes in 2017-18, according to the Knight Report. That’s roughly $20,000 per student-athlete.\n\nNEW APPROACH: COVID forces recruiting changes for Rocco\n\nUD’s $1.4 billion endowment does not pay for athletics and is presently not a viable source, Rawak said. But endowing components of athletics as a funding mechanism is a goal, she added.\n\nTuition and fees have typically risen about 4% annually for UD students, increasing $600 to $14,280 for in-state undergraduates in 2019-20 and $1,400 to $35,710 for their out-of-state counterparts.\n\n\"We don't use that to fund athletics,\" Rawak said, adding that the university has numerous income sources beyond student payments.\n\nSeveral UD faculty members not authorized to speak on behalf of the university or the athletic department, as well as those with knowledge of the subject outside the school, disputed Rawak's contention students are not helping to foot the bill for athletics, however.\n\nDavid Ridpath, an Ohio University sports management professor, agrees that “athletic programs at colleges and universities have value.” He is president of the board of directors for the Drake Group, which has a mission “to defend academic integrity in higher education from the corrosive aspects of commercialized college sports.”\n\n“But that value is often overstated and used as an excuse to spend more,” he told The News Journal, “such as when apologists claim that athletic success influences enrollment, donations, etc. when the evidence on that is mixed at best.\n\n“So it becomes a perpetual cycle of trying to be something you are not, and chasing someone else who is likely spending money they don’t have. A school can have a successful athletic program without continuing to spend more and more where likely the end game is exactly the same as when they started.”\n\nChanging to spur success\n\nPart of Rawak’s efforts to improve UD athletic fortunes has included changing head coaches in 12 of Delaware’s 21 varsity sports.\n\nThe seven conference titles Delaware has won since Rawak came – three in field hockey (2016, 2017 and 2019) and one each in men’s soccer (2016), baseball (2017), women’s golf (2017) and women’s outdoor track and field (2019) – were all by teams with head coaches who were here before Rawak’s arrival.\n\nIn 2016, Delaware also won the NCAA field hockey title.\n\n“If you were to look at the successes of our programs, collectively, all of them, one of the things to recognize is, Rome wasn’t built in a day,” said Rawak, who is frequently lauded by staff for her positive approach and leadership. “It takes time.\"\n\nThe 2019-20 school year was, by far, Delaware’s most successful recently from a won-loss standpoint before the shutdown.\n\nThe previous three, Blue Hen squads went 189-188-2 in 2016-17, 170-184-6 in 2017-18 and 162-200-3 last year. Along with that CAA women’s track title, the 2018-19 season did feature the return to the national rankings by the men’s lacrosse team.\n\nThe 147-99-4 record in 2019-20 was a dramatic improvement and likely reflected some new coaches reaping the benefits of their programs getting re-established.\n\nIn addition to more field hockey success, this school year featured a 22-11 record in men’s basketball, its best in six seasons; women’s soccer had its highest finish, second place, in 18 Colonial Athletic Association seasons and most wins (12) since 1994; women’s cross-country was a best-ever second in the CAA meet; men’s tennis was 14-1 with a chance at the winningest season in school history when it ended prematurely; softball was 19-4, equaling its best start ever, at the time spring sports were halted.\n\nOther sports, however, such as football – long the university’s pride and joy – and women’s basketball, struggled to regain past glories.\n\nLEARNING FROM LEGENDS: QBs enjoy video meetings with Blue Hen greats\n\nAfter ending a seven-year NCAA football playoff absence in 2018, Delaware went 5-7 last fall, its third under coach Danny Rocco. Despite a veteran lineup, women’s basketball was 12-17 under third-year coach Natasha Adair.\n\nAmong recent athletic upgrades at Delaware have been devoting more resources toward sports such as swimming, tennis, golf, cross-country and track, which were once designated as “low-tier.” Tennis players often supplied their own rackets, and runners received just one pair of shoes for a season.\n\nMuch of Rawak’s approach has gone toward adding staff positions aimed at supporting the athletic mission, such as in heath-, media-, academic- and leadership-related positions.\n\nIn 2015-16, Delaware spent $3.65 million on support and administrative compensation, according to the Knight Commission. Two years later, that figure had nearly doubled to $6.8 million.\n\nThe UD staff directory on BlueHens.com recently listed 219 positions, including 14 involved with recreation programs and intramural activities at Carpenter Sports Building on central campus.\n\nIn contrast, several FBS schools that are close to Delaware in terms of spending list far fewer, such as Conference USA’s Old Dominion (166), Mountain West member Wyoming (186) and the MAC’s Buffalo (193).\n\nThe University of Delaware does not reveal salaries of its coaches or athletic administrators, even though some are among the First State’s highest-paid employees.\n\nIn doing so, UD cites its status as a state-assisted yet privately chartered and governed institution. Taxpayer dollars do typically account for roughly 10% of the university’s annual operating budget.\n\nThe university's IRS Form 990, which is made public, does list the highest compensated employees.\n\nIt is known that Rocco was the third-highest paid UD employee in 2017, according to the most recently available IRS Form 990, with total compensation of $609,167. Rawak ranked seventh at $480,046.\n\nBoth have taken 5% pay cuts, along with Adair and men’s basketball coach Martin Ingelsby, as part of COVID-19 money-saving measures.\n\nRidpath, the Ohio University professor, termed Delaware’s institutional and government support “a significant amount of money that could have been used for other things to support the educational mission, but Delaware made a choice.”\n\nBut was it the right choice?\n\n“For Delaware, that is pretty high of an amount,” Ridpath said. “There are many disadvantages, not the least of which is aptly explained as robbing Peter to pay Paul. I don’t think some funding like this is inherently bad but this amount is too much considering where the money is coming from.\n\n“... The real danger is schools like Delaware that don’t generate enough revenue [income] still increasing spending. The question is why and how that impacts university?”\n\nNew financial sources surface\n\nThe huge financial impact athletics has on a college is not new.\n\nIn his 1918 tome “The Higher Learning in America,” economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen wrote: “College sports come in for ever increasing attention and take an increasingly prominent and voluminous place in the university’s life.”\n\nHe warned collegiate athletics was “earnestly pushed by the businesslike authorities” even though, he added, “it is the most widely out of touch with all learning.”\n\nThese are modern-day arguments as well, though UD athletes tend to perform better academically than their counterparts. Ten teams had perfect scores in 2018-19 in the NCAA’s Academic Progress Rate, which measures academic eligibility and retention of scholarship athletes over a four-year period.\n\nIn the introduction to his 2019 book, Intercollegiate Athletics Inc., George Mason University economics and public policy professor James T. Bennett wrote that collegiate athletic programs have become “gargantuan, taxpayer-supported spectacles that now dominate many public universities.”\n\nOf Delaware pulling so much of its athletic revenue from institutional sources, Bennett said, “That’s not revenue at all. Revenues come from ticket sales and paraphernalia sales. This isn’t revenue.”\n\nIt’s actually a subsidy that’s granted, in this case, by the university.\n\n“The whole thing is a scam, very candidly,” Bennett said. “I mean, what’s the purpose of the university? I thought it was education.”\n\n“Highest-paid guy is some loser coach,” added Bennett, who was speaking generally not specifically about anyone at Delaware. “What does it say about priorities? Spending tens of million dollars on programs with zero academic value. This is unheard of throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Think of how you could divert that money.”\n\nCENTER OF ATTENTION: Howard starter Prince transfers to Delaware\n\nDelaware has shown the potential to tap into other monetary resources, however.\n\nOne of Delaware’s biggest victories off the field in recent years, for all to see, did come in fundraising, though there was a substantial cost to the university as well.\n\nIn a campaign separate from normal athletic support involving capital funds, UD contributed $25 million toward the $60 million project to refurbish the west grandstand of Delaware Stadium and build the adjoining Whitney Athletic Center.\n\nThe other $35 million was raised through private donations, including a $10 million gift from 1980 graduate and former UD golf team member Ken Whitney and his wife, Elizabeth. The nearly two-year project is slated to be concluded late this summer.\n\nThe easy transmission of the coronavirus between people, which has led to social-distancing standards, jeopardizes the immediate future of crowded assemblies and the financial rewards that come with them, however. Delaware has not yet announced how it will handle or limit football crowds this season.\n\nUD has other facility improvements it would like to tackle, including updating the east stands at Delaware Stadium and a complete modernization of the window-less Delaware Field House. The Delaware Stadium/Whitney Athletic Center project demonstrated there are potential outside financial resources for athletics.\n\n“The fundraising we did here,” Rawak said during a tour of Delaware Stadium, “was a significantly positive sign that people believe in the vision and are invested in it.\"\n\nOfficials also visualize Delaware Stadium as a greater potential revenue generator by using it as a site for large-scale events, much the way the Carpenter Center is a setting for concerts, graduations and other gatherings beyond UD games. Placing a temporary public ice-skating rink inside Delaware Stadium in the winter, for instance, and even playing hockey games there has been proposed.\n\nThe athletic department received just $710,000 from donor contributions in 2017-18, below the FCS median, according to the Knight Commission (Donations for the Delaware Stadium/Whitney Center project count separately because they're for a capital project not athletic expenses).\n\nWith the exception of several Historically Black Colleges and Universities, most FCS schools had a larger percentage of their revenue from those sources than Delaware.\n\nIn marked contrast, perennial FCS football champ North Dakota State pulled in $6.7 million in donor contributions; CAA rival William & Mary, $5.8 million; Missouri State, $4.7 million; football power Montana State, $4.2 million; and JMU, $2.5 million.\n\nWith schools having to rein in athletic costs because of COVID-19’s impact, Delaware faces a stiff challenge in its continued effort to improve its sports fortunes while also being fiscally fit and tuned in to important social issues.\n\n“I don’t resent that fact that they are trying to make major sports programs prominent for this university,” Kowalko said, “but is it at the cost of academics? Is it at the cost of integrating the school when they talk about diversity?”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

But critics worry that his history of negotiating advantageous deals with a select group of developers on the Riverfront could derail success and simply make the rich richer.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"There is almost nothing I can imagine where what's good for a developer would not be good for the city,\" Purzycki said recently.\n\nAfter winning Wilmington's Democratic mayoral primary last month, Purzycki is relying on his record of economic growth — calling it \"unmatched in Delaware\" — to sail through the November general election. He faces Republican businessman Robert Martin and Independent Steve Washington — two candidates lacking high expectations for victory in a Democrat stronghold.\n\nFor two decades, Purzycki oversaw the transformation of the Christina Riverfront from an industrial wasteland to a family-friendly entertainment destination heralded by city, state and community leaders. Along the way, RDC leaders have leveraged an estimated $350 million in public funds into $1 billion in private investment, bringing more than 1,400 residents and 6,000 employees to the district, according to the corporation's statistics.\n\nSupporters call Purzycki a courageous and transformational leader who won't back down.\n\n\"He feels a sense of urgency, which is contagious, surrounds himself with good people and doesn’t give up when he’s convinced he’s right,” said U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., who was governor when the Riverfront Development Corp. was formed. \"Without Mike at the helm, I’m not sure we’d have made it as far as we have.”\n\nPurzycki's pro-business platform — he supports giving companies tax and regulatory incentives to spur employment — and direct pipeline to state leaders have earned him support among Delaware's power brokers in the legal and development communities. Taken together, those constituencies donated tens of thousands of dollars to the 71-year-old candidate, according to campaign finance records. Purzycki raised nearly $42,000, more than his seven rivals combined, during a recent three-week fundraising period, records show.\n\nPurzycki is proud of that endorsement. It proves that people who made significant investments in the city trust him to deliver, he says.\n\nCritics worry that the larger community could be shortchanged under a Purzycki administration. Over his tenure overseeing the development group, Purzycki has been blamed for not fulfilling the RDC's original mission (which also included redevelopment along the Brandywine), brokering back-room deals with real estate investors for public money, and for creating a wealthy playground on the river that doesn't encourage minority participation or benefit Wilmington's most troubled neighborhoods.\n\n\"As a businessman and making his clients and sponsors money, Mike's done well with that,\" said the Rev. Derrick Johnson, a Wilmington pastor who clashed with Purzycki while serving on the board of the HOPE Commission.\n\n\"But he's also separated communities,\" Johnson, of Joshua Harvest Church, added. \"It plays into this notion that there's this classist divide between us.\"\n\nPurzycki's opponents raised similar concerns during the primary. During one mayoral debate, after Purzycki questioned Eugene Young's experience, the Delaware Center for Justice Advocacy director fired back that the city is \"not a corporation where you ... just turn a profit.\"\n\nIn another debate, City Councilwoman Maria Cabrera called the \"gentrified\" Riverfront an example of what has gone wrong in the city's economic development policy.\n\n\"We should have mandated they hire minorities,\" said Cabrera, the city's first female Hispanic council member.\n\nThe RDC, as a quasi-public agency, is not required to keep statistics on minority contractors or other employees at the Riverfront. Anecdotally, there is \"plenty\" of minority participation, according to Acting Executive Director Megan McGlinchey.\n\nPurzycki acknowledges that managing a nonprofit development corporation, which sells waterfront views and receives roughly half its $6.4 million budget from the state, is a different animal than a diverse city with entrenched poverty, gun violence and a $155 million budget that never seems to stretch far enough.\n\n\"I will concede the fact that the average profile of the employee on the Riverfront is not consistent with the job market available in our neighborhoods,\" he said. \"I get that. We've got to deal with that.\"\n\nYet he remains convinced that he can transfer the Riverfront's success to all of Wilmington by adopting a similar strategy: Use zoning tools to bar certain businesses, such as warehouses, from entering a neighborhood; knock down dilapidated buildings; lay down infrastructure; and attract private business.\n\n\"There are places in our city that aren't developing and people want them to be something — a shopping center, a park, an employment center,\" he said. \"The trouble is you have to create an environment that the employer wants to be in, that the developer wants to develop in.\"\n\nYou have to improve the environment or else, frankly, they're not going to come.\"\n\n'Fool's errand'\n\nBefore the trampoline park, beer garden, CrossFit, and the 212-acre wildlife refuge, there was contaminated land and little hope.\n\nCarper recalled inviting then-Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer — father of Baltimore's revived Inner Harbor— to walk the Christina riverfront back when \"you could hardly tell the river was there\" because it was so ugly.\n\n\"What do you think?\" the Delaware governor asked his counterpart. \"Is this a fool's errand?\"\n\nSchaefer persuaded Carper to create a public-private partnership to shepherd redevelopment of the district, once a manufacturing hub for railroad cars, paper mill rollers, boilers and boats. In 1995, the Governor's Task Force established the Riverfront Development Corp. with $4.5 million in seed funding to oversee the development of the Brandywine and Christina rivers toward the goals of creating economic vitality, improving the environment, encouraging historic preservation and promoting public access.\n\nPurzycki, a former New Castle County Councilman and state Senate attorney, joined as executive director a year later. Early on, he realized that in order to persuade developers to sign on, he had to make the riverfront appear like a prosperous place to do business.\n\nSTORY: Riverfront Development Corporation marks two decades\n\nThe Brandywine took a back seat after it became clear that the quickest path to redevelopment was targeting land on either side of the Christina River along Justison and South Market streets. In the future, the RDC may revisit bringing manufacturing jobs and recreational amenities to the Brandywine, Purzycki said.\n\nThat can't happen soon enough, according to Wilmington Councilman Darius Brown, who represents the 3rd District.\n\n\"For well over a generation, 7th Street Peninsula, 12th Street Connector, the former Electric Hose & Rubber factory site on East 12th Street and Todds Lane have been ideas, conversations and unimplemented plans,\" Brown wrote in a recent email. \"That has to change.\"\n\nLike moving pieces on a chess board, RDC leaders have experimented with different Riverfront offerings. A much-promoted exhibition center failed after a handful of blockbuster presentations. The space later became the Chase Center, which now hosts business conferences, trade shows and weddings.\n\nOutlet retailers bailed at the Shipyard Shops, which is now an office and retail complex that is 92 percent occupied, according to the RDC.\n\nKahunaville, once Delaware's biggest nightclub, is now the Delaware Children’s Museum with a miniature golf course out back.\n\n\"The best projects were the ones we didn't do,\" Purzycki said, referring to the chain restaurants and lower-grade hotels that wanted to locate there.\n\nSTORY: Riverfront beer garden returning in '17 with upgrades\n\nThe Riverfront has had its share of setbacks, the former University of Delaware football star acknowledges. In 2002, a state-commissioned report cited weak financial management at RDC under Purzycki, blaming the corporation's $3 million cash shortfall on a failed land deal and RDC staff's lack of experience in mounting large-scale exhibitions at the First USA Riverfront Arts Center.\n\nThe report also recommended increased scrutiny on the relationship between the RDC and the private development company owned by the Pettinaro family. The Pettinaros are a major landowner on the Christina Riverfront and their company was hired to do much of the construction, including the Shipyard Shops.\n\nPurzycki disputed many of the report's findings at the time, explaining that the study held the Riverfront agency to the same standards as a for-profit organization. More recently, he said the RDC functions like a government agency requiring long-term public subsidy like the Parks or Police departments.\n\nThe RDC, with a staff of 10, has reported an operating loss of $4 million to $13 million in each of the last dozen years, according to IRS tax forms. A $7.8 million operating loss was reported in fiscal 2015, the most recent year available. Purzycki earned more than $176,000 in salary and other compensation that year, more than Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams's current salary of $115,276.\n\nMcGlinchey, the acting RDC director, said the operating figures are skewed because they include real estate depreciation and don't account for the state's annual contribution, which has hovered around $3 million, along with revenues pumped into the local economy.\n\nIn reality, McGlinchey said, the RDC is performing break-even on operations or at a surplus. Further, most if not all the public money expended at the Riverfront to date has been repaid, largely through increased tax revenues, she said. By next year, public revenues associated with new Riverfront activity will pay for all public expenditures, including an estimated $66 million for amenity projects like Tubman-Garrett Riverfront Park that were never intended to “make money,\" according to a 2012 economic analysis of the Riverfront conducted by University of Delaware researchers.\n\nJudging the RDC on numbers alone, it has been a success for state and local governments, said Jonathan Justice, a UD public policy professor.\n\nWhat the RDC is not, however, is a true community development corporation — a grassroots effort focused on developing community resources, Justice said. Rather, it functions as an arm of the state without having to follow the same contracting procedures or disclosure requirements.\n\n\"It was created in a form that provides just enough distance that some of the rules apply differently,\" he said.\n\nRewarding risk-takers\n\nThe News Journal has chronicled how the RDC, over its history, has sealed deals with select developers willing to take on the risk of the Riverfront. As of 2012, the Buccini/Pollin Group had benefited from more than half of taxpayers' $250 million investment in the Riverfront, according to a previous newspaper report.\n\nIn a recent interview, BPG co-president Rob Buccini praised Purzycki's ability to look several steps ahead in assessing projects.\n\n\"We're not always in agreement, but he's usually right,\" Buccini said. \"I have to be a lot nicer to him now.\"\n\nAdded Purzycki: \"It's hard to imagine our city without Buccini/Pollin — building after building after building...It was money extraordinarily well spent.\"\n\nSTORY: Buccini/Pollin buys 3 buildings in Wilmington\n\nTime and again, Purzycki went to bat with the state for BPG and the Riverfront.\n\nThe Penn Cinema project, built in partnership with BPG, hit a snag after Norfolk Southern Railway Co. sued the state in Delaware Superior Court, alleging that its south Madison Street property was illegally seized for the cinema. The two parties eventually settled.\n\nIn 2010, the RDC secured the property from the state Department of Transportation for $2 million — nearly $4 million less than its highest appraised value. At the time, Purzycki said that appraisal didn't take into account the recession's impact on the Riverfront real estate.\n\nSoon after, Purzycki approached the state about giving a $6 million letter of credit for a 10-story Westin Hotel being developed by BPG principals. That prompted some lawmakers and hotel operators to complain about unfair competition.\n\nAt the time, The News Journal published emails between Purzycki and Secretary of State Jeff Bullock in which the pair discussed ways to cobble together cash from taxpayer-supported agencies to fund the hotel next to the Chase Center on the Riverfront.\n\nIn one, Purzycki asked Bullock: \"If the state is a supporter of the project, do you want to keep a high or low profile?\"\n\nIn the end, the city of Wilmington and RDC provided $3 million in loan guarantees for the Westin, which has since been repaid, according to RDC officials.\n\nThe Westin's current occupancy rate is 77 percent, according to the hotel's operator, beating original projections. Chase Center revenue is up 7 percent this year with nearly $5.4 million in total sales.\n\nBut the full-service hotel hasn't been the game-changer that advocates had envisioned.\n\n\"The Westin hasn't helped the Chase Center yet,\" Purzycki said recently. \"It's only 180 rooms so if you're going to bring 500 people to town, 180 rooms isn't enough.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Buccini/Pollin announced plans to build two new hotels at the Riverfront, a 200-room Marriott and a 100-room Homewood Suites. Unlike the Westin, new hotel projects won't seek public funding, Purzycki said.\n\nSTORY: Candidates discuss crime, education and parks\n\nBy the end of this year, work is expected to begin on a bridge connecting U.S. 13 with the Riverfront, opening up the south side of the river to more development.\n\nThe RDC doesn't track vacancy rates in the district, but McGlinchey estimates they're under 10 percent overall.\n\nAs the Riverfront continues to evolve, the public shouldn't lose sight of how far it has come, said Edward C. Ratledge, who has studied the fiscal impacts of the Riverfront.\n\nTo illustrate his point, the director of UD's Center for Applied Demography & Survey Research cited the state's investment in drugmaker AstraZeneca, which came to Delaware in 1999. The state gave the company more than $40 million in grants and tax credits and spent another $70 million upgrading roads in and around AstraZeneca's Fairfax campus.\n\nSince that time, the British pharmaceutical giant has reduced Delaware jobs to about 2,100 employees as part of company-wide layoffs and is looking to relocate its operations elsewhere in Delaware.\n\nBy comparison, the RDC transformed a brownfield into a thriving mini-city.\n\n\"You can't gentrify a junkyard,\" Ratledge said, responding to Riverfront critics. \"A lot of things are controversial down there because you don't know the outcome.\"\n\nDemanding accountability\n\nAround town, residents are already calling Purzycki \"Mr. Mayor.\"\n\nHe has issued a slew of recommendations for how to improve Wilmington: Speed up the construction permitting process, expand blue-collar job opportunities and encourage employers to hire local and employees to live local.\n\nSTORY: What a Purzycki administration might look like\n\nAs he did at the Riverfront, he says he will emphasize staff accountability. He supports assembling neighborhood stabilization units, teams of people from multiple city departments that assume responsibility for distinct geographic areas.\n\nA management audit is in order, according to Purzycki. Any city department that isn't functioning effectively will be considered for cuts. He declined to name specific departments.\n\nMcGlinchey is Purzycki's likely successor at the RDC and the two look forward to continued partnerships. At the same time, Purzycki has pledged to invest in struggling neighborhoods without displacing current residents and tackle recidivism as a fundamental public safety issue, as he did as board chairman of the HOPE Commission.\n\n\"I think the mayor has to be more politically sensitive than I've had to be,\" he said recently. \"I've had to have political considerations with decisions we've made but the mayor represents everybody in every corner of the city.\"\n\nPurzycki, who would be city's first white mayor in more than two decades, fiercely defends his positions, Pastor Johnson recalled. During a 2008 HOPE Commission meeting, Johnson and Purzycki got into a heated exchange over implementing a program to assign social workers to dangerous drug corners. Johnson criticized his colleagues for not dispatching the workers quickly enough. The argument escalated and Purzycki got in Johnson's face, according to a newspaper report at the time. Johnson slapped Purzycki and the two were separated; both eventually apologized.\n\nPurzycki operates on the premise that if you fix the environment, then you'll \"fix people,\" Johnson said recently. But that underestimates entrenched inequality.\n\n\"The wealthier folks just have more ground,\" he said.\n\nPurzycki disagreed. Aligning the priorities of the business community with the larger community will increase the tax base, bring in more jobs and higher wages, he said.\n\n\"There's no zero sum there,\" he added. \"Who's losing in that one?\"\n\nNews Journal reporters Scott Goss and Jeff Mordock contributed to this report.\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.

At the time, he said his purchase of a Wilmington apartment complex could lead to the perception of favoritism or a conflict of interest.\n\n\"I believe the necessary difference between my political and professional roles is strained,\" he wrote in his resignation letter.\n\nOver his tenure, Purzycki was dogged by conflict-of-interest accusations given his dual roles as a real estate investor and councilman voting on zoning decisions that affected one of his business partners. At one point, Purzycki called in the state Attorney General's Office to weigh in; investigators ruled that he had violated no laws.\n\nBut Purzycki also helped write the county ethics code, criticized his political opponents for their cozy relationships with developers, intervened on constituents' behalf to block two office projects, and encouraged the county to wean itself off state and federal support and focus on local efficiencies.\n\nHe had a running feud with Edward \"Pete\" Peterson, former president of the state AFL-CIO and Peterson's daughter, Karen.\n\nBut time has healed political wounds.

Rawak termed the university’s financial support “truly remarkable. I am, and I know our coaches and team members are, very grateful.”\n\nIt was also revealed Delaware has already raised $23 million of the remaining $35 million from private donors. Many of the private donors were on the field at halftime during Saturday's announcement, which included fireworks and a video presentation.\n\n\"For us who have been part of this tradition for so many decades, we always wanted to construct a monument that was commensurate with the tradition that was already built,\" said Joe Purzycki, the 1969 UD football captain standing beside brother Mike, the Wilmington mayor who played for Delaware from 1964-66.\n\n\"For years we've been dragging our feet,\" added Joe Purzycki, excited that construction of such a facility will now take place.\n\n\"It'll give the program a real shot in the arm,\" Mike Purzycki said.\n\nThe stadium upgrade and athletic performance center construction are part of UD’s new fundraising campaign, branded “Delaware First,” which has an overall goal of $750 million.\n\nBACKGROUND:$750 million needed to bring the UD to 'the next level'\n\nAmong the outside donors are Delaware Board of Trustees member Kenneth C. Whitney and his wife, Liz Whitney, who were not present Saturday. They have made what UD termed \"a transformational lead gift\" of $10 million that will go toward the athletic performance center. It will bear the Whitney name, Rawak said.\n\nKen Whitney played golf at Delaware from 1977 to 1979 and graduated in 1980 with an accounting degree. He has been a longtime employee at the Blackstone Group, an asset management company, in New York City and is also a Tony Award-winning producer.\n\nIn 2005, they established the Whitney Family Scholarship Endowment. They then created the Whitney Family Endowed Chair in UD's Lerner College of Business and Economics in 2011.\n\n“Athletics is an integral part of creating an extraordinary experience for our students, our alumni and our community. Our student-athletes and fans deserve top-notch facilities,” UD President Dennis Assanis said. “Through the Delaware First campaign, we are committed to strengthening the athletics program to [the] Blue Hen nation now and for generations to come.”\n\nConstruction will not begin until Delaware has raised all the money, which they hope to conclude by the end of the 2018 football season.\n\nThe plan is to have the grandstand seating plus the upper sections of the building, containing the club suites and seating and press box area, done by the 2019 football season. The first home game that year is Sept. 7 against Delaware State.\n\nThe rest of the athletic performance center project would be concluded in time for the 2020 season.\n\n“After all the false starts, it’s just fantastic to see this finally come to fruition,” said Middletown resident Harold Smith, a 1964 UD grad and baseball player who has been regularly attending football games since 1966. “It’s so needed by all of our athletes, not just football. It’s just going to be wonderful to see them have the facilities they need to be better students and better athletes.\n\n“The improvements of the stands will benefit the fans and make us more proud of our stadium and bring it up to more modern standards. As far as amenities for the media, which people may not think that’s important, what we have now is an embarrassment to our university.”\n\nRyan Allen, a freshman guard on the men’s basketball team who would be a senior in the fall of 2020, said it’s “very exciting” to know a facility such as the athletic performance center is coming.\n\n“It’s a great sign for the recruits, too,” he said. “We’ll be able to get a lot of things done in there.”\n\nCoaches have already used the future facility in recruiting, where it is “extraordinarily significant,” football coach Danny Rocco said.\n\n“The landscape is changing so dramatically across the country,” Rocco added. “All these schools are trying to do things to remain as relevant as they can in the recruiting market. It will offer a definite spike across the board for Delaware athletics.”\n\nJohn Dollmeyer, president of the Blue Hen Touchdown Club fan support group, said the commitment of the UD Board of Trustees and Assanis to Blue Hen athletes was particularly noteworthy.\n\n“It’s gonna put us in the upper echelon of the CAA [Colonial Athletic Association] and be a real boost for the university,” Dollmeyer said.\n\nHNTB Architecture Inc., a design and construction management firm that has worked on many professional and NCAA Division I football stadiums, has done the renderings. Delaware now has a request for proposal out allowing companies to bid on the design phase of the project.\n\nThe changes will slightly lower stadium capacity because the newer chair-back seats will be wider. But Delaware hasn’t averaged more than 20,000 fans per home game since 2010.\n\nDelaware Stadium is also the home of the university’s men’s and women’s lacrosse teams. Aside from Blue Hens football and lacrosse games, UD’s annual commencement ceremony, the annual DFRC Blue-Gold all-star high school football game in June and a few other college and high school football games, the stadium is rarely used for big events.\n\nRawak hopes to change that.\n\n“This is an athletic asset, but it really is a community asset, a university asset and a state asset that brings people together,” she said, mentioning concerts as one possible draw. “We’re envisioning so much more being able to be accomplished and people gathering in ways they are not now.”\n\nDelaware, because of its large football following and – until recently – winning tradition, has also long been viewed as a candidate for a move to the highest level of NCAA competition – the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. Delaware presently resides in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision, which has a national championship playoff, won by Delaware in 2003. Delaware has won six national championships in football dating back to 1946.\n\nRawak said the project should not be viewed as a signal of such a move.\n\n“There is aspiration in everything that we’re working to do here,” Rawak said. “But at the end of the day, what we need to do is be competing where we are and working toward winning national championships at the FCS level. That’s not a bad thing.”\n\nRawak added that the upgraded facility “gives us the opportunity to have choices. And during that period of time, I think the landscape of college athletics, as we’re seeing things take place, is going to adjust. How exactly? I’m not 100 percent sure. We can’t project that future. Are we paying attention? Absolutely we’re paying attention.”\n\nFuture stadium improvements are planned in the east stands and end zones, though Rawak would not offer specifics or a timetable.\n\n“None of that matters unless we accomplish this,” she said.\n\nShe added that the neighboring Delaware Field House, which “needs to be gutted,” is also in need of a major overhaul apart from its artificial turf indoor practical field installed several years ago.\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

First-round games are Nov. 24.\n\nThe university had announced in November 2017 it would renovate the West (home-side) stands at Delaware Stadium with improved seating, provide luxury options and build a modern structure for media and coaches’ booths.\n\nJust outside the stadium on the west side and connected to it would be a 90,000-square-foot structure housing a wellness center, athletic training, sports medicine, nutrition, sports psychology and strength and conditioning facilities to serve UD student-athletes.\n\nIt was christened the Whitney Athletic Center after a $10 million gift from 1980 graduate and former UD golf team member Ken Whitney and his wife, Elizabeth.\n\n“The Whitney Athletic Center will play an essential role in helping ensure the success of our student-athletes, both in competition and in the classroom,” UD president Dennis Assanis said in a university press release. “Ken and Liz Whitney have demonstrated their deep commitment to our students through their generous gift, and we appreciate everyone who has followed their lead in supporting this project.”\n\nOf that $60 million, the university was providing $25 million, with athletics raising the other $35 million with an eye on beginning work after the 2017 football season. The “Build Our Home” athletic project is part of UD’s Delaware First fund-raising campaign launched in 2017.\n\nRawak said Delaware has raised $32 million, which is enough to start the work, and is certain it’ll have the rest by its June 2018 deadline.\n\n“We have many people who have made verbal commitments and we’re just working to get those things finalized and formalized,” Rawak said. “We’re very grateful to the board [of trustees] and the president for granting us the opportunity to move forward and put shovels in the ground.”\n\nDELAWARE STADIUM\n\nReviewing the best games seen fromoutgoing press box\n\nSkeptics wondered if renovations would ever happen\n\nDelaware announces long-awaited stadium improvements\n\nThe cost hasn’t changed in the past year, she said.\n\nJake Giusti, a defensive back on Delaware's 2010-14 teams, was among those honored at halftime for having contributed to the project.\n\n\"It was the greatest four-and-a-half years of my life,\" said Giusti, a Florida native who is now a medical-device salesman in New York City for Stryker. \"With the opportunity Delaware gave me to get a football scholarship and play four-and-a-half seasons, it was the least I could do to help them get back. It's a great university and a great athletic program and Chrissi has a great vision. It was my way of saying thank you.\"\n\nConstruction is being done by Barton Malow, a Michigan-based company that was involved in Rose Bowl and Michigan Stadium renovations, and Wilmington’s EDiS, which took part in the original building of Delaware Stadium when it opened in 1952.\n\nThe architect is HOK Sports, whose recent stadium renovations include Georgia’s Sanford Stadium.\n\nWhile the seating work will be done by next season’s Aug. 29 football opener at Delaware Stadium against Delaware State, the press box will be usable but not complete and amenities for those in club seating will also not be finished, Rawak said.\n\nThe Whitney Athletic Center is not expected to be completed until June 2020.\n\nThe club-seating area in the stadium is a major change from plans released last year by Delaware. Initial renderings had club seating at the top of the west stands and then connected to the lower floor of what would be a two-story press box, where there would be gathering areas.\n\nNow, club seating will comprise the eight first rows of the stadium closest to the field from end-to-end on the refurbished west side and comprise roughly 1,100 seats.\n\n“That’s based on feedback we received from our fans,” Rawak said. “They like being low. They want to be able to be close to the field. It was very clear from the feedback so that was an adjustment we made.”\n\nClub-seat holders will have access to a room that will be constructed behind the stands and connected to the second floor of the Whitney Center, with an entrance through the bottom of Section B. It will not offer a view of the football field but will have TV monitors and other amenities, including a bar. That area will not be completed before next season.\n\nThe structure at the top of the stadium with media facilities and coaches’ booths will now be just one level.\n\nDelaware Stadium has long been highly regarded for its viewing angles because of the steepness of its stands, and that will not change, Rawak said, as the concrete base of the grandstand will remain intact. Even the first row of those club seats will be high off the field, as the box seats there now are.\n\n“I’m really pleased we didn’t have to tear down. That was a big win for us,” Rawak said of the economic savings and also being able to maintain the stadium’s treasured sight lines.\n\nSideline hedges behind the Delaware bench will have to be removed, however.\n\nThe other major change is that sections C, D and E – the middle part of the west stands – will have chairback seats from top to bottom. The entire stadium is presently bleacher seating.\n\nStadium capacity, which is presently about 22,000, will decrease slightly because chairback seats take up more space.\n\nDelaware Stadium will still be able to hold its normal events, such as Delaware lacrosse games in the spring, UD commencement in May and the DFRC Blue-Gold Delaware High School All-Star Football Game in June. Seating options may be limited, however, which could be a problem for commencement, the only event that fills the stadium.\n\nDelaware plans to release more specific football seating information to previous and potential ticket buyers in January. There will be a price increase for the higher-quality chairback seats.\n\nGround-level improvements will also include modernized concessions and bathrooms. In one ode to tradition, Rawak said, the popular “pee wall” will be retained in some form because of strong public opinion. That particular men’s bathroom is located at the southwest corner features large troughs in which men urinate while water runs into it from pipes above.\n\nImproving the press box and coaching booths and providing improved seating options have been considered a Delaware Stadium need since the 1980s. The stadium didn’t even have handrails on its steep stairways until several years ago.\n\nOver the years, various plans were hatched to modernize Delaware Stadium, some with fancy renderings. A 2008 HOK Sports plan featured a costly redesigned UD athletic complex reflecting the central green layout of main campus.\n\nAt last, improvements are imminent.\n\nFuture plans call for fixing up the East side of Delaware Stadium and major improvements to the Delaware Field House.\n\n“I just really want everyone to feel incredible pride in this,” Rawak said of the stadium improvements and Whitney Athletic Center addition. “It’s a game changer.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

He will play for his third Super Bowl championship on Sunday, when the Patriots take on the Eagles in Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis.\n\nHarmon doesn't take any of this for granted.\n\n\"It puts everything in perspective coming from Delaware, a small state,\" Harmon said. \"Not a lot of guys from there make it to the NFL, so when you’re put in positions like this, it just lets me really understand how blessed I am.\"\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nBut this experience is different. Harmon is playing against the hometown team for most of Delaware. In fact, many of Harmon's friends growing up are Eagles' fans, and he has heard from them often over the last several weeks as the Eagles have made their improbable Super Bowl run.\n\n\"They always tell me best of luck, and they'll say, 'I hope you play well and have a great game, but you're going to lose,'\" Harmon said with a laugh.\n\n\"I wouldn't expect anything else. That area is so loyal to the Philadelphia Eagles, and they have a big fan base in Delaware. They'll root for their team instead of a friend or even a family member.\"\n\nHarmon has shared each of his Super Bowl experiences by flying out his immediate family – his parents, Derik and Dawn; his wife, Christine, his two children, ages 6 and 2; and his grandparents and in-laws.\n\nEAGLES: Wilmington's Wendell Smallwood, family living Super Bowl dream\n\nEAGLES: Team turns to Brett Favre for inspiration\n\nEAGLES: TE Trey Burton knows is role\n\nAnd it's just as special to them now as it was when it first happened during Harmon's second season in 2014, when the Patriots hung on to beat the Seattle Seahawks.\n\n\"I try to bring the same people because those are the ones who sacrificed for me to get to where I’m at,\" Harmon said. \"It’s a little token of love for me to bring them here and celebrate this with. They love it. They never expect it. Every time I tell them that they’re coming, they’re filled with joy and tell me how much they appreciate it. It makes it all worthwhile.\"\n\nSo do the Super Bowl rings. As Harmon's career has evolved from Caesar Rodney star to Rutgers to the Patriots' third-round draft pick in 2013, so has his role on the team and his influence. The Patriots named him one of their captains this season.\n\nThe Patriots start three safeties in Harmon, Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung. Harmon is on the field for 66 percent of the Patriots' defensive snaps. Harmon, who led the Patriots with four interceptions this season, is quickly becoming known as \"The Closer\" for his penchant for game-sealing interceptions in the fourth quarter.\n\nThat began when he intercepted former University of Delaware quarterback Joe Flacco in the end zone with 1:46 left to seal New England's 35-31 win over the Ravens on Jan. 10, 2015 in an AFC Divisional Round playoff game.\n\nHe intercepted Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger in the end zone in the final seconds of a Dec. 17 game, with the Patriots leading 27-24. The Patriots clinched the home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs with the victory.\n\nIn all, Harmon has 13 interceptions in his career. Ten of them have come in the fourth quarter, and six of those came in the final two minutes of the game.\n\nIn fact, it would be a bad omen for the Eagles if Harmon were to intercept a pass from Nick Foles on Sunday. The Patriots have never lost a game in which Harmon has an interception.\n\n\"Duron is around the ball,” Patriots coach Bill Belichick told reporters who cover the Patriots after that game. “He reads the quarterback and the ball well.\"\n\nThe Patriots showed how much they value Harmon last spring by signing him to a four-year contract worth $17 million. Belichick is known for his win-at-all-costs approach, which notoriously once consisted of releasing a player on Christmas Eve.\n\nBut Belichick has also shown loyalty to players he respects and admires. Harmon is one of those players.\n\n\"He’s probably grown a little each year,\" Belichick said. \"Duron’s a very smart player, prepares well, has great communication skills in the secondary with the linebackers, the adjustments the signal callers have to make in our defense based on formation. He brings a lot of positives to the table. He’s a very good worker. And off the field, a very inspirational guy in the weight room, meetings, things like that.\n\n\"He gets guys going. He’s got a good energy.\"\n\nEagles defensive end Chris Long has seen that, too. Long played for the Patriots last season and said he got to know Harmon well.\n\n\"He’s an awesome player,\" Long said. \"I think he’s been under the radar nationally. He’s really come into his own. I think he’s become one of their best players on defense. He has made big plays for them. He’s a hard worker.\n\n\"A lot of people may not see that, but he’s a leader as well. You can tell he stepped into a leadership role for them, and that’s big when you’re able to become a leader for that team.\"\n\nThe Patriots are relying on that to continue for Harmon, who credits former and longtime CR football coach Mike Schonewolf for instilling that in him at a young age.\n\nAnd that has enabled Harmon to appreciate what he has accomplished over five NFL seasons that have never ended before the third week of January.\n\n\"I tell you, it never gets old,\" Harmon said. \"It’s a humbling feeling because there are people who play in this league for 13-plus years who never get close to being in the Super Bowl, let alone making the playoffs.\n\n\"At the same time, it’s something we work hard for. We put in a lot of work year in and year out. Each year is its own year. We try to just separate the years, wash out what happened the year before and focus on the task at hand, and that’s getting better and trying to be where we are today.\"\n\nAs usual, that means playing into the first weekend of February.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

The Dukes were preseason favorites in the league coaches’ poll.\n\nBut for a program such as Delaware’s, which always expects to contend, the 68-43 margin could have elicited alarm.\n\nThe Blue Hens appeared woefully ill-equipped to cope with JMU. The defeat was littered with statistical uh-ohs that should’ve raised the eyebrows of the 1,172 in attendance and many others who follow the Blue Hens’ women’s basketball fortunes.\n\nAsked afterward if the outcome was more a reflection on JMU’s prowess or Delaware’s shortcomings, coach Natasha Adair didn’t flinch.\n\n“It’s absolutely more about us,” she said. “ … For the first time, I would say, for 40 minutes, we were a step slow. I didn’t think we had the fight that I know we have, that I’ve seen in this group.”\n\nEx-Hodgson, Delaware standout Nichols earns raves from Bears' Nagy\n\nIn falling behind 39-21 at halftime, Delaware shot 27 percent from the field while making just one of six 3-point tries, was 4-for-12 at the foul line and was outrebounded 26-21. JMU drained its first nine foul shots and scored 24 of its 30 points from the field in the paint.\n\nDelaware’s third-quarter response wasn’t particularly powerful or persuasive.\n\nIt consisted of 3-for-21 shooting from the field, two more missed foul shots, six points and four turnovers. JMU’s lead grew to 53-27 then eventually sprouted to 65-34.\n\n“I thought we got looks,” Adair said. “We got to the rim; we got to the free-throw line. But you can’t go 8-for-22 [Delaware’s final free-throw showing]. We took 67 shots. You can’t go 17-for-67.\n\n“There’s still a bunch of basketball to play, and we want to be our best team in March. But opening night?”\n\nAdair added, “There’s a standard” that Delaware just did not meet.\n\nThe Hens have two months to change that.\n\n“I don’t think it defines us for the rest of the season,” said junior forward Samone DeFreese. “I think it’s a big wake-up call that we have to go get it, and we can’t wait for it to come to us.”\n\nDelaware has now lost an agonizing 13 straight and 19 of the last 22 encounters with James Madison dating back to the Hens’ 77-67 upset win over then-22nd-ranked JMU at the Carpenter Center in 2007 when both were NCAA at-large selections.\n\nUD men rally past William & Mary\n\nThe majority of those 19 defeats were also one-sided.\n\nThe only three UD wins since came in 2012 and 2013 when the Blue Hens were ripping through unbeaten CAA seasons en route to back-to-back NCAA Tournament berths sparked by Elena Delle Donne, an All-American and future WNBA MVP and Olympic gold medalist.\n\nFriday’s loss dropped the Blue Hens to 5-8 overall. They’ll have a much better shot at their first CAA victory Sunday at 2 p.m. when Towson visits, then face another ferocious test the following Sunday at home against rival Drexel. But Towson, which hasn’t beaten Delaware in Newark in 11 years, did win at Drexel on Friday in another season opener.\n\nDelaware has had just one losing record in women’s basketball in the past 10, a 15-17 finish in 2014-15. Six times in that span Delaware has won at least 19 games, including last year, its first under Adair.\n\nCertainly, the loss of 2018 CAA Player of the Year Nicole Enabosi to a summer knee injury has hurt the Blue Hens, as did prized freshmen recruit Lolo Davenport suffering the same fate in preseason practice.\n\nNobody had double digits in rebounds or points, another glaring aspect of Friday’s setback. Delaware was 1-for-11 on 3-pointers and was outrebounded 59-44.\n\n“I’m disappointed in our effort, but it’s not an indication of who we ultimately will become,” Adair said. “But there is a sense of urgency for us to come out on Sunday and play harder.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

They’ve seen colorful blueprints and handsome drawings.\n\nSo Chrissi Rawak, Delaware’s athletic director, was pressed at a media gathering after the football game against Albany last Saturday, quizzed while speaking to the Blue Hen Touchdown Club Thursday and no doubt questioned wherever else she has journeyed in the past week.\n\nIs it really, truly going to happen?\n\nWill Delaware Stadium actually get the renovations that most agree it has needed since Tubby Raymond, the Blue Hens’ College Football Hall-of-Fame football coach from 1966-2001 who turned 92 last week, was a spring chicken?\n\n“Absolutely,” Rawak said, wearing a confident grin. “No doubt in my mind, none. We’re 80 percent to goal. You can feel it. People say that to me.”\n\nThe proof, as Rawak alluded to, is in the payments.\n\nSome $48 million of the $60 million project has already been raised.\n\nThat includes a hefty $25 million from the university, which Rawak termed “significant,” and $23 million already secured from private donors. In addition, UD will match donations of $50,000 or more.\n\n“The renderings we’ve seen look fantastic and we’ve needed it for years,” said touchdown club member Jim Skean.\n\nLong considered one of the revered locations away from college football’s top competitive level, Delaware Stadium will finally receive the architectural rejuvenation many feel it has long been entitled.\n\n“Other than the fact that the stadium is old, it’s the best stadium I’ve ever been in besides Franklin Field to watch a football game,” Newark resident Tom Runnels said, referencing the University of Pennsylvania’s Philadelphia fortress. “It’s steep, it’s crowded, so every seat in this stadium is right on the field. This stadium could have been an 80,000-seat stadium if they capped off each end.”\n\nSome actually once envisioned that for Delaware Stadium during the Blue Hens’ 1970 glory days when they won three of their six national titles.\n\nRunnels is hoping that steep grade and the stands’ proximity to the field – the sidelines are very narrow – are not sacrificed for the sake of modern engineering. Rawak doesn’t know such details yet, she said.\n\nSometimes it’s less about sightlines than modern conveniences, such as concessions and restroom facilities, which at Delaware Stadium have become rather antiquated.\n\n“The stadium renovation is long overdue,” said Remo Mazzetti Sr., another stadium regular. “The bathroom situation especially has been disgraceful for a number of years.”\n\nOne who did express some reservations was former TD club president Connie Cecil, who wondered \"Does this improve the fans' experience?\"\n\n\"I am not sure,\" she said. \"I do think it will improve recruiting which should bring in more fans. My concern is the cost to the fans. No word about increasing prices, and I am sure that will happen.\"\n\nWhat is now a 22,000-seat stadium will actually get a fraction smaller, which hardly matters considering Delaware hasn’t averaged more than 19,000 fans since 2011 and 2017 average attendance was 16,648, the highest in four years.\n\nSome do harbor hope of Delaware moving up from the NCAA’s Division I Football Championship Subdivision to its Football Bowl Subdivision, which would require an invitation from a conference, extra expenditures, including 22 additional scholarships, and more seats.\n\nRawak has pledged to keep an open mind but emphasizes that “what we need to do is be competing where we are and working toward winning national championships at the FCS level.”\n\nA win at Villanova Saturday could put Delaware (7-3) back in the FCS Tournament.\n\n“Three reasons to not go FBS,” said Runnels. “Connecticut, Rutgers, Temple.”\n\nHe was referring to three schools that were once UD rivals but now dwell in FBS and, except for Temple’s ascension two years ago, have had rare moments of distinction.\n\nDelaware, despite its ongoing record streak of six seasons not making the NCAA playoffs, has long relished its big-fish-in-a-small-pond football status.\n\nNow, the home pond is about to get a belated cleanup.\n\nAll about the money\n\nDelaware Stadium opened in November 1952 at a cost of $240,000 and seated 7,000. Runnels was a young boy who attended the first game, remembering only, “we won.”\n\nThe stadium was supposed to be bigger.\n\nBut fund-raisers had a hard time finding the money, according to Elbert Chance’s book “100 Plus: The Story of Delaware Football.”\n\nThat seemed to portend things to come at Delaware Stadium, which always drew the largest crowds in the Colonial Athletic Association and its conference predecessors until James Madison's recent enlargement of Bridgeforth Stadium, but is the last to receive modern press, coaching and luxury-seating amenities.\n\nThe largest chunk of what Delaware has already raised this time is $10 million from 1980 graduate and former UD golf team member Ken Whitney and his wife Liz. It will go toward construction of the stadium renovation’s corresponding undertaking – a 90,000-square foot athletic performance center – that’ll stretch along the west side of Delaware Stadium.\n\nThe stadium refurbishment includes new seating in the middle three sections of the home (west) stands. Rising above that will be a modern media and game-day coaching box level and, beneath that, a large enclosed area with club seats, two suites and large gathering areas affording views of the football field.\n\nNo construction will begin until all the money is raised. Delaware hopes to have the grandstand makeover and new luxury seating and pressbox structure completed before the 2019 season. The Whitney Center down below would then be finished in 2020.\n\n“There’s so much energy and enthusiasm right now for our university, for our athletics department and for our football program,” first-year football coach Danny Rocco said. “So I am extremely fortunate and blessed to be in the middle of this timeline here as we really do advance and worked toward our goals.”\n\nIn the past 10 years, a pair of similar proposals – one to build a performance-center facility in the north end zone and another on the west side – never reached the serious fund-raising stage.\n\n“There is no room for failure for this project,” Rawak said. “It’s too important to this university, our student-athletes and I would say the community.”\n\nThis one is part of UD’s ambitious Delaware First, which aims to bring in $750 million. Other priorities include the Biden Institute for public policy and civic engagement, expanding graduate education and programs encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\n“It seems to me that everything President [Dennis] Assanis does, he does well,” said long-time UD football fan Rick Just. “He certainly has excellent credentials. The president is intent on elevating the profile of the university. There’s no reason to believe that he won’t do that with these structures or any other building on campus. I’m convinced that he and athletic director Rawak have thoroughly evaluated the situation and that the final construction is something we will all be proud of. I’m anxious to see the results.”\n\nDelaware Stadium was expanded to 13,500 seats in 1964, 20,100 in 1970 and 22,700 soon after, though the record crowd of 23,619 for the 1973 Temple game resulted from temporary stands on the field and standing-room tickets. Subsequent alterations reduced capacity closer to its present-day estimated 22,000, an attendance number Delaware hasn’t surpassed since 2008.\n\nRawak said last Saturday that the west stands would be razed and rebuilt, but amended that this week to say that’s something architects must decide and isn’t certain.\n\nSimilarly, no decisions have been made on what appearance the new facilities may have. The athletic performance center will like have plenty of glass, reflecting the STAR Campus across South College Avenue, and, this being the University of Delaware with its Georgian-style buildings, expect to see some brick.\n\n\"The big difference this time around is the university has skin in the game,\" said long-time rooter Mike Carney, referring to board of trustees support and the $25 million.\n\nUD leaders, he added, \"all believe that a first-class, winning athletic program heightens the profile of the entire university. Maybe someday we will have ESPN Gameday on campus and coach [Lee] Corso will put on the Fightin' Blue Hen head gear.\"\n\nCarney was referring to Corso traditionally ending that Saturday on-location show by donning the mascot headgear of the team he's picking to win.\n\nThis is just phase one, Rawak said.\n\nFuture plans are to improve the east grandstand and north and south end-zone seating areas in Delaware Stadium and to modernize the Delaware Field House. It opened in 1966 and houses half of Delaware’s coaches in small, windowless offices. It’s possible the entire football operation may eventually move from the Carpenter Center, where it is now, back to the Field House someday.\n\nThose will require ambitious fund-raising efforts, too. But the stadium/performance center project indicates Delaware is off to a good start.\n\n“It’s about time,” said touchdown club member Barb Owens, a 1958 UD grad. “We’ve been promised this for years.”\n\nThis time, the promise is going to be kept.\n\nIn doing so, Rawak had to foster a culture of giving, along with Jordan Skolnick, Delaware’s senior associate athletic director/development who came with her from the University of Michigan in 2016.\n\nDelaware athletics had long relied on the generosity of the Carpenter family of Montchanin, and individuals such as Frank Acierno and Fred Rullo, whose contributions aided in the construction of the Bob Carpenter Center, which opened in 1993, and Rullo Stadium, which opened in 1998.\n\nThat’s not enough, however, in the 21st century, when college athletics is an expensive undertaking. Delaware’s most recent annual athletic costs were $30.8 million.\n\n“There isn’t a history of philanthropy here,” Rawak said, “not in the same way as a private school or at Michigan. We were in our sixth fund-raising campaign for the university [at Michigan], so people understood how philanthropy fit into the university and what it meant to the university. It truly is that game changer for institutions and what it offers.\n\n“So here it’s really been about educating, to be honest, and helping people understand the need, the cause, what it’s going to do for the university, what it’s going to do for athletics and, as soon as they’re hearing that and they’re understanding that, they’re jumping on board.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

Only Div. I and II schools give athletic scholarships.\n\nAt one time, colleges recruited athletes by scouting high school games. The thinking was that the top talent was going to be noticed: \"If you are good enough, they will find you.\"\n\nBut over the past 15 to 20 years, the college athletic recruiting model has moved away from high school games – where a select few athletes might possess college-level talent – toward the multibillion-dollar industry known as travel sports, in which the majority of participants are seeking college scholarships.\n\nParents invest hundreds to thousands of dollars a season in travel programs so their children can play in \"showcase\" tournaments that draw college coaches to scout hundreds of prospective players in one place. From softball and baseball to lacrosse, field hockey, soccer and volleyball, travel programs crowd the landscape of youth sports.\n\nThe competition for scholarships is fierce. While NCAA Division I and II schools provide more than $2.9 billion in athletic scholarships a year to more than 150,000 students, that equates to only 2 percent of high school athletes, according to the NCAA.\n\nDespite those odds, or maybe because of them, youth sports has grown into a $7 billion industry, according to Forbes magazine. Experts believe that number will reach $9 billion by 2019.\n\nThe path for those coveted athletic scholarships is long for athletes and parents. Steele, a rising junior at Smyrna High School, began her quest about the time she entered elementary school.\n\nNBA:Sixers draft Fultz with No. 1 pick\n\nBASEBALL: St. Mark's grad chooses UD over Phillies\n\nAt age 6, she started playing Smyrna-Clayton Little Lass softball. She joined the Delaware Force 12U travel team at age 11, then played for the Delaware Hurricanes before joining the Empire State Huskies last year.\n\n“I’ve known for a very long time that this is the direction I wanted to go,” Steele said.\n\nShe is being raised by a single mom, Stephanie Shaw, and has a younger sister and brother who both play travel sports. Shaw said she spends between $5,000 and $7,000 a year on Madison's teams.\n\nIt’s a price she is willing to pay if it means a full ride for Madison. The average annual cost of an in-state public college is $24,610. The average cost of a private college is $49,320 a year.\n\n“I definitely don’t want my mom paying for my college,” Steele said. “It will take a lot of work and sacrifice, but in the end, it will be worth it.”\n\nA different recruiting model\n\n“The mission of the Empire State Huskies is to get as many girls into college-level programs,” said coach Joe Porcelli. “We travel the country to different showcase tournaments trying to get the girls exposure to different colleges and universities.”\n\nFor the Huskies, which are based near Poughkeepsie, New York, that means playing a minimum of 10 tournaments in the fall and 15 in the summer in Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Missouri and Florida.\n\nThat alone is not enough to land scholarships.\n\nPorcelli said it is incumbent on the players to proactively communicate with college coaches.\n\n“If there are 20 different schools going [to a showcase tournament], our players will email the coaches, and if there are particular schools they are interested in, we’ll reach out to those coaches on their behalf,” he said.\n\n“[Coaches] don’t usually come to you without you first reaching out to them,” Steele said.\n\nWhile students cannot sign letters of intent – which officially locks them into a college – until their senior year, many make verbal commitments as early as their freshman years, although the vast majority of these \"verbals\" occur around junior year.\n\nSmyrna High softball coach Nicki Shirley played at Saint Joseph’s University on a full scholarship. Her experience has helped Steele and Eagles teammate Kaelyn Press. The two also play together on the Empire State Huskies.\n\n“When you have athletes that are proactive like [Steele], local coaches will show up,” said Shirley, who has coached Smyrna for 11 years. “I get a few calls from coaches, but I tell [the players] they need to be the ones communicating.”\n\nThough more college coaches prefer to attend showcases, Shirley believes they would get a better feel for players if they saw them in school games.\n\n“The level of play rises,” said Shirley, whose Eagles went 15-4 and lost in the first round of the state tournament this season. “If you want to see how a player will be in a team setting, watching high school games gives you that best shot.”\n\nSteele has a verbal offer to play at Misericordia University, a Division III school in Pennsylvania, and has heard from some Division II programs. She's hoping this summer will bring more interest.\n\n“I’m open at this point,” the rising junior said. “I just want to go to school and play. ... I would like for it to be a school in the South because that has been my dream since I was a kid. I know I’ll have to keep working hard to get there.\"\n\nCampbell Garrison has a different goal in mind.\n\nGarrison plays lacrosse at Appoquinimink High School and for the Team 302 travel program.\n\nThe rising senior realized early on that while he loved playing the sport, his skills weren’t going to land him a Division I scholarship.\n\n“I play lacrosse because I love playing,” Campbell said. “I’m interested in playing in college, but I’m looking to get an academic scholarship to a smaller Division III school. I’m looking at that size of school because it fits my talent level and I love a lot of the schools I’ve visited.”\n\nWorth the investment?\n\nA study conducted by TD Ameritrade in 2016 looked at the commitment of parents to their children’s athletic dreams and the financial costs and potential long-term financial implications.\n\nThe findings from the study showed that 63 percent of the more than 1,000 parents surveyed typically spend between $100 and $499 a month per child on elite youth sports, with the bulk of the money going toward travel and team fees. One in five parents said they spend at least $1,000 a month.\n\nTwo-thirds of parents surveyed hope scholarships will cover more than half of college costs, and 40 percent are at least pretty sure their kids will snag one.\n\nWhile 74 percent of parents said they made significant sacrifices to pay for travel sports, only a quarter of the players actually earned scholarships.\n\nParents do everything from taking fewer vacations to dipping into retirement savings to delaying retirement and even taking second jobs. Some 10 percent of those surveyed even cut back on money set aside for college funds.\n\nAlison Benjamin and her husband spent “tens of thousands” of dollars on teams, travel and equipment for their son Cole, who played for the Akadema Warriors travel baseball organization.\n\nCole, a pitcher, is now on scholarship at the University of Delaware.\n\n“We joke that we could have gotten a good start on college with the amount we paid for travel,” she said. “[But ] it’s absolutely worth it. My husband and I agree it is one of the best investments we’ve made in his future. Cole is reaping the benefits.”\n\nDepending on the sport, scholarship does not necessarily mean full ride. In baseball, for instance, a fully funded program only has 11.7 scholarships at any one time. Most baseball programs carry 30 to 35 players, meaning there are very few – if any – on a full scholarship.\n\nThat can add risk to the investment in travel sports, especially for a family with lesser means.\n\nThat’s something elite players face every day, said Paul Niggebrugge, owner and founder of Be Your Best Academy in Middletown and a coach for the Akadema Warriors.\n\n“We’re very sensitive to this,” he said. “We try to make it work in every way.”\n\nAkadema and other travel programs offer payment options or allow parents to volunteer to offset costs. Parents can also fundraise.\n\n“We’ll never say ‘you can’t afford it,’ ” Niggebrugge said. “We’ll try to figure out creative ways to make that happen. We’re baseball purists and money should never be a reason why you shouldn’t participate or have an opportunity to excel.”\n\nCoaching perspective\n\nUniversity of Delaware softball coach John Seneca says finding the right student-athlete can be a crapshoot.\n\nWith only 50 evaluation days allowed by the NCAA, Seneca said showcase tournaments are critical.\n\n“The big push for us is showcases,” said Seneca, who just completed his second season as Blue Hens head coach. “I can watch 30 games a weekend and see 50 kids I think will fit our program and I use maybe two of the evaluation days we’re given. We try to get out to as many of these tournaments as we can.”\n\nSeneca said that while he and his assistants try to hit the big showcases, they also will go to lesser-known tournaments because they received an email from a player or a player's coach that piques their interest.\n\nHe said he receives thousands of emails a year from prospective players highlighting their skills, interests, grades and a link to a highlights video.\n\n“That’s huge,” he said. “It’s nice to click on a link and see someone who could potentially be a player here. We may invite them to one of our camps or set out to watch them play.”\n\nSeneca said he wishes he could scout more high school games.\n\n“I love watching high school ball,” he said. “You get a chance to see them lead and see them playing for something. You can see things you don’t see in a couple of innings at showcases.”\n\nBut Seneca can't see many high school games because the college and high school seasons run concurrently. Plus, he said, high school games only allow college coaches to see a couple prospects at a time.\n\nUD head baseball coach Jim Sherman said he could easily find 10 games a day if he wanted to during the summer showcase season. That, he said, has been the biggest change since he started coaching in college 31 years ago.\n\n“There are many more teams today,” said Sherman, who led the Blue Hens to the NCAA Tournament this season. “It used to be American Legion and local teams we would watch. Probably about 15 years ago, travel ball started taking off and 10 years ago it exploded.”\n\nSherman said because of that, he doesn’t see as many quality teams. But he is able to see more individuals at showcase tournaments. He said he relies on communication with academies and high school coaches to tell him about standout players.\n\n“You have to have networks more now than ever before because the dynamic has changed,” he said. “You have to find those individuals who know the levels of play and who can critique talent and character.”\n\nPerson vs. performance\n\nWhen asked what it takes for a high school athlete to get noticed and earn a college scholarship, Niggebrugge said talent is right up there.\n\nBut the head coach of the 2017 state champion Caravel Academy baseball team thinks being the right person and being the right fit for a certain program can outweigh talent.\n\n“I think it is about the person first, then the performer. They must be aligned,” said Niggebrugge, who has five state championships in his tenure at Caravel. “I’ve seen too many kids who are skilled and talented but never reach their potential because there are too many distractions and interferences.”\n\nNiggebrugge recognizes that players sign up for elite travel baseball teams with a scholarship in mind. He said kids and parents become enamored with Division I baseball.\n\n“They are looking for scholarships and oftentimes they are misled,” Niggebrugge said. “Families get caught up in getting that athletic scholarship all the time and they get demoralized and they are in despair when they don’t get the offer.”\n\nNiggebrugge said it has gotten so bad that colleges, like the airlines, will overbook or over-recruit.\n\n“You think you are going to this school on a scholarship, and all of a sudden, they’ve got somebody else, or they’ve brought in 19 or 20 pitchers and you thought you had a chance to be a starter and all of the sudden, you aren’t even on the staff,” he said.\n\nRecruiting college soccer players is a different animal, says UD men’s coach Ian Hennessey. While players continually reach out to coaches and send videos, the structure within the sport has changed how recruiting is done.\n\nHennessey, a former Major League Soccer player and All-American at Seton Hall, is entering his ninth season at UD.\n\n“More and more, kids don’t play in school,” he said. “We often find players in development academies. There are often 150 clubs in an academy. They are the crown jewel. That’s where you will see most coaches attend.”\n\nBut that has its downside, too. Hennessey said the trend he is seeing in professional development is a lot of the kids going pro and not going to college. He said that makes it tough on college programs.\n\nBut when he does attend showcase tournaments, Hennessey has a good idea of who he is looking for.\n\n“The kid should be able to jump off the page at you to play Division I,” he said. “Besides excelling in academics, he also needs to have a high soccer IQ.”\n\nPaying dividends\n\nThe boom in travel sports has started to see results at the professional level.\n\nSeveral current Phillies spent their summers playing on travel teams.\n\n“I played year-round from 10 years old and on,” said first baseman Tommy Joseph. “I played for all sorts of different teams. Any time I could get on the field I did.\n\n“I was doing it because I wanted to do it. Nobody was forcing me to do any of that stuff. I was the one who wanted to. I led the charge.”\n\nWhen asked if travel ball helped him get drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the second round in 2009, Joseph was blunt.\n\n“I don't think there's really any other way,” he said.\n\nNate Esposito isn't in the big leagues yet. But he believes travel ball helped him land the college scholarship that led to him being drafted by the Kansas City Royals in 2015. Today, Esposito is a catcher for the Wilmington Blue Rocks, the Royals Class-A minor-league affiliate.\n\n“The great thing about the [travel] showcases is you are able to show your skills and talents to teams that have never seen you before,” Esposito said. “The main thing is you have to play as much as you can. When you play three games a day, you give yourself a lot of chances to be seen by somebody.”\n\nEsposito, a 23-year-old Granite Bay, California, native, had verbally committed to play at Cal-Poly before he was invited to play in the Area Code games, one of the top baseball showcases in the country. He withdrew his commitment, hoping that exposure would land him an offer at a bigger school.\n\n“Eventually, Oregon State offered me a scholarship, so I decided to go there,” said Esposito, who was given a scholarship that covered 70 percent of his school costs. Esposito ended up transferring to then-NAIA power Concordia University his senior year and was an All-NAIA West pick.\n\nPhillies catcher Andrew Knapp was two years ahead of Esposito at Granite Bay High School.\n\nKnapp didn’t play travel baseball until he was 14. He worries that it can burn kids out.\n\n“I was a Little League kid and I really enjoyed Little League,” Knapp said. “I think now kids are so worried about playing travel ball, they don't enjoy it. Until you're in high school, it's supposed to be like you go out and play.\"\n\nWhile Esposito said playing year-round baseball helped him, he knows it isn’t for everybody.\n\n“I know guys who played just as much as me or more and actually got burned out,” he said. “You really, really, really have to love the game in order to play that long. Playing for a full year is tough and will grind on you a little bit, but if you love the game, it’s really helpful.”\n\nMeghan Montemurro contributed to this article.\n\nContact Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

He wouldn’t say who. He just wanted all to have a meaningful, motivational message ready.\n\nDuring that gathering, three regulars widely respected by teammates were summoned – starting cornerback Justin Watson, running back Thomas Jefferson, who’d been 2015 CAA co-Offensive Rookie of the Year, and tight end/h-back Kyle Yocum.\n\n“I was inspired. They all had great messages,” said Patrick Crowley, then a red-shirt sophomore who’d made the team as a walk-on out of Concord High.\n\nWhen it came time for the fourth and final speaker, Brock said it was someone players may not expect. Then he called Crowley.\n\n“I asked Frank Raggo, ‘Did he say my name?,’ ” said Crowley, who was sitting alongside the Delaware kicker. “He said ‘Yeah, go up!’ I was like ‘Oh wow.’ I was nervous.’ ”\n\nTo the front of the room stepped Delaware’s smallest player, a 5-foot-6, 180-pound special teamer and third-level cornerback who had appeared in just one career game up to then.\n\nHe promptly explained to his teammates how much it meant to him to play football for Delaware. It was a lifelong dream, come true.\n\n“His message was awesome,” teammate Troy Reeder would say later.\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS: No easing up on end-zone celebrations\n\nBLUE HENS: Could Spruill be CAA's next freshman back to excel?\n\nCrowley is the grandson of Archie Rapposelli, an honored Delaware high school football coach who’d played for the Blue Hens. Crowley had been attending games and practices since his childhood, often wearing a full uniform, while making friends with players, such as quarterback Joe Flacco.\n\nAt one of those games, against James Madison when Crowley was 11 in 2006, he had walked down from his seat in the West stands at Delaware Stadium, plopped himself in a box-seat chair just above the field and introduced himself to the person next to him.\n\n“Remember my name. I’m going to be on this team one day,” Crowley informed that individual, who happened to be then-UD president David Roselle. Crowley’s aunt, Maryann Rapposelli, a UD employee, watched in stunned amazement.\n\nJerry Oravitz, Delaware’s former football operations director and now an associate athletic director in development, remembers Crowley standing outside Delaware Stadium following games wearing a full uniform, even sporting eye black, as he greeted his heroes.\n\n“Someday, somehow, Pat Crowley was going to be a Blue Hen,” Oravitz, who got to know the ubiquitous child, remembered thinking.\n\nAmong Crowley’s prized possessions are two photos of him and Flacco from 2006 and a framed hand-written letter Flacco sent him during his rookie season with the Baltimore Ravens, where he is now entering his 10th season as the starting quarterback.\n\nAs he spoke to his teammates last October, Crowley was addressing mostly players from out of state who’d been recruited by numerous schools and were on scholarship.He mentioned the young boys who await the players, asking for a chinstrap or wristband or just a high-five, as they head toward the locker room after games.\n\n“I told them I was that kid,” Crowley said. “You have to think about the people that you’re playing for. You might just think, ‘Oh, it’s Delaware football, it’s no big deal,’ but to some people, it’s a huge deal.”\n\nCrowley's love for the Blue Hens was honed as a childhood spectator, rooting for his idols, and has grown stronger now that he’s a player himself.\n\n“The way I feel about it is, I’m more tied to this team than anybody who signed the contract [for a scholarship] freshman year,” he said, reflecting on his comments to teammates. “I have to be here. There are ties between me and this Delaware football program that I have to be a part of it. It means more to me than a scholarship. I could play on this team forever. My worst nightmare is waking up and realizing I’m not going to be a Blue Hen one day, I’m not going to be on this team anymore because I absolutely love being on this team.\n\n“Up to this point in my life, it’s my proudest accomplishment.”\n\nCrowley’s father, Jim, said Patrick’s bedroom in their suburban Wilmington home is “a shrine to Delaware football and Joe Flacco.” That framed letter hangs above his bed, though Sonny Riccio, Flacco’s predecessor at quarterback in 2004-05, was his first favorite.\n\n“If there’s ever a Rudy II, this is it,” Jim Crowley said, referring to Daniel “Rudy” Ruettinger, the Notre Dame walk-on who played in his last game in 1975 and is the subject of the popular 1993 film “Rudy.”\n\nDevotion rooted in family\n\nThe Blue Hens begin the 2017 season Thursday night against Delaware State at Delaware Stadium in Newark.\n\nThe opener is being greeted with a new sense of excitement. Brock was fired the day after Delaware lost that game at William & Mary. In December, Delaware lured coach Danny Rocco away from CAA rival Richmond. He has a 90-42 record in 11 seasons as a head coach – the first six at Liberty – and has never had a losing year.\n\nDelaware is coming off its first back-to-back losing seasons – both 4-7 – since the late 1930s and hasn’t reached the NCAA playoffs in six years, double its second-longest absence (1983-85).\n\nThe Blue Hen Nation aches for a winner and Crowley, now in his red-shirt junior season, feels the pain.\n\nBut season-ticket sales have nearly doubled from last year, due in part to an unpopular UD Athletic Fund required donation being removed, and enthusiasm is strong.\n\n“I think he’s more hurt than anybody by the past couple years because he’s been around it for so long,” Brody Kern, Delaware’s fifth-year senior center and co-captain, said of Crowley. “He’s been coming to games since he was a little kid and all he ever wanted to do was play Delaware football.\n\n“He’s an amazing person, a great guy to talk to. He can talk to anybody, too. Because the history of Delaware is the way it is, having Pat is a reassurance of what we could be and what we should be.”\n\nCrowley’s love for Delaware football was instilled by his grandfather, Rapposelli, who donned his leather helmet to play guard on coach Bill Murray’s 1948-50 Blue Hen teams after a year on the freshman squad.\n\nIronically, rosters listed him as 5-foot-6, 181 pounds, one pound from the identical size as the grandson who would play for the Blue Hens almost 70 years later. Rapposelli played on the offensive line, now manned by behemoths typically weighing around 300 pounds and standing more than six feet tall.\n\nRapposelli died June 3, 2005, at age 76. Patrick was 10 and has fond memories.\n\n“I had a lot of Delaware football conversations with him, before I even started going to games,” Crowley said. “I always heard about Delaware football. They played in Wilmington [at 30th Street and Gov. Printz Boulevard]. He always told me about that stadium.”\n\nRapposelli was state high school football coach of the year in 1968 when he guided Claymont to a 9-0 record and the Blue Hen Conference Flight B title. There were no state tournaments then. A Claymont grad, Rapposelli had become the Indians coach in 1966 after nine years as an assistant at Salesianum. He coached Claymont through 1972.\n\n“My dad loved all of his grandchildren and he would always tell them to be the best you can be and give them words of encouragement,” said Patrick’s mother Margaret. “I think he’d be busting at the seams really to see Patrick out there on the field being 5-foot-not-much, sticking with it, working hard, because he made it all on his own.”\n\nMargaret Crowley spent some time on the field at Delaware Stadium herself. In 1984, as a UD sophomore, she wore the Blue Hen mascot suit – pre-YoUDee – during football games. Patrick’s two older sisters Michelle and Brenda also attended UD. His identical twin brother, Michael, is a senior who has played the lead role in several UD theatre productions.\n\nAt Concord, Pat Crowley was a two-year starter at cornerback, saw spot duty at quarterback and also kicked, sometimes scoring when he ran on direct snaps. He was captain his senior season in 2013, which was long-time Raiders coach George Kosanovich’s last before retiring.\n\n“Pat worked so hard all the time and earned his way to get to where he was,” Kosanovich said of Crowley, whom he called the type of dedicated player who “really makes a program go.”\n\nKosanovich was coaching at Wilmington High when Crowley’s grandfather was at Claymont, knew him well and coached with him in several Blue-Gold all-star games, a fact Crowley appreciated.\n\n“I loved Archie,” Kosanovich said. “You didn’t have to think twice about what Archie was thinking or what he was going to say. Everything he did was right on his collar and you knew what was coming.”\n\nWhile in high school, Crowley took part in theDamion Daniels Elite Training program, where he got to know players who actually were elite, such as Newark’s Taylor Reynolds, who starred as a James Madison cornerback and had an Atlanta Falcons free-agent opportunity; St. Elizabeth’s Andre Patton, the Rutgers wide receiver now in the Los Angeles Chargers’ camp; and Middletown’s Chris Godwin, the wide receiver drafted in the third round by the Tampa Buccaneers in April out of Penn State.\n\n“There’s a lot of guys who got me better training with them,” Crowley said. “It was all to get to Delaware. That was my end goal. My size wouldn’t get me here, my speed, nothing like that. So I thought my work ethic would have to set me apart to be seen by the coaches.”\n\nWhen former Delaware assistant coach Brian Ginn came to recruit Concord teammate Grant Roberts, Crowley took the opportunity to make some contacts himself. It led to a 2013 recruiting visit during Delaware’s win over James Madison and a 2014 summer tryout that earned him a walk-on spot.\n\nCrowley’s uncle Joe Rapposelli played for the Blue Hens in the early 1990s. Last year, after Crowley saw his first game action against Delaware State, Joe had a present for him.\n\nIt was Archie Rapposelli’s 1950 Delaware letter sweater, made of thick blue wool with a yellow ‘D’ sewn on. Archie Rapposelli had proudly stitched a purple and gold Claymont ‘C” on the other side.\n\n“That’s when I realized how proud my grandfather would be that I was playing for Delaware,” Crowley said.\n\nLifelong dream fulfilled\n\nThe Blue Hens were well on their way to a 56-14 opening-night win over Delaware State last season at Delaware Stadium when Crowley was sent onto the field for the first time in a game to play cornerback.\n\n“It brought tears to my eyes,” father Jim said.\n\nThat was an epidemic inside Delaware Stadium, where a woman sitting near Mike Buono asked the Brandywine Warriors youth coach why his eyes had turned misty. He told her it was from seeing one of his all-time favorite players step on the field to play for the Blue Hens.\n\n“I get chills talking about that,” Crowley said of his first game action as a Blue Hen. “I saw my family in the stands. That was the first thing I did. I was looking up at the pressbox and I was like ‘Wow. This is like the most special moment of my life.’\n\n“Then I started locking in. The coaches were yelling at me. I think the call was something like ‘Buzz!” and I was like ‘I have to play football’ and when the play is over I can think about it again. That was amazing.”\n\nCrowley made Delaware’s travel roster, which consists of roughly 70 players, and midway through the season he became a starter in the punt block unit, which Delaware calls “pride and joy.”\n\nIt certainly fit that description for Crowley, who appeared in five games last season.\n\n“That’s when I really felt like I belonged and was contributing to the team,” said Crowley, who has also been a holder for kicks this year. “That was really eye opening.”\n\nThose contributions continue and they are not taken lightly, said Rocco.\n\n“There are a lot of ways to add value to your program and it’s not always the guys who are the star players who are adding value,” said Rocco, who spent his childhood glued to the high school teams his father, Frank, was coaching throughout Pennsylvania.\n\n“Pat certainly adds a lot of value in a lot of different ways. He comes in every day to practice with a great attitude. He comes to work. His enthusiasm rubs off on the teammates. It’ll bring me great joy to be able to get him out there in a game and give him an opportunity to do some things to help us get some wins.”\n\nChris Cosh, Delaware’s defensive coordinator and secondary coach, credits Crowley, a sport management major who aspires to coach college football, for a willingness to help other players be better.\n\n“He’s making calls from the sidelines, predicting routes,” Cosh said. “He’ll come tell me, ‘Coach, so-and-so did this.’ He’s into it and when he gets out there he has the same expectations as everyone else. He takes a lot of pride in his work. He brightens up my day by being out there.”\n\nTurns out Crowley has a history of helping Delaware defensive backs, going back to when he was 12.\n\nIn 2007, the week before it played Navy, Delaware had an open date. Some UD players happened to be at 69th Street Field in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, that Saturday watching youth games. Crowley, playing there for the Brandywine Warriors, spotted cornerback Anthony Walters.\n\n“He said, ‘Be ready next week when you play Navy because of that receiver, number such and such, you’re gonna be covering. Watch him,’ ” Jim Crowley recalled. “Anthony was like, ‘We haven’t even looked at any film yet.’ ”\n\nThe following week, Jim brought Patrick to a UD practice.\n\n“Anthony walked over,” Jim Crowley said, “and said, ‘You’re not gonna believe this. We’ve been watching game film. He was spot on. He knew exactly what they were running and that’s the guy I’m covering. He knew that. I don’t know how in the world . . . ’ ”\n\nDespite young Crowley’s scouting report, the UD defense had a tough time in Annapolis with Navy’s triple-option attack. But Flacco threw for a career-high 434 yards and four touchdowns and Omar Cuff rushed for 141 yards and four TDs of his own in a 59-52 win.\n\nA year later, as a Ravens rookie, Flacco answered a letter from Crowley, then 13, with an advice-filled, full-page response in which he urged the then-quarterback hopeful to “always be working to be the best self you can be!!”\n\nHe closed the letter by writing, “It would be great to see you at QB for the Hens someday, but don’t be afraid to picture yourself playing QB at USC or Notre Dame either.”\n\nSitting there listening to Crowley that night in Williamsburg, and understanding his lecture as well as anyone, was Troy Reeder.\n\nReeder was a standout at Salesianum and then started for Penn State as a red-shirt freshman linebacker on 2015. He transferred back to Delaware, where father Danny starred, so he could play with younger brother Colby.\n\nAt Penn State, Reeder had been around kids who’d been lifelong Nittany Lions fans and “are dying to just be on the team, no matter what their role is,” he said.“It might their fifth year, their last game of the season, they get to run down on a kickoff.”\n\nDelaware football, Reeder knows, has similar allure.\n\n“Pat’s a real good example of what can happen when you do have a positive attitude for everything,” Reeder said. “All of a sudden you go from a guy who walks onto the team and people from the outside think you don’t have much of a shot and he’s on punt return holding guys up or holding kicks or whatever.\n\n“That’s a tribute to him and I think he inspires a lot of guys on our team.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini atktresolini@delawareonline.com.

But the famed Philadelphia science museum, site of school trips for generations of kids from Bucks County to Delaware, is undergoing a complete overhaul for its upcoming 200-year anniversary next year.\n\nAnd starting Nov. 4, the museum will be home to a new and permanent space exploration exhibit called \"Wondrous Space.\"\n\nThe exhibit, billed as an \"an immersive, awe-inspiring journey through the marvels of space exploration,\" will be the first of six new permanent exhibits at the Franklin Institute in advance of its 2024 bicentennial.\n\nThe $8.5 million permanent exhibit will be augmented with some premium space artifacts as it opens Nov. 4, including two rovers on loan from Carnegie Mellon University, and a 10-foot-long rocket engine from Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nWhat's in store for visitors to the Franklin Museum this fall, and next year? Here's what we know.\n\nMore:'Abbott Elementary' comes to Philadelphia for the first time, visiting Franklin Institute\n\nMore:Not just Rocky steps: 10 Philadelphia movie and TV locations even locals might not know\n\nWhat will be included at the Franklin Museum's new 'Wondrous Space' exhibit in 2023?\n\nSpace stuff, of course. But also, the exhibit will double a sort of theme park for outer space exploration.\n\nThe two-story, 7,500-square-foot exhibit will include immersive \"experiences\" designed by a team led by Dan Picard of design firm MDSX, known for its work at Disney World, Sea World and the Kennedy Space Center. The science expertise came courtesy of Franklin's chief astronomer, Derrick Pitts.\n\nThe museum promises visitors will be \"transported\" to space through simulations that allow them to virtually travel across vast distances and \"control the forces of nature.\" Other exhibits focus on future of space technology and exploration.\n\nIn addition to the rovers and rocket engines on loan, the museum also will have additional artifacts on loan from places like Kennedy Space Center, \"space bread\" inventor Hope Hersh, and Boeing, which sponsored the exhibit to the tune of $3 million.\n\nWith the help of design company AMETEK Inc., which designed the thermal controls for the mars rover, the exhibit also will offer an interactive station that lets guests design and test exploratory rovers.\n\nWhat else is planned for the Franklin Institute renovation in 2024?\n\nIn a September release, museum staff said a total of six new exhibits would be installed. And 12 would go away.\n\nThe new exhibits will cover \"space, the human body, earth systems, the built environment, advanced machines and robotics, and computer science.\" According to press materials, the new exhibits would likewise be \"future-focused\" and large in scale, and will \"push the boundaries of traditional science center exhibits.\"\n\nSo things are going to be a little bit different at the popular centuries-old institution.\n\nWill they be removing the big papier-mache Giant Heart?\n\nNo worries, the heart will stay. The museum is taking pains to keep its most iconic exhibits, and this will include both the charmingly retro ― and oddly compelling ― papier-mache Giant Heart, and the Baldwin locomotive that's been housed in the museum since 1933.\n\nHowever, the museum has not yet released a full accounting of what will stay and what will go.\n\nAre there other space-related things happening at the Franklin Museum in 2023?\n\nGlad you asked! A whole bunch of stuff, unsurprisingly. As of Sept. 12, the museum's chief astronomer Pitts has begun a podcast called \"The Curious Cosmos with Derrick Pitts\" (9/12). The museum will also host an eclipse viewing party on Oct. 12. When the museum opens its Wondrous Space exhibit on Nov. 4, guests will also be treated to a touring Mars art installation by artist Luke Jerram, and the reopening of the \"refreshed\" Holt & Miller Observatory.\n\nMatthew Korfhage is a USA Today Network reporter in the broader Philadelphia region, covering culture, food, equity, science and why the trains don't run on time.

On the episode, the namesake school will take a field trip to Philadelphia's renowned Franklin Institute science museum.\n\n“Abbott Elementary” creator and West Philly native Quinta Brunson is known for getting the local details right in her role as a can-do second grade teacher named Janine Teagues at a fictional Philadelphia grade school.\n\nPeople from Delaware to South Jersey to Northeast Philly love tracking appearances of regional slang (oldhead, jawn, youse); hyperlocal product placement (Utz, Danny's Wok); and in-jokes about the unstoppable cult of Gritty, James Harden's beard and the plastic coverings on South Philly Italian couches.\n\nMore:'SNL': Quinta Brunson praises teachers, takes a jab at 'Friends' cast in opening monologue\n\nNeed a break?

You can take a tour if you'd like.\n\nWhy is Abbott Elementary going to the Franklin Institute for the season finale?\n\nBecause that's what Philadelphia schoolchildren do.\n\nIn part, the school trip is the payoff to the \"Fundraiser\" episode from January, when Abbott Elementary students engaged in a classic Philly pastime to fund a Franklin Institute field trip: selling chocolate at somewhat inflated prices, with a bit of ingenious hustle.\n\n“Abbott Elementary” producers called the museum last fall, said Franklin Institute chief astronomer Derrick Pitts. Brunson and some of the other stars arrived in Philly at the end of January to shoot the episode. The institute managed to keep the filming hush-hush by closing off only certain sections of the museum at a time, leaving the rest of the museum open.\n\nPitts said he was \"walking on air” after getting to meet Brunson, and was gratified the Franklin Institute was the first place that “Abbott Elementary” decided to visit in Philadelphia.\n\n\"Quinta was really happy to be here at the Franklin Institute. You know, it felt like she knew us,\" he said. \"I mean, her mother was a schoolteacher. ... And of all the places you could come in Philadelphia, she chose the Franklin Institute. I think that says something.\"\n\nWhat exhibits will Abbott Elementary students visit at the Franklin Institute?\n\nAs students have done for nearly 70 years in Philly, the children of Abbott Elementary will run through the chambers of the 4-ton, papier-mache Giant Heart. They will hop aboard the hulking Baldwin 60000 steam locomotive at the museum's train factory, there since 1933.\n\nAnd, of course, they'll also visit the 20-foot-tall marble statue of Ben Franklin in the museum's rotunda, the nation's official memorial to the kite-flying, almanac-happy Founding Father.\n\nThe children featured as extras in the season finale are not from Los Angeles: They are real-deal Philadelphia schoolchildren, apparently including \"seven nephews and nieces\" of Brunson, the star told Jimmy Kimmel this week.\n\nWhat else happens in the ‘Abbott Elementary’ season finale?\n\nWe're told that chaos ensues after Principal Ava Coleman (Janelle James) spots an extraterrestrial life form in the Franklin Institute. That said, who hasn't?\n\nBrunson's co-star Tyler James Williams has hinted that the finale is a corker.\n\n\"It’s a big chaotic episode, but it’s one of the ones that sits super close to my heart,\" said Williams in an interview with blog HollywoodLife. \"I’ll really never forget that episode, man. It was super beautiful, and I can’t wait for people to see it so we can finally talk about what happened.\"\n\nWhere can I watch the ‘Abbott Elementary’ season finale?\n\nYou can watch it live Wednesday, April 19, on ABC at 9 p.m. EDT. You can also log into any of ABC's streaming apps. If you're willing to wait till Thursday, you can also watch with a Hulu subscription.\n\nMatthew Korfhage is a Philadelphia-based reporter for USA Today Network.

I wasn’t feeling too beat up, so I booked us a one-night, two-day stay in Philadelphia. I needed a break, too.\n\nPhilly is really special to me because I lived there for four years during college. I graduated from The University of the Arts in 2003. Last week marked Jack’s first trip to Philly — and boy did he love it.\n\nWe stayed at Double Tree by Hilton Hotel Center City — located on the Avenue of the Arts, it was the perfect location for sightseeing, dining and fun!\n\nThe hotel is an excellent place for families looking for a place to rest their heads, dine, have fun, play, and take in some art — and you can do all of this in the hotel.\n\nJack loved the suite — and so did I. There was a living room and kitchenette — moms love storing yogurt tubes, cheese sticks and juice boxes to ward off “the hangry kid”— at least I do.\n\nDowntime is important, too. Jack loved lounging in the living room watching cartoons, eating those famous warm Double Tree freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, while I caught up on the news in the other room and freshened up before dinner.\n\nDid I mention the heated pool? What kid doesn’t dig that? Jack took a night swim — with the gleaming skyline behind him. Perfect!\n\nOn the way to dinner, it was like we were walking through an art gallery, yet we were still in our hotel. The cool seating, funky wall art on the ceiling, and bright murals delighted us.\n\n“Wow Mom!” Jack said.\n\nWe dined at Spice 28 and had some delicious Asian-Fusion eats like pad Thai, edamame, rice and chicken.\n\nThe real fun was exploring the city. We visited the Franklin Institute — I hadn’t been there since I was a young Girl Scout.\n\nJack was fascinated by the hands-on exhibits, such as walking through a giant human heart, climbing in the human brain, the planetarium — and so much more like the trains, planes and Space Command ride. It’s such a special museum because everything is please, please, please pretty please touch!\n\nNext we walked around Philly and took in the fountains, cherry blossoms, City Hall and Rittenhouse Park. I even treated Jack to an OJ at Rouge in Rittenhouse Park — he thought that was pretty fancy. They have the best burgers! My dad used to take me there when he visited back in the college days.\n\nOver the span of two days, we hit three must-go spots in Philly, including LOVE Park. Located near City Hall, LOVE Park serves as the grand entrance to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\n\nThe plaza, designed by famed City Planner Edmond Bacon, father of actor Kevin Bacon, was originally constructed over an underground parking garage in 1965. The plaza expanded in 1969, with the addition of beautifully curved granite steps and a majestic fountain. It’s a great spot for pictures, of course.\n\nThe Liberty Bell was an important stop. Jack is lucky and has been to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and The World Trade Center Memorial in New York City.\n\nIt’s important that he understand what America has been through and what we stand for: freedom, liberty and perseverance.\n\nThe Liberty Bell bears a timeless message: “Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants thereof.”\n\nNo tickets are required and waiting in line is great because there is so much to read and see. Jack, of course, was overwhelmed by the giant, iconic bell, and very curious about the crack in it. I did some Googling while we were in line to share some info with him.\n\nAccording to National Park Service Centennial, “No one recorded when or why the Liberty Bell first cracked, but the most likely explanation is that a narrow split developed in the early 1840s after nearly 90 years of hard use. In 1846, when the city decided to repair the bell prior to George Washington’s birthday holiday (Feb. 23), metal workers widened the thin crack to prevent its farther spread and restore the tone of the bell using a technique called ‘stop drilling.’ The wide ‘crack’ in the Liberty Bell is actually the repair job! Look carefully and you’ll see over 40 drill bit marks in that wide ‘crack.’ But the repair was not successful. The Public Ledger newspaper reported that the repair failed when another fissure developed. This second crack, running from the abbreviation for ‘Philadelphia’ up through the word ‘Liberty,’ silenced the bell forever.”\n\nAfter that we walked around South Street, which is so eccentric and wild. Long known as the edgiest street in Philadelphia, South Street is a melting pot of groups and cultures. South Street is always buzzing no matter if you visit on a Tuesday afternoon or a Friday night. This mom has been to plenty of bars and clubs on South Street.\n\nMy favorite part of the trip was taking Jack to The University of the Arts, where I studied Communications and Digital Journalism. I took him to the Great Hall and students snapped pics of us. I was able to point out my dorm building and we toured the University’s galleries. Jack loved the snowboard art. Pretty cool if you ask us!\n\nWe had a great time. We hope to return soon because there is just so much to do in the city that loves you back!\n\nVisitPhilly.com for more information.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/11/13/animal-innards-display-franklin-institute/18967331/", "title": "'Body Worlds' animals on view at Franklin Institute", "text": "Margie Fishman\n\nThe News Journal\n\nImagine your family dog.\n\nNow imagine your family dog with his skin peeled back, exposing a dense network of capillaries in blazing blood red.\n\nCreepy? Yes. Captivating? Absolutely.\n\nFrom the creator of the original controversial \"Body Worlds\" nearly two decades ago, \"Body Worlds: Animal Inside Out\" at the Franklin Institute is an anatomical safari of more than 100 specimens.\n\nOn display through April 12 in Philadelphia, the exhibition offers exceptional access to the skeletons, muscles, organs and circulatory systems of some of our favorite animal friends.\n\n\"That's a rabbit?\" one visitor marveled recently. \"I thought that was a monster.\"\n\nIt's a fairly common reaction, according to institute staff. They promise that no animal was harmed or killed for the exhibition. Deceased animals were donated by university veterinary programs, zoos and animal groups. The smattering of human parts – used mainly for comparison purposes – were given by the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg, Germany.\n\nGerman anatomist Gunther von Hagens invented the plastination technique in 1977. He developed a vacuum process, replacing the body's water, fat and assorted gunk with reactive plastics that harden to reveal innards in their majestic complexity.\n\nVon Hagens launched the first \"Body Worlds\" in Tokyo in 1995. The traveling exhibition of human corpses has since visited more than 50 museums and venues worldwide, prompting complaints from religious leaders.\n\nBody Worlds appeared at the Franklin Institute in 2006, shattering attendance records at the time. A second Body Worlds focused on the brain debuted in 2009.\n\nA selection of animal specimens in the first Body Worlds were such a hit that Von Hagens and his team curated a collection for Animal Inside Out. Each specimen took an average of 1,500 hours to prepare for display.\n\nFrom a reindeer fetus to a full-grown giraffe to a rarely seen giant squid, the exhibition underlines the similarities in anatomy and physiology among all living creatures. The goal is to promote respect and appreciation, according to Franklin Institute CEO Larry Dubinski.\n\n\"You're really just in awe,\" he says.\n\nVisitors learn that nearly every part of a bird's anatomy has evolved to aid flight, rat organs are packed most efficiently, and the nervous system of a cat resembles angel hair pasta.\n\nA gargantuan human thigh bone rests next to a snail, which, when alive, can travel a maximum speed of one mile a week. An almond-sized hare brain is compared to a walnut-sized cat brain and a mango-sized human brain. Brain size, the accompanying text reminds us, is not directly proportional to intelligence.\n\nThe exhibition closes with a plea for conservation, noting the estimated 1,300 species classified as endangered or threatened.\n\nThere are no age restrictions for Animal Inside Out. Parents should gauge whether their children can handle seeing a horse's head sliced in half or the inner workings of a camel's stomach.\n\nThrough Jan. 4, an associated exhibition, \"Sesame Street Presents: The Body,\" is geared for children ages 2 to 7. It promotes healthy eating and good hygiene, featuring a giant sneeze machine.\n\nBut if you want to catch Animal Inside Out, you need to act fast. After it leaves the institute, it's not likely to return to the U.S. And Dubinski doesn't expect to host another Bodies-themed exhibition anytime soon.\n\nMolly Barnes, a budding brain surgeon from Yardley, visited Animal Inside Out recently with her mother. At age 12, Barnes has dissected fish and frogs and swallowed oysters without getting queasy.\n\nShe seemed impressed by nature's minor miracles.\n\n\"I thought the cat's brain would be a little bigger,\" she said. \"And the size of the bull's testicles surprised me.\"\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882 or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nIF YOU GO:\n\nWHAT: \"Body Worlds: Animal Inside Out\"\n\nWHEN: Through April 12\n\nWHERE: The Franklin Institute, 222 N. 20th St., Philadelphia.\n\nTICKETS: Daytime tickets (includes general admission to the institute): Adults, $29.50; children ages 3-11, $22.50.

Kessler’s feature-length film, “The Pine Barrens,” will be shown at 5 p.m. accompanied by a live score by The Ruins of Friendship Orchestra.\n\nInfluenced by the distinct ecology and history of New Jersey’s Pine Barrens, the project explores cultural and creative relationships with the natural world with works by artists inspired by the region, including land art pioneer Nancy Holt, Nobel Prize-winning artist Maya Lin, and Philadelphia video installation artists and Guggenheim Foundation Fellows Matthew Suib and Nadia Hironaka.\n\nAt 1.1 million acres, the Pine Barrens, also known as the New Jersey Pinelands, represents the largest open space on the East Coast between Boston and Richmond, Va., and covers about 22 percent of the nation’s most densely populated state. Under the sandy soil lies 17 trillion gallons of pristine water in the Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer, which supplies drinking water to two million people.\n\nDespite countless threats and continued abuses, this unlikely land of fire, folklore and endangered species has persisted, mainly due to the relationship between people and the natural world that remains strong in this region through agriculture, storytelling, recreation and advocacy.\n\nThe event begins at 3 p.m. in the museum's halls of dioramas with experimental film installations and a display of academy plant and animal specimens collected from the Pine Barrens. From 5 to 7 p.m., “The Pine Barrens” film will be shown with the live The Ruins of Friendship Orchestra.

Listening to the photographer's recount of how he got the shot will stick with you longer.\n\nWhen nature photographer Michael “Nick” Nichols led a bevy of media representatives through \"Wild,'' his exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, almost every photo he stopped in front of came with a story worth repeating.\n\nMore:Zoo exhibit keeps kids cool, teaches them how animals cope\n\nMore:Escape not once, but twice, from Franklin Institute\n\nMore:Endless summer: Franklin Institute’s mirror maze\n\nNichols is a great tale-teller, said Peter Barberie, co-curator of the exhibit with Melissa Harris, who has written a new biography of the photographer based on years of friendship.\n\nNichols said his stories are “all almost true.” He certainly brings a lot of bounce to the nature shots, whether they be of lions, tigers or bears. Then there are the endangered species, elephants and apes, delightful snaps of hippos surfing in the river and skeevy ones of members of the photo team covered in crawling and hopping bugs the size of passion fruit seeds.\n\nPatience pays off\n\nSitting for hours, and sometimes days, for the nature shot isn't fun. The exhibit includes information about how challenging it was to rig up ways to capture images for the 30 expansive articles he compiled for National Geographic.\n\nNot a single photo displayed was taken from a Range Rover on a tourist safari. Most were from “hides,” usually a lean-to kind of setup where the photographer waited endlessly for targets to show up at a watering hole, beach, savanna or forest.\n\nLions are a bit social, Nichols said, aren't afraid of humans and hunt at night, so he used infrared sensors for those photos. Tigers, however, are another story.\n\n“You can't get close to tigers. I sat 19 days in a hide, a grass structure. The tiger got close to me once. He came and peed on my hide. In three months, I got one photo of him and that was from a camera trap,” he said.\n\nNichols dubbed that tiger “Charger,” and you don't have to look closely to see the shadow of the camera robot Nichols used to get the photo. He wouldn't categorize it as his favorite but he wore a black T-shirt with an image of that shot, instead of a traditional starched white shirt, to the black-tie reception at the Museum of Art on the night the exhibit was opened to donors.\n\nAbout half of the photos in the exhibit were taken with film, in days before digital cameras. Some of Nichols works are paired with paintings, sculptures and artifacts already in the museum's collection. There is a carved ivory chair and foot stool, for example, in one gallery displaying photos of elephants. Curators have set up a scavenger hunt of sorts, suggesting visitors stop in other sections of the museum to see examples of Nichols' work. (A hint: one of them he and curators call “bear in a bath” is in the cloister portion of the museum).\n\nOne of the pairings is of a photo by Nichols of a silverback gorilla installed near a poster depicting a well-known painting of Tommy Dale Palmore of a gorilla lying on a Oriental carpet. Nichols said he and his wife, artist Reba Park, purchased a copy of that poster and kept it for years. Palmore called the seductively posing gorilla Reclining Nude.\n\n'Our lives are brief'\n\nBefore you even enter the galleries, your mouth will drop open when you stand in the Grand Stair Hall and gape at 60-foot wall hangings of a redwood being climbed by members of Nichols' crew and a sequoia tree in a blizzard. The redwood image is the result of 84 separate images that created a composite that became a five-page fold out in an issue of National Geographic.\n\n“One of those trees is 1,500 years old; the other, 3,200 years old. They remind us that our lives are brief,” said Museum Director and CEO Timothy Rub.\n\nMany of the photos in the exhibit show the results of elephant poaching to collect ivory. Nichols said he was heart-broken to see the results of the animal massacres, but emphasized that his purpose in traveling through the region was to document the wildlife, not act as an advocate, a position for which he had no standing.\n\n“I'm not a citizen of the Congo. I can't take an elephant or a gorilla (to a sanctuary spot). That's not my job, not my responsibility,” he said.\n\nDiligence and luck\n\nNichols became a staff photographer for National Geographic in 1996 and was named editor at large for photography in 2008. He said most of his photographs were the result of diligence and luck.\n\n“How do you get the surfing hippo shot? You go up and down the beach until you find one. They have a gigantic body, little tiny legs, so they don't like to walk. They go into the ocean and coast. There is no X on the map (for where to find the hippos). There are no surfing beaches. You just keep looking,” he said. The displayed photo was taken at 4 a.m. at Loango National Park in Gabon.\n\nBe sure to stop at the end of the exhibit, in the video room, before you exit into the exhibit gift shop. Settle into one of the comfortable seats and watch the looped video that includes crew members who worked with Nichols.\n\nA portion of the film shows a technician wearing camouflage clothing and a football helmet topped not only with netting but with a plastic owl.

Incurably. I’ve tried to quit. But I just can’t. Cut me open and I bleed Dodger Blue. Pantone 294 to be exact.\n\nI can’t help it. It’s my dad’s fault. He infected me. We lived in L.A. and he watched Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale and the great teams of the 1960s. I got to see Steve Garvey and the great teams of the 1970s and ’80s. Watching Fernando Valenzuela pitch was an event in our house, as it was in many other L.A. homes gripped by Fernandomania. Vin Scully’s voice was the soundtrack of my childhood. When I was in college, I won an essay contest and covered a Dodgers game as a fantasy sportswriter during the team’s “Think Blue Week” (Note to the Dodgers editor: I’ll file that story any day now).\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nI’m still mad at myself for not watching Kirk Gibson hit his famous home run off Dennis Eckersley in the 1988 World Series. That night I was 13 miles away at the Great Western Forum rooting for the Kings and booing Philadelphia Flyers goalie Ron Hextall.\n\nMLB HAS CHANGED:At 76, can White Sox manager meet it halfway?\n\nMETS FANS, REJOICE:MLB owners approve Steve Cohen as new owner\n\nWhen Gibby hit his dinger, the only thing the Forum public-address announcer said was something like, “Final score from Dodger Stadium: Dodgers 5, Oakland A’s 4.” Everyone cheered but no one had any idea.\n\nAnd my Dodgers fanaticism runs even deeper. You see, I attended Cal State Fullerton, which, to put it mildly, is a baseball school. Fullerton is basically a parking lot with some buildings for kinesiology classes that baseball players attend in between bunting drills. I’m kidding. Sort of. Go, Titans!\n\nTurner is one of the most successful players to come out of Fullerton. He was a skinny, scrappy second baseman for the Titans and, frankly, I thought he was a longshot to have a major league career. When Fullerton was in the College World Series in 2003, I watched Turner get hit in the face by a pitch and break his ankle on the same play. I thought that might be the end of his baseball career.\n\nInstead, Turner never gave up on himself. He returned the next year and helped lead the Titans to their fourth College World Series title.\n\nThen he clawed his way through pro baseball. When the New York Mets gave up on him and didn’t think he was even worth the price of arbitration, he signed a minor-league deal with the Dodgers in 2014 and earned the third base job. He became the heart and soul of the Dodgers and earned every penny of the four-year, $64 million deal he signed in 2016.\n\nWith all the amazing players the Dodgers have, like Clayton Kershaw and Walker Buehler and Corey Seager and Mookie Betts, I’m not overstating this when I say that there is no way the Dodgers would have won the World Series without Turner’s leadership on and off the field.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Turner knew what was riding on this shortened season amid a pandemic. In July he outlined the protocols the Dodgers would follow in order to stay safe and keep a championship season on track. He even “stressed avoiding public appearances for marketing.”\n\nTurner has been a model player any team would covet. A model player. That term has now taken on a shameful meaning for Turner. Because when he chose to return to the field and celebrate with his team, despite testing positive for COVID-19 and being told to isolate, he became the epitome of selfishness and set a horrible example for the rest of us.\n\nWhen Julio Urias struck out Willy Adames for the final out to clinch the World Series, I wanted to cry. I watched the Dodgers celebrate and I was concerned about Turner, because we didn’t know at that time why he had left the game in the eighth inning. I was worried. I thought at best he had suffered an injury and at worst he had gotten some terrible news about a family member.\n\nI turned off the TV for a little while. When I came back and checked my phone, fully prepared to order hundreds of dollars of championship gear and souvenirs, the news of Turner was everywhere. So were the pictures of him celebrating with teammates. With a mask, and then without. He sat next to manager Dave Roberts, who had Hodgkin’s lymphoma and once said, “I’ll take beating cancer over any World Series or big stolen base. Baseball is part of me, something I did. But my fight against cancer was real.”\n\nSo what’s real to Turner? Holding a trophy? A celebration? A photo op? Turner would have still been a champion without any of that. Instead, he chose himself. He decided he had sacrificed enough, so he would sacrifice everyone else on the field: players, coaches, wives, children, team personnel, support staff, photographers, everyone. Young and old. Athletes in perfect health and people who are seriously compromised.\n\nAnd I don’t want to hear any baloney rationalizations about teammates being OK with Turner’s choice and supporting his reckless decision. Capital B and capital S. Even if that were true, Turner and the Dodgers don’t get to make that choice. Major League Baseball does. They had rules and agreed-upon protocols for a reason. As the pandemic continues to rage, we’re all sacrificing. But I guess if you’re a big enough athlete in a big enough moment, those rules don’t apply.\n\nI’m pretty sure Turner thought two things in the moment: The season-long sacrifice was all about winning and now that we’ve won, screw the rules. And two: What’s the league going to do to me? Fine me and suspend me for a few games next year?\n\nI own a Dodgers T-shirt with Turner’s name and No. 10 on it. It belonged to my best friend, also a Fullerton alumnus, who died of cancer a few years ago. We both loved Turner and the Dodgers, and the shirt is one of my treasured possessions. I’ll always keep it, but I don’t know if I’ll ever wear it again. I’ll always be a Dodgers fan, but I don’t know if I can ever root for Turner again.\n\nMaybe if Turner makes an apology I can believe, I’ll forgive him. I’m not sure. But maybe he won’t even do that. Maybe he doesn’t care.\n\nBut I am certain of this. Turner made one of the worst and most selfish decisions I’ve seen in sports, and in so doing he broke the heart of at least one of his biggest fans. And for the rest of his life he has forfeited the right to disagree with people who break rules for whatever selfish reasons they can come up with.\n\nContact Carlos Monarrez at cmonarrez@freepress.com and follow him on Twitter @cmonarrez.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/12/27/giant-menorah-downtown-detroit-celebrates-faith-and-freedom/95884744/", "title": "Giant menorah in downtown Detroit celebrates Hanukkah faith ...", "text": "Niraj Warikoo\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nAddressing a packed crowd Tuesday night in Campus Martius, Rabbi Kasriel Shemtov cried out: \"Happy Hanukkah! Let me hear it!\"\n\n\"Happy Hanukkah,\" the audience roared back.\n\nNext to them stood a 26-foot-tall menorah that would be lit soon, part of the annual \"Menorah in the D\" program that brings the Jewish holiday to the heart of downtown Detroit. The sixth annual event has grown in size since its inception, a way for the Jewish community to celebrate its faith tradition and also the idea of religious freedom. Close by sits a tall Christmas tree near the skating rink at Campus Martius.\n\nMore on Hanukkah:\n\nRabbis complain about Michigan prisons' Hanukkah rules\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHanukkah overlaps with Christmas this year. But why all the moving around?\n\nChinese food for Hanukkah on Christmas\n\n\"It really gives people a sense of pride, of being able to celebrate the holiday, and bring the message of religious freedom to all,\" said Shemtov, of the Shul-Chabad Lubavitch in West Bloomfield, which hosts the event along with the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit. \"We are blessed in this country where we can celebrate a holiday in the center of the city. This is for all cultures, all faiths, the blessings we have in the United States of America.\"\n\nMenorahs have 8 branches that are lit on each night of the 8-day Hanukkah holiday, which marks the miracle of oil lasting 8 days instead of one after Jews had defeated their adversaries in ancient Greece to preserve their Jewish identity. Chabad, an Orthodox Jewish group, started in 1974 in Philadelphia the tradition of lighting a menorah in a public space. The Liberty Bell was their first location, a symbolic way to stress the importance of religious freedom, both in the past and present.\n\nThere are other menorah lightings in metro Detroit done by Chabad, including in Oak Park, Southfield, and in Franklin Cider Mill for the first time this year. The Detroit event featured a food court, music, Hanukkah crafts, dancing and an afterglow for adults with craft beers.\n\nThe menorah lightings this year come during a tense time for some minorities, including the Jewish community, amid concern about a rise in racism and anti-Semitism tied to an intense presidential election race.\n\nBenji Rosenzweig, 34, West Bloomfield, has participated in the Detroit menorah lighting since it first started in 2011, celebrating \"the idea that we as Americans can celebrate our religious beliefs publicly without fear of persecution or discrimination.\"\n\nRosenzweig's grandfather grew up in Poland during a time of anti-Semitism that made them even afraid to light a menorah inside their home.\n\nToday in America, \"we can celebrate publicly in an environment like this,\" Rosenzweig said. \"We live in an amazing country where we have the religious freedom to celebrate how we choose.\"\n\nAt Tuesday's ceremony, Shemtov and other speakers said the light of the menorah can help illuminate our individual souls. On stage was a woman who had lived in France when Nazis took power.\n\nHanukkah is \"a holiday that celebrates lightness over dark, good over evil,\" said Michigan Supreme Court Justice Richard Bernstein. Bernstein called upon the crowd to \"celebrate the simple miracles\" in our lives, which are filled with both joy and \"struggle, pain, and hardship.\"\n\n\"Live your life like a great novel,\" with both the good and bad, he said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Southfield, said the menorah lighting demonstrates the values of \"respect and inclusion\" in metro Detroit, which can be \"a model for this great country.\"\n\nContact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com or 313-223-4792.
