And many of the nation’s grid operators are also not taking climate change into account in their planning, even as extreme weather becomes more frequent and more severe.\n\nAll of this suggests that more power outages are on the way, not only this summer but in the coming years as well.\n\nPower operators in the Central US, in their summer readiness report, have already predicted “insufficient firm resources to cover summer peak forecasts.” That assessment accounted for historical weather and the latest NOAA outlook that projects for more extreme weather this summer.\n\nBut energy experts tell CNN that some power grid operators are not considering how the climate crisis is changing our weather — including more frequent extreme events — and that is a problem if the intent is to build a reliable power grid.\n\n“The reality is the electricity system is old and a lot of the infrastructure was built before we started thinking about climate change,” said Romany Webb, a researcher at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “It’s not designed to withstand the impacts of climate change.”\n\nWebb says many power grid operators use historical weather to make investment decisions, rather than the more dire climate projections, simply because they want to avoid the possibility of financial loss for investing in what might happen versus what has already happened. She said it’s the wrong approach and it makes the grid vulnerable.\n\n“We have seen a reluctance on the part of many utilities to factor climate change into their planning processes because they say the science around climate change is too uncertain,” Webb said. “The reality is we know climate change is happening, we know the impact it has in terms of more severe heatwaves, hurricanes, drought, and we know that all of those things affect the electricity system so ignoring those impacts just makes the problems worse.”\n\nMatjaz Krivic\n\nAn early heatwave knocked six power plants offline in Texas earlier this month. Residents were asked to limit electricity use, keeping thermostats at 78 degrees or higher and avoid using large appliances at peak times. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, in its seasonal reliability report, said the state’s power grid is prepared for the summer and has “sufficient” power for “normal” summer conditions, based on average weather from 2006 to 2020.\n\nBut NOAA’s recently released summer outlook forecasts above average temperatures for every county in the nation.\n\n“We are continuing to design and site facilities based on historical weather patterns that we know in the age of climate change are not a good proxy for future conditions,” Webb told CNN.\n\nWhen asked if the agency is creating a blind spot for itself by not accounting for extreme weather predictions, an ERCOT spokesperson told CNN the report “uses a scenario approach to illustrate a range of resource adequacy outcomes based on extreme system conditions, including some extreme weather scenarios.”\n\nThe North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC — a regulating authority that oversees the health of the nation’s electrical infrastructure — has a less optimistic projection.\n\nIn a recent seasonal reliability report, NERC placed Texas at “elevated risk” for blackouts this summer. It also reported that while much of the nation will have adequate electricity this summer, several markets are at risk of energy emergencies.\n\nCalifornia grid operators in its summer reliability report also based its readiness analysis on “the most recent 20 years of historical weather data.” The report also notes the assessment “does not fully reflect more extreme climate induced load and supply uncertainties.”\n\nCompounding the US power grid’s supply and demand problem is drought: NERC tells CNN there’s been a 2% loss of reliable hydropower from the nation’s power-producing dams. Add to that the rapid retirement of many coal power plants — all while nearly everything from toothbrushes to cars are now electrified. Energy experts say adding more renewables into the mix will have the dual impact of cutting climate change inducing greenhouse gas emissions but also increasing the nation’s power supply.\n\nPlan B\n\nOne Chicago neighborhood is already making plans for how to keep the lights, air conditioning and heat on when the larger grid fails.\n\nIn the Bronzeville neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, solar panels dot the rooftop of a public housing complex. A short drive away, a a giant battery stores energy from the solar panels as well as natural gas generators, creating a micro grid. Ilinois-based energy company, Commonwealth Edison, is working with community members to make the neighborhood energy independent.\n\n“Without power we are talking about potential life-threatening situations, so this micro grid provides that backup to be able to deliver power even when the [main] grid isn’t there,” said Paul Pabst, an engineer for Commonwealth Edison.\n\nThe project is pending approval but once it’s operating, the micro grid can connect and share power with the main grid. In the event of a blackout, it can disconnect and operate independently, tapping its stored battery energy to power the homes, police station and hospital in the area for four hours.\n\nYami Newell is a Bronzeville resident and energy advocate. She has seen the cascading effects of an unreliable power grid in Chicago, a place that’s no stranger to weather-related outages from both extreme cold and extreme heat. Losing power in a heatwave can create a dangerous health situation, and for families on a fixed income, losing all of the food in their refrigerator can be financially devastating.\n\n“An energy crisis can become a public health crisis,” Newell told CNN. “It can become a food crisis.”\n\nAs communities look for innovative ways to build a more resilient grid, Bronzeville is one possible blueprint. Until states build a more resilient power grid, climate change will force energy companies to continue to take emergency actions, like asking people to limit electricity use or forced rolling blackouts to manage the grid when supply can’t meet demand.", "authors": ["René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/uk/liz-truss-government-crisis-thursday-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "Liz Truss resigns as Britain's Prime Minister after disastrous six ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nLiz Truss will become the shortest-serving prime minister in British history, after announcing her intention to resign just six weeks into a disastrous term that pitched Britain deep into political and economic turmoil.\n\nTruss said Thursday that she would step aside for a new leader to be chosen within the next week, after a growing number of her own Conservative Party’s lawmakers said they could not support her any longer.\n\n“Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to His Majesty The King to notify him that I am resigning as Leader of the Conservative Party,” Truss said while standing outside the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the same spot in which she had promised to put the UK back onto the path to economic growth and stability just six weeks earlier.\n\nThe announcement brings to an ignominious end a catastrophic tenure in Downing Street, which appeared doomed ever since the announcement of Truss’s flagship economic agenda sent markets into panic. A record rise in UK government bond prices sent borrowing costs surging and forced the Bank of England to make three successive interventions to rescue overstretched pension funds. The pound at one point hit an all-time low against the US dollar.\n\nTruss said she would stay in Downing Street until her successor is named.\n\nGraham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee which represents rank-and-file Conservative Members of Parliament, said Thursday that the new party leader – and therefore prime minister – should be in place before the end of October.\n\nCandidates to replace Truss will need at least 100 nominations from British Conservative lawmakers, Brady said later on Thursday, a move that effectively narrows the field of potential candidates.\n\nThe threshold allows for the possibility of three candidates, maximum, he said. There would be an online vote for Conservative Party members if two candidates make it through the parliamentary stages, party chairman Jake Berry added.\n\nIf only one candidate emerges, there could be a new party leader and Prime Minister by Monday, Brady said.\n\nTruss had tried to save her position by admitting her plan was a mistake and replacing her chancellor and long-time ally Kwasi Kwarteng with Jeremy Hunt, a staunch supporter of former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the leadership contest over the summer.\n\nIn the end, even that was not enough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Truss lost another top official when Home Secretary Suella Braverman dramatically quit just a few weeks into the job, using her letter of resignation to launch a blistering attack on the prime minister’s leadership.\n\n“The business of government relies upon people accepting responsibility for their mistakes. Pretending we haven’t made mistakes, carrying on as if everyone can’t see that we have made them, and hoping that things will magically come right is not serious politics,” Braverman wrote in a critique of Truss’s numerous U-turns on taxes and public spending.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss announces her resignation outside Number 10 Downing Street on October 20, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nMaking a bad day even worse, chaotic scenes unfolded in the UK Parliament on Wednesday evening during a vote on whether to ban controversial fracking for shale gas.\n\nLawmakers reported that aides for Truss had manhandled MPs into the voting lobby to force them to vote against the ban proposed by the opposition Labour Party. Politicians in the lobby tweeted eyewitness accounts alleging that MPs were being physically dragged to vote in the government lobby, amid angry scenes of shouting and altercation.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle announced Thursday that he had ordered an investigation into the allegations.\n\nShortest tenure ever\n\nThe names of potential successors began floating around even before Truss announced she was going to resign.\n\nLeader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who stepped in for Truss during a difficult parliamentary debate earlier this week and also stood in the leadership contest over the summer, will likely be in the running. Sunak, who was Truss’ biggest rival in that contest, is another possible candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, allies of Boris Johnson, Truss’s predecessor in Number 10, made it clear on Thursday that they think the former prime minister will stand in the leadership contest, according to two sources who worked on Johnson’s 2019 leadership campaign.\n\nNewly appointed Home Secretary Grant Shapps and Kemi Badenoch, who came fourth in the last leadership contest, could also stand.\n\nTruss announced her decision to leave on day 45 of her tenure. George Canning previously held the record for the shortest term in Downing Street, having served for 119 days until his death in 1827.\n\nHer move ensures a fresh power struggle within the ruling Conservative Party, which has hemorrhaged public support for the past year and has now overthrown Boris Johnson and Truss in the space of a few months. The new prime minister will be the third since the last general election in December 2019 and the fifth since the Conservatives came into power in 2010.\n\nEarlier this year, Truss’s predecessor Johnson narrowly survived a confidence vote in his leadership. But he resigned weeks later when dozens of ministers and members of the government quit, citing a lack of confidence in his government.\n\nTruss was elected the Conservative Party leader in early September. The September 6 audience during which Queen Elizabeth II officially appointed Truss as the new prime minister, the 15th of her reign, was one of the last duties carried out by the monarch before her death on September 8.\n\nThe new prime minister, whoever that may be, will become the first to be appointed by King Charles III.\n\nKeir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, which is enjoying a huge lead in opinion polls, on Thursday repeated his calls for an early general election.\n\n“After 12 years of Tory failure, the British people deserve so much better than this revolving door of chaos,” the opposition leader said in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people,” he added.\n\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for an early vote.\n\n“The interests of the Tory party should concern no-one right now. A General Election is now a democratic imperative,” Sturgeon said on Twitter.\n\nThe next general election is due to take place no later than January 2025, but the prospect of Britain seeing its third prime minister since the last poll in 2019 would heap pressure on Truss’ successor to ask the public for a new mandate.\n\nThe British pound was trading 0.5% higher against the dollar after Truss announced her resignation, indicating that investors welcomed the decision.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/uk/rishi-sunak-sajid-javid-resignation-boris-johnson-intl/index.html", "title": "Huge blow for Boris Johnson as senior UK government ministers ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson was dealt a huge and sudden blow on Tuesday when two of his top ministers announced their resignations, saying they could no longer work for a government mired in scandal.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced their decisions to quit within minutes of each other on Tuesday evening, plunging Johnson’s troubled administration into renewed chaos and prompting a wave of other junior ministers and officials to resign.\n\nSome called on Johnson himself to step down, and there was speculation that if he refused to go, members of his own party would launch a formal effort to unseat him – less than a month after the last one failed.\n\nThe immediate cause of the resignations was the bungled handling of a recent controversy, but came against the backdrop of months of turmoil in which Johnson was fined by police for breaking Covid-19 lockdown rules.\n\n“The public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously,” Sunak said in his resignation letter, posted to Twitter. “I recognise this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning.”\n\n“I am sad to be leaving Government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this,” Sunak added.\n\nJavid wrote that “it has been an enormous privilege to serve in this role, but I regret that I can no longer continue in good conscience.” Javid added that the vote of confidence in the prime minister last month “was a moment for humility, grip and new direction.”\n\n“I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership – and you have therefore lost my confidence too,” Javid wrote.\n\nOther ministers and officials occupying more junior posts in the government quit in the hours that followed, with more resignations continuing on Wednesday morning. Johnson moved to shore up his position, replacing his two Cabinet ministers late on Tuesday.\n\nScandal after scandal\n\nThe latest crisis blew up out of Downing Street’s handling of last week’s resignation of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, who stepped down from his post last Thursday amid allegations he had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before.\n\nWhile he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.”\n\nDowning Street had struggled to explain why Pincher was in government in the first place, amid a wave of revelations about his previous alleged conduct, denying Johnson knew anything specific about the allegations.\n\nOn Tuesday, it emerged that a complaint had been made against Pincher in the Foreign Office about three years ago and that Johnson was briefed on what happened.\n\nMinutes before Sunak and Javid announced their resignations, Johnson acknowledged it “was a mistake” to appoint Pincher to his government.\n\n“I got this complaint. It was something that was only raised with me very cursory, but I wish that we had acted on it and that he had not continued in government because he then went on, I’m afraid, to behave, as far as we can see – according to the allegations that we have – very, very badly,” Johnson said in a broadcast interview.\n\nUK opposition leader Keir Starmer said it was “clear” that the government was “collapsing.”\n\n“Tory cabinet ministers have known all along who this Prime Minister is. They have been his cheerleaders throughout this sorry saga. Backing him when he broke the law. Backing him when he lied repeatedly. Backing him when he mocked the sacrifices of the British people,” the Labour Party leader said in a statement released after the two resignations.\n\nFor months Johnson has been facing a barrage of criticism over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices for which he and others were fined.\n\nJohnson has faced numerous other scandals that have hit his standing in the polls – despite his 80-seat landslide victory just two-and-a-half years ago. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and whipping MPs to protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nLast month, he survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nBut while he managed to win the confidence vote, he suffered a further blow late last month when his party lost two parliamentary by-elections in a single night, raising new questions about his leadership.\n\nAccording to an Ipsos UK survey conducted between 22 and 29 June, Johnson’s Conservative Party, by some measures, is at its lowest level recorded in more than a decade. Just 21% of respondents said it is “fit to govern” – the lowest number for either the Conservatives or Labour since Ipsos started tracking this metric in 2011.\n\nThe chaos in Westminster had ripple effects in the financial markets, pushing the value of the British pound against the dollar to its lowest in more than two years.\n\nMore resignations\n\nDowning Street did not hesitate filling the vacant roles. Nadhim Zahawi, who was previously Secretary of State for Education, was appointed as Chancellor, while Downing Street Chief of Staff Steve Barclay became the new Health Secretary. Michelle Donelan replaced Zahawi as Education Secretary.\n\nThe resignation of the two Cabinet ministers prompted more junior figures to follow. Conservative party vice chair Bim Afolami announced his decision to quit live on television. During an interview with Tom Newton Dunn on Talk TV, Afolami said: “I just don’t think the Prime Minister any longer has my support… the support of the party or indeed the country anymore.”\n\nAlex Chalk, who served as the Solicitor General for Englnad and Wales, one of the government’s most senior law officers, also quit, saying in his resignation letter that it was time “for fresh leadership.”\n\n“To be in government is to accept the duty to argue for difficult or even unpopular policy positions where that serves the broader national interest. But it cannot extend to defending the indefensible,” Chalk said.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s trade envoy to Morocco, Andrew Murrison, also stepped down, blasting the “rolling chaos of the last six months” and saying that Boris Johnson’s “position has become unrecoverable.”\n\nAt least half a dozen other junior-ranking government officials also announced resignations later on Tuesday, and more quit on Wednesday morning.\n\nAllies of the Prime Minister insisted he would fight on. But, adding to the sense of chaos, two more ministers resigned just as Zahawi was giving an interview to BBC Radio 4’s Today program, regarded as the most high-profile of morning broadcast shows. As Zahawi responded to being told of the first resignation, the presenter, Nick Robinson, interrupted him to tell him of another.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2018/01/16/uwm-peer-georgia-state-university-figured-out-how-graduate-more-black-students-than-any-school-count/991109001/", "title": "How UWM peer helps most black students succeed", "text": "ATLANTA – Tyler Mulvenna wanted to achieve more than a high school diploma.\n\nHis sisters had babies as teenagers. One dropped out of high school but later earned her GED; the other finished high school. His mother, a single parent, worked two jobs and did not go to college.\n\nMulvenna noticed white students at his racially mixed high school, 45 minutes south of Atlanta, typically went to college, the second or third generation in their families to do so. He saw their posts on Facebook from campus visits with their parents, who were successful college graduates.\n\n“It was a fork in the road: The people who went to college, and those who didn’t,” Mulvenna recalled years later. The path he chose led to graduation from Georgia State University last spring.\n\nMulvenna started college in 2013, shortly after the urban research university made a commitment to not just admitting students but teaching them how to succeed.\n\nLeaders at the school — located a few blocks from Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthplace — stepped up their game in 2011 to nurture students who didn’t excel in high school, who didn’t know anything about navigating college, and who didn’t have anyone to guide them.\n\nRELATED: Only 1 in 5 black students enrolled at UW-Milwaukee graduates in 6 years\n\nARCHIVES: Amid rough seas for UW System, wave of distinct challenges hits UWM\n\nLeaders at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee — a peer of Georgia State in a city that struggles with a similar racial divide — have heard a lot about how Georgia State dramatically improved retention and graduation rates for at-risk students over the past six years. UWM hopes to find success by following a similar path.\n\nNo longer turning its back\n\nGeorgia State was segregated well into the 1960s. As recently as 10 years ago, white students were far more likely to graduate than black students.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2012, when the recession hammered Atlanta, the university lost $40 million in state support. But leaders didn’t let the lost funding rob them of their sense of mission.\n\nGeorgia State today graduates more African-American students than any other university in the country, and black students earn degrees at the same rate as whites.\n\nSince stepping up its efforts, Georgia State has more than doubled the number of bachelor's degrees it awards to African-American students — from 1,001 in 2009-'10 to 2,040 in 2016-'17.\n\nPART ONE:UWM has one of the worst black, white achievement gaps in the U.S. Here’s what the university is doing about it\n\nGeorgia State created an elaborate safety net for students at risk of dropping out.\n\nIt harnessed the power of analytics and big data and started so-called GPS advising, linking advisers to students as soon as they fail an exam, start missing classes, or register for a course that could slow them down because it won't count toward their major.\n\nThe university also began offering need-based Panther Retention Grants to students who fall behind paying tuition bills. It changed the way classes are taught to help vulnerable students succeed and introduced broad meta-majors to make sure classes fit with more than one major as students figure out a career path.\n\nWhen it consolidated last year with a two-year community college, Georgia State boosted to 50,000 the number of students it educates — 20,000 of them at the community college's campuses.\n\nGeorgia State's commitment to graduate more degree holders has not only helped students, it has helped the university's finances as well.\n\nThat’s because every student who doesn’t drop out continues to pay tuition and fees of roughly $10,000 per year.\n\nRELATED: UWM gets grant to aid MPS math, science teachers\n\nARCHIVES: UW Spotlights 'tragedy' of students needing remedial help\n\nFor every percentage point increase in the number of freshmen who return for the second year — 325 students — the university collects $3.18 million in revenue it otherwise would have lost if they dropped out.\n\nEven with that boost, the university still is not replacing all its lost state funding after the Great Recession. But leaders decided the school could no longer turn its back on low-income, minority and first-generation students, said Timothy Renick, a Georgia State vice president.\n\nMinority students from low-income households are often the first in their families to go to college. Because many attend urban public schools with marginal success rates, they aren’t academically prepared for college, Renick said.\n\nIn their quest to serve those who need the most help, Georgia State’s leaders were guided by a single question: Given this demographic reality — which mirrors Milwaukee’s — how do we shape the institution to respond to the students we enroll?\n\nLearning from mistakes\n\nUWM today looks a lot like Georgia State in 2003.\n\nAnd in Milwaukee, one of America’s most segregated, poverty-ridden cities, the success of the city itself is in some ways tied to the future of its most vulnerable residents.\n\nNationwide, the disparity in six-year graduation rates between blacks and whites is 13 percentage points.\n\nAt UWM, the racial disparity is 24 percentage points. By comparison, Marquette University, a private Jesuit school in Milwaukee, has a gap of 7 percentage points, but also enrolls fewer African-American students.\n\nThree of every four black students who enroll at Georgia State graduate within six years, while one of every five black freshmen at UWM finish in six years — among the worst track records in the nation, according to a recent study by the Education Trust, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\nAfrican-American students actually graduate at a slightly higher rate than white students at Georgia State: 77.5% vs. 76.4%.\n\nUWM is looking to Georgia State to see if approaches that worked there could help in Milwaukee.\n\nFor example, UWM is hiring more advisers and changing its advising approach. A committee is working to make sure introductory courses provide students with adequate preparation for their majors — and to be sure those courses fit with more than one major in case they change their minds.\n\nAlumni and administrators are raising private money to help students cover financial emergencies that might otherwise force them to drop out.\n\nA November decision by the UW System Board of Regents also may help UWM speed its progress. The plan will restructure UW’s two-year colleges, known for nurturing students toward four-year degrees. For UWM, that means taking on UW-Waukesha and UW-Washington County as satellite campuses. The intent is not to ship students to the suburbs, but rather to serve them where they are.\n\nRELATED: For UW-Waukesha professor, teaching math is an art form\n\nGeorgia State’s success with such programs has hinged on pinpointing mistakes made by past students to help current students avoid the same mistakes. Professors each day plug students' test grades into software linked to advisers who can reach out to help students before it's too late.\n\nHe took advantage\n\nMulvenna, who grew up outside Atlanta, started down the road to college at the end of eighth grade. That’s when his soccer coach, a NASA aerospace engineer, invited him along when he took his own son to visit Georgia Tech.\n\nMulvenna learned he needed to sign up for the challenging high school courses that would prepare him for college. He started picturing himself on campus, becoming excited for the future and working toward it, like his white Facebook friends.\n\nStill, his odds of success weren’t great. No one in his family had attended college before him. His study habits were lacking, as were his financial resources. Like 60% of Georgia State students, he was eligible for federal, need-based Pell Grants.\n\nMulvenna commuted from home his freshman year and worked about 30 hours a week through most of college to pay his bills. He was able to limit his student loan debt to about $8,000 with the help of scholarships and grants.\n\nHe took advantage of everything Georgia State — a majority-minority campus tucked amid the shiny skyscrapers of downtown Atlanta — offered him. He built relationships with advisers. Got involved with campus activities.\n\nHe graduated in four years, with a degree in French, international business and marketing.\n\nComparing notes\n\nLike Milwaukee, Atlanta doesn’t have the proudest heritage of race relations. But unlike Milwaukee, it has an influential and affluent African-American community.\n\nRenick, vice president for enrollment management and student success, worked closely with Atlanta’s city leaders to make his vision for Georgia State a reality.\n\nBefore taking on that role in 2008, he served as a professor of religious studies at the university for more than 20 years.\n\nRenick, who is white, oversees a multitude of areas that are managed by at least three different people at most campuses. Among them are financial aid, advising and the registrar’s office.\n\nOne of his innovations was implementing a weekly meeting where staff members from different departments exchange information to help students stay on track.\n\nFor example, the bursar may share with financial aid staff and advisers the names of students who haven’t paid their bills. Then, all three can work together to determine whether there’s a financial emergency. If there is, they may arrange for private grant money to cover it.\n\n'Come in and we'll talk'\n\nWhen Renick became a campus administrator, Georgia State had roughly 15 people who only did academic advising. Now there are 150 between the Atlanta campus and its community college campuses.\n\nExpanding the advising staff reduced the adviser-to-student ratio from 750 to 1, to 300 to 1.\n\nAdvisers have access to an early warning system powered by data.\n\nIt allows advisers to track students’ every academic move, from course registration to grades. Faculty update the system daily.\n\nAny time students make any one of 800 different missteps — such as failing a quiz, not showing up for classes, or signing up for the wrong course — advisers receive electronic alerts. What gets flagged was based on an analysis of 10 years of data, 2.5 million grades and 140,000 student records.\n\nThe data analysis also found that 75% of students who get an A or a B in their first course in their major graduate on time. If they get a C, it drops to 25%.\n\nAs a result, advisers try to address problems as early as the second week of class to change the trajectories of potential “C” students.\n\nAdvisers sit down with the students who don’t start off strong to get to the bottom of what happened. Maybe a student needs tutoring. Maybe he needs to go to the writing center. Maybe she needs to take another course before trying upper-level work.\n\nThe approach is “Why don’t you come in and we’ll talk about what resources we have that can make you successful so you can succeed,” Renick said.\n\n“What had we been doing with that C student?” he asked. “Absolutely nothing.”\n\nIn fact, the university was doing worse than nothing, in his view. Students who got Cs were led to believe they were ready to move on to more difficult courses. But that isn’t always the case.\n\n“They get into the class with upper-level work,\" Renick said, \"and whatever the weakness is evidenced in the C grade becomes exacerbated and turns into Ds and Fs.”\n\nBy then, it’s too late.\n\nRELATED:Broken car? Medical bill? New grant programs keep students on track during emergencies\n\nRELATED:34 years after retirement, UWM prof still helping students as endowment tops $1 million\n\nAt UWM, similar initiatives to prevent those students from falling through the cracks are in their infancy. Earlier this year, the university brought together advisers focused on multiculturalism and those who specialize in student support. Those teams focus special attention on first-year students and on those who haven’t declared majors.\n\n“Business, Industry, and Applied Technology” and “Social and Behavioral Sciences” are among the so-called meta-majors to keep UWM students on track toward graduation, while giving them flexibility to switch majors.\n\nUWM last year used grant money from UW System earmarked for advising initiatives to launch new software already used by Georgia State and others. The software helps students make better choices, starting with course schedule planning. The start-up cost was $5,000; the ongoing annual cost is $40,000.\n\nStudents choose preferred courses and schedule times for breaks and work. The software then generates the best scheduling choices, based on requirements of their major, reducing the chances for mistakes that can slow progress toward graduation.\n\nThe grant from UW System is to last through fiscal 2019.\n\nLike Georgia State, UWM also creates alerts for advisers in real time, but has fewer advisers available to help students. Georgia State, with about 30,000 students, has roughly 100 professional academic advisers on its Atlanta campus. UWM, with about 27,000 students, now has 85.\n\nToo Big Brother-ish?\n\nIn the beginning, vocal opponents on the Georgia State faculty argued using such up-to-the-minute data was too Big Brother-ish and invaded students’ privacy.\n\nFaculty also worried students would be steered toward easier majors to improve graduation rates.\n\nThat hasn’t happened. Computer science and biology are the two fastest-growing majors, according to Renick.\n\n“It might be because we’re giving them a fighting chance,” he said.\n\nGeorgia State provides that chance by getting students up to par in their chosen fields or, if they can’t do that, helping them make different choices.\n\nPart of that assistance is a revamped math curriculum. Instructors work with students hands-on in both classrooms and in math labs, where students progress at their own pace and get hundreds of bits of personalized feedback every hour.\n\nLectures are online.\n\nAnother strategy is giving students time to explore before they choose majors. Students interested in business, for example, spend their freshman year learning the differences among majors such as accounting, finance and risk management.\n\nThis helps prevent a common situation: Students who change their minds midway through school, but can’t change their majors because the courses they have already taken won’t count toward something different.\n\n'My head was spinning'\n\nAt Georgia State, high-achieving undergraduates are paid to mentor struggling students.\n\nFirst, university leaders identified the required courses with the highest rates of failure or withdrawals.\n\nThen they identified the mentors: students who had earned good grades in those courses and were eligible for federal financial assistance via work study.\n\nRather than wasting their talents in typically mindless work study jobs such as answering phones, the mentors lead classes known as “supplemental instruction.”\n\nAbout a third of Georgia State’s students take advantage of the additional group tutoring sessions each year, in part because they are led by undergraduates who may mirror the demographics of the struggling students, Renik said.\n\nStudents who attend at least three sessions for a single course do about half a letter grade better than those who don’t, and they are more likely to return to school the following year, Renick said.\n\nUWM, which introduced supplemental instruction in about a dozen courses a couple of years ago, is hoping for similar results. Course offerings are expanding.\n\nDuring a supplemental instruction biology session at Georgia State, student Makeda Phillips shared frustrations about a professor’s lecture.\n\n“He went through today so fast, I could not keep up,” she said.\n\n“My head was spinning,” another student chimed in.\n\nMentor Maya Earl, who had done well in the class the previous year, knew what they were talking about because she was sitting in the lecture that day, too, as part of her job.\n\nEarl helped her fellow students break down the biological processes into mnemonics that would help them remember.\n\nSoon they were slapping high-fives.\n\nStart college in summer\n\nBetter advising and scheduled sessions of group tutoring are only part of Georgia State’s solution.\n\nThere’s also summer school. But it’s not make-up work. It’s an early start to freshman year.\n\nIncoming freshmen with borderline grades get a college acceptance letter that says if they want to attend Georgia State, they must start classes in June — not August.\n\nThose classes — seven credit hours of coursework toward a degree — are part of what’s known as the Summer Success Academy.\n\nStudents also learn how to study, how to manage money and how to work effectively with tutors and advisers. Their dorms become “freshman learning communities” where they are matched with peer mentors and live with students who have similar academic interests.\n\nThe program works.\n\nBefore, only half the students in the bottom 10% of the freshman class came back the next year. Four years after the Summer Success Academy started, 90% of students with that same academic profile returned.\n\nThe few who don’t succeed are told that although they are still Georgia State students, in the fall they must attend the community college that merged with Georgia State last year.\n\nIt’s a similar concept to the upcoming merger of the UW System’s two-year campuses with its four-year ones.\n\n'I'm glad it happened'\n\nFortune Onwuzuruike, who grew up in Marietta, was not thrilled to get an acceptance letter telling him to show up for his freshman year at Georgia State three months early.\n\n“It felt like such a bad idea. I had just graduated from high school, and three weeks later, I’m back at it,” he recalled.\n\n“My parents said, ‘It’s a head start; jump in there and get it done.’ ”\n\nSo he did. He was in summer classes with 25 to 50 students instead of 200. He had one-on-one time with professors. He learned where to go if he had questions. His peer mentor was a Georgia State homecoming prince — someone who linked him with student organizations, including student government, where he excelled.\n\nOnwuzuruike was elected president of student government his senior year, graduating with a 3.69 GPA and a bachelor’s degree in health informatics.\n\nHe is now pursuing a master’s degree and working as an associate application analyst for Wellstar, the largest not-for-profit healthcare system in Georgia.\n\n“It turned out to be a great opportunity,” Onwuzuruike said. “I left Summer Success with a 4.0 GPA, a head start with seven college credits and a goal to earn as many As as possible. I’m glad it happened the way it did.”\n\nThe difference was people\n\nMulvenna is well on his way to succeeding in the work world since graduating last May.\n\nHe was promoted by his college employer, Intercontinental Hotels Group, to project manager for language efforts to give all guests the best experience, regardless of the language they speak.\n\nHe knows what made the difference for him at Georgia State.\n\n\"The difference was the people I met,\" he said.\n\nMulvenna met his best friend his first day of a Freshman Learning Community class. He also had strong mentors: an adviser who, among other things, helped him figure out scholarships so he could study abroad.\n\nHe also had his adviser for a student goodwill ambassador program established by the university president; and a professor who helped him gain experience in international business before he graduated.\n\n\"I never had a shortage of people,\" Mulvenna said. \"That really confirmed the importance of relationships.\"\n\nRead more of this special report at jsonline.com/education.\n\nThis story was done in partnership with the Solutions Journalism Network, www.solutionsjournalism.org.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/middle-east/953704/lebanon-one-year-on-beirut-explosion", "title": "'No truth, no justice': Lebanon one year on from the Beirut blast | The ...", "text": "A year ago today, Beirut was rocked by a catastrophic explosion that would claim the lives of at least 215 people, injure more than 7,500 and leave hundreds of thousands homeless and displaced.\n\nTwelve months on, “ground zero of Lebanon’s apocalypse” is haunted by the “stench of dead rats” that “seeps from hulking piles of rotting grain”, says The Guardian’s Middle East editor Martin Chulov. “Broken silos teeter above, their sides ripped apart by the catastrophic blast that also broke the soul of Beirut.”\n\nThe explosion in the city – which has rebuilt itself after so many crises, from its emergence out of French colonial rule in the early 1940s to the 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 – served to “shatter a city that was already at a tipping point”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

While “rebuilding is something the Lebanese are good at… this time is different”.\n\n“The port explosion and financial crisis were not chance events”, she adds. “They were catastrophes caused by decades of government incompetence and corruption.”\n\nAdding to the widespread sense of betrayal is the “fact that thousands of the estimated 77,000 residences damaged or destroyed in the explosion have yet to be fully rebuilt”, The Independent’s Trew says.\n\n“The waterfront closest to the port, once an impressive skyline of apartment blocks, businesses and bars, is still a jagged-tooth wasteland”, while “families have begun looking outside for help, urging the international community not to intervene but to cut diplomatic ties with those implicated in the explosion”.\n\nThat diplomatic help has so far not arrived, with Al Jazeera reporting that the position of the international community remains that the country’s leaders are “to blame for the political and economic crisis”, meaning reform must come before a bailout.\n\n“We have no truth, no justice, no one has been held accountable. And we have no space to grieve,” says Paul Naggear, whose three-year-old daughter Alexandra was one of the youngest victims of the blast.\n\n“Even the same day of the funeral when she was buried, my wife and I knew we needed to fight, we needed to be vocal,” he told The Independent. “It is criminal to ask the same people that killed us…to form a government and to rule us again. This is intolerable.”\n\n‘Dysfunction of a state’\n\nIf little has changed in the notoriously divided political culture of Lebanon’s ruling elite, the blast has served to drive its residents “from street protests to political action”, says France 24.\n\nWithin days of the blast, “a tent city – dubbed ‘the Basecamp’ – had sprung up” to aid the victims, “comprised of NGOs and volunteer groups offering a range of emergency services in the absence of a comprehensive state response”.\n\nMuch of the response was organised by lawyer Hussein El Achi, who was “convinced him to join the fight for change from the inside” following his growing frustration with “interference in the investigation” and “Lebanon’s sectarian kleptocracy”, the broadcast adds.\n\nEl Achi is not alone, with protests breaking out that saw demonstrators “blocking major roads and clashing with security forces in Beirut” after “a months-long effort to form a new government by the prime minister-designate” failed, Sky News reports. The formation of a new government is a precursor to any reform that would unlock aid.\n\n“Instead of giving birth to an era of redemption, the explosion has come to define the utter dysfunction of a state that has failed for all intents and purposes”, says The Guardian’s Chulov. The political class remains “unable to form a government” and is instead “bickering over the allocation of ministries as prizes to bolster their fiefdoms”.\n\nLast week, Lebanon named its richest man, Najib Mikati, a two-time prime minister and resident of its poorest city, Tripoli, as its designated leader. He will now be tasked with forming a government where his predecessor Saad Hariri, another former leader, failed.\n\nBut as the “sheer scale of Lebanon’s meltdown continues to be absorbed by its people”, others “are starting to confront an unpalatable view that the state’s very foundations were flawed at each of its incarnations”, Chulov adds.\n\n“If now isn’t the moment to change, then when is?”, asks Yarr Hadid, a 24-year-old student with plans to leave the country. “Are we to accept that this is how it is in Lebanon?”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Peter Weber", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/europe/france-presidential-election-explainer-intl/index.html", "title": "France's presidential election race is tighter than expected. Here's ...", "text": "Paris CNN —\n\nAt the start of 2022, France’s upcoming presidential election looked set to be one of the country’s most watched political races in decades.\n\nAn incumbent president standing for election for only the second time in his life; a candidate twice convicted of inciting racist and religious hatred polling in second place; another hard-right stalwart in third and the long-dominant left of French politics in disarray.\n\nThen Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nWith Europe’s eyes fixed firmly on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s bloody war, priorities have quickly shifted: Ammunition stockpiles, high stakes diplomacy and even the threat of a nuclear strike have all entered the national debate.\n\nCampaigning has been disrupted by the crisis, and several key candidates have had to backtrack on their past support for Putin.\n\nBurnished by his experience on the world stage, most polling suggests that incumbent President Emmanuel Macron is likely to come out on top.\n\nBut with just days to go before the election, his closest rival Marine Le Pen is rising in the polls, suggesting the vote could be more tightly fought than the last time the pair went head-to-head in 2017.\n\nFrance hasn’t reelected a sitting president for 20 years, diplomacy has trumped campaigning in the president’s agenda and with the conflict fueling a cost of living crisis, French voters aren’t facing the election many expected.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWhen is the election, and how does it work?\n\nTo elect their new president, French voters will likely head to the polls twice.\n\nThe first vote, on Sunday April 10, sets 12 candidates against each other. These candidates qualified for the race by securing endorsements from 500 mayors and/or local councilors from across the country.\n\nIf no candidate wins 50% of votes in the first round, the two contenders with the most votes will proceed to a run-off two weeks later, on Sunday April 24.\n\nOf the 12 candidates in the race, IFOP polling suggests that only five have ever garnered more than 10% of voters’ support. A second round of voting is almost guaranteed.\n\nThis also isn’t the only national vote France faces this year – parliamentary elections will take place in June.\n\nWho’s in the race?\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron speaks to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at a December 2019 summit. Macron took a leading role in trying to avert war in Ukraine. Christophe Morin/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe incumbent\n\nFirst-term President Emmanuel Macron has only ever stood in one election – his successful 2017 presidential run – and has had a mixed record coming into 2022. Considering that no sitting French president has won re-election since Jacques Chirac in 2002, his is a tough spot to be in, though he is the favorite.\n\nAn ex-investment banker and alumnus of some of France’s most elite schools, Macron stirred up nationwide anger with a diesel tax early in his presidency, setting off the yellow vests movement – one of the most prolonged protests the country has seen for decades.\n\n“The popularity rating today is important,” political commentator Jean-Michel Aphatie told CNN. “The level of hatred towards Emmanuel Macron is considerable and shared.”\n\nInternationally, his attempts to win over Donald Trump, prevent the AUKUS submarine deal and his unsuccessful diplomatic efforts to avert war in Ukraine were arguably failures. But Macron’s full-throated backing of an ambitious and autonomous European Union has won him respect abroad and established his geopolitical credentials at home.\n\nThe most unexpected challenge of his presidency – Covid-19 – has perhaps defined his time in office. More than two years of lockdowns and mask mandates, a fumbled EU vaccine rollout and the bold move to effectively force French people to get vaccinated have fired up vocal opposition, even as most of the country learned to live with the realities of the virus and a quiet majority supported the measures.\n\nMacron has refused to debate his opponents and has hardly campaigned himself. While his pole position in the race has never really been under threat, experts believe his strategy has been to avoid the political mudslinging as long as possible in order to brandish his image as the most presidential of all the candidates.\n\nBut a week out from the first vote, Macron urged his supporters to guard against complacency. “Anything is possible,” he told them, warning of the possibility of a Brexit-style upset in the election.\n\nMarine Le Pen speaks at a campaign event in Reims, France, on February 5. Benjamin Girette/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe challenger\n\n“French electoral logic means that in the second round, you have to be the least hated of the two remaining candidates,” Etienne Girard, editor of L’Express magazine, told CNN.\n\nWhile France’s first round sees ballots cast across the political spectrum, in the second round many vote to keep a candidate out of office as much as to elect their opponent.\n\nThat’s been a problem for Marine Le Pen, who has been synonymous with the French far-right for much of the past decade.\n\nNow an MP in the Calais region – the gateway to the UK that has struggled to deal with migrants heading to Britain – the anti-immigrant Le Pen faced off against Macron in 2017, but lost by a sizeable margin.\n\nHer father, fellow far-right firebrand Jean-Marie Le Pen, also lost in the second round – in his case to Chirac in 2002.\n\nMarine Le Pen’s strategy for this election was originally one of winning mainstream support – “a strategy of respectability,” as Girard describes it.\n\nWhile still strongly anti-immigrant, the softening of her tone around flagship topics like Islam and euroskepticism – especially since Brexit – has been widely touted as an effort to win over voters outside her far-right base. Even so, “stopping uncontrolled immigration” and “eradicating Islamist ideologies” are her manifesto’s top two priorities.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets Marine Le Pen at the Kremlin in Moscow on March 24, 2017. MIKHAIL KLIMENTYEV/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA fan of Vladimir Putin – a photo of her visiting the Russian president featured on a since-scrapped campaign leaflet – the war in Ukraine has brought up uncomfortable questions for Le Pen.\n\nBut in the campaign’s final weeks, she’s put the cost of living front and center of her platform, promising measures that she claims will put “150 to 200 euros” back in the pockets of each household, including a pledge to lift sales tax on 100 household goods.\n\nLe Pen is known for capturing hard-to-reach voters, according to pollster Emmanuel Riviere. “She always manages to seduce people who are not interested in politics at all, precisely because she offers them a solution to express their anger towards politics,” he told CNN.\n\nLe Pen is currently polling far higher than she did at the 2017 election. Days out from the first round, IFOP polling suggests she may win 47% of votes in a second round runoff against Macron.\n\nFar-right candidate Eric Zemmour gives a speech to activists at a campaign rally in Lille, northern France, on February 5. Samuel Boivin/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nNew extremes\n\nThe new kid on the block, far-right TV pundit and author Eric Zemmour had long been touted as a possible presidential contender. Known for his uncompromising stances on Islam, children with non-French names and immigration, he has twice been convicted for inciting racial or religious hatred.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, he has doubled down on his race-driven rhetoric, touting the racist “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory in his speeches and promising a “ministry for re-immigration” to deport as many as 1 million people of North African descent from France. The theory contends that immigrants want to “replace” the native-born French population.\n\nZemmour enjoyed a seat among the top three candidates until March, according to IFOP polling, challenging the Le Pen family’s dominance of the political far-right.\n\nHe openly cites Islam as a danger menacing France and has attracted a more educated and affluent demographic to the political extreme, according to Riviere. Well-read and a talented orator, his appeal to “save our homeland, our civilization, our culture” has struck a chord with some.\n\n“People, when they sit in front of their TVs and listen to him, they feel like they’re being elevated. And that, in France, is something that is expected enormously from a political leader,” said Girard, who has also written a biography of Zemmour.\n\nUltimately, though, he is treading on the toes of Le Pen.\n\n“They are really in direct competition with each other because their confrontation can make them lose big to one or the other,” Riviere said.\n\nZemmour – who in 2018 proudly confessed to “dreaming” of a French Putin – has seen his popularity wane since the war in Ukraine began.\n\nZemmour was publicly convinced that Putin would never invade, then continued to defend him even after he did. Zemmour has since condemned the invasion – something of a U-turn in his support for the Russian president.\n\nFar-left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon is currently polling in third place ahead of Sunday's first round presidential election. Patrick Batard/Abaca/Sipa/AP\n\nOutside chances\n\nIn Jean-Luc Melenchon, the French far-left has its firebrand politician too. The leader of the “France Unbowed” party, veteran activist and politician Melenchon has stood in three presidential contests so far.\n\nAmong his flagship policies are a “fiscal revolution,” a radical rethinking of French governance towards more direct involvement of the electorate and a 1 billion-euro plan to combat violence against women – a hot-button issue in France.\n\nBut devoid of a unifying candidate, the French left seems to have little chance of challenging for a second-round place. Melenchon has a loyal base among voters from the far-left but he’s struggled to win over more centrist voters.\n\nBoth Anne Hidalgo, Mayor of Paris and the left-wing Socialist Party’s presidential candidate, and Valerie Pecresse, of the right-wing Republicans party, have struggled to make headway in the polls – a damning indictment of the French political mainstream. Their parties suffered from the creation of Macron’s centrist “La Republique En Marche” party in 2016, and have yet to recover.\n\nBut while Macron may be in the lead as French voters prepare to go to the polls, April may yet have surprises in store.\n\n“In this country, anything is possible. We’ve seen the impossible come true in other countries,” political commentator Aphatie said. “Donald Trump elected? Never.”\n\nWhat do the polls say?\n\nIncumbent Macron is out in front, according to polling from IFOP, which suggests his levels of support haven’t dropped below 24% since January, and rose to a high of 31% in the first weeks of the war in Ukraine.\n\nSimilarly, Marine Le Pen has held on to second place for almost all of the past three months – hitting a high of 21% at the end of March – according to IFOP.\n\nAll of which would seem to set up a rerun of the 2017 second round. But while Macron walked away with almost two-thirds of the votes last time around, IFOP polling suggests that this year a Macron-Le Pen faceoff could result in the incumbent taking 53% of the vote to 47% for Le Pen, a much less comfortable margin of victory for Macron.\n\nWhat are the biggest issues for French voters?\n\nThe cost of living is among the top issues for the French electorate this year. Faced with the economic fallout of the pandemic, high energy prices and the war in Ukraine, voters are feeling the pinch, despite generous government support.\n\nWhile financial pressures may not be enough to whitewash some candidates’ extremism in voters’ minds, they may push some to look for unorthodox answers to their problems.\n\nPublic servants prepare election materials to be mailed to voters, less than a week out from the first round of France's presidential vote. Loic Venance/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe fighting in Ukraine is a long way from the bistros and cafes of France, but the conflict is certainly on voters’ minds. Just shy of 90% of French people were worried about the war in the last week of March, according to IFOP. Given the challengers’ patchy record on standing up to Putin, this is likely to play in Macron’s favor.\n\nNotably absent from the debate has been the environmental crisis. Although the importance of climate protections is gaining traction globally, France sourced 75% of its electricity needs in 2020 from nuclear energy, according to the French environment ministry. With most candidates backing the kind of nuclear development that Macron has already announced, there is little divergence on this issue.\n\nFor all the fanfare that this election once promised, with a war on the European Union’s border and many voters struggling to pay their bills, France’s choice may now rest more on the next five months than the next five years.", "authors": ["Joseph Ataman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/04/16/stay-home-order-protested-sailors-sickened-pork-producers-test-positive-news-around-states/111556232/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Montgomery Public Schools has deployed school buses to provide Wi-Fi hot spots to students in need of internet access. The district said six buses would be parked across town, allowing students to get connected while learning remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic, news outlets reported. Most of the buses were expected to be available in various locations from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., Monday through Friday. The district said it had 11 buses capable of providing Wi-Fi. About 50 students within 100 feet of the bus will be able to connect to the hot spot at the same time, MPS Communication Director Jade Jones told the Montgomery Advertiser. The school bus hot spots were made possible through a partnership between the school district, the city of Montgomery and TechMGM, a cyber initiative, WSFA-TV reported.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has opened the state’s sport fishing season while reminding participants to adhere to health restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Sport and personal-use fishing will remain open during the 2020 season “subject to compliance with health mandates,” the department commissioner’s office said in a letter Monday. Subsistence fishing remains open and unrestricted. A March 27 travel ban between communities issued by Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy does not include Alaska residents traveling to “fishing locations,” the fish and game department said. Residents traveling to participate in sport or personal-use fisheries outside their own communities were asked to follow guidelines including remaining close to home, researching and abiding by local mandates and buying food, drinks and fuel before leaving their communities. The department also requested that anglers practice social distancing and use face coverings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The Navajo Nation has announced plans to continue its weekend overnight curfew through the first weekend in May to fight the spread of the new coronavirus. Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez announced the plan Tuesday after reservation officials first implemented the 8 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday curfew Easter weekend, The Arizona Republic reported. “The 57-hour weekend curfew was effective in reducing the numbers of people that went into the public,” Nez said, adding that officials are “developing a new order to implement similar curfews for the next three weekends for the entire Navajo Nation.” The order is expected to be finalized in the coming days, Navajo Nation spokesperson Jared Touchin said. The Navajo Police Department enforced the curfew by setting up checkpoints in multiple communities and issuing more than 170 citations to violators, which could include a fine up to $1,000 and 30 days in jail. The Navajo Nation also has a nighttime curfew requiring residents to stay home between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. every day. Essential employees with official identification and people with emergencies are exempt from the restrictions.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge on Tuesday blocked Arkansas’ order preventing the state’s only surgical abortion clinic from performing the procedure during the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker granted the temporary restraining order that Little Rock Family Planning requested against the state. Arkansas had ordered the facility to halt surgical abortions unless they’re needed to protect the life or health of the mother. The state accused the clinic of violating its order preventing elective surgeries that could be safely postponed. Other states have used similar orders to restrict abortions during the public health crisis. The clinic said 20 patients, who were not candidates for abortion-inducing medication, were scheduled for surgical abortions this week. The attorney general’s office said it would take “immediate steps” to have the ruling reversed.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The Navy has removed 116 medical staff members from its hospital ship docked off Los Angeles after seven people tested positive for COVID-19, an official said. The personnel from the USNS Mercy were taken to a nearby base and remain under quarantine. None so far has needed hospitalization, said Lt. Rochelle Rieger of the 3rd Fleet. Rieger initially said 126 medical crew members were taken off the ship but corrected the number to 116. It’s unclear where or how the sailors became infected, Rieger said. The ship left San Diego on March 23 when all were screened before they boarded, Rieger said. It arrived at the Port of Los Angeles four days later to provide relief to the city amid the pandemic by accepting patients from hospitals who were not infected with the virus. None of the more than 1,000 personnel aboard was allowed to leave the ship once it departed San Diego. So far the ship, with 1,000 beds, has taken in only 20 patients from hospitals and none has tested positive for the coronavirus or showed any symptoms of the illness, Rieger said. Two medical personnel from the ship who tested positive came in close contact with a small number of the patients but they were wearing full protective gear, including gloves, N95 masks and eye goggles. The removal of the 116 crew members will not affect the ship’s ability to treat patients, Rieger said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Vice President Mike Pence will travel to the Air Force Academy for its pared down commencement ceremony Saturday to address graduating cadets in person, and not by video as originally planned. Pence’s office announced his travel plans Tuesday and said additional details would be released at a later time. The event usually attracts a large crowd to Falcon Stadium and ends with a traditional aerobatics demonstration by the Air Force Thunderbirds. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, the academy is closed to visitors and no spectators, including family, will be allowed at this year’s ceremony, which will only last about 30 minutes. The Thunderbirds will only perform a flyover. Cadets will march 6 feet apart and sit 8 feet apart during the event. Cadets will not march up to receive their diplomas and the typical high-fives and hugs are banned, The Gazette reported.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: The state has hit the pause button on setting up new hospital beds to care for any overflow patients during an expected surge in COVID-19 patients. More than 1,800 extra beds are in place at sites such as UConn Health, the Connecticut Convention Center and Western Connecticut and Southern Connecticut State universities. Josh Geballe, Gov. Ned Lamont’s chief operating officer, said Tuesday the state is cautiously optimistic it will need fewer than the 12,000 beds originally projected for coronavirus patients during the surge, which is expected to hit later this month. About 56% of the state’s 1,500 or so critical-care ventilators are in use, Geballe said, and an additional 300 are on the way. The state’s surgical mask supply also is in good shape, especially because a new disinfecting machine should be in place by the weekend, he said. That machine can clean about 80,000 N95 masks each day, and those masks can go through the process up to 20 times, he said. The state has received some shipments of protective equipment in recent days and is waiting for more to arrive, Lamont said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The state’s court buildings will remain closed for at least another month. The News Journal of Wilmington reported that the state’s top judge announced the extension on Tuesday. Delaware Chief Justice Collins J. Seitz Jr. said that people are supposed to be at home and not coming and going from courthouses. Delaware suspended all pending trials a month ago because they often require juries and involve numerous court staff. Courthouses often see hundreds of people flow through them each day. But they are now reduced to a skeleton staff. Courts have been holding hearings in criminal cases over video and telephone. Routine civil court actions are also being done remotely. Bail motions and probation violation hearings have also been able to continue remotely.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser extended the District’s public health emergency until May 15, WUSA-TV reported. Stay-at-home orders will remain in effect for at least another month. It also means everything from schools to bars and restaurants will remain closed. “We’ll need until at least May 15 to help flatten the curve,” Bowser said. She also gave additional guidance for wearing masks in the District, saying masks are required in grocery stores, hotels, taxis, ride-shares and other private transportation, and strongly encouraged for workers and riders of public transit.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:The state’s teachers union called on Gov. Ron DeSantis to keep campuses closed through the end of the school year, saying the coronavirus outbreak “presents a threat we cannot control.” Fedrick Ingram, president of the Florida Education Association, said in a letter to the governor that teachers have “risen to the challenge” of conducting their classes online since campuses closed last month and there is no reason to reopen them until the virus is under control. DeSantis suggested last week that he was considering reopening schools next month because children have little risk of dying from the disease, drawing criticism that such a move would endanger staff members and parents who are older or have health problems. Florida has more than 4,500 public schools serving 2.7 million children. They employ 180,000 teachers. DeSantis said at a Tuesday news conference that he is not going to reopen the schools until it can be done safely and any decision will be done in consultation with superintendents and parents. He said schools will be discussed by a task force on reopening the state that he intends to appoint this week.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp declared a pandemic exemption from a 1951 state law that prohibits wearing masks in public after some black officials warned that some African Americans, fearing harassment by police, might not cover their faces for protection. The anti-mask law makes it a misdemeanor to wear “a mask, hood” or other face covering to “conceal the identity of the wearer” on public property. Georgia passed the law to prevent Ku Klux Klan members from wearing hoods during public rallies and marches. With the federal Centers for Disease Control now encouraging Americans to wear masks that cover the mouth and nose in public, Kemp signed an order Monday that said the anti-mask law can’t be enforced against people covering their faces as protection against the virus. Kemp told a news conference he wanted to ensure that “people can follow the guidance of public health officials without fear of prosecution” amid the global pandemic. Kemp thanked Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms for raising concerns about the anti-mask law. Last week, Bottoms ordered Atlanta police to suspend enforcement of the law\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A state program providing free hotel rooms to health workers responding to the coronavirus crisis has been modified after the demand exceeded the number of available rooms. More than 870 room nights have been reserved through the Hotels for Heroes program, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday. The overwhelming demand forced organizers to make changes including limiting workers to seven-day reservations. Hotels for Heroes was established to use extra hotel rooms while helping financially support the visitor industry and the community. Hotels on Kauai, Maui, Hawaii island and Oahu with approved reservations are compensated $85 per room per per night from state tourism funds. The program was developed by the Hawaii Tourism Authority, the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau and the Hawaii Lodging & Tourism Association. The program does not accept health workers who have tested positive for COVID-19 or who have been required to quarantine. Honolulu Fire Department Battalion Chief Kevin Mokulehua said the program will help about 1,000 active department workers.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao said the Federal Aviation Administration will distribute about $44 million in airport aid to 36 Idaho airports to help the facilities respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The money is from the $2.2 trillion rescue package passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump last month. The airport funding is aimed at replacing revenue lost from the severe decline in passenger traffic and other airport business because of the coronavirus. The money can be used for airport capital expenditures, airport operating expenses such as payroll and utilities, and airport debt payments. The Boise Airport in southwestern Idaho is receiving just under $19 million, and the Idaho Falls Regional Airport in eastern Idaho will get about $2.3 million.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Dozens of immigrant children in U.S. custody and living in three Chicago-area shelters have tested positive for COVID-19, officials said. The Chicago-based Heartland Alliance operates shelters where children in the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement’s custody wait to be released to a relative or legal guardian. By Tuesday, 37 of 69 minors tested positive, according to a statement. Heartland officials called their prognosis “very good,” but declined to offer specifics on their medical treatment. The Office of Refugee Resettlement, tasked with the custody and care of immigrant children caught traveling alone across the U.S.-Mexico border, said Tuesday that 21 children in Illinois and Texas shelters are COVID-19-positive and six others recovered. None required hospitalization. They couldn’t immediately explain the discrepancy with Heartland’s data, saying they were still compiling figures. Federal officials have suspended placing children in states including New York and Washington over concerns with the outbreak. Officials with Heartland, which stopped taking new children last month, tested all children, added nurse practitioners and staff members are taking precautions like wearing gloves and masks.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:Democrats said they will hold the June 13 state convention virtually over concerns for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The convention had been expected to draw hundreds of party insiders and candidates to the Indiana Convention Center. At the event, state delegates select nominees for lieutenant governor, attorney general and national delegates to the Democratic National Convention, which has been pushed about a month to Aug. 17. Democratic Party Chairman John Zody said that all state delegates will be mailed ballots. The party is looking into online voting options. He said party officials still are working through details of how the process and timeline will work and it’s possible voting won’t be complete until after the convention. “We’re excited to hold the 2020 State Convention virtually and we’re confident we’ve found the safest way to bring Hoosier Democrats from around the state together,” he said. “There’s just too much at stake in 2020 to not adapt to maintain a critical element of the electoral process.”\n\nIowa\n\nColumbus Junction:Soaring numbers of workers at a Columbus Junction pork-processing plant who have been sickened by COVID-19 have sparked fears not only for the employees’ health but also for the vitality of this small town and the continuity of the nation’s meat supply. Officials from Tyson Foods have closed the Louisa County plant amid one of the state’s largest outbreaks of COVID-19: 186 employees have tested positive for the illness. The facility is one of the nation’s major pork processing plants and the rural community’s largest employer. The Columbus Junction plant is one of several meatpacking facilities across the state and the nation where business has been suspended after they were hard hit by the virus. In Tama County, where 108 positive COVID tests and three deaths have been reported, National Beef suspended production at the Iowa Premium beef plant after an outbreak. Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork processor, shut its Sioux Falls, South Dakota, plant over the weekend as the coronavirus spread among workers. Meat processing plants from Colorado to Canada have similarly suspended production after the virus spread. Tyson Foods officials said Tuesday that the company would keep its Columbus Junction plant, which typically has about 1,400 employees, shuttered. The plant, said to be responsible for 2% of the country’s total slaughtering capacity, has been closed since April 6. The company is diverting livestock originally scheduled for delivery at Columbus Junction to its other plants, when possible.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Amid a surge of complaints from out-of-work Kansans, state officials are making another effort to fix the state’s faltering system for filing unemployment claims as the coronavirus outbreak wreaks havoc on the economy. The Kansas Department of Labor said in a tweet that tech workers were taking the agency’s website down for an hour each at noon and at 7 p.m. Tuesday. Gov. Laura Kelly said Monday that the department has received more than 130,000 initial unemployment claims over the past three weeks. She said that initial claims are up by 3,400% for the year. But even those numbers don’t capture the full extent of job losses in the state, in part because a 43-year-old mainframe computer cannot keep up. Kelly said the system was the victim of of “decades of neglect” and already was scheduled for an upgrade. A team of dozens of experts worked over the weekend on a solution. “But it’s sort of like repairing a plane in the air,” Kelly said. Republican state Senate President Susan Wagle took the administration to task over the problems, saying people are complaining to her that passwords aren’t working, they aren’t getting money despite filing claims weeks ago and are facing other problems.\n\nKentucky\n\nMadisonville: Those over age 60 might be more vulnerable to the coronavirus, but a 103-year-old Kentucky woman fought it and won. Virginia Harris, who lives in Hopkins County, was diagnosed with the virus in March after an aggressive fever and nausea, her family told WFIE-TV. Because she didn’t have respiratory issues, her family didn’t think it was coronavirus, but she was tested anyway. “We got the results back about five days later, and they were positive. We were very very distraught, upset,” grandson Adam Harris said. Her symptoms included a high fever and low blood pressure. “I was so sick, I thought I was going to die. But the good Lord took care of me, everybody was praying for me, and it just wasn’t my time,” Harris said. Her daughter-in-law, Jayne Harris, said one of the worst things was not being able to be with her as she fought the virus. “It’s just heart-wrenching to know she was going to be in there and do this on her own,” she said. Family members said they hope Virginia Harris’ story will give hope to others sickened in the pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards said he intends to keep K-12 public schools shuttered through the remainder of the academic year because of the coronavirus crisis, but few details have been provided about how districts should judge student performance with classrooms closed for two months of the school year. Edwards’ closure of public schools was set to expire this month, but he said he will sign an order this week to continue the closure for the rest of the school year, which lasts until late May. The decision will have Louisiana’s 700,000 public school students out of their classrooms for two months of the school year. “School isn’t canceled. They just won’t be going to their campuses,” Edwards said. He said gathering students into packed classrooms isn’t safe because of the virus outbreak, with Louisiana among the hardest-hit states. The state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, school superintendents and school board leaders urged Edwards to keep schools closed. Local school districts have been using distance learning – and at least half are using some form of online teaching – to keep lessons going since schools closed in mid-March, according to the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Even though many workplaces are empty, the state workers’ compensation system expects an increase in claims related to the coronavirus crisis. The system already is receiving claims from dozens of health care workers exposed to the virus, and more claims are expected in the coming weeks for injuries suffered at home by Mainers who are working remotely, the Portland Press Herald reported. “Spare bedrooms, basements and kitchen counters are newly transformed into eight-hour work spaces that often are not appropriately engineered for comfort or safety,” said Tony Payne, spokesman for MEMIC, the Portland-based workers’ compensation insurer. At least 208 Maine workers had filed notifications by Monday of workplace exposure to coronavirus since mid-February, when the system began coding reports to track COVID-19, said John Rohde, executive director of the Maine Workers’ Compensation Board. Mainers who contract the virus on the job will be eligible for worker’s compensation benefits, while those who are quarantined and do not test positive will not, officials said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore:Goldman Sachs is partnering with the city and Lendistry to steer $10million in capital from the federal Paycheck Protection Program to help entrepreneurs through the COVID-19 pandemic, The Daily Record reported. Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young along with Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Lendistry CEO Everett Sands joined Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on the announcement call. Lendistry was founded in 2014, according to the firm’s website, with the goal of using the latest financial tech to provide loans to disadvantaged small businesses. The firm intended to make “a big splash in Baltimore this year,” Sands said. As a result of the crisis, the lender is now focused on getting federal stimulus dollars to businesses in need, he said, and that includes ventures not in Lendistry’s portfolio. Currently the lender is accepting loan applications for up to $250,000 from businesses in Maryland and five other states. In order to apply, businesses must provide 12 months of payroll, a first-quarter 2020 payroll summary, as well as tax, health care and retirement statements for 2020 and 2019. Under the Paycheck Protection Program businesses are allowed to borrow up to 2.5 times their precoronavirus payroll to cover eight-weeks of payroll, and 20% for expenses like rent and utilities. Those loans are eligible for forgiveness if a business keeps its workforce at its prepandemic level.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts budget watchers are predicting a steep drop in revenue in the face of the coronavirus economic shutdown. Democratic House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz said the House typically holds its budget debate in April, a timeline he said is no longer feasible. Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation President Eileen McAnneny said the state could see a decline of billions of dollars in revenue and massive layoffs as high as 570,000 that could push the unemployment rate to nearly 18%.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:Demonstrators drove thousands of vehicles – many draped with protest signs – to the state Capitol Wednesday, loudly protesting Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order intended to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Police watched as horns honked and commercial and private vehicles from across the state jammed Capitol Avenue and other streets surrounding Michigan’s seat of government. “Liberty once lost is lost forever,” read a sign draped across a commercial van. “Security without liberty is called prison,” read another, stretched across the Capitol’s front lawn. Lt. Darren Green of the Michigan State Police estimated several thousand cars were part of the demonstration, with 100 to 150 people on the Capitol lawn. Green said traffic was backed up for more than a mile around the Capitol in several directions. “They’re doing a pretty good job of maintaining social distance,” Green said. “They’re being respectful and not causing any issues at all.” Meshawn Maddock, a board member of the Michigan Conservative Coalition, the nonprofit group that organized the protest, said the demonstration should send a strong message to the governor that it is time to allow Michiganders to return to work, in cases where they can do so safely. Whitmer declared a state of emergency in Michigan on March 10 and announced a “stay-at-home” order March 23 that directed residents to stay inside, except for essential purposes, and told businesses deemed nonessential to stop calling employees in to work. Last week, she extended that order until May 1, while imposing tougher restrictions on nonessential travel and some retail outlets.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Businesses deemed nonessential during the coronavirus crisis have inundated Gov. Tim Walz’s administration with requests to open their doors again as a stay-at-home order continues. Walz recently extended that order until at least May 4, but said he and his administration would look at exemptions for more businesses over the coming weeks. State officials would come up with requirements for social distancing, hygiene and public health. An estimated 80% of Minnesota jobs are in essential fields that are still operating. And Walz has granted additional business exemptions such as lawn care. That exemption was crucial for Oak Marsh Golf Course, general manager Steve Whillock told the Star Tribune. Now he and other golf industry leaders are pressing the governor to open the courses to the public. The course had been operating safely with social distancing before Walz’s closure order, Whillock said. They had been sanitizing cart handles, allowing only a certain number of people in their pro shop and taking other steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A community used some creativity to celebrate a woman’s 100th birthday amid the ban on large gatherings during the coronavirus outbreak. Friends and families of Catherine Alderson were escorted by police cars and fire trucks as they celebrated a century of her life in a car parade Friday, the Oxford Eagle reported. Alderson was able to wave to cars while sitting in her driveway, wrapped in a shawl and surrounded by bubbles and pink balloons. The idea to bring the celebration to her home came from Alderson’s grandchildren, and was made possible by the police and fire departments in Oxford. Long distance family members and Alderson’s friends from church also joined the party. “She didn’t know why the Lord had left her here this long,” Peggy Leister, Alderson’s daughter, said. “I told her maybe it’s because she lived for Him and worked hard and tried to do what He asked her to do in the Bible.” Officials in Lafayette County have also been hosting other car parades for children who are missing birthday celebrations because of the outbreak. Deputies said 14 parades with fire trucks and blaring sirens were held in the county since their office announced it will be hosting the drive-by parties last week.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State data showed Missouri’s unemployment rate reached 4.5% in March, and that’s likely the tip of the iceberg in terms of the hit the coronavirus crisis has taken on jobs. Missouri unemployment was 3.5% in February. April unemployment data could reflect a much steeper increase in the state’s jobless rate. Gov. Mike Parson didn’t issue a statewide stay-at-home order until April 7, although many local governments had similar requirements in place by then. Unemployment claims shot up in response to the pandemic. Nearly 238,000 people filed new unemployment benefit claims in Missouri in the first three weeks after the coronavirus crisis began hitting the economy. That’s more than 1 in 12 eligible workers. Missouri’s Department of Labor and Industrial Relations on Wednesday urged self-employed and gig workers to also file for unemployment. Missouri’s unemployment program doesn’t cover those individuals, but they are eligible for $133 to $320 a week through a federal coronavirus aid program, according to the state labor department. The agency expects to start processing those claims as soon as next week.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State agencies and courts are taking adequate precautions to protect inmates from exposure to the new coronavirus, the Montana Supreme Court said in rejecting a petition by Disability Rights Montana seeking the appointment of a special master to reduce the number of people incarcerated. The justices said there was no evidence that the Department of Corrections, courts or jail officials have violated any clear legal duty to reduce inmate populations. Authorities have implemented appropriate measures for prisons and jails to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, including those issued by Chief Justice Mike McGrath, the unanimous opinion stated. On March 20, McGrath asked county and city court judges to “review your jail rosters and release, without bond, as many prisoners as you are able, especially those being held for nonviolent offenses” and to hear such motions on an expedited basis. Hours after Disability Rights Montana filed its petition on April 1, Gov. Steve Bullock issued a directive that suspended new transfers into Department of Corrections custody, called for screening anyone who arrives at a facility and restricts in-person visitation. If the department director does approve a transfer, he said, the inmate must be quarantined for 14 days at the new facility. Bullock also directed the Board of Pardons and Parole to consider early release for inmates who are 65 or older, have medical conditions that put them at higher risk, are pregnant or are nearing their release dates – if they are not a public safety risk. Many of those steps were already in place. Justices said they believe the governor’s directives and his reliance on guidance from the Centers of Disease Control best addresses the crisis.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state employees’ union will deliver more than 1,600 petitions to Gov. Pete Ricketts’ office demanding that he give all state workers the option to work from home if their jobs allow it. The petitions also called for an extra $2 an hour in “hazard pay” for those who have to work in person during the coronavirus pandemic. “State employees are concerned and they are anxious,”said Justin Hubly, executive director of the Nebraska Association of Public Employees. “We need the governor to take action to ensure their safety.” Hubly said the only safeguard in some state offices is a bottle of hand sanitizer. The union has also questioned why call-center employees aren’t allowed to do their jobs from home. Ricketts has said it isn’t possible for all state employees to work from home because the state still has to provide essential services. He has said employees with concerns about their work environment should talk to their managers.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Renown Regional Medical Center has increased its ability to cope with the spread of COVID-19 by about 173% by retrofitting the regional trauma center’s Mill Street parking structure into a three-story temporary facility designed to hold 1,400 coronavirus patients at peak capacity. Construction of the temporary facility was “herculean,” according to Renown CEO Tony Slonim, a roughly $11 million precautionary effort that will help the region’s health care system cope with an expected influx of coronavirus cases. Just one of the temporary facility’s two 700-bed floors nearly matches Renown’s normal 808-bed capacity. Rows of dozens of neatly bedded cots crosshatch the structure’s expansive interior underneath a ceiling lined with the buildout’s exposed HVAC and electrical guts. There are no privacy partitions between the beds, and ventilated Sani-huts serve as backups for a handful of plumbed toilets on each floor. A partitioned staff area splits each patient floor into two sides. That staff area is full of computer monitors and other medical equipment. The first and second floor are for patients, with 700 beds on each floor. The third floor is where the vehicle-sized HVAC units are housed along with a break area for staff.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A hearing has been scheduled for Friday in a lawsuit seeking to block Republican Gov. Chris Sununu from spending federal COVID-19 relief funds without lawmakers’ permission. Democratic leaders of the New Hampshire Legislature sued the governor this week arguing that only the legislative fiscal committee has the power to spend the $1.25 billion the state is expected to get. Sununu countered that state law grants him authority to take immediate action during a crisis, including creating the Governor’s Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery to disburse the money. Lawmakers will have input via an advisory panel, which met for a second time Wednesday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: March tax revenue was up 3.6% compared with 2019, but officials warned Wednesday that the economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis would have a significant effect on state finances next month and beyond. The state collected $1.88 billion in March, up $66.3 million over March 2019, the Treasury Department said in a statement. “Treasury is closely monitoring factors such as the closure of businesses across New Jersey, the sharp increase in unemployment insurance claims, and the decline in the stock markets, which are expected to have a significant impact on tax revenue collections in the coming month,” the department said in an emailed statement.The development came a day after Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, and the Democrat-led Legislature enacted a bill delaying the income tax filing deadline from Wednesday to July 15. The delay could hobble state revenue in the future, the department warned. The governor and lawmakers also agreed to postpone the end of the fiscal year from June 30 to Sept. 30.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Parents who want their children to have a special birthday party while still abiding by stay-at-home and social distancing measures can call the Las Cruces Fire Department to help out. “We will commit an engine to drive by their house with the lights on and then drive slowly through the neighborhood,” said Adrian Arias, deputy chief of administration for LCFD. Arias said fire department administration understands how challenging it can be for parents keeping children inside and away from others to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus. “We’re realizing kids are at home and they’re not having a birthday gathering like they usually do. We’re just asking the parents if they wish to request that they call us ahead of time,” he said. Arias said the birthday shout outs are for children between the ages of 4 and 12 and will be conducted between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. The fire department has done about eight “birthday shout outs” so far. “We’re calling them birthday shout outs, not necessarily parades, because we don’t want a line of vehicles driving around through neighborhoods even though traffic has slowed down quite a bit,” Arias said. “We’re trying to prevent large crowds from getting out of the house.” The fire department will cruise by “with a fire apparatus or one of our squad units, which looks very similar to an ambulance,” he said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said state residents will be required to wear face coverings when they are out and coming in close contact with other people. The new mandate will require a mask or face covering on busy streets, public transit or any situation where people cannot maintain 6 feet of social distancing. The executive order is similar to recommendations already in effect in New York City and will be in force Friday. “Stopping the spread is everything. How can you not wear a mask when you’re going to come close to a person?” Cuomo said at his daily briefing. “On what theory would you not do that?” The governor said there will initially be no civil penalties for noncompliance, but he’s urging merchants to enforce it among customers. Although hospitalizations from the outbreak are leveling off, state officials are trying to dramatically reduce transmission rates as the death toll rises. Cuomo’s announcement came hours after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called for stores to make customers wear face coverings in order to protect store workers against exposure.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: The city is moving to slash millions of dollars from its budget, with bus system upgrades, a city worker pay boost and renewable energy the likely financial victims of the coronavirus pandemic. Asheville is facing potential losses of more than $6 million in taxes and other revenue in the next two months and millions more in the next fiscal year, starting July 1, financial forecasters the told City Council. The pandemic’s economic downturn will hit the city in its current budget year and the next, which starts this summer. Most losses will come from decreases in expected sales taxes and parking fees, according to numbers presented by Assistant City Finance Director Tony McDowell. Even during the “depths of the Great Recession“ 10 years ago, the worst quarterly sales tax drop was 10%, McDowell said. “By comparison, the League of Municipalities is estimating right now that for the last quarter of this year we may see a 20% decline,” he said. The drop could be even worse, at 35%, according Buncombe County government budgeters.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Health officials announced the largest single-day increase in cases of the new coronavirus. The Department of Health said 24 cases were reported Wednesday, bringing the state total to 365. Officials said 401 people have been screened since Tuesday, bringing the total number tested in North Dakota to 11,317. They said 10,952 of those tests have come back negative. There have been nine deaths related to the coronavirus in the state, but none was reported Wednesday. Health officials said there were 36 coronavirus patients who were hospitalized Wednesday.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:A judge dropped a charge that a man who recorded a large gathering in a Cincinnati neighborhood violated Ohio’s coronavirus quarantining orders. Hamilton County Judge Alan Triggs on Wednesday dropped the charge at the prosecutor’s request, and allowed 26-year-old Rashaan Davis’ release from jail to house arrest pending grand jury action on a felony count of inciting violence, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported. Davis was jailed April 5. Grand jury proceedings have been suspended for safety during the pandemic.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The Oklahoma County jail has seen no cases of COVID-19 during the pandemic, officials told county commissioners on Wednesday, The Oklahoman reported. Cpt. Gene Bradley with the Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office said the jail’s quarantine measures, which include putting each new inmate into isolation for 10 days while monitoring their temperature and symptoms, has contributed to the success. Bradley said there had been five suspected cases, but that they did not amount to anything. This success separates the county jail from state correctional facilities, where at least one inmate and five staffers have tested positive for COVID-19. The largest issue for the jail has been personal protective equipment, but multiple organizations and individuals have donated masks and other equipment. Jail staff should be covered for up to the next 60 days, Bradley said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Liquor Control Commission has suspended the license of a southern Oregon bar that officials said violated restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Cave Junction’s Sportsman Tavern is the first case in which an Oregon establishment’s license has been suspended for allegedly defying an executive order that bans on-premise food or drink consumption, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Business owner Kim Sanders told the Associated Press that the bar has not been open and that he was not trying to violate the order. The suspension happened Friday after an Oregon Liquor Control Commission inspector on Thursday checked out a citizen tip, agency spokesperson Mark Pettinger said. The inspector discreetly parked and observed people going in and out of the building, Pettinger said. The inspector went inside, Pettinger said, and there were drinks at the bar. The suspension is in effect indefinitely and can be challenged by the licensee. Sanders said that the bar has been closed since mid-March and that his employees were there cleaning, painting and generally revamping it while maintaining social distancing standards. The Oregon Liquor Control Commission is also investigating other alleged violations of Gov. Kate Brown’s executive order, Pettinger said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said it’s easing up on tax enforcement during the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Revenue said it will pause payments on existing payment plans on request; offer flexible terms for new payment plans; suspend or reduce automatic enforcement of liens, wage garnishments and use of private collection agencies; and take other steps to offer relief to individual and business taxpayers. The measures will last through at least July 15, the agency said Wednesday. The Department of Revenue previously extended the deadline for taxpayers to file their 2019 Pennsylvania personal income tax returns from April 15 to July 15.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city and its firefighters’ union have collaborated to buy 34,000 N95 face masks for first responders and front-line city staff dealing directly with the public to protect them from exposure to the new coronavirus. About 8,000 masks have been distributed, and others are on the way, according to the office of Mayor Jorge Elorza. “We have closely been monitoring our staff needs during this time and I am glad that we are able to provide these critical employees with the tools necessary to protect themselves and others during this time,” Elorza said. Firefighters are already required to wear masks and gloves when responding to calls.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is still a few weeks away from a likely peak of coronavirus cases, but leaders at the state’s comprehensive teaching hospital said it’s time to plan for how to restart parts of society that have been shut down. The Medical University of South Carolina said their modeling shows they have enough beds to handle the peak in COVID-19 cases, now expected to hit around April 30. With the immediate crisis appearing under control, the hospital is turning toward what it can do to help get the economy and social life back on track without having another spike in cases that could lead to another massive shut down, MUSC President Dr. David Cole said Wednesday. Health officials said they’re still waiting for must-have developments, including a widely available COVID-19 test that can deliver results within a hour; a test that can determine if someone had the coronavirus and is now immune; a robust network of investigators to track down and quarantine anyone who has been in close contact with someone who just tested positive; and a plan to protect the most vulnerable, such as the elderly and people with compromised immune systems, Cole said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Mayor Paul TenHaken is going ahead with a city-wide shelter-in-place ordinance, now that Gov. Kristi Noem has rejected his request to issue a county-wide order. TenHaken did not say how the ordinance would differ from his stay-at-home proclamation. The Argus Leader reported the first reading of the ordinance was scheduled for Wednesday night with a second reading scheduled for next week. TenHaken’s request for Noem comes as Minnehaha County saw its number of cases reach 768. The state has reported 988 cases, and 438 of Minnehaha County’s cases are workers at Smithfield Foods pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, according to the Department of Health. And 107 involve people connected to Smithfield workers, such as family members. TenHaken said residents would still be able to travel for work and to get groceries and other essential items. The ordinance also wouldn’t stop people from doing activities outside as long as they are social distancing.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State parks will remain closed because of the ongoing threat of the new coronavirus. The announcement by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation keeps the 56 parks closed past the previously announced April 14 date to end the closures. State officials closed down the parks starting April 4. They have not set a new date to reopen them, saying they will closely monitor the pandemic and will notify the public when parks reopen. The department said the closure occurred because state parks saw staggering increases in visitor traffic, including from out-of-state visitors, making social distancing difficult to control.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:Twice as many Texans applied for food stamps in March than during the same period last year, as out-of-work residents swarm to government subsidized programs to put food on the table amid the coronavirus crisis, the Statesman reported. About 231,000 Texans applied for benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, in March compared to 114,000 applications in March 2019, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. During the first week of April, the state approved 83% more requests for benefits compared to the same period last year, with many of them likely coming from applications received in March. The state administers the program but the benefits are paid with federal funding. Last month, the state agency reported 3.3 million Texans were eligible for food stamps, more than a third of them children, and $370 million worth of the benefits were distributed. Since the pandemic hit, the federal and state government have relaxed some of the rules to qualify for the program, including suspending certain interview and employment requirements, but advocates see room for improvement. Texas has some of the most stringent conditions to qualify for food stamps, according to policy experts.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah joined more than 20 other states in canceling classes at public schools for the rest of the school year to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Students will finish the year doing mostly online assignments to avoid the risk of crowded classrooms, Gov. Gary Herbert said. “In order for us to continue to slow the spread and to get back on our feet socially and economically this is not the time to have our schools back open,” Herbert said. “This is not an easy decision to make. It is disruptive and it impacts our children, parents and families.” Public schools have been closed since March 16. Halting in-person classes has cast thousands of parents in the role of home school teachers as they guide students through online assignments created by teachers who often organize daily video meetings with students to help. About 667,000 children go to public schools in Utah, according to state figures. Utah joined states such as Arizona, Oregon and Washington that had made the same decision.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:State Attorney General T.J. Donovan is suing a Williston man suspected of price gouging on masks during the coronavirus pandemic. Donovan announced the lawsuit against Shelley Palmer and his company Big Brother Security Programs Inc. on Tuesday. Palmer is accused of purchasing surgical masks for 10 cents each, representing them as N95 masks to local health care providers, and selling the masks to the Central Vermont Medical Center for $2.50 each – an approximately 2,400% price increase. Palmer's actions occurred during a shortage of personal protective equipment in March because of the global pandemic, Donovan's court complaint stated. Palmer, however, said the masks were 3-ply non-woven KN95 masks – a mask that follows a Chinese standard for protection – and that he paid between 50 cents and 65 cents for each. He said he was not price gouging and that the hospital to which he sold the masks knew what he was selling and set the price. He is worried that Donovan's legal action is going to ruin his business. This is the first COVID-19-related case alleging price gouging filed in Vermont, Donovan said Wednesday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said he is extending his executive order that placed temporary restrictions on restaurants, recreational activity, entertainment, gatherings and nonessential retail businesses for two weeks. The order was initially supposed to be in effect until April 23 but will now last until May 8. Northam said that data showed that the order needed to be extended to protect public health. The order closed recreation and entertainment businesses, as well as personal care businesses, Northam said. It also banned gatherings of more than 10 people. Northam said modeling data showed that social distancing is working to flatten the curve and slow the spread of the disease in Virginia. There are still many new cases and deaths, but many of these are cases that were contracted weeks ago. The stay-at-home order remains in effect until June 10. The state will continue to monitor health data to determine what needs to happen next.\n\nWashington\n\nWallula: Dozens of workers at a Tyson Fresh Meats plant in Walla Walla County have tested positive for the new coronavirus, but officials said the plant will remain open. KEPR-TV reported this week that 42 workers had contracted the coronavirus at the meat plant in Wallula. Leaders with the Benton-Franklin Health District said they are working with staff at the plant to ensure it is a safe work environment. Officials with Walla Walla County Emergency Management said they are confident the employer is taking necessary precautions to prevent additional spread. The plant has about 1,400 workers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBeverly: A wood flooring production facility announced Wednesday that it would temporarily lay off and furlough several employees after decreased demand because of the coronavirus pandemic. AHF Products said in a statement that the cuts would affect 215 employees at the Beverly plant, including supervisors, salaried operators and maintenance and support staff. “The past several weeks have been like no other that we have experienced in our lifetime,” plant manager Blaine Emery said. “The current pandemic situation has impacted hardwood flooring demand significantly, and as a result, has forced AHF to reassess its workforce needs.” The statement said the company had already cut back, including a reduction in spending on capital initiatives and reducing pay for employees not furloughed. “We understand the impact these layoffs will have on the families of those affected and look forward to getting people back to work as soon as we can,” the company said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers signaled Tuesday that it might be another month before he starts relaxing social distancing mandates. The governor’s stay-at-home and school closure orders are set to expire on April 24. Evers told KSTP-TV that lifting the mandates won’t be “like flipping a switch.” He said he wants to be sure more coronavirus testing is available, there’s better tracking of sick people and there’s enough personal protective gear for health care workers before he will consider allowing businesses to open and easing social distancing restrictions. He added that it’s unlikely schools will reopen but he hasn’t made a final decision yet. “I would fully expect another couple of weeks, a month, before we are in a position to actually say we’re ahead of the curve here, and after that we can start thinking about how we can relax things,” Evers told the television station.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state has recorded its second known death related to the new coronavirus. The Laramie County man died Tuesday after being hospitalized in Cheyenne for weeks, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. The Wyoming Department of Health announced the man’s death Wednesday. A Johnson County man hospitalized in Buffalo with the coronavirus died late last week. As of Wednesday, Wyoming had close to 400 confirmed and suspected cases of the virus. More than 160 people had recovered. Gov. Mark Gordon has urged people in Wyoming to stay at home except when absolutely necessary and to avoid gathering in groups of 10 or more. He has ordered the shutdown of schools, bars and dining-in at restaurants through at least April 30.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/960667/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-28-april-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 28 April 2023 | The Week", "text": "1. King’s ancestor ‘exploited slaves’\n\nDirect ancestors of King Charles III and the royal family owned slave plantations, according to research in The Guardian. A document found by a researcher reveals that a direct ancestor of the king was involved in buying at least 200 enslaved people from the Royal African Company in 1686. The document states that the “negroes” were exploited on tobacco plantations in Virginia.

Anger as fewer EU laws scrapped\n\nBrexiteer MPs are angry after ministers dramatically scaled back the number of EU laws to be scrapped by the end of the year as part of Rishi Sunak’s bonfire of Brussels rules and regulations. Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, is to publish a list of 800 laws that will be removed from the UK statute book in an attempt to get the legislation through the House of Lords. The Telegraph said the development is the “latest Brexit betrayal”. A Tory MP said Badenoch is “a lame minister who is having rings run around her by ‘Remainer’ officials”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Worst famine since Live Aid in Africa\n\nEast Africa is “in the grip of the worst drought since the 1984 famine”, says The Mirror. One person is dying of hunger every 30 seconds in East Africa, says the paper, after climate change saw six consecutive years without a rainy season. Richard Blewitt, for the British Red Cross, said “the Africa food crisis is a catastrophic, deadly emergency on a scale we haven’t seen in recent history,” and “right now, more than 140 million people are struggling without the food they need to survive”.\n\nChild hunger in Africa ‘due to lack of political will’\n\n4. Russia resumes city bombings\n\nKyiv and several other Ukrainian cities have been hit by a wave of missiles fired by Russia. A woman and a child of three were killed in the city of Dnipro, according to the mayor. Three people were reportedly killed in a cruise missile strike on a high-rise residential building in the city of Uman, in the central Cherkasy region. Although Russia regularly bombed Ukrainian cities and infrastructure last winter, “massive strikes had become less common in recent months”, said The Guardian.\n\nCan Ukraine win war in the skies with Russia?\n\n5. Report ‘to criticise BBC chair’\n\nAn official investigation has concluded that the chairman of the BBC breached the rules in failing to declare his involvement in an £800,000 loan to Boris Johnson prior to his appointment. Richard Sharp is set to face calls to quit as head of the corporation when the findings of the two-month long inquiry are published today. The report by Adam Heppinstall KC is expected to have found that Sharp broke the code on public appointments by failing to inform the committee that interviewed him.\n\nRichard Sharp: ‘grim’ report that could spell the end for BBC chair\n\n6. Weight-loss jab set for UK\n\nA new weight loss jab that helps patients lose an average of two-and-a-half stone is set for approval in the UK. Tirzepatide was tested on 938 adults who were overweight or obese and had type 2 diabetes. Those on the highest dose lost 15.7% of their body weight on average, equating to 34lb (15.5kg). Manufactured by Eli Lilly, it helps people feel fuller for longer after eating and lose weight by imitating hormones.

Met ‘hasn’t learnt lessons’\n\nThe inspector of constabulary has warned that Metropolitan police could be failing to spot serial killers and identify murders because they are not properly investigating unexpected deaths. The force has not learnt from a “calamitous litany of failures” in the case of serial killer Stephen Port and “history could repeat itself”, said Matt Parr. The Met Police’s Assistant Commissioner, Louisa Rolfe, said the force was “sincere in our desire to make real change to minimise the chance of a case like this ever happening again”.\n\nCan the Metropolitan Police rebuild public trust?\n\n8. Spain breaks heat record\n\nSpain broke the temperature record for April yesterday, reaching 38.8C according to weather authorities. The record figure was reached in Cordoba airport in southern Spain, as a heatwave saw temperatures 10-15C warmer than expected for April. The conditions have been caused by a mass of very hot air from north Africa travelling across the Iberian peninsula and the Balearic islands. A recent EU report concluded that the climate crisis had “frightening” impacts in Europe last year.\n\nWhat is the hottest UK temperature on record?\n\n9. New concussion guide for sport\n\nNew grassroots guidance states that anyone with suspected concussion must be immediately removed from football, rugby and other sports and rest for at least 24 hours. The UK-wide guidelines also say that players should not return to competitive sport for at least 21 days. “We know that exercise is good for both mental and physical health,” said Prof James Calder, the surgeon who led the work for the government, “but we need to recognise that if you’ve got a head injury, it must be managed and you need to be protected, so that it doesn’t get worse”.\n\nHead injuries and concussion: ‘how many warnings does football need?’\n\n10. Tributes to ‘godfather’ Springer\n\nTributes have been paid to Jerry Springer after the TV presenter died aged 79. The BBC said the broadcaster, best known for The Jerry Springer Show, which ran for nearly three decades from 1991, was “era-defining” and “the godfather of reality TV”, while the New York Times said the “unapologetically brash” host was a “cultural phenomenon”. Springer’s family said he died “peacefully” on Thursday at home in Chicago.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Harold Maass", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/23/donald-trump-joe-biden-michigan-campaign/5996914002/", "title": "Trump vs. Biden: Each has his strength in different parts of Michigan", "text": "Michigan has long been a conundrum politically.\n\nAmong the Rust Belt states, it's known to be more favorable to Democrats, because of the influence of Detroit and its suburbs, relative to the rest of the state. No Republican has been elected U.S. senator from the state since 1994 — and he was voted out after one term. Until Donald Trump, no Republican presidential nominee had won Michigan since George H.W. Bush in 1988.\n\nAnd having won by about two votes for each of the state's precincts, Trump's 10,704-vote victory over Hillary Clinton four years ago wasn't exactly resounding.\n\n\"The basic voting patterns in Michigan have been blue. It's a blue state,\" said Michael Traugott, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan's Center for Political Studies.\n\nExcept, of course, when it's not.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nGoing into the Nov. 3 general election, both Democrat Joe Biden and President Trump have Michigan on their minds, wondering what color the state will be this year. Both they and their surrogates have been holding rallies in key areas — in west Michigan, in and around Saginaw, in metro Detroit. Both are trying to make sure the right voters — their voters — turn out amid the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and a skyrocketing amount of voting by absentee ballot.\n\nAnd as every Republican knows, you start out in Michigan from a relative disadvantage: a huge Democratic voting bloc in southeastern Michigan, which is decisive if it turns out.\n\nBut Republicans have obviously been able to win in Michigan. Rick Snyder won the governorship twice and Republicans controlled the secretary of state and state attorney general jobs for 16 years before Democrats flipped them two years ago. Both chambers of the state Legislature have been controlled by Republicans for a decade, though there are plenty of Democrats who will argue that's the result of gerrymandering.\n\nThen there is Trump, who was able to draw heavily in 2016 from formerly Democratic industrial areas where job losses have hit hard and pull big margins from rural areas to stitch together a coalition just big enough to overcome Democratic support for Clinton that was down, relative to Barack Obama's 2012 win, pretty much everywhere.\n\n\"This was not something Republicans were used to relying on,\" said John Sellek, CEO of Harbor Strategic Public Relations in Lansing and former state director of Republican Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in Michigan. \"It wasn't conceivable you could drive turnouts at those levels (in those areas of the state) and counter what your losses might be in metro Detroit.\"\n\nMore:In the era of Trump, Michigan's political map is changing. Here's how\n\nMore:President Trump again misleads on auto industry and much more at Muskegon rally\n\nMost of those Republican wins, besides Trump's razor-thin victory, were in off-year elections, when low propensity voters, often clustered in and around urban areas, were more likely to sit out. This year, however, turnout is expected to be high, if not at record levels. Biden has a lead of 48%-39% in the most recent polls by EPIC-MRA of Lansing, which does work for the Free Press. But after the experience of 2016 and Trump's upset over Clinton, few are prepared to entirely count out the president.\n\nEven if Trump faces headwinds, especially in metro Detroit, it's possible that he can either tamp down support for Biden there to levels he can overcome with a strong showing elsewhere, or find new pockets of support, especially in west Michigan, to make up for the possibility of a Democratic wave in Oakland and Wayne counties.\n\nComing off Democratic gains in 2018, when the party swept the three top statewide offices, it looks like a tall order, to be certain. But it will come down to how well both he and Biden are doing in various regions across the state, relative to the race four years ago. With that in mind, here's a look at all of those regions — using the geographic breakdowns employed by EPIC-MRA of Lansing for clarity's sake:\n\nMetro Detroit\n\nTo begin with the obvious, it’s difficult to impossible to win in Michigan without doing relatively well in metro Detroit, which typically accounts for about 40% of the statewide vote. As a region, it clearly is far more favorable ground to Democrats than Republicans, though former Gov. Rick Snyder managed to win the tricounty region (Macomb, Oakland and Wayne) outright in 2010.\n\nThe key to winning the state while losing in metro Detroit overall is keeping Democratic strength below a certain threshold. Said Sellek, \"You have to account for and plan for a baseline turnout that you have to overcome in southeastern Michigan.\"\n\nFor instance, Snyder won his second term in 2014 while losing in metro Detroit overall to Democrat Mark Schauer. But Snyder kept it close enough — losing 52%-47% — to maintain his advantage across the rest of the state. In 2016, Trump lost the region to Clinton 56%-40%. It was a wide gap to be sure but far better than the 62%-38% drubbing Obama gave Romney in the region in 2012.\n\nLooking at presidential and gubernatorial elections over the last few decades, it appears that anytime a Democrat gets better than the 56% Clinton got in metro Detroit, he or she has won statewide. John Kerry, for instance, got 58% and beat incumbent President George W. Bush in Michigan in 2004. And remember that while Clinton lost, she did so by a tiny margin, just two-tenths of 1%. If Biden can do even a bit better than that, it would suggest he’s got a good chance of winning the state. Of course, it’s always possible this will be the year in which those historical trends are turned on their ear with waves of support for Trump in other parts of the state — but that would indeed be a sea change in Michigan politics.\n\nAs of right now, it looks like Biden is in good shape to hit that number, though it's not a certainty. The Free Press looked at the three most recent EPIC-MRA polls — one in September and two in October — and averaged support for Biden and Trump in each of the state's regions.\n\nIt found that Biden led Trump 54%-34% in metro Detroit on average. That might sound like — and might turn out to be — good news for Trump, since it's below the 56% level of support. But there are a couple of important caveats to that. First, the margin of error for that number is larger than the plus or minus 4 percentage points to be used when considering statewide totals because the sample size is smaller. (That's even more true for the other regions that have even smaller sample sizes.)\n\nSecond, it's also a fair bet that, given the Democratic leanings in the district, the 9% of undecided voters on average in the polls could break more toward the Democrat than the Republican. In the firm's final poll before the 2016 election, for instance, Clinton led Trump 48%-35% in metro Detroit with 11% undecided. She wound up beating him there 56%-40%.\n\nIf the undecided voters broke the same way this year and the polls were as accurate as in 2016, Biden would clear the 56% threshold easily.\n\nSo how does Trump win Michigan? He needs to begin by winning big again in Macomb County — four years ago he won it by nearly 12 percentage points after Obama had won it for two elections in a row. He also needs to keep turnout low in Wayne County, where in the last election he was aided greatly by two factors: First, Clinton got some 76,000 fewer votes out of the county than Obama had four years before, with the number of Black voters in Detroit down significantly. Secondly. a large number of voters — nearly 11,000 in Wayne County — went to the polls but sat out the presidential race altogether.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, is looking at a three-part plan: First, he needs to bring Trump’s margins down in Macomb, if not win it outright. Second, he’s working on getting people in Wayne County, especially African Americans in Detroit, to turn out. And third, he’s hoping to turn out suburban voters in Oakland County, who, while backing Clinton four years ago, also had a huge number of voters — 13,476 — who didn’t vote for any presidential nominee. Two years ago, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer got more votes out of Oakland, the state's second largest county, than Clinton, a remarkable achievement for an off-year election and one that suggests a fired-up Democratic electorate.\n\nSaid Traugott, \"The Democrats won't be snuck up on like they were in 2016. ... You can tell from the flow of early voting in Michigan that more people will have access to the ballot in 2020 than they did before and turnout should go up ... which should favor the Democrats.\"\n\nOuter metro\n\nAs we’re defining it here, this region is a sort of catchall of several counties, which, in some important ways, aren’t very much alike at all. Washtenaw is anchored by a Democratic bastion in Ann Arbor and at the University of Michigan; Genesee, Monroe and St. Clair counties are all former industrial centers, and have more in common with some parts of western Wayne, southern Macomb and the Bay region than they do Ann Arbor. Livingston County is a changing exurb, with strong housing and income growth. Lenawee County prides itself on its scenery and small-town living.\n\nWhat they all have in common is they either touch, or are no more than one county away, from the big counties of metro Detroit.\n\nOn balance, this has been good territory for Democrats, largely because Genesee, where Flint is situated, and Washtenaw are the largest two voting areas and are predominantly Democratic. (Monroe, which has been somewhat of a swing area, went for Trump in 2016 after backing Obama in 2008 and 2012; most of the rest of the area has been reliably Republican.)\n\nWhile losing in the region overall, Trump still did well relative to Republicans in other years. Even though Washtenaw was the only county in the state where Clinton did better than Obama had four years before. Trump only lost the region overall to Clinton 48.5% to 46%, far better than the 14 percentage point loss Obama tagged Romney with in 2012.\n\nDemocrats could look to this region to claw back more votes. Whitmer won this region 55%-42% two years ago. What's more interesting perhaps is how areas like this, when broken apart, show how Michigan is changing depending on which areas are growing or shrinking. Growing areas tend to become slightly more Democratic friendly and shrinking ones somewhat more Republican, relative to the past.\n\nLivingston County backed Trump by 30 percentage points and Romney over Obama in 2012 by 23 points. But Whitmer closed that gap to 17 points two years ago to former state Attorney General Bill Schuette.\n\nEPIC-MRA pollster Bernie Porn said he has seen it in other work he has done for his clients. \"We are seeing more receptivity toward bond proposals and tax issues (in some exurbs). ... If they were considered as safe (for Republicans) as they have been in the past, you would not be seeing that.\"\n\nBut as some of these areas become relatively more Democratic-leaning, others — such as Genesee and Monroe — have become friendlier to Republicans as they've seen industry leave.\n\nIt makes for an unsettled region: Polling averages have shown Biden up in this region by a wide margin, though, again, the margin of error on such a small sample would be large. But Democrats have done big in this region before making such a turnaround possible.\n\nBut it will be a blow to Trump's chances if Biden approaches Obama's 14-point margin in 2012.\n\nBay region\n\nWe're defining this geographic region as the counties in the Thumb (excepting St. Clair, which is included in Outer Metro) and Arenac, Gladwin, Midland, Bay and Saginaw counties. As a region, it has tended slightly more Republican-leaning — Romney won there 50.5% to 48.4% for Obama in 2012 — with two big exceptions, Bay and Saginaw counties, former industrial centers with a socially conservative, blue-collar population that still typically voted for Democrats. Overall, the region makes up about 7% of the electorate.\n\nIn 2016, Trump scored big with these voters and it was one of the keys to his success.\n\nHe beat Clinton in the region 58%-37%, running up big margins of 30%-45% in many of the counties, especially those in the more rural parts of the Thumb. More significantly, he flipped Bay and Saginaw counties, which moved from backing Obama in 2012 by 5 percentage points and 11 percentage points, respectively, to backing Trump by 13 points in Bay County and 1 point in Saginaw.\n\nNo Republican candidate for president had won either of the counties since Ronald Reagan in 1984.\n\nThat’s a giant change and it resulted in Trump getting some 22,000 more votes out of the region than Romney did. If Trump is going to win in Michigan again, he’s going to be counting on getting those votes and more out of this part of the state, which explains why he held a big rally outside Saginaw in September. Biden, meanwhile, is counting on being a more likeable candidate than Clinton was in this area, much as Whitmer was two years ago: She lost the region overall, but by 8 points, not 21. And both Bay and Saginaw counties swung back into her column.\n\nRandy Badgerow, chairman of the Bay County Republicans, acknowledged that the 2016 result came as a surprise to him, \"mostly because this area's so heavily Democrat. It’s such an automotive union-type area that I was just surprised.\" But he thinks Trump is positioned to win it again.\n\nThe polls show the region as unsettled with a larger-than-expected percentage of undecided and potential third-party voters. It’d be a huge swing if it actually backed Biden overall, given the partisan lean of the region overall. But Trump needs a very strong showing here to replicate his 2016 victory; otherwise, he’ll need to find a lot more votes somewhere else in the state.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Clinton lost more votes relative to Obama in 2012 — nearly 35,622 — than Trump gained in this region.\n\nNorth region\n\nIt’s safe to say no region of the state was as attuned to Trump’s 2016 campaign as Up North. While it had been trending more Republican generally — Romney beat Obama in the region 54%-45% in 2012 — it really turned out for Trump four years ago, when voters there gave him a resounding 59%-36% victory, a whopping 23 percentage points.\n\nBy way of reference, we’re looking at the northern region as anything north of an east-west line that runs along the southern borders of Manistee, Wexford, Missaukee, Roscommon, Ogemaw and Iosco counties, including the Upper Peninsula. Geographically, it’s huge — 34 counties — but it’s mostly rural and accounts for just about 8%-9% of the statewide electorate. Grand Traverse and Marquette are its largest counties.\n\nIts strength for Trump four years ago exemplified how he was able to remake the political map of Michigan.\n\n\"The massive levels of turnout Trump drew in counties from Clare north... these margins were just piling up to unseen levels,\" Sellek said.\n\nWhile there clearly has been some movement in pockets of this territory toward Democrats — Whitmer came within a hair’s breadth of winning in Grand Traverse two years ago and flipped neighboring Leelanau County — there’s no question just how strong this area was for Trump in 2016. The total vote for president in 2016 increased more than 49,000 votes — about 14% — and nearly all of those, 47,156, went to Trump, an enormous advantage.\n\nRecent polling suggests Trump may do it again this year, leading in the average of the most recent polls 52%-36%. What’s less clear, however, is how much more he can pull out of it: The parts that are growing, such as Grand Traverse, are trending more Democratic.\n\nThat said, this is a region where polling has suggested far more people are less concerned about the threat of COVID-19 — and far more interested in getting the economy restarted — than in other parts of Michigan and where Whitmer is generally less liked than Trump. That very much sounds like it continues to be Trump country and will likely respond in kind this election.\n\nCentral region\n\nCentral Michigan, defined here as the counties running south along a swath from Osceola and Clare counties to the Indiana-Ohio line (follow M-66 and U.S. 127 north to south, and you’ll get the idea) is a mix of rural communities and small towns, heavy industry with General Motors plants in Delta Township and Lansing, state government and Michigan State University in Ingham County and an older industrial area in Battle Creek in Calhoun County. It typically accounts for about 12% of the state’s turnout in a given election.\n\nOver some recent years, it has been something of a swing area, despite large swaths of more conservative territory. As a region, it backed Obama twice — by 55%-44% over Republican John McCain in 2008 and by a much-closer margin, 50%-48% over Mitt Romney in 2012. But for a big double-digit margin in Ingham County for Obama, however, Romney probably would have taken the area eight years ago. And it did back Snyder in both of his elections. As such, it was ripe for a big win by Trump in 2016.\n\nFour years ago, Trump won it by 10 percentage points, 52%-42%, and while some 15,000 more voters came out that year, the significant change was how many dropped Clinton — she got 44,000 fewer votes than Obama had — while Trump picked up more than 30,000 votes. The change was apparent all over the region with the exception of Ingham. But nowhere more so than Calhoun County, which went from backing Obama over Romney by 2 percentage points to supporting Trump over Clinton by 12.5% (which is similar to what happened in a much more famous swing county, Macomb).\n\nCalhoun had backed Republican presidential nominees previously but not since President George W. Bush in 2004 and, even then, it was a much tighter race. As such, it's no surprise why Trump held his first official campaign rally in Michigan last December in Battle Creek — and on a day when the Democratic majority in the U.S. House and former Republican U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, who represents the district, were voting to impeach him on accusations he asked Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden. The Senate would later acquit.\n\nAs with some other parts of the state, this region swung back toward the Democrats in the 2018 gubernatorial election, as Whitmer took back a handful of counties — including Clinton, Eaton and Isabella, though not Calhoun — so it’s possible Biden could claw back some of Trump’s gains. But Whitmer won here by just 2 percentage points, making it equally possible that Trump can again do well in this region. With its split between progressives in Lansing, older industrial areas in and around Battle Creek and small-town conservatives, it’s hard to say where it will go, but Trump needs to do well here to stay ahead.\n\nWest Michigan\n\nYou can say west Michigan — defined here as the seven counties along Lake Michigan north from the Indiana border as well as Cass, St. Joseph, Kalamazoo, Kent, Newago and Lake counties — is reliably Republican. Going back to the 1998 election for governor, the Republican candidate at the top of the ticket has won each time regionally with one exception: Obama in the landslide of 2008.\n\nFour years ago, it was no different for Trump, who won here 52%-41% over Clinton. The surprising thing was that his winning percentage was a point less than Romney’s had been in 2012. And while Trump showed his reach in the more rural parts of this region and even made some impressive gains in Democratic-leaning areas such as Lake and Muskegon counties, he did worse overall than Romney in two Republican bastions, Ottawa and Kent counties.\n\nGenerally speaking, there is no reason to believe that Trump won’t win in this part of the state again. If anything, his polices to cut taxes and regulations in order to spur the economy would be expected to resonate in an area that has largely embraced pro-business measures. And while Trump’s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is a divisive figure nationally and in Michigan, she’s well known in west Michigan and has deep ties to the GOP there.\n\nBut there is still a strong element of social conservatism associated with the Dutch-American community in west Michigan, which may or may not be ready to fully embrace a president as demonstrative and controversial as Trump. His surrounding himself with people like DeVos and Vice President Mike Pence — not to mention putting two and possibly three conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court — certainly can’t hurt him. But there is also a streak of libertarian independence shot through this region, as evinced by Amash's stand against Trump. Many in the region also recall Republicans like Gerald Ford and Paul Henry who were known for a more collaborative style than the president's or the current levels of partisanship in Congress.\n\nAnd this could be a decisive area.\n\nTwo years ago, Whitmer lost the region overall but won in Kent County, where Grand Rapids is situated, and that helped propel her to the governorship. There has been reason to believe the area, which is growing, is trending more Democratic. That could spell trouble down the road.\n\nOnce the Republican formula for winning statewide was to hold down losses in southeastern Michigan, then \"turn to west Michigan and hope that was going to carry you home,\" as Sellek put it. But Kent County in particular — as it gains in affluence — is beginning to look more and more like Oakland County as its Democratic-lean has become more pronounced.\n\n\"Republicans until recently didn't think they had to turn out the ground game in west Michigan — they thought it would turn out itself,\" Sellek said. \"That's no longer the case. That's going to be a battleground for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nSome handicappers are saying the race to replace Amash between Peter Meijer, the Republican heir to the eponymous grocery store chain, and Democratic lawyer Hillary Scholten is a toss-up.\n\nEven if Trump wins in west Michigan, as would be widely expected, he can’t afford to see a drop-off in a region that accounts for about 19% of the statewide vote. This is a region where he and his campaign would want to pick up votes, if anything, to protect against the likelihood of an increased turnout among Democrats who didn’t come out four years ago, especially in Wayne and Oakland counties. Since he already hit huge numbers in many of the more rural regions of the state, this region may offer him his best opportunity to increase his totals.\n\nWhich explains why he and his surrogates have been targeting the region. Last week, he was in Muskegon, aiming to kill two birds with one stone, speaking both to west Michigan's traditional Republicans and blue-collar voters in what had been a traditionally Democratic county.\n\nThere are those who argue that the regions themselves don't matter so much and that winning or losing in Michigan is simply a matter of whether Democrats turn out their voters or not. It's true that, as a rule, Republicans have a much more narrow deviation in terms of how many vote than Democrats do. In 2004, President George W. Bush got 2.3 million votes in the state, more than any other Republican top-of-the-ticket nominee in the last 20 years. In 2008, Barack Obama got 2.9 million votes.\n\nAnother school of analysis, however, says Michigan has become less tied to partisan leanings and more about its preference for specific politicians. This week, Corwin Smidt, a Michigan State University political science professor, posted an analysis of voter registration and found that it's possible — though even he is skeptical — that the number of voters could hit an astronomical 5.9 million. Given that just over 5 million voted in the 2008 presidential election, it's a leap at best but even if it's less than that, it would seem to bolster Democratic hopes.\n\nBut Smidt isn't certain. Much of the increase is in areas where the partisan lean in the last two presidential elections has been better for Republicans. And older Democratic bastions such as Wayne County continue to lose population and some, such as Bay County or Calhoun County, are moving toward Republicans. On the other hand, other areas that are growing, such as Kent or Livingston counties, may be moving toward Democrats, though it's unclear how quickly they are doing so.\n\n\"Michigan has been a swing state,\" he said. \"The truth is, there are a lot of what-ifs that could be played out. If Biden replicates Whitmer's support in places like Oakland and Kent, definitely (Biden wins). However … we’ve also been a swing state so it's hard to say (he) can easily replicate that result.\n\n\"The demographics of the state really haven't changed in 20 years,\" he added. \"What's changed is voters don't fit in as much with their party as they used to.\"\n\nContact Todd Spangler attspangler@freepress.com.

Adkins, who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroism during the Vietnam War, died from complications from COVID-19. The Bennie Adkins Foundation announced the death on social media Friday. He was 86. Adkins served more than 20 years in the U.S. Army, with 13 of those years spent as a Green Beret. He was deployed to Vietnam three times and awarded the Medal of Honor in 2014 for heroism in a 1966 battle. According to the Medal of Honor citation, Adkins carried wounded soldiers to safety – sometimes drawing fire on himself to allow the wounded to be rescued – and fought off waves of attacking forces. Following retirement in 1978 at the rank of command sergeant major, he graduated from Troy University and founded an accounting firm in Alabama. He lived in Opelika.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said Alaskans soon could be making appointments at barbershops and nail salons again, as the state looks to further reopen parts of the economy shut down or restricted because of coronavirus concerns. Dunleavy said Monday that details are expected this week. Other areas he said were being looked at include restaurants and retail shops, businesses he said employ many people and could put in place safety protocols while meeting demand for services. He said Alaskans will be asked to continue washing their hands, cleaning surfaces, maintaining social distance and wearing masks, particularly when shopping. The state feels pretty good about its numbers and its health care capacity, equipment and ability to track cases, he said. The state has reported at least 321 cases of COVID-19, with 161 of those cases recovered and nine deaths.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Banner Health is setting up makeshift grocery stores for workers on the front lines tending to coronavirus patients. The provider announced Monday that select metro Phoenix hospitals will have on-site locations where health care workers can pick up provisions. Fruits, vegetables, bread, dairy products and eggs are among the essentials that will be available to physicians, nurses and other staff at a discounted price. Banner officials say they hope to ease the burden for workers who are putting in especially long shifts. The facilities that will offer groceries are in Queen Creek, Glendale, Scottsdale and Phoenix. In Mesa, Banner Desert Medical Center will instead have grocery boxes available to buy. Arizona-based Banner Health, one of the largest nonprofit health care systems nationwide, owns and operates 28 acute-care hospitals.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Nearly a third of the inmates at a state prison have tested positive for coronavirus, state health officials said Monday. About 600 inmates in the Cummins Unit tested positive for the virus, an increase of about 250 from a day earlier, state Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith said. Prison officials announced the first case at the facility a little over a week ago. Smith said the department has completed most of its testing of inmates at the prison. A health department spokeswoman said the agency has tested more than 1,000 inmates and is awaiting results from 25 more. “Until we have completely interrupted chains of transmission in the prison, I’m not going to say it’s over,” Smith said. “Once we know who’s positive, who’s negative, who’s exposed, who’s not exposed, then we can begin moving people around, and that, I would say, is the beginning of containment.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: An estimated 320,000 adults in Los Angeles County may have been infected with coronavirus, according to preliminary results of a study that suggests the illness is far more widespread than current testing shows and the death rate is much lower. The study conducted April 10-11 by the county and the University of Southern California estimated that approximately 4.1% of the county’s adult population of 8 million has antibodies to the virus. When adjusted for margin of error, the infection rate ranged from 2.8% to 5.6%, or about 220,000 to 440,000 adults. The study, which was criticized by some outside experts, follows other research that has suggested more people have had coronavirus than previously determined through testing – many without symptoms or without feeling ill enough to seek a test. But it also means more people have been silent carriers of the virus that has killed more than 1,200 people in California.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado will let its statewide stay-at-home order expire next week, allow a gradual reopening of nonessential businesses, and permit nonelective surgical procedures and other activity suspended by the coronavirus fight as long as strict social distancing and other protective measures continue, Gov. Jared Polis said Monday. Polis credited widespread compliance with social distancing and shelter-in-place orders for state information that suggests COVID-19 hospitalizations are leveling off, allowing the most severe restrictions imposed last month to expire April 27. He urged residents who can work at home to keep doing so and all to stay at home as much as possible, avoid large gatherings, and wear masks and other protective gear. Details on specific measures will be released this week, Polis said. State and local authorities are empowered to reimpose restrictions in response to health crises, he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has teamed up with a group of scientists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and other research institutions who’ve created a new app that will provide more information about the spread of COVID-19 as officials prepare to eventually reopen Connecticut. Gov. Ned Lamont said the state is the first to officially partner with the developers of the HowWeFeel.org app, which enables residents to report daily about how they’re feeling and their symptoms. He encouraged people to download the app, noting it does not require logging in or sharing any personal information, such as name or email address. It’s one of several ways the state plans to use technology to help inform officials on how and when to slowly restart parts of society. For example, Lamont said the state has received 3,500 “smart thermometers” that will upload data about residents’ temperatures to a cloud-based system.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A state panel has drastically lowered official government revenue estimates as the coronavirus outbreak continues to wreak havoc with the national and state economies. The Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council on Monday lowered its revenue estimate for this year by $416 million, or 9%, compared to its March estimate. This year’s revenue total is currently predicted to be almost 6% less than the amount collected last year. The panel also lowered its revenue estimates for the fiscal year starting July 1 by $273 million, or 6%, compared to its March estimate. The downward revisions were largely due to significant declines in estimates for personal income taxes and corporate income taxes. But estimates were also down significantly for lottery and gross receipts tax revenue. The only increase was in insurance taxes and fees, along with a slight uptick in dividends and interest for the current year.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Numbers from the D.C. Office of Unified Communications show a spike in calls for noise complaints and mass gatherings once the coronavirus pandemic came to the area, WUSA-TV reports. Overall, the amount of 311 calls handled by the city is up 7% since the city began modifying operations the week of March 15. According to statistics from OUC, dispatched noise complaints soared 17% beginning in March and continuing into April. Following the spread of the virus, OUC dispatchers also saw 2,150 service requests come in regarding concerns with mass gatherings, and 195 reported complaints of nonessential businesses being open or not in compliance with social gathering parameters. Dispatchers saw a 24% spike in 311 calls the week of March 15. “People were asking questions like where are the tests, are schools closed, are they going to give out meals,” Director of Unified Communications Karima Holmes said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Six Super Bowl rings may get you special treatment in a lot of places, but former Patriots quarterback Tom Brady learned Monday that it won’t get you anything when you’re caught working out in a park that is closed to the public due to the coronavirus pandemic. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said during a news briefing that the new Buccaneers quarterback was spotted working out by himself at a park downtown. A member of staff patrol went over to tell him he had to leave, and she recognized the man to be the 42-year-old Brady. The City of Tampa tweeted from its page Monday, “Sorry @TomBrady! Our @tampaparksrec team can’t wait to welcome you and our entire community back with even bigger smiles – until then, stay safe and stay home as much as you can to help flatten the curve.” The four-time Super Bowl MVP left the New England Patriots and signed a two-year, $50 million contract with the Bucs in free agency, joining a team with the worst winning percentage in league history.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPooler: America’s Second Harvest of Coastal Georgia will host a drive-thru emergency food distribution event at 9 a.m. Wednesday at the Tanger Outlet Centers in the city. It will be a first-come, first-served distribution while supplies last for residents of Pooler, Executive Director Mary Jane Crouch said in a press release Monday. In the light of the COVID-19 virus, strict precautionary measures will be taken to keep staff and the public safe during the distribution. Clients must remain in their cars and have a space cleared in the trunk of their vehicle available for the Georgia National Guard to load a box of nonperishable food, produce and protein into their vehicle. “We can only provide one box per vehicle, and no exceptions will be made,” Crouch said. A variety of nonperishable goods and fresh produce will be distributed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The federal coronavirus relief funds for Hawaii residents are not expected to cover a single month of expenses because of the state’s high cost of living, an economic analysis found. The one-time, $1,200 payments from the government’s coronavirus rescue package are likely to be less effective in Hawaii because the average cost of living is 20% higher than the national average, Hawaii Public Radio reports. Beth Giesting, director of the nonpartisan Hawaii Budget and Policy Center, said when accounting for the local cost of living, the $1,200 payment is more like $960 elsewhere in the U.S. “In no case does it cover a full month’s expenses,” she said. How far the money goes depends on location. On Oahu, the most expensive island, $1,200 does not cover even half the average monthly expenses for a single person, Giesting said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: With students completing school work remotely during the coronavirus pandemic, officials say more youths are filling their days by doing farm labor and other agricultural jobs. Educators and farm-worker advocates are worried that could take a toll on students’ education and health, the Idaho Statesman and Idaho Ed News report. The majority of child work-related fatalities occur in agricultural jobs, according to a 2018 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, as kids can encounter pesticide exposure, dangerous equipment or extreme temperatures. “This is definitely a concern,” said Sarah Seamount, migrant education coordinator for the Idaho State Department of Education. “Although these students are not at school, they are still in school and are expected to continue their education during this soft closure, just like all Idaho public school students.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The number of black Chicago residents becoming infected with the coronavirus and of those dying of the disease remains disproportionately high, city officials said Monday. Black residents made up about 46% of the 12,571 confirmed tests for the coronavirus and about 60% of the 500 deaths in the city linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, despite making up 30% of the city’s population. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the city and neighborhood organizations working to share information about the virus and preventing its spread are focused on three neighborhoods: Auburn Gresham, South Shore and Austin. Health conditions that are more common among African Americans can make people more vulnerable to the virus, including diabetes and asthma. Experts also have pointed to higher uninsured rates and poorer access to health care.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor said Monday that he was easing restrictions on hospitals from performing elective surgeries even as the state health commissioner remained concerned about whether coronavirus infections were slowing. Gov. Eric Holcomb said while he was extending the statewide stay-at-home order until May 1, hospitals would be allowed starting Tuesday to resume procedures to diagnose and treat medical conditions. A halt to elective procedures had been ordered last month to help preserve hospital equipment and protective gear if needed to treated people seriously ill with COVID-19 respiratory infections. State officials have not reported shortages of hospital beds and equipment such as ventilators even as Indiana’s coronavirus death toll has topped 550 in little more than five weeks since the state’s first known death.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Gov. Kim Reynolds said Monday that the state’s meatpacking plants must stay open despite coronavirus outbreaks that have sickened hundreds of workers, saying shutting them down would be devastating for farmers and the nation’s food supply. Reynolds said at a news conference that the virus spreads quickly and easily at the plants because so many workers are in close proximity, acknowledging “we will continue to see clusters of positive cases” in them. “But these are also essential businesses and an essential workforce,” she said. Coronavirus outbreaks at Tyson Foods pork plants in Columbus Junction and Waterloo and a National Beef plant in Tama have contributed to a surge in positive cases in Iowa in recent days. Tyson resumed limited operations Tuesday at its plant in Columbus Junction, where more than 200 workers have become infected and at least two have died.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The coronavirus has arrived at a third correctional facility as the state’s largest prison outbreak grows to include nearly 90 positive cases. Kansas Department of Corrections Secretary Jeff Zmuda said in a news release that one staff member tested positive Monday at the Topeka Correctional Facility, which is the state’s only all-female prison, with a capacity of 948. Health officials are conducting contact tracing to determine who has been in close contact with the worker. The largest outbreak is at the Lansing Correction Facility, where 47 staff and 40 inmates are infected. An inmate at a work-release facility in Wichita also tested positive, prompting corrections officials to move 113 prisoners earlier this month to Lansing, where they are being quarantined. With advocacy groups demanding action, Gov. Laura Kelly has said efforts are underway to identify inmates who are close to finishing their sentences and can be released.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A legal organization representing an area church that filed a lawsuit against Gov. Andy Beshear is calling on churches around the country to follow Maryville Baptist’s lead and reopen early next month. Liberty Counsel, a nonprofit that provides legal assistance in cases involving evangelical causes, has dubbed May 3 as “ReOpen Church Sunday,” according to a news release from the group, and is encouraging churchgoers to fill the pews as they did earlier in April at Maryville Baptist Church in Bullitt County. The call to action notes that families who attend services, which are currently banned in Kentucky as the commonwealth fights the spread of the coronavirus under Beshear’s “healthy at home” restrictions, should practice social distancing and “include appropriate measures of sanitization,” as well as including other options like reduced seating, live videos online and parking lot services.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Authorities arrested a pastor on an assault charge Tuesday after he admitted he drove his church bus toward a man who has been protesting his decision to hold mass gatherings in defiance of public health orders during the coronavirus pandemic. The police department in Central, a suburb of Baton Rouge, said on Facebook that Tony Spell, pastor of Life Tabernacle Church, turned himself in and was arrested on charges of aggravated assault and improper backing. Spell was taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish prison, where about 70 of his parishioners, dressed in their Sunday best, arrived in church buses to show support. Gathering in a parking lot across the street, they stood close to each other, praying and singing hymns. Trey Bennett, the protester Spell is accused of assaulting, also showed up at the jail, carrying his protest sign, which said “Close this church” on one side and “Danger: coronavirus incubator” on the other.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Social distancing rules imposed to protect against the new coronavirus also appear to be reducing incidence of the flu. The number of flu diagnoses in Maine increased by 184 in the three weeks since late March when most of the social distancing policies began in the state. The number of flu cases grew by 1,812 during that same period a year earlier, the Bangor Daily News reports. “What those data suggest is that by staying inside and abiding by Gov. (Janet) Mills’ recommendations and rules, we’ve not only gotten a hold of COVID-19, but we’ve also dropped the number of influenza cases as well,” Maine Center for Disease Control Director Nirav Shah said. The state has still seen more flu cases overall this year than last. But the number of flu-related hospitalizations has dropped noticeably. As for the new coronavirus, Maine has now recorded more than 875 cases and 35 deaths from COVID-19.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state has dramatically boosted its testing capacity for the new coronavirus with a shipment of 500,000 tests from a South Korean company, the governor announced Monday, noting his Korean-born wife played a major role in championing the $9 million purchase. As states have scoured the world for testing supplies, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said he asked wife Yumi Hogan on March 28 to help negotiate the purchase, tapping into the goodwill she has sought to foster between the state and South Korea. Hogan said 22 days of negotiations led to the shipment’s delivery by air Saturday. The governor noted that President Donald Trump had told state officials the states need to lead on boosting their testing capacity. The purchase was cited at Monday’s press briefing at the White House, with Trump opining that he didn’t believe it was necessary. Administration officials have been pushing governors to step up testing, while some governors have said testing infrastructure is inadequate.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: School buildings in the state will remain closed through the end of the academic year, but remote learning will continue, Gov. Charlie Baker announced Tuesday. There hasn’t been any strong guidance about how to operate schools safely as the state works to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the Republican governor said. “We believe therefore that students cannot safety return to school,” he said, adding that all non-emergency child care programs will remain closed until June 29. Baker’s announcement came a day after Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a Democrat, suggested schools would not reopen until September. “I also think next year when school comes back in September, it could be a very different looking situation in the classrooms,” Walsh said Monday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday said the state is working with major retailers to open more drive-thru sites to test as many as 1,000 people a day for the coronavirus, especially people who don’t have symptoms but still are required to work outside their home. “Robust testing is essential to have confidence about our strategies for safely reducing risk and reengaging sectors of our economy,” Whitmer said. She said Walmart, Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are part of the plan to open eight test sites across the state. Whitmer cautioned, however, that there’s a shortage of swabs and chemicals needed to complete tests. If labs had all the supplies they needed, 11,300 tests a day could be performed, the governor said. “The reality is we’re about half of that because we need additional swabs and reagents,” Whitmer said. “However, those supplies are in demand globally, and we are competing to get them and working incredibly hard so that we can ramp up to that 11,300 capacity and hopefully beyond.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Muslims in south Minneapolis will be able to maintain safe physical distance during the call to prayer throughout the holy month of Ramadan. The call to prayer will be broadcast by speaker five times each day in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood to allow residents to pray together starting the first day of Ramadan and lasting throughout the holy holiday. Mayor Jacob Frey facilitated the noise permit after the community requested the service. The Council on American-Islamic Relations paid for the audio equipment for the broadcast from the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque. The broadcasts are expected to reach thousands of residents while allowing residents to maintain safe physical distance for prayer during the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement, Frey said the broadcast should offer “a measure of stability and reassure our entire city that we are all very much in this together.” Ramadan starts Thursday and ends May 23.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday that he believes the state is reaching a “plateau” in the increase of new coronavirus cases, and he will consider in coming days how the state should ease into reopening parts of its economy. “We are confident … that our health care system is not going to be overwhelmed,” the Republican said during a news conference, joined by the state health officer. Many businesses deemed “nonessential” have been closed, and claims for unemployment benefits have skyrocketed. Reeves announced last week that starting Monday, some closed businesses, including clothing stores and florists, could sell items for delivery or curbside pickup. Some smaller businesses had said they were losing money to big chain stores that have remained open. The state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, said Monday: “Big box stores are still pretty crowded. It makes me very nervous. And I’m not seeing a lot of folks wearing masks in the community, necessarily.”\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Chinese government over the coronavirus, alleging that nation’s officials are to blame for the global pandemic. The lawsuit, filed in federal court by the state’s top prosecutor, alleges Chinese officials are “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians.” “The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease,” Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement. “They must be held accountable for their actions.” Lawsuits against other countries are typically fruitless because U.S. law generally prohibits them with rare exceptions, said Ashley Deeks, an international law expert at the University of Virginia School of Law. Missouri Democratic Party Executive Director Lauren Gepford called the lawsuit a “stunt” by a Republican attorney general who is up for reelection this year.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A cloistered order of nuns, devout in their vows of poverty and seclusion, the Poor Clares are not often seen in public. For the vast majority of their time, the six sisters remain in anonymity, quietly praying that the blessings of God be granted to all, even during the most common of times. But these are not common times. For the first time in their 20-year history in the city, the Poor Clares have emerged from their monastery to raise their hands in blessing over Great Falls and sing the blessing of St. Clare. “We wanted to bless the city, especially the health care workers,” Sister Judith Crosby said. “We see the city, and we are very aware of its needs and continually pray for them,” added Sister Jane Sorenson. “It’s been strongly on our minds for as long as we’ve been here. But at this point in time with the pandemic, we just believe it would be good for us to (be) visible, let people know that they are in our prayers.”\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Five more people have died from COVID-19, bringing the state’s total deaths to 33 since the new coronavirus outbreak this year, health officials said. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release that three of the deaths reported Monday were in a hard-hit area of south-central Nebraska. They included a woman in her 60s from Hamilton County and a woman in her 80s and a man in his 60s, both from Hall County. The other two deaths came from the Omaha area in Douglas County, where a man in his 40s and a man in his 70s – both with underlying health conditions – died of the disease. Word of the new cases came after Gov. Pete Ricketts announced Monday that he will lift the state’s ban on elective surgeries for hospitals that have at least 30% of their beds, intensive-care unit space and ventilators available. Hospitals must also have at least two weeks’ worth of personal protective equipment in stock.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A strip club business has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Small Business Administration after not receiving money from the $2 trillion federal coronavirus aid bill. Little Darlings owner Jason Mohney has struggled obtaining emergency funding from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act after Congress grouped the business into the category of operations of a prurient sexual nature, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Mohney argues the exclusion is discriminatory toward a class of workers who perform a legal and legitimate service through the Flint, Michigan-based company, which operates 200 exotic dance clubs in Las Vegas and multiple other cities. Not all companies in the sexual business have been denied funding. Bella’s Hacienda Ranch brothel owner Madam Bella Cummins received a notification that her funding application was approved for about $70,000, but the federal program had run out of money by then.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: Catholic Medical Center, one of the state’s largest hospitals, is furloughing hundreds of workers as it loses millions of dollars a month because of the coronavirus pandemic. The hospital said Tuesday that it will put 423 workers, or 13% of its workforce, on a 60-day furlough, starting Saturday. An additional 914 workers will have their hours reduced, leaders at the vice president level and above are taking a 15% pay cut, and executive directors are taking a 5% cut. Like other facilities, the hospital has eliminated elective procedures and scaled back outpatient visits to prepare for a surge of COVID-19 patients, to conserve protective equipment, and to protect other patients and staff. The hospital lost $11 million in March and expects to lose up to $70 million by July. Last week, the company that runs Elliot Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center announced 650 workers would be furloughed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s COVID-19 death toll saw its biggest spike yet Tuesday, climbing by 379 deaths, Gov. Phil Murphy said. The increase comes as the number of new cases has been leveling off, the first-term Democrat said at a news conference. New Jersey has had 4,753 deaths from the virus and more than 92,000 cases, up from about 89,000. Despite some positive signs, like the leveling off of cases and the increasing time it takes for the number of people with COVID-19 to double, Murphy said there are still weeks to go of social distancing. “We cannot rush to reopen anything and risk undoing all the extraordinary work you’ve done so far,” Murphy said. Murphy also on Tuesday toured the state’s third and newest field hospital to open during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Atlantic City Convention Center field hospital is aimed at alleviating pressure on local hospitals and will treat non-coronavirus patients in 258 beds.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A team of national defense scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory that studies contagions with award-winning accuracy has developed its own U.S. forecast for the spread of the coronavirus. It’s one model that states are utilizing as they consider the duration of directives on social distancing and restrictions on business. With support from the U.S. Energy Department, the Los Alamos model builds upon a decade of past experience in forecasting contagions, including the seasonal flu, the Ebola virus and mosquito-borne Chikungunya. Last year Los Alamos statisticians beat out more than 20 teams in a CDC competition aimed at improving flu forecasting using supercomputing power. The lab’s “Dante” model was most successful in predicting the peak and short-term intensity of the unfolding flu season – and became the basis for the new COVID-19 model.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Hospitals in parts of the state will be able to conduct outpatient elective surgeries again, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday as he pledged to consider regional differences when reopening New York’s outbreak-stalled economy. The governor said elective treatments will be allowed in places where the outbreak is less severe. “We’re going to allow it in those hospitals and counties in the state that do not have a COVID issue or we wouldn’t need their beds in case of a surge,” Cuomo said. The hospital restrictions will remain in effect in New York City and suburban Westchester and Rockland counties, as well as Albany, Dutchess and Erie counties, he said. By Monday, more than 250,000 people in the state had tested positive for COVID-19 – a milestone figure that likely undercounts infected residents by a significant margin. People in New York City, a worldwide hotspot, were advised to seek testing only if they were ill enough to possibly require hospitalization.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFort Bragg: It’s become a competition for the soldiers of 647th Quartermaster Company to see who can crank out the most face masks during a shift to protect against the coronavirus. The parachute rigging unit is essential to airborne operations at Fort Bragg. On any given day, the soldiers’ shed is filled with paratroopers in red ball caps, busy packing parachutes and readying supplies for jumps. While that work continues, soldiers across the room are laser-focused on tiny pins and buzzing sewing machines. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, riggers are now making cloth face masks to fight the virus for personnel around the sprawling Army base. Initially, Company Commander Captain Anthony Williams set a goal for his soldiers to produce 600 masks a week. “With the soldiers and their adaptability and their resilience, we’re actually producing 600 masks a day,” Williams said. North Carolina State University donated 4,000 meters of unwoven material that’s being used to construct new personal protective equipment.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: A local company is working with universities and a medical school on using unmanned aerial vehicles in the fight against the coronavirus. SkySkopes, based in Grand Forks, has launched demonstrations to show a variety of ways in which its drones could be used in the pandemic. KFGO reports SkySkopes CEO and President Matt Dunlevy says the drones can deliver supplies to hospital, check people’s temperatures from the air and even sanitize playground equipment. The company said it’s working with the University of North Dakota’s medical school and its Center for Innovation as well as North Dakota State University and Grand Forks County. The company had planned to conduct testing in Hillsboro but met with some opposition. City Commission President Terry Sando said a small number of people expressed concerns about the drone testing.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Schools across the state will stay closed for the remainder of the school year while classes continue remotely, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine announced Monday. DeWine, who was the first governor in the nation to shutter schools statewide, said his latest decision stems from concern for the continued safety of students, teachers and communities. He said returning students to their classrooms could lead to new cases of COVID-19. DeWine said teachers and administrators also worried that another disruption to a school year already interrupted by the coronavirus might negatively affect students, who need continuity. “We have to think about the risk to teachers, students and our communities,” DeWine said. The governor said no decision has been made about the fall but said a blend of in-person and online learning might be an option for districts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt’s attempt to ban abortions during the coronavirus pandemic cannot be enforced, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge Charles Goodwin issued a preliminary injunction late Monday after abortion providers sued Stitt over the ban. The injunction replaces a temporary restraining order that the same judge issued last week that allowed most abortions to continue. The injunction ensures abortions can be performed in Oklahoma while the case continues in federal court. Stitt’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but a spokesman for Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter said he intends to appeal the decision. Stitt attempted to ban abortions as part of a prohibition on elective surgeries aimed at preserving personal protective equipment, such as surgical masks, gowns and gloves, during the public health crisis.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The governor’s office on Monday circulated its own version of a three-phase federal guideline to lift restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic, including allowing child care facilities and possibly restaurants to reopen in the first phase. The Trump administration’s guidelines say there first must be downward trajectories, during a 14-day period, of influenza-like illnesses, COVID-19-like cases, documented cases or positive tests as a percent of total tests, as well as “robust testing and contact tracing.” Oregon, however, has some counties with no or few COVID-19 cases. The draft circulating among state leaders says Oregon will likely use modified metrics, especially for rural counties with small numbers. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown’s draft plan, which comes as Republicans in the Legislature ramp up pressure on her to lift economic restrictions in rural areas, offers no time frame, saying experience in other countries and modeling says reducing social distancing too quickly will create a spike in cases.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Transporting bodies from a hospital to the medical examiner’s office in the back of a pickup truck is “unacceptable,” a city Department of Public Health spokesman said after images of a contractor stepping on the bodies while unloading them from the truck bed were captured over the weekend. A photographer for The Philadelphia Inquirer captured images of the delivery of five or six bodies that were enclosed in white body bags and covered by mats in the back of the pickup truck Sunday afternoon. The bodies were delivered to a facility where the city has secured several refrigerated trailers to help with an increased need for body storage from hospitals and private funeral homes. James Garrow, a spokesman for Philadelphia’s public health department, said Tuesday that the delivery was an isolated occurrence that was not up to the standard transportation protocols.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has made available at no cost 700 single-occupancy dorm rooms for front-line workers who need a safe place to stay during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Gina Raimondo said Tuesday. The rooms are for health care workers, nursing home employees, public safety personnel and others at high risk of contracting the virus who do not want to worry about infecting family members by staying at home, the Democrat said at her daily news briefing. The rooms are not for people who have tested positive for the disease and need to stay in isolation. Laundry and meal service are available for a fee, she said. The Rhode Island Department of Health reported 394 additional cases of COVID-19 and 16 new deaths Tuesday. The 394 new cases, a single-day high since the pandemic began, bring the total number of positive cases in the state to 5,500. The state now has 171 deaths.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Some beaches in the state reopened Tuesday, with mayors and other leaders enthusiastically telling people to soak in the sun while being careful and continuing coronavirus precautions like social distancing. But other beach towns took a more cautious approach, citing federal guidelines for determining whether the spread of the virus had slowed that have not yet been met in South Carolina. Part of the struggle for local governments is determining where the state is in terms of the pandemic’s spread. State health officials quietly changed their estimate of the peak over the weekend from April 30 to sometime the week before. But while the number of new COVID-19 cases from April 12 to April 19 dropped by nearly 17% in South Carolina, the number of coronavirus tests done over that same period fell more than 27%, according to data from the Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nJefferson: Racing promoters plan to go ahead with an event at a track in Jefferson this weekend with some modifications for social distancing. Sprint car promoter and racing veteran Terry McCarl is bringing the Open Wheel Nationals to Park Jefferson Speedway on Saturday. But the drivers won’t be racing for a packed house. Instead only 700 tickets have been sold for a speedway that seats more than 4,000, KELO-TV reports. McCarl said that should give each person more than 6 feet of distance from the next fan. Concessions will be limited with distancing marks on the ground. And attendees are encouraged to bring a covering for their faces. Gov. Kristi Noem is one of the few governors who hasn’t issued a statewide stay-at-home order.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee announced Monday that businesses across the majority of the state will begin reopening as early as next week. The Republican governor said his mandatory safer-at-home order will expire April 30, which will pave the way for 89 out of the state’s 95 counties to begin opening businesses. However, Lee’s announcement does not apply to the state’s counties with the largest cities, including Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Madison, Shelby and Sullivan counties – areas that are not overseen by Tennessee’s Department of Health but have their own public health districts. Some businesses will be allowed to reopen as early as April 27, but it’s unclear exactly which ones will be granted such clearance. Lee told reporters such details would be finalized by his economy recovery team later this week. Most state parks will reopen Friday.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Most state parks reopened Monday as the state began what Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said will be a gradual unraveling of restrictions that were put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Eager hikers and fishermen lined up early as parks reopened for the first time since temporarily closing April 7 as part of statewide social distancing restrictions. At Enchanted Rock State Natural Area in the Hill Country, about 120 people made reservations Monday to enter one of Texas’ most popular park destinations, park ranger Tina Johnson said. Visitors had to remain in their car while grabbing trail maps, and signs reminded them to wear masks and keep 6 feet apart from other hikers. In Houston, dozens of families flocked early to Sheldon Lake State Park, where most but not all visitors wore masks as required.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: All but one of the state’s 28 confirmed coronavirus deaths have been people over the age of 55, health officials said Monday. That breakdown mirrors national trends: More than 9 in 10 of the 15,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the United States were in that age group, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest reported death among Utah residents was a 68-year-old man who was serving as a senior missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Allen Dee Pace, of Willard, had been serving with his wife in Detroit when he was diagnosed with COVID-19 in early April, said church spokesman Daniel Woodruff. He died Saturday. Utah Department of Health spokesman Tom Hudachko said 27 of the state’s 28 deaths have been people over the age of 55. The vast majority had underlying health conditions and died in hospitals, state epidemiologist Angela Dunn said.\n\nVermont\n\nMarshfield: The board of the struggling Vermont State Colleges system on Monday considered a plan to close three campuses because of added financial troubles brought by the coronavirus outbreak, while earlier in the day students and other critics protested in a car parade through Montpelier. Under a proposal announced by Chancellor Jeb Spaulding on Friday, the two campuses of Northern Vermont University in Johnson and Lyndon and the campus of Vermont Technical College in Randolph, which has another campus in Williston, would close. Liberal arts programs in Johnson and Lyndon would be moved to Castleton University. Not every program would be transferable, Spaulding said. The board and chancellor said they received more than 1,000 emails over the weekend from students, faculty and community members, with some painful stories. The schools’ faculty assemblies and unions voted no confidence in Spaulding, and a petition was started to keep the Northern Vermont University at Lyndon campus open.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Staff at the University of Virginia Medical Center threw away convention to find a way to extend the life of personal protective equipment in the face of the highly communicable and deadly new coronavirus, The Daily Progress reports. With a pandemic raging, staff across the center’s departments worked to find ways of extending the life of protective gear as shortages of N95 masks and other equipment used when treating patients grew critical in other parts of the country struck by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Staff wound up playing MacGyver with a robot designed to clean hospital rooms of virulent organisms, turning it into a virus-killing, gear-cleaning, ultraviolet ray gun called Tru-D. Set at maximum power, Tru-D can disinfect hundreds of masks with each 20-minute cycle.\n\nWashington\n\nPasco: The sheriff of a county in eastern Washington state is telling residents he will not enforce Gov. Jay Inslee’s stay-at-home orders or any guidelines “that infringe on your constitutional rights.” Franklin County Sheriff J.D. Raymond sent a letter to constituents Monday in which he said he does believe the coronavirus pandemic is real and “needs to be dealt with appropriately.” “I believe that social distancing and taking appropriate and proper steps to slow the spread of the virus and control its transmission is important,” Raymond said. But Raymond, who has been sheriff for six years in the county of about 95,000 people whose biggest city is Pasco, also said he believes adults are capable of policing themselves, and “we have the capability of adjusting our habits to these trying times.” KOMO-TV reports Raymond thinks local businesses and houses of worship can reopen while adhering to strict social distancing standards.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: The city responded Monday to a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union that raised concerns with officials’ plans to clear a homeless encampment. Authorities in Wheeling began efforts last week to remove informal living setups erected in a section of city-owned property after receiving numerous criminal complaints from residents and contractors, The Intelligencer reports. The West Virginia ACLU chapter asked the city Sunday to commit to halting the removal of the encampments and instead establish housing options for the individuals who would be displaced, according to a copy of the letter obtained by news outlets. The organization contended that clearing the camp would go against the statewide shelter-in-place order meant to protect against the spread of the coronavirus – as well as Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommending homeless encampments not be vacated. Wheeling City Manager Robert Herron said Monday that officials were reviewing the concerns but did not say whether they would be addressed, according to news outlets.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican leaders of the Legislature asked the conservative-controlled state Supreme Court on Tuesday to block an order from Gov. Tony Evers’ administration extending a stay-at-home order until May 26. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald asked the Supreme Court to take the case directly, a move that would skip lower courts and get a final ruling sooner. Evers on Thursday announced he was directing state Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm to extend the order closing most nonessential businesses from April 24 to May 26. Vos and Fitzgerald said Tuesday that there was “immense frustration” with the extension. They argue that Palm exceeded her authority in issuing it. Evers has said he believes the order was made legally. Vos and Fitzgerald said the order is eroding the economy and liberty of people in the state.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Flanked by bodyguards wearing virus-protection face masks, Gov. Mark Gordon told about 100 raucous protesters Monday that he didn’t know when Wyoming would get back to normal but was talking with state officials about how to reopen businesses. On the one-month mark after his orders to close schools and a variety of businesses to limit the spread of the coronavirus, he came out of the Capitol to engage with the group carrying the U.S. and the Gadsden “Don’t Tread on Me” flags and signs reading “Don’t Flatten the Economy” and “Defend Liberty.” Gordon began by reading a prayer but didn’t quiet the group, who demanded to know what businesses and jobs he thought were essential. “They’re all essential!” somebody else shouted before Gordon could answer. Wyoming’s measures set to run through at least April 30 aren’t as strict as those in neighboring states that have issued statewide stay-at-home orders, Gordon pointed out.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/22"}]}

The lineup features the most iconic groups in the genre: Iron Maiden, Guns N' Roses, Judas Priest, AC/DC, Tool and Metallica.\n\nFormer Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne was scheduled to perform at the festival, but pulled out in July due to ongoing health issues. He was replaced by English heavy metal band Judas Priest.\n\nOsbourne's absence will be impossible to ignore, and it's expected that at least one or two of the bands performing at the festival will pay tribute to the \"Prince of Darkness,\" especially because Metallica toured with Osbourne during the band's early years and Judas Priest has shared the stage with him on numerous occasions. During a 2019 interview, Maynard James Keenan of Tool referred to Osbourne and Black Sabbath as his earliest musical influences.\n\nAll of the performances will be entertaining and impressive, to say the least. Each band features high-level production value during every tour in the form of stunning visuals, themed stage setups, and an overabundance of pyrotechnics and on-stage explosions. Combine all of that with the vigor, mischievousness, spirit and angst of heavy metal, each band's live show is certain to be an unforgettable experience.\n\nHere is what we are hoping to hear — and see — from each band.\n\nFriday\n\nIron Maiden\n\nAs someone who has never seen Iron Maiden, I'm excited to see what the British heavy metal icons will bring to the festival. The band's last performance was in August at the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany as part of \"The Future Past\" tour and featured many classics such as \"Stranger In A Strange Land,\" \"The Prisoner,\" \"Can I Play With Madness\" and of course \"The Trooper,\" which no Maiden performance can exclude.\n\nThe band dusted off some classics from the 1986 album \"Somewhere Back In Time\" and opened each show with \"Caught Somewhere in Time,\" which hadn't been played since 1987. Fans also got the first live performances of \"Alexander the Great.\"\n\nWith three shows in Canada in September and October before the final tour date at Power Trip, I'm hoping lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and the rest of the band will treat the Power Trip to more rarely played songs such as \"Powerslave\" and \"Sea of Madness.\"\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nIt's been said that the members of Iron Maiden are the undisputed kings of Big Metal Shows with their stage setup and pyrotechnics, and that it's \"a religious experience.\" So, I'm looking forward to seeing what exactly that entails.\n\nMost longtime fans of the genre know that Iron Maiden shows are iconic. They've been the stuff of legend for decades. One has to wonder if playing at a festival like Power Trip only ups the ante, so to speak, on what Iron Maiden does to further that legend at a one-of-a-kind show that should be remembered for a long, long time by those who attend.\n\n—Andrew John\n\nGuns N' Roses\n\nGuns N' Roses already has something special to offer locals who watch the band at Power Trip — the energetic live performance its members are known for.\n\nThe last time Guns N' Roses performed in the area — when the group headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2016 — it was a special occasion for the reunited lineup featuring frontman Axl Rose with guitarist Slash and bassist Duff McKagan. But there was a problem. No, the band didn't pull any of its infamous antics of the past such as showing up late or calling the show early, but Rose had to perform the two-and-a-half-hour set both weekends with a broken foot sitting in a throne loaned to him by Dave Grohl.\n\nSince then, the original members have been making up two decades apart and continued to tour arenas and stadiums around the globe. It's hard to say when fans will see a new album, but the Guns have released three new singles since 2021.\n\nGuns N' Roses' 25-30 song recent setlists feature many of the known hits from \"Appetite For Destruction,\" \"Use Your Illusion I\" and \"Use Your Illusion II.\" McKagan is also known to perform lead vocals on selections from the 1993 covers album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" such as The Misfits' \"Attitude,\" The Damned's \"New Rose\" or UK Subs' \"Down on the Farm.\" An intriguing addition since 2017 is the Glen Campbell tune \"Wichita Lineman.\"\n\nI don't expect anything less than Guns N' Roses bringing an ear-splitting, high-powered good time, but why not invite metal god and Misfits frontman Glenn Danzig for \"Attitude\" or do something crazy like bring out Bob Dylan for that cover of \"Knockin' On Heavens Door?\"\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nSaturday\n\nJudas Priest\n\nJudas Priest celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2022 with a large world tour, and the group hasn't performed since last December, but when you're asked to replace Ozzy Osbourne, you don't say no. It's hard to say whether Priest will stay in anniversary mode and perform the previous tour's set that's full of classics such as \"Breaking The Law\" and \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" and \"Living After Midnight\" or throw some other songs in the mix like \"Never Satisfied\" or its cover of Joan Baez' \"Diamonds and Rust.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, a set full of classic Judas Priest songs sounds like fun, so I'm hoping for the 50th anniversary show.\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nAC/DC\n\nIn 2020, AC/DC released the album “Power Up,” but left fans waiting on tour dates coming out of the pandemic. Power Trip will mark the band's first show in seven years, so there's a lot of warranted excitement around the performance — especially considering the obstacles the group faced in 2016. That's when frontman Brian Johnson left the band because of medical issues and bassist Cliff Williams retired, but both returned in 2018, including former drummer Phil Rudd, who was fired in 2015 due to legal issues.\n\nAC/DC’s comeback will feature Johnson, Williams, guitarists Angus Young and Stevie Young, but Rudd will not be at Power Trip. Matt Laug, who has drummed for Alice Cooper, Slash’s Snakepit and Alanis Morissette, will fill in.\n\nI have no doubts that AC/DC will deliver and Power Trip will be a renewal of the legendary Australian band that is also celebrating 50 years. I'm hoping to hear classics such as \"Thunderstruck,\" \"Shoot To Thrill\" and \"Moneytalks.\"\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nAsk anyone who has been to an AC/DC concert and they'll tell you that it's one of the best music experiences of their lives. I've had people describe it to me as \"mind-blowing,\" \"unforgettable\" and \"different every time.\" So, I want to see what makes this concert, in particular, unique and unforgettable.\n\nI've been to some amazing concerts in my day, over a 27-year stretch, but I'm told that AC/DC will rock harder than maybe anyone, so I have to see what that looks like for myself.\n\nAC/DC has rarely played with other rock legends onstage, although Axl Rose sang for the band in 2016 while Brian Johnson dealt with hearing issues. But that has me wondering whether they could bring a rock legend out at Power Trip. Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl has performed \"Back in Black\" with Johnson and has said that he would love to perform with AC/DC one day. Maybe at Power Trip he gets his chance. That would really be something.\n\n—Andrew John\n\nSunday\n\nTool\n\nThe best way to describe a Tool concert based on my own experience is \"surrealistic,\" but there's never been anything ordinary in the band's music, which extends to its live performances. Consider Tool to be more of an audio and visual affair than a concert. Frontman Maynard James Keenan doesn't thirst for being front and center. The music is the purpose and will be the main idea throughout the entire set.\n\nFor those who attended Desert Trip in 2016 and saw former Pink Floyd co-founder Roger Waters' performance, I expect the atmosphere of Tool's live show to be the same and unlike any of the other bands performing at Power Trip, but without the inflatable pig and heavy political themes.\n\nI'm hoping Tool will recognize the 30th anniversary of the album \"Undertow\" and perform some songs that have only appeared sporadically in recent setlists. Songs such as \"Sober,\" \"Undertow\" and \"Flood\" are the epitome of Tool as a band, but it's going to be all about what fits into the live presentation.\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nMetallica\n\nPower Trip will end Sunday with Metallica, one of the world's most famous metal bands that was already selling out arenas before MTV played its videos. The band is currently on its M72 tour playing in stadiums around the globe, performing songs from the 1983 debut album “Kill ‘Em All” to the 2023 album “72 Seasons.”\n\nMetallica performed in August at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood and it’s likely many who attended that show will be at Power Trip.\n\nMetallica has acknowledged special occasions, so I expect a remarkable show to end Power Trip. Maybe something like the Big 4 show in 2010 at the Empire Polo Club when Metallica performed Diamond Head’s “Am I Evil?” with members from other the bands. Maybe even a guest appearance by King Diamond, or one of the many artists such as St. Vincent or Slipknot vocalist Corey Taylor who performed on the \"Black Album\" tribute, \"The Metallica Blacklist.\"\n\n—Brian Blueskye\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing how loud these guys are, and how well my earplugs work. In all seriousness, I live in La Quinta, not far from the polo grounds and can often hear music from the festivals from my porch. But I hear that Metallica is super loud live, and I can imagine most of the surrounding neighborhoods will feel that once the group opens with \"Ecstasy of Gold.\"\n\nI'm also looking forward to seeing how much of the crowd is older Metallica fans versus younger listeners, many of whom I assume will merely be there to see an iconic band before it's too late. Metallica is of course a group that has fans from every generation, but most of the truest fans are likely between the ages of 40-60. I'll bet many of them can still rock as hard as the younger fans.\n\nI'll be right there alongside all of them, watching a band I've listened to for decades but have yet to see live.\n\n—Andrew John\n\nBrian Blueskye is the arts and entertainment reporter for The Desert Sun, where he covers all the music festivals in the Coachella Valley.

In the three years since her previous release, the singer went through a divorce, quit drinking, become a death doula, started the observational podcast “What I’m Looking At” and toured and recorded with Loma, the trio she formed with Dan Duszynski and Jonathan Meiburg. After setting the tone with an experimental mood piece that finds her repeating the line \"What is your wish?\" she settles into an album that favors more song-oriented fare without abandoning the eccentricities that make that first track what it is. The result will leave you haunted.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 5. The Trunk Space, 1124 N.

The album follows 2017's “Moh Lhean,” which found him adopting a more reflective world view in the wake of a health scare while at the same time drifting into haunted psychedelic folk. As PopMatters noted, “It’s as if he has suddenly come to terms with his place in the world and that has translated into music which is warmer, looser, and more liberated.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 6.

Q magazine calls it \"a stunning, stealthy, faintly malevolent collection of songs that serve as a reminder of this songwriter's power and innovation.\" It's kind of amazing how much of her edge she's managed to retain more than 30 years after grabbing our attention by the throat.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 8.

They're fronted by singer-guitarists Devon Allman (Gregg's son) and Duane Betts (Dickey's son, whose first name is a tip of the hat to the late Duane Allman). And their bassist is Berry Duane Oakley, the son of Allmans bassist Berry Oakley.

They're playing Mesa on a tour celebrating their 20th anniversary. \"The Wilderness,\" their latest album, earned a perfect score from the reviewer at the Austin Chronicle, who called it \"textured, ornate, and somehow seeping into the deepest parts of you.\" The Line of Best Fit also loved \"The Wilderness,\" calling is \"thrillingly foreign yet familiar in its finest moments.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 11.

But despite the introspective nature of the lyrics and the way the first song sounds like it was captured in the middle of a dream, it doesn’t feel like the work of a bedroom-pop auteur. Too many of the album’s highlights rock too much to warrant that description, from the richly orchestrated pop charms of “The Bus Song” to the post-punk grinding of “1 Billion Dogs.” And the followup will be here by the time she gets to Phoenix.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 11.

We’re a new band. We just came out.\" They've actually been doing this since 1991, and it shows. In a good way. They're a well-oiled, versatile hits-of-another-galaxy machine, their brand of brainy indie pop tending to favor the McCartney side of Beatlesque.

Total streams for the album are quickly approaching half-a-billion across all platforms.

So I for one was not the slightest bit surprised to see them bring in Julian Casablancas of the Strokes to co-produce their latest effort, “City Club.” Clash Music said most tracks \"wouldn’t render them out of place in an episode of the enigmatic ‘Twin Peaks.’”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, July 17.

It's all profoundly psychedelic, willfully eccentric and given to outbursts of attention-grabbing bass heroics with serious pop sensibilities to wash down all the weirdness. Paste magazine praised the new album as \"challenging music,\" but the challenge was clearly more in the creation than the listening.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, July 20. Marquee Theatre, 730 N.

Released in 1992, his first album with Cracker wasn't nearly as adventurous but its best songs made the most of Lowery's cult of personality, topping the modern-rock radio charts with \"Teen Angst (What the World Needs Now).\" These co-headlining tours look great on paper and they're even better live.\n\nDetail: 8 p.m. Saturday, July 20.

They arrive in on a tour celebrating the 10th anniversary of \"These Four Walls,\" a debut the A.V. Club said was \"like a 50-minute, 11-song tour through the Scottish scene’s past, present, and future, emphasizing how much of the country’s best pop music has been concerned with transporting listeners to specific places, so we can all linger there together.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, July 23.

Club noted, Honus Honus and his bandmates were \"reborn as hook-focused, crossover experimentalists\" on \"an enthusiastic belly flop into accessibility.\" Given the move into poppier waters and their old eccentric ways, it almost stands to reason that they're touring with Rebecca Black, the viral video sensation behind a single celebrated as the worst song ever, \"Friday.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Thursday, July 25.

In reviewing their latest album, \"I Want to Die in New Orleans,\" which hit the Billboard album charts at No. 9, HipHopDX wrote, \"Have they actually changed the world of music itself?

Well, he's still on the road five years later, offering the upscale country hits (and pop crossovers) that gave him more than 30 chart-toppers.

From \"Planet Claire\" to \"Dance This Mess Around,\" it still sounds like it dropped in from another, much quirkier planet, wrapped in kitschy day-glo yellow. And it spawned one of the more unlikely mainstream breakthroughs of the decade — \"Rock Lobster,\" a surf-guitar-fueled party track that wore its debt to Yoko Ono proudly on its vintage sleeve.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 14.

But the more inspired moments of \"Kyle Craft & Showboat Honey\" are closer in spirit to the psychedelic pop years, from the mesmerizing drone of \"Broken Mirror Pose\" to the post-Cream psychedelic blues of \"Oh!

The storm made landfall at 10:40 p.m. EST near the town of Haulover, about 30 miles south of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph, about 2 mph shy of Category 5.\n\nIota was the first Category 5 hurricane of the season and the strongest hurricane this late in the calendar year ever recorded, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nHurricane watches and warnings were in effect the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras.\n\nThe Hurricane Center said: \"This is a catastrophic situation unfolding for northeastern Nicaragua with an extreme storm surge of 15-20 feet forecast along with destructive winds and potentially 30 inches of rainfall. It is exacerbated by the fact that it should make landfall in almost the exact same location that category 4 Hurricane Eta did about two weeks ago.\"\n\nThis is only the second time in history that Nicaragua has been hit by two hurricanes in one season, AccuWeather said.\n\nEvacuations were being conducted from low-lying areas in Nicaragua and Honduras near their shared border, which appeared to be Iota's likely landfall. Winds and rain were already being felt on the Nicaraguan coast Sunday night.\n\nCoronavirus updates:Promising news from Moderna on the vaccine front; US soars past 11M infections; Michigan scraps indoor dining\n\nAll of Honduras was on high alert, with compulsory evacuations that began before the weekend. By Sunday evening, 63,500 people were reported to be in 379 shelters just in the northern coastal region.\n\nNicaraguan officials said that by late Sunday afternoon about 1,500 people, nearly half of them children, had been evacuated from low-lying areas in the country's northeast, including all the inhabitants of Cayo Misquitos. Authorities said 83,000 people in that region were in danger.\n\nEta already wreaked havoc. It hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, killing at least 120 people as torrential rains caused flash floods and mudslides in parts of Central America and Mexico. Then it meandered across Cuba, the Florida Keys and around the Gulf of Mexico before slogging ashore again near Cedar Key, Florida, and dashing across Florida and the Carolinas.\n\nIota was forecast to drop 8 to 16 inches of rain in northern Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and southern Belize, with as much as 30 inches in isolated spots. Costa Rica and Panama could also experience heavy rain and possible flooding, the hurricane center said.\n\nIota is the record 30th named storm of this year’s extraordinarily busy Atlantic hurricane season. Such activity has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.\n\nThe official end of hurricane season is Nov. 30.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.\n\n'This makes me giddy':Moderna's candidate COVID-19 vaccine looks to protect 94.5% of those who get it, trial shows\n\nI volunteered for Moderna's COVID vaccine trial:Here's why I think I got the vaccine, not placebo", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/11/30/atlantic-hurricane-season-2023-ends/71731429007/", "title": "Atlantic hurricane season 2023 ends: How bad was it? How many ...", "text": "It's over: The six-month Atlantic hurricane season finally comes to an end Thursday.\n\n\"We don't foresee any more tropical development,\" NOAA's lead hurricane forecaster Matthew Rosencrans told USA TODAY this week. The 2023 Atlantic hurricane season is over, he said.\n\nOverall, it was a season with lots of storms (20), but fortunately only three landfalls in the U.S.\n\nIndeed, it was a very active season, but except for Harold, Idalia and Ophelia, the U.S. was repeatedly spared from disastrous storms supercharged by record heat in the ocean. Major, potentially calamitous storms such as Hurricane Lee – which was a Category 5 out in the open Atlantic – and Category 4 Hurricane Franklin both swerved away from U.S. shores.\n\nHere's what to know about the end of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season:\n\n4th-most active season on record\n\n\"It was quite busy for named storms,\" Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach told USA TODAY this week. \"The 20 named storms is tied with 1933 for the 4th most on record, trailing only 2020 (30), 2005 (28) and 2021 (21).\"\n\nSeven storms were hurricanes and three intensified to major hurricanes, NOAA said.\n\nAn average season has 14 named storms, of which seven are typically hurricanes.\n\nOne measurement that scientists use to determine a season's strength is known as ACE (Accumulated Cyclonic Energy), which was somewhat above normal, and met NOAA's definition of an above-normal season, Klotzbach said.\n\nEl Niño vs the warm Atlantic\n\nBefore the season started, forecasters were confronted with two competing factors: A strong El Niño, which tends to reduce Atlantic hurricane activity due to the wind shear it produces, and record-warm water in the Atlantic Ocean, which would favor an increased number of storms.\n\nBoth factors ended up playing a role in the hurricane season:\n\n“The Atlantic basin produced the most named storms of any El Niño influenced year in the modern record,” said Rosencrans. “The record-warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic provided a strong counterbalance to the traditional El Niño impacts.”\n\nOverall, El Niño acted to protect the U.S. from what could have been an even more active year due to the unusually warm waters of the Atlantic, which were caused in part by climate change.\n\nSo, which factor 'won' the season?\n\n\"Overall, I would say that the warm Atlantic won, in that we ended up with below-normal shear in a strong El Niño year,\" Klotzbach told USA TODAY. \"Basically, we would have expected a lot more shear in the western Atlantic given the strength of El Niño\"\n\nRosencrans told USA TODAY that although the warm Atlantic might have \"won\" overall, wind shear from El Niño did have an impact on the Gulf of Mexico, which had a quiet season (except for Idalia).\n\nIn the tropical Atlantic Ocean, sea-surface temperatures were at record warm levels during the peak of the 2023 hurricane season. These warm waters and associated low pressures in the tropical Atlantic were likely the reason why El Niño did not have its normal effect across the tropical Atlantic, Colorado State University forecasters said.\n\nHurricane season ends:See how 4th most active season produces just 3 landfalling storms\n\nMeteorologist Jeff Masters of Yale Climate Connections told USA TODAY that the level of activity in the Atlantic was far higher than was typical for an El Niño year, so he said the record-warm waters “won” out over the usual suppressive factors (chiefly, higher wind shear) that El Niño usually brings. Wind shear over the tropical Atlantic in 2023 was much lower than usual for an El Niño year.\n\nFortunately, the steering pattern in 2023 was typical of that for an El Niño year, with a weaker and farther-east Bermuda-Azores high leading to most storms recurving out to sea without affecting the U.S., Masters said.\n\nThe high \"helped to allow storms to turn north well before reaching the U.S. or even the Caribbean,\" said University of Miami meteorologist Brian McNoldy on his blog this week.\n\nWas climate change a factor in the warm Atlantic waters?\n\nMasters told USA TODAY that the record-warm waters in the Atlantic in 2023 were largely caused by an unusual atmospheric circulation pattern brought on by the rapid transition from a three-year La Niña event to strong El Niño conditions.\n\n\"While the El Niño/La Niña cycle is natural, there has been research published linking the unusual circulation patterns of 2023 to human-caused climate change,\" he said.\n\nClimate change has also been causing a slow increase in Atlantic sea temperatures of about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees F) in the tropical Atlantic’s main development region for hurricanes in the past century (during August-October).\n\nDamage was lowest since 2015\n\nAccording to global reinsurance broker Gallagher Re, the total damage from Atlantic named storms was the lowest since 2015. Three storms each caused over $100 million in damage:\n\nHurricane Idalia: $2.4 billion\n\nTropical Storm Ophelia: $375 million\n\nHurricane Lee: $150 million\n\nHurricane Idalia was the only U.S. landfalling hurricane in 2023. It made landfall as a category-3 hurricane on Aug. 30 near Keaton Beach, Florida, causing storm surge inundation of 7 to 12 feet and widespread rainfall flooding in Florida and throughout the Southeast, NOAA said.\n\nIdalia led to seven direct and three indirect deaths in the U.S., Masters said.\n\nTropical Storm Ophelia made landfall as a strong tropical storm with 70-mph winds on Emerald Isle, North Carolina, on Sept. 23, causing widespread heavy rainfall, gusty winds and significant river and storm surge flooding in portions of eastern North Carolina, NOAA said.\n\nEastern Pacific storms also wreaked havoc\n\nSeveral hurricanes from the eastern Pacific made news in 2023:\n\nTropical Storm Hilary brought widespread heavy rainfall and flooding to Southern California, with some areas receiving up to 600% of their normal August rainfall. According to NOAA, Hilary led to the first ever issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings for the Southern California coastline by National Hurricane Center.\n\nHurricane Otis made landfall near Acapulco, Mexico, on Oct. 25 as a category-5 hurricane with sustained winds of 165 mph. Otis holds the record as the strongest landfalling hurricane in the eastern Pacific after undergoing rapid intensification, in which wind speeds increased by 115 mph in 24 hours, according to NOAA. At least 50 people died in Mexico due to Otis.\n\nHurricane Dora, a category-4 storm that began in the eastern Pacific but then crossed into the central Pacific, passed south of Hawaii in early August, marking the first major hurricane in the central Pacific basin since 2020. The strong gradient between a high-pressure system to the north and Dora to the south was a contributing factor to the catastrophic, wind-whipped wildfires in Hawaii that killed more than 100 people, NOAA reported.\n\nContributing: Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/07/10/republicans-alienate-gen-z-voters-inflation-housing-family-values/70389574007/", "title": "GOP abandons Gen Z Republicans – and are taking the US down ...", "text": "I vividly remember watching every single 2016 Republican presidential debate. I was 13 years old, new to politics and transfixed by the Titanic force that washed over the country seven years ago. My only previous experience with politics was watching a map slowly fill with red and blue (more blue) in 2012.\n\nNow, Donald Trump stood center stage. To his left came a statement that could have been uttered by any of the men on the debate stage. “We’re on the verge,” said the TV set, “of being the first generation of Americans that leave our children worse off than ourselves.”\n\nMy 13-year-old mind – five years removed from the pressures of reality – wrote these claims off as hyperbolic. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich, among others, prevaricated some version of this warning every time they spoke. I now realize that they weren’t pessimists; they were prophets.\n\nRubio, Kasich and every Republican also-ran who sounded the alarm seven years ago were right, but even they were far too late. The Republican Party has drifted away from young people, leaving them unmoored in the midst of an economic and social maelstrom.\n\nThe Republicans sell out\n\nIt didn’t have to be this way. Before I was even born, the stage was set for the decline of my country. The promise of the Reagan fusionists was everlasting economic prosperity at the small cost of libertarians running the show. Gross domestic product would go up every year, prosperity would reign in America and Republicans would be electorally ascendant in perpetuity.\n\nThat didn’t last long.\n\nThe Reagan agenda emptied out America. Globalization offshored millions of jobs, decimating the well-paying low-education careers that allowed decades of easy access to homeownership and prosperity. My generation grew up surrounded by closed factories, shadows of once-vibrant Main Streets and – at least in Appalachia – an oppressive opioid crisis.\n\nIt is nothing less than a slap in the face to see the current Republican Party blissfully embracing the same economic liberalism that gave us a nation in decline.\n\nWhere am I – a young social and economic conservative – to find a political home? In the same party as the free marketeers who wreaked havoc upon the middle class? Am I to make common cause with the libertarians who sold America’s future for short-term success?\n\nRepublican Party not interested in Gen Z\n\nThe Democrats – or at least the populists and left-wingers among them – recognize some of these problems, but their solutions are wrong at best and counterproductive at worst. On any number of issues, Democrats default to heavy-handed government action on average Americans instead of going after the bad actors.\n\nTake student loans, where instead of penalizing colleges for obscene tuition prices, Democrats attempted to force taxpayers to foot the bill.\n\nStill with the Clintons?Dear fellow conservatives: Please stop complaining about Hillary Clinton\n\nTo repeat the refrain from seven years ago, this generation is decidedly worse off than their parents. Politicians may pay lip service to generational struggles, but no prominent voice seems bothered by young people being shut out of their own society.\n\nCertainly not on the Republican side of the ledger, which has seemingly evaluated the electoral returns and decided on this as the default response to unsatisfied 20-somethings: “You got a raw deal. Tough.”\n\nRepublican leadership has seemingly sworn off appealing to young people, or at least temporarily surrendered. They do so at their extreme peril, as Generation Z becomes an ever-greater share of the electorate. Shoulder-shrugging in response to young people being locked out of their own society will not work much longer.\n\nThe lost dream of homeownership\n\nI care not for the internal Republican squabbling over partisan orthodoxy. I avoid social media like the plague, but when I must venture into the wastelands of Twitter, my eyes are captured by boundless right-wing infighting. Flame wars wage over which of the endlessly enumerating Republican presidential candidates has the right view on Ukraine. Which conservative talking head is more correct about today’s cultural outrage? Around and around we go.\n\nMy concerns – like many of my fellow Gen Zers – are far more provincial. Can I buy a house? Can I afford to get married? Can I support a family? The most basic pillars of American society, once available to all, are becoming increasingly illusive. This is to say nothing about buying a house or raising a family comfortably. For many young Americans, those ships have already sailed.\n\nAffordable housing has ceased to exist. Homeownership, long foundational to the American dream, is only accessible to young people on the far edges of major cities. Because the country was so hollowed out and opportunities only exist in the metros, demand far outstrips supply. Every day, my D.C.-area friends and I mull just how awful of a commute we’re willing to endure for the price of owning, not renting.\n\nInflation prices out millennials, Gen Z:Buying a home was a dream for millennials like me. For many, it won't be possible.\n\nBeyond economics\n\nThe GOP has decided to wage an all-out war on woke. As a young social conservative, I applaud their efforts to finally say “no” to a culture descending into madness, yet it’s telling that nobody can define what \"woke\" is. To steal a term from the other side, nobody is asking what the “root causes” of woke are.\n\nAre we surprised that American society is fragmenting as the family is breaking apart? The United States has the highest rate of single-parent households in the world. Just under 1 in 4 Americans grow up without a father at home.\n\nThe war on woke distracts from the serious thinkers doing serious work on fixing American families.\n\nYoung conservatives are adrift in the movement. Instead of focusing on exploding inflation and economic crisis, the Republican Party is occupied with a 3-year-old election. Instead of taking colleges to task for gouging students with tuition, the Republican Party pontificates endlessly about personal responsibility. Instead of fighting the root causes of the culture war – collapsing family life – the Republican Party passes anti-\"woke\" legislation while unable to define the term.\n\nThis is the rot of liberalism within the Republican Party. Older party elites were brought up on a desire to keep government out of so-called private affairs, like the family. They have forgotten that the family is the fundamental political unit. Without strong families, the country falls apart. The well-being of young people, those who are trying to form families, is the highest purpose of government.\n\nThe GOP is a rudderless party\n\nThe Republican Party elites are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Family formation is at an all-time low. The life expectancy is in free-fall. The ship is sinking. Instead of having any of these conversations, the powers that be think it very important to debate the debt ceiling.\n\nThe dirty little secret is that most of the people making decisions in the Republican Party – but also the country at large – will not have to contend with their consequences. The same generation has ruled America for 30 years, and human biology will soon come calling. Instead of recognizing their time is up and retiring, members of this generation has decided they will be carried out – in coffins, if necessary.\n\nLest you think this sounds harsh, they inherited a world-historically wealthy country. They leave us a nation in decline. They have failed, in every conceivable way. The least they could do is not threaten to blow up the country every six months on their way out.\n\nRodge Reschini, a summer intern with USA TODAY Opinion, is a rising senior at Cornell University.

Here is where they are now and where they are heading.\n\nExtreme wind and storm surge from the remnants of a typhoon were powerful enough to uproot buildings in Alaska this weekend, and the storm it is still hanging around.\n\nHurricane Fiona brought over 2 feet of rain to portions of Puerto Rico, causing rivers to rage, demolishing a bridge in the torrent of water. Fiona caused an islandwide power outage, impacting nearly 1.5 million customers on Sunday. The storm is now forecast to strengthen into the Atlantic season’s first major hurricane.\n\nAnd after making landfall in southern Japan as a strong typhoon, causing damage and power outages, Nanmadol is turning right and heading up the spine of Japan towards Tokyo. From there, it heads toward Alaska.\n\nAre you impacted by these storms or know someone who is? Bookmark or share CNN’s lite site for fast connectivity.\n\nHurricane Fiona\n\nOver a foot of rain has fallen in much of Puerto Rico over the past three days. One reporting station north of Ponce reported over 2 feet of rain in the last 24 hours.\n\nThat is an astonishing amount. Sometimes as a meteorologist, you wonder, is this really going to happen? You don’t want to cry wolf.\n\nBut, on Friday, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center began warning of a foot of rainfall possible in Puerto Rico. By Saturday, they upped the rainfall forecast after seeing how much rainfall the storm produced in Guadeloupe (over 19 inches in 24 hours), providing as much of an advanced warning as possible.\n\nThis excessive rainfall forced rivers to rise higher than during Hurricane Maria.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows bridge swept away in Hurricane Fiona 02:09 - Source: CNN\n\nAs the storm moves Monday off the northern shore of the Dominican Republic, it will continue to bring flooding rains to Puerto Rico as the storm’s southerly flow draws moisture across the island.\n\nSouthern Puerto Rico can expect an additional 4 to 6 inches, with up to 10 inches maximum possible in some locations. That would result in a storm total of 12 to 20 inches of rain, with local maximums of 30 inches across portions of the island.\n\nThe center of Fiona will slowly move off the Dominican Republic’s north shore today. As it moves over open water, it is forecast to strengthen as it passes Turks and Caicos on Tuesday.\n\nWednesday, it is forecast to become the season’s first major hurricane in the Atlantic.\n\nFrom that day on, it is expected to curve to the northeast and track out to sea, threatening Bermuda later this week.\n\nLandfall in Bermuda isn’t out of the question, but it is like hitting a tiny bull’s eye in a vast ocean.\n\nI won’t feel really comfortable that the US East Coast is out of the woods until Fiona makes the turn in a couple of days and moves northeast.\n\nHowever, forecast models seem to be in very close consensus that this turn will happen, leaving high surf and rip currents as the potential hazards to the US eastern coastline.\n\nLive Updates\n\n• More than 300 FEMA responders are on the ground in Puerto Rico\n\n• “This is not Maria, this hurricane will not be Maria,” utility spokesperson vows\n\n• More than 1 million are still without power in Puerto Rico as Fiona churns in the Caribbean\n\nWorst storm surge since the early 1970s\n\nThe remnants of a typhoon lashed the western coast of Alaska all weekend. Although it is weakening, it was still hanging around early Monday.\n\nThe storm was so strong that winds were reported gusting up to 93 mph in Alaska. Storm surge pushed water levels over 10 feet in Nome, Alaska, the highest since a storm in November 1974.\n\nAnd the water level was slow to subside as the storm refused to leave, forcing the Alaska regional weather service office to compare it to an unwanted relative.\n\n“The storm is the uncle that comes over for a few days, makes a mess, & won’t leave. It will sleep on the couch along the northwest coast a few more days, but the worst is over & impacts will continue to fade,” it tweeted Sunday.\n\nBy Wednesday, the storm will have weakened enough to no longer be the dominant weather pattern across the state.\n\nThen all attention will move to tracking the storm now hitting Japan.\n\nTyphoon Nanmadol\n\n“One of the strongest typhoons ever seen,” the World Meteorological Organization tweeted Sunday.\n\nPowerful Nanmadol made landfall in Kagoshima Prefecture on Sunday as the fourth-most powerful typhoon (by pressure) to hit mainland Japan.\n\nAhead of the storm, Kyushu authorities took the unusual step of issuing a rarely used “special warning” to convey the seriousness of the threat posed by the storm.\n\nA “large-scale disaster” could also be imminent, with extensive flooding and landslides, the Japan Meteorological Agency warned. “The highest level of vigilance is required for rising water levels and flooding of rivers, landslide disasters and flooding of lowlands,” it said on Sunday.\n\nThe storm has made a turn towards the northeast, traveling up the west coast of mainland Japan, before crossing over the country and back into the West Pacific.\n\nThe storm has weakened but will continue to deliver extreme rains, mudslides and storm surge as it tracks across the country.\n\nFrom Japan, it will travel out over the Pacific and arrive on Alaska’s doorstep later in the week.\n\n“While this storm is expected to curve north towards the southern Bering Sea, it will weaken significantly & not be anything out of the ordinary,” the weather service in Alaska tweeted Saturday. “It is not forecast to move into the Northern Bering” Sea.\n\nSo, the state can give a sigh of relief.", "authors": ["Judson Jones"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/phoenix-weather/2017/09/06/could-harvey-flooding-happen-phoenix/621644001/", "title": "Could Hurricane Harvey or Irma flooding happen in Phoenix?", "text": "Weldon B. Johnson\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nMany Phoenix-area residents have followed Hurricane Harvey and the devastating flooding in Houston, which has been a called 500-year or even a 1,000-year event.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida braces for Hurricane Irma, another historically strong storm expected to wreak havoc. Irma is a Category 5 storm (the highest level, as determined by wind speed) with sustained winds of 185 mph.\n\nPeople around Phoenix should keep in mind that we’re approaching the time when we could experience historic rain events of our own. Some of Arizona's worst flooding has occurred in August and September. In fact, we had a 1,000-year flood (meaning there is a 0.1 percent chance it could happen in any given year) here on Sept. 8, 2014.\n\nEarly September is often when our weather transitions out of monsoon mode (with warm, moist air coming out of the south to southeast) back to the usual pattern of fronts approaching from the west. That westerly flow is usually dry, but sometimes the remnants of a tropical storm or hurricane in the eastern Pacific Ocean or Gulf of California influence our weather.\n\nWhy this time of year?\n\nKen Waters, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix, explains.\n\n“During that transition period there is always a chance that something is brewing,” Waters said. “That’s the magic time we could get tropical moisture come up and, in some cases, produce enormous amounts of rain. Nothing like what’s happening in Houston, but we had our own version in 2014 when we had several tropical cyclones remnants affect our area.”\n\nMORE:Yes, Phoenix monsoon storms ARE worse than they used to be\n\nWaters was referring to several storms that caused flooding around the Valley in late August and September 2014. Those storms were severe by our standards, but didn't produce Harvey amounts of rain. Some cities in Texas received nearly 50 inches during that storm.\n\nOne major reason for the difference, Arizona State University climate researcher and professor Randy Cerveny said, is that Texas was hit with a full-on hurricane. We typically get what’s left over after those Pacific storms lose much of their energy.\n\n“When we get long-lasting rainfall, it’s usually the remnants,” Cerveny said. “We’ve only had a couple situations where a full-blown tropical storm makes it across the border into Arizona.\"\n\nA small amount can be dangerous\n\nPhoenix does not see the volume of rain that recently pummeled parts of the Gulf Coast, but it doesn’t take nearly as much to cause havoc here.\n\nOn Sept. 8, 2014, Phoenix saw an all-time record of 3.3 inches in a 24-hour period at Sky Harbor Airport and even more in other parts of the Valley. That amount paralyzed the city briefly and left motorists stranded in several feet of water on flooded highways. The storm caused flooding in several Valley neighborhoods with standing water in homes in Mesa and Phoenix in particular.\n\nMORE:‘Still feels like the flood happened yesterday’: The storm that changed Mesa\n\nThat storm was fueled by the remnants of Hurricane Norbert and it followed a strong monsoon storm less than a month earlier.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2014, a storm dropped more than 5 inches of rain near New River, north of Phoenix. The rain caused the closure of Interstate 17 for several hours along with closures of two dozen other roads in that area.\n\nFlash flooding forced swift-water rescues and the evacuation of at least one neighborhood and New River Elementary School.\n\nParts of south Phoenix received about an inch of rain that day and that was enough to flood homes in low-lying areas.\n\n“Our soils are different and our topography is different,” Cerveny said. “We don’t need nearly as much rain to cause a problem. If you stop and think about it, we get usually about eight to nine inches of rain a year. There are places (in Texas during Hurricane Harvey) now that had close to seven times that amount of rainfall.”\n\nContributing factors\n\nCerveny said the layout of Houston contributed to the severity of the flooding. The sprawl that has come along with growth there has not been handled well.\n\n“They’ve removed the wetlands,” Cerveny said. “They keep putting in suburbs with concrete and asphalt, so there is no place for the water to go.”\n\nAnd climate change worldwide is contributing to more major storms. Irma, the most powerful Atlantic Ocean hurricane ever recorded above the Caribbean and east of the Gulf of Mexico, comes along less than two weeks after Harvey.\n\nCerveny said there are too many meteorological variables to say any individual storm is a result of climate change, but that the phenomenon contributes to the increased intensity.\n\n“The idea here is that the likelihood of having more moisture in a storm is a result of global warming,” Cerveny said. “A warmer world means you’ll have more evaporation. More evaporation means more water in these storms.”\n\nThis year, a University of Arizona study concluded that the Phoenix area is being hit by more severe storms now than in years past. That could lead to more chances for flooding, considering how little rain it takes to cause problems here.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nArizona monsoon: Which parts of the Phoenix area get the most rain?\n\nWater-damaged Burton Barr Central Library in Phoenix won't reopen until June 2018", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/world/top-climate-weather-stories-2022/index.html", "title": "Devastating disasters and flickers of hope: These are the top climate ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFrom a small island in Polynesia to the white-sand beaches of Florida, the planet experienced a dizzying number of climate and extreme weather disasters in 2022.\n\nBlistering summer heat broke records in drought-stricken China, threatening lives and food production. In the United States, drought and sea level rise clashed at the mouth of the historically low Mississippi River. And in South Africa, climate change made rainfall that triggered deadly floods heavier and twice as likely to occur.\n\nYet against the backdrop of these catastrophic events, this year also sparked some glimmers of hope:\n\nScientists in the US successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it used – a huge step in the decades-long quest to replace fossil fuels with an infinite source of clean energy.\n\nAnd at the United Nations’ COP27 climate summit in Egypt, nearly 200 countries agreed to set up a fund to help poor, vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters they had little hand in causing.\n\n“There was some encouraging climate action in 2022, but we remain far off track to meet our goals of reducing global heat-trapping emissions and limiting future planetary warming,” Kristina Dahl, principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN. “There must be a stronger collective commitment and progress toward slashing emissions in 2023 if we are to keep climate extremes from becoming even more devastating.”\n\nHere are the top 10 climate and extreme weather stories of 2022.\n\n10. Tonga volcano eruption and global tsunami\n\nA zoomed-in view of the Tonga eruption, taken by Japan's Himawari-8 satellite, about 100 minutes after the eruption started. Simon Proud/Uni Oxford, RALSpace NCEO/Japan Meteorological Agency\n\nWhen the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted in January, it sent tsunami waves around the world. The blast itself was so loud it was heard in Alaska – roughly 6,000 miles away. The afternoon sky turned pitch black as heavy ash clouded Tonga’s capital and caused “significant damage” along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.\n\nThe underwater volcanic eruption also injected a huge cloud of ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, more than 30 kilometers (around 19 miles) above sea level, according to data from NASA satellites.\n\nAt the time, experts said the event was likely not large enough to impact global climate.\n\nBut months later, scientists found that the eruption actually belched an enormous amount of water vapor into the Earth’s stratosphere – enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The massive plume of water vapor will likely contribute to more global warming at ground-level for the next several years, NASA scientists reported.\n\n9. Rivers hit record lows\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Severe drought reveals incredible discovery at bottom of Mississippi river 00:45 - Source: CNN\n\nSearing temperatures, lack of rainfall and low snowpack pushed some of the world’s most vital rivers to new lows this year.\n\nNorthern Italy saw its worst drought in more than 70 years. The 400-mile River Po hit a record low due to an unusually dry winter and limited snowpack in the Alps, which feeds the river. The drought impacted millions of people who rely on the Po for their livelihood, and roughly 30% of the country’s food, which is produced along the river.\n\nAlso fed by winter snowpack in the Alps along with spring rains, Germany’s Rhine River dropped to “exceptionally low” levels in some areas, disrupting shipping in the country’s most important inland water way. Months of little rainfall meant cargo ships began carrying lighter loads and transport costs soared.\n\nMeanwhile in the US, extreme drought spread into the central states and gauges along the Mississippi River and its tributaries plummeted. Barge traffic moved in fits and starts as officials dredged the river. The Mississippi River dropped so low that the Army Corps of Engineers was forced to build a 1,500-foot-wide levee to prevent Gulf-of-Mexico saltwater from pushing upstream.\n\n8. US passes landmark climate law\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs \"The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022\" into law during a ceremony in the State Dining Room of the White House in August. Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nAfter more than a year of negotiations, Democrats in late July reached an agreement on President Joe Biden’s long-stalled climate, energy and tax agenda – capping a year of agonizing negotiations that failed multiple times.\n\nBiden signed the bill into law in August and signaled to the world that the US is delivering on its climate promises.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin was influential in delaying the bill’s passage. Multiple White House and Biden administration officials for months had tried to convince the senator to support the bill over dinners in Paris and ziplining in West Virginia.\n\nAn analysis suggests the measures in the bill will reduce US carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 and would put Biden well on his way to achieving his goal of slashing emissions in half by 2030.\n\n7. Hurricane Nicole\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We are in trouble here in Daytona': Coastal homes collapse into the ocean 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\nHurricane Nicole was the first hurricane to hit anywhere in the US during the month of November in nearly 40 years. The rare, late-season storm also marked the first time that a hurricane made landfall on Florida’s east coast in November.\n\nAlthough Nicole was only a category 1, it had a massive wind field that stretched more than 500 miles, coupled with astronomically high tides that led to catastrophic storm surge. Homes and buildings collapsed into the ocean in Volusia County, with authorities scrambling to issue evacuation warnings.\n\nHurricane Nicole flooded streets, destroyed power lines and killed at least five people. The storm came just 42 days after deadly category 4 Hurricane Ian wreaked havoc on the west coast of Florida.\n\n6. A breakthrough at COP27\n\nProtesters demonstrate during the UN's COP27 climate conference in November in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nNegotiators from nearly 200 countries agreed at the UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to set up a new fund for “loss and damage,” meant to help vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters. It was the first time wealthy, industrialized countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the US and the EU, agreed to establish such a fund.\n\n“We can’t solve the climate crisis unless we rapidly and equitably transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuels, as well as hold wealthy nations and the fossil fuel industry accountable for the damage they have done,” Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN.\n\n5. A summer of flooding\n\nSubmerged vehicles in Jackson, Kentucky, in July. Between 8 and 10 inches of rain fell within 48 hours from July 27 to 28 across Eastern Kentucky. The month was Jackson's wettest July on record. Michael Swensen/Getty Images\n\nThe summer’s series of floods started off in Yellowstone National Park in June, when extreme rainfall and rapidly melting snow washed out roads and bridges in the park, causing significant damage to the nearby town of Gardiner, Montana, at the park’s entrance. Authorities had to rescue more than 100 people from the floods.\n\nThe year also brought several 1,000-year rainfall events. A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense it’s only seen on average once every 1,000 years – under normal circumstances. But extreme rainfall is becoming more common as the climate crisis pushes temperatures higher. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which loads the dice in favor of historic rainfall.\n\nDeadly flooding swept through Eastern Kentucky and around St. Louis in July after damaging, record-breaking rainfall in a short period of time.\n\nCalifornia’s Death Valley, after a yearslong dry spell, saw its rainiest day in recorded history.\n\nMeanwhile, down south, parts of Dallas, Texas, got an entire summer’s worth of rain in just 24 hours in August, prompting more than 350 high-water rescues.\n\n4. Europe’s deadly heat wave\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Wildfires threaten London during record-breaking heat wave 01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nEurope experienced its hottest summer on record in 2022 by a wide margin. While the heat kicked off early in France, Portugal and Spain, with the countries reaching record-warmth in May, the most significant heat came in mid-July, spreading across the UK and central Europe.\n\nThe UK, in particular, topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) for the first time on record. Stephen Belcher, the UK Met Office’s chief scientist, said this would have been “virtually impossible” in an “undisrupted climate.”\n\nThroughout western Europe, the heatwaves gravely increased wildfire risk, with one London fire official noting that the 40-degree day led to an “unprecedented day in the history of the London Fire Brigade.”\n\n3. The West’s water crisis\n\nVideo Ad Feedback As water levels drop at this major lake, bodies begin to appear 03:19 - Source: CNN\n\nThe past few years have been a reality check for western states that heavily rely on the Colorado River for water and electricity. Plagued by decades of overuse and a climate change-fueled drought, the river that serves 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico is draining at an alarming rate.\n\nThe water levels in its two main reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell – have plunged rapidly, threatening drinking water supply and power generation. In late July, Lake Mead – the country’s largest reservoir – bottomed out and has only rebounded a few feet off record lows. Its rapidly plunging levels revealed human remains from the 1970s and a sunken vessel from World War II.\n\nThe federal government implemented its first-ever mandatory water cuts this year for states that draw from the Colorado River, and those cuts will be even deeper starting in January 2023.\n\n2. Catastrophic flooding in Pakistan\n\nFlood-affected people carry belongings out from their flooded home in Shikarpur, Sindh province, in Pakistan in August. Asif Hassan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFloods caused by record monsoon rain and melting glaciers in Pakistan’s northern mountain regions claimed the lives of more than 1,400 people this summer, with millions more affected by clean water and food shortages. More than a third of Pakistan was underwater, satellite images showed, and authorities warned it would take months for the flood waters to recede in the country’s hardest-hit areas.\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres said the Pakistani people are facing “a monsoon on steroids,” referring to the role that the climate crisis had in supercharging the extreme rainfall. The hard-hit provinces Sindh and Balochistan saw rainfall more than 500% of average during the monsoon season.\n\nPakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming emissions, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\n\n1. Hurricane Ian\n\nDestruction in the wake of Hurricane Ian on October 4 in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHurricane Ian was a Category 4 storm when it made landfall in southwest Florida in late September and left a trail of destruction from the Caribbean to the Carolinas. Insured losses from Ian are expected to reach up to $65 billion, according to recent data from reinsurance company Swiss Re.\n\nThe storm first struck Cuba before undergoing rapid intensification from a tropical storm to a category 3 hurricane in just 24 hours – something scientists told CNN is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms. That same week, Super Typhoon Noru in the Philippines grew from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 overnight as residents around Manila slept, catching officials and residents unaware and unable to prepare.\n\nHurricane Ian’s size and intensity allowed it to build up a storm surge higher than any ever observed in Southwest Florida, devastating Fort Myers and Cape Coral. Ian killed more than 100 people, most by drowning. It will likely be one of the costliest hurricanes on record not only in Florida, but in the US.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricane/2023/08/30/history-of-hurricane-tropical-storm-threats-to-savannah-georgia/70719399007/", "title": "History of hurricane, tropical storm threats to Savannah Georgia", "text": "Live Updates:Hurricane Idalia live updates from Savannah, coastal Georgia: Storms moves through Ga. as a Cat 1\n\nRoads and Bridges:Which roads in the Savannah area are closed? Live updates on Idalia's impact\n\nOn Tuesday, Idalia was expected to be a strong tropical storm upon its arrival on the Georgia coast, but earlier on Wednesday after making landfall in the big bend of Florida, it maintained hurricane strength.\n\nBased upon the latest models, Hurricane Idalia is projected to be a Category 1 hurricane and to pass between Savannah and Augusta around 8 p.m. on Wednesday. It could bring wind gusts between 55-85 mph and 1 to 3 inches of rain.\n\nBefore Tropical Storm Ian skirted Savannah's shores in 2022, former editor Adam Van Brimmer pulled together a history of the string of storms over the last century to threaten our area. As he wrote then, Savannah had a hurricane-related nickname prior to Hurricane Matthew’s glancing blow in 2016: Dodge City, as in a city with a reputation for dodging storms. The past seven years, though, have been more active than the preceding 60 years.\n\nHere’s a look at Savannah’s stormy history.\n\nYear: 2023\n\nIntensity: Category 1 with wind gusts projected between 55-85 mph\n\nEvacuation: No\n\nWhat to know: Idalia made landfall in the Big Bend of Florida, as a Category 3 storm and cross the Florida-Georgia line as a Category 2, headed toward the Georgia and South Carolina coasts.\n\nIan\n\nYear: 2022\n\nIntensity: Tropical storm with winds of 65 mph\n\nEvacuation: No\n\nWhat to know: Ian made landfall near Fort Myers, Florida, as a Category 4 storm and moved northeast across the state and into the Atlantic Ocean. Ian passed well east of Savannah as a Category 1 hurricane, causing some coastal flooding.\n\nDorian\n\nYear: 2019\n\nIntensity: Tropical storm force winds\n\nEvacuation: Yes\n\nWhat to know: Dorian devastated several islands of the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm but remained offshore as it moved north along Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The storm made landfall in North Carolina. Gov. Brian Kemp ordered an evacuation for six coastal counties, including Chatham.\n\nIrma\n\nYear: 2017\n\nIntensity: Category 1 hurricane\n\nEvacuation: Yes\n\nWhat to know:Irma was projected to pose a catastrophic threat to Savannah as it swept through the Caribbean. However, weather conditions push the track south and the storm didn’t turn north until reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Irma came ashore in western Florida and caused devastating damage to crops and farmland in Southwest Georgia. Low-lying areas of Savannah, particularly on Tybee Island, experienced flooding, as the strongest winds struck at high tide.\n\nMatthew\n\nYear: 2016\n\nIntensity: Category 1 hurricane\n\nEvacuation: Yes\n\nWhat to know: Matthew hugged the East Coast as it swept north out of the Caribbean. The storm passed 30 miles off the coast of Tybee as a Category 1 hurricane and winds took down thousands of trees and knocked out power to 140,000 homes in Chatham County. Neighborhoods on Tybee, marshside islands such as Wilmington and other low-lying parts of Savannah experienced flooding. Chatham County spent $22 million to clean up 1.2 million cubic yards of tree limbs, trunks and leaves following the storm.\n\nHermine\n\nYear: 2016\n\nIntensity: Tropical storm with winds of 63 mph\n\nEvacuation: No\n\nWhat to know: The system brought 3 to 4 inches of rain with maximum sustained winds near 50 mph, and high tide reached 8.5 feet Friday. At least 25,000 Georgia Power customers lost electricity.\n\nIrene\n\nYear: 1999\n\nIntensity: Tropical depression with winds between 20 mph and 30 mph\n\nEvacuation: No\n\nWhat to know: Hurricane Irene mirrored Ian’s track, moving north from the Caribbean Sea and cutting a west to east path across Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean. The storm passed well offshore of Savannah.\n\nFloyd\n\nYear: 1999\n\nIntensity: Category 2 hurricane\n\nEvacuation: Yes\n\nWhat to know: Floyd was an abnormally large storm, measuring 580 miles in diameter as it approached the East Coast. The hurricane’s size prompted the largest evacuation of a coastal area in American history, with 2 million people from six states fleeing ahead of the storm. Floyd swept past Georgia well offshore, delivering only tropical storm force winds to Savannah. The winds and rain left more than 55,000 without power and streets littered with downed tree limbs and leaves. There was little coastal flooding due to storm surge.\n\nHugo\n\nYear: 1989\n\nIntensity: Tropical storm\n\nEvacuation: No\n\nWhat to know:Hugo was a monster storm that devastated a historic coastal city - not Savannah, but Charleston. The storm was a Category 4 when it made landfall and remained at Category 1 strength when it reached Charlotte, 200 miles inland. Hugo brought heavy rain to Coastal Georgia and is often associated locally with a memorable football game between Georgia Southern and Middle Tennessee State in Statesboro. Nine inches of rain fell during the 26-0 Eagles’ victory.\n\nBob\n\nYear: 1985\n\nIntensity: Category 1 hurricane\n\nEvacuation: No\n\nWhat to know: Another storm that swung wide of Savannah, Bob came ashore north of Beaufort, South Carolina.\n\nDavid\n\nYear: 1979\n\nIntensity: Category 1 hurricane\n\nEvacuation: No\n\nWhat to know: The last storm to deliver a direct hit to Savannah brought 90-mph winds that wreaked havoc on trees and electricity lines causing widespread power outages. At the height of the outage, about 75,000 of the company then known as Savannah Electric’s 88,000 customers were without power. Many homes and businesses were without power for more than a week.\n\nGracie\n\nYear: 1959\n\nIntensity: Tropical storm\n\nEvacuation: No\n\nWhat to know: Grace made landfall north of Savannah and lashed Charleston in what at the time was labeled “the most intense” storm the area had seen in decades.\n\nAble\n\nYear: 1952\n\nIntensity: Category 1 hurricane\n\nEvacuation: No\n\nWhat to know: Able slipped past Savannah and came ashore north of Beaufort.\n\nUnnamed\n\nYear: 1947\n\nIntensity: Category 1 hurricane\n\nWhat to know: The last storm to come ashore in Georgia prior to David in 1979, this hurricane is said to have struck twice as it moved due west and inland instead of north and into South Carolina. According to reports, government officials cloud seeded the storm by dropping dry ice into the hurricane from a B-17 bomber, which some suspect contributed to the storm’s hard turn to the west prior to striking Savannah.\n\nUnnamed\n\nYear: 1940\n\nIntensity: Category 1 hurricane\n\nWhat to know: This hurricane caused extensive property damage in Savannah. Photos taken after the event show collapsed structures and rubble in the downtown streets as well as flooding elsewhere.

The storm ripped a path of destruction in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland before weakening and moving out to sea Sunday.\n\nNow, officials are beginning to account for the damage brought forth to the region.\n\nNova Scotia, where Fiona first made landfall during the early morning hours Saturday, was hit hard by the storm. Powerful winds toppled trees and power lines, washed out roads, littered neighborhoods with debris, and in many cases, snapped whole power poles in half, officials said.\n\nOfficials are prioritizing power restoration after Fiona ravaged power lines and communication networks across the province, Premier Tim Houston said Sunday morning.\n\n“Getting roads cleared, giving space to the crews to do what needs to be done, that’s the most important thing right now,” Houston said. “It will take time.”\n\nOne person in Newfoundland reportedly died in the storm. Houston said there haven’t been too many reports of serious injuries, though about 200 people are currently displaced from their homes.\n\n“The damage is significant, but right now that the priority right now is getting power back to people, getting people to a safe shelter, getting, you know, some return to normal,” he said. “That will take time when we come out of this.”\n\nA home fights against high winds caused by Fiona in Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador, on Saturday, September 24.

The Prime Minister said residents lived through a “terrifying” 12 hours Saturday.\n\n“People have seen their homes washed away, seen the winds rip schools’ roofs off,” Trudeau said. “And as Canadians, as we always do in times of difficulty, we will be there for each other.”\n\nIn Prince Edward Island’s Charlottetown, police shared images of downed power lines over buildings, fallen trees blocking roadways and piercing through structures. The region’s utility, Maritime Electric, said it was concerned about people out walking and driving on streets where there is widespread damage from downed power lines and possible live wires.\n\nPower outages across Nova Scotia\n\nSeveral provinces were impacted by the heavy winds and rain, but none more than Nova Scotia. As of Monday morning, more than 284,400 customers were still without power across Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick – including more than 190,400 in Nova Scotia, according to Poweroutage.com.\n\nNearly three quarters of Nova Scotia lost electricity as Fiona pushed through, Houston said Saturday. Peak wind gusts of 171 km/h (106 mph) were recorded in the province’s town of Arisaig Saturday. Meanwhile, Wreckhouse in Newfoundland saw 170 km/h (105 mph) gusts.\n\nPoor weather conditions have hampered power restoration efforts, Nova Scotia Power President and CEO Peter Gregg said Saturday. More than 900 power technicians were on their way to the area, but some customers may experience power outages for several days, he said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Drone video shows 50-foot waves and 100 mph winds inside Hurricane Fiona 01:04 - Source: CNN\n\nIn Nova Scotia’s capital, Halifax, strong winds uprooted trees and downed power lines, sending sparks flying and lights flickering off.\n\nA Halifax apartment complex’s roof collapsed, forcing about 100 people to leave for a shelter, Mayor Mike Savage told CNN Saturday.\n\n“The magnitude of this storm has been breathtaking,” Savage later said at a Saturday news conference. “It turned out to be everything predicted.”\n\nOsborne Head in Nova Scotia received 192 mm (7.55 inches) of rain and Crowe Brook in New Brunswick got 107 mm (4.2 inches), among other heavy rainfall amounts across the provinces.\n\n‘Total war zone,’ Port aux Basques mayor says\n\nA home fights against high winds caused by post Tropical Storm Fiona in Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador on Saturday.

A woman was rescued from the water after her house collapsed, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. She was taken to a hospital; the extent of her injuries wasn’t immediately known, police said.\n\nPort aux Basques, a town at the southwest tip of Newfoundland, was also one of the worst-hit areas, Trudeau said Saturday.\n\n“We’re seeing devastating images coming out of Port aux Basques,” he said. “Obviously as we see the images of houses falling into the sea, of waves destroying property and buildings, our first thought needs to be for people.”\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Sunday recovered the body of a 73-year-old woman who had been washed out to sea the day before in Port aux Basques.\n\n“The woman was last seen inside the residence just moments before a wave struck the home, tearing away a portion of the basement,” police in a press release.\n\nThis is the first death attributed to Fiona in Canada.

Concrete barriers were also set up around areas that were rendered “danger zones” by the storm, the mayor said.\n\nThe Port aux Basques tide gauge recorded a maximum total water level of 2.73 meters (8.96 feet) – topping its previous record of 2.71 (8.89 feet) meters set in 2017, according to the Canadian Hurricane Centre.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2023/08/29/hurricane-idalia-spaghetti-model-atlantic-loop-second-florida-strike/70708872007/", "title": "Hurricane Idalia spaghetti model suggests second Florida strike", "text": "UPDATE: Wednesday morning's spaghetti models now all seem to agree that Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall near Keaton Beach, will continue moving out over the Atlantic.\n\nCould Hurricane Idalia hit Florida twice?\n\nFlorida residents nervously watching the tracking models as the tropical cyclone approaches the west coast of the state have noticed that some of the spaghetti models for its future are starting to show a distinct curve to them, with a few even predicting a second strike on the east coast.\n\nNot all the models agree, although as of Tuesday afternoon, nearly all of them show a downward curve after the storm leaves the Georgia/South Carolina coasts. Most have the storm dissipating in the Atlantic Ocean well away from shore.\n\nDouble trouble:Could Hurricane Idalia make a return trip to Florida? Another storm did.\n\nDo Hurricane Idalia's spaghetti models say it could hit Florida twice?\n\nA few models, notably NOAA's Global Forecast System (AVN0) and the NHC's Trajectory and Beta Model (TABS), suggest Idalia could come back and hit Florida's southeast coast by Port Saint Lucie sometime Monday. The Canadian Meteorological Centre's model has it striking near Hialeah.\n\n\"The GFS has been leading the charge on this taking a clockwise loop,\" meteorologist Josh Nagelberg of Perry Weather said of the National Weather Service's forecast system. \"Several ensembles take it right (back) towards the Bahamas. (There) are some solutions that take this back into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which is the last place we want to see anything at this point.\"\n\nWhat does the National Hurricane Center say about Idalia hitting Florida twice?\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, the agency remains uncertain.\n\nAccording to the latest discussion from the National Hurricane Center, \"On days 3 through 5, there is significant uncertainty on whether Idalia will turn out to sea (as shown by the COAMPS-TC and HAFS models) or turn southward (as suggested by the global models).\n\n\"For now, the official forecast shows a slow motion at the end of the forecast period until the scenario becomes clearer.\"\n\nComputer models for that far out are complex, however, and subject to change.\n\n\"Right now, given the time that it’s a week or so out, (our) confidence is pretty low,\" said Kole Fehling, with the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Melbourne.\n\nEven more uncertain at this point, should it loop back, is where Idalia might eventually re-enter the Peninsula and how much steam it has as it moves west across the state toward Southwest Florida or further north.\n\nIf Idalia loops back, how strong would it be?\n\nIdalia is expected to still be a tropical storm when it leaves the coast of Georgia or South Carolina on Thursday. But Hurricane Franklin might help keep it calm.\n\n\"They're showing that loop very close to where Franklin is now. The good news is, if you want to call it good news, is that Franklin is such a big storm, a strong Category 4, that it's cooling off the waters,\" Nagelberg said. But if Idalia holds together until it moves south into the above-normal hot ocean waters it could rebuild.\n\n\"It certainly does have a better chance of trying to make a comeback.\"\n\nHave any hurricanes hit Florida twice before?\n\nLoops are rare for tropical storms and hurricanes, but it's happened.\n\nIn 2004, Hurricane Ivan nipped the Panhandle when it made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama as a major Category 3 hurricane. Ivan maintained hurricane strength through central Alabama and wreaked havoc through the southern U.S., spawning over 120 tornadoes before finally leaving the coast of Virginia as a remnant low. Ivan was responsible for the deaths of 64 people in the Caribbean and 25 in the U.S., including 14 in Florida, and an estimated $20.5 billion in damages.\n\nBut in the mid-Atlantic, the remains of Ivan merged with a frontal system over the Delmarva Peninsula, drifted south for several days, and crossed southern Florida as an extratropical cyclone before re-entering the Gulf of Mexico and regenerating into a tropical cyclone that moved into Louisiana and Texas.\n\nThat wasn't the first hurricane to hit us twice, even just in 2004, but the other one didn't involve a loop. Hurricane Frances crossed the state in early September from the southern end of Hutchinson Island and dumped rain across the peninsula until it left the state near Tampa. It then made a second landfall near St. Marks and brought wind and rain all the way up to the Canada-U.S. border.\n\n2004 was a devastating hurricane season, with four hurricanes hitting Florida within six weeks. Hurricane Jeanne followed Ivan and while it didn't hit Florida twice — once was more than enough — it did do a complete 360-degree loop-the-loop in the Atlantic before strengthening into a Category 3 hurricane and making landfall just 2 miles from where Hurricane Frances struck three weeks earlier.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2021/11/20/ghostbusters-afterlife-dan-aykroyd-bill-murray-britney-spears/8663324002/", "title": "'Ghostbusters: Afterlife': Dan Aykroyd on Bill Murray, Britney Spears", "text": "It was 1984 when the Ghostbusters first took the call to save New York City from paranormal peril.\n\nAs these mystic forces resurface to wreak havoc 37 years later in \"Ghostbusters: Afterlife\" (now in theaters) the most famous poltergeist battlers ever take the next call to duty.

I think mine was taken out at the waist, But movie cameras make you look good, the equipment felt good and I didn't have to put another hole in the belt.\n\nQ: Bill Murray was critical of 'Ghostbusters II.' How did you get him on board for this?\n\nAykroyd: Billy is very discriminating and has a high BS detector. He's not going to do something that's false in any way. Having his imprimatur made this whole thing valid. If he hadn't done it, it would have been a massive hole. But he saw the merits, the joy and the possibilities here.\n\nQ: Egon Spangler warned in \"Ghostbusters\" that you should never cross the streams due to minimal chance of surviving, but in 'Afterlife,' it happens and doesn't kill. What gives?\n\nAykroyd: You should never cross the streams. You're dealing with a million electron volts per thrower. That's no good. In this case, it didn't work. We were shocked. But the climax was against a demonic entity from another dimension with intense power. Without giving anything away, the way it went down on set, there was a lot of flashing lights and smoke. As actors, we believed (in those moments) because of the power of the set.\n\nQ: 'Afterlife' adds a gunner seat in the Ecto-mobile, did you wish you thought of that?\n\nAykroyd: We did add some features to the Activision video game.

And the scene flying through the cornfield, that was exhilarating.\n\nQ: Now that you have a fresh taste for battle, there's reports of a fourth 'Ghostbusters.'\n\nAykroyd: As the original co-writer (with Ramis) and creator of the characters, I have proprietary rights. They can't make a movie without me granting theatrical rights. I would grant that, and if there's a part for me, I would certainly play it again. But I don't know what the status is for any further films.\n\nQ: What would you like to see in a new 'Ghostbusters'?\n\nAykroyd: I'd like to die. I think Bill and I should be killed in the next one.

She works hard for her money, she's matured and she's going to be fine. But if she wants some help and advice, I'll supply it gratis. Tell her to call me, I'll double her fortunes in five years. I'd put her in Amazon, Tesla and Netflix stocks and just walk away, watch the money grow.\n\nQ: With \"SNL\" getting so political, have you gotten a call from producer Lorne Michaels to return, and as which player?\n\nAykroyd: First of all, James Austin Johnson, the new 'SNL' cast member, is a tremendous impressionist. He does a great Trump and a great Biden. But when Trump was being impeached (in January), Lorne and I were discussing me coming back as Nixon to wake up Trump in a nightmare. But then so many other political things happened that just overtook it.\n\nQ: \"Afterlife\" director Jason Reitman, the son of \"Ghostbusters\" director Ivan Reitman, paid tribute to your longtime collaborator Harold Ramis. What did you think?\n\nAykroyd: Jason was a friend of the Ghostbusters, and of Harold. He lost a friend and an avuncular figure when (Ramis) died. There'd be no \"Ghostbusters\" without Harold, his writing and intelligence, the cerebral-yet-accessible tone of dialogue. He wasn't a believer in ghosts or the paranormal supernatural, necessarily. But he knew all of the science that was being explored.

Had teammates that messaged me, of course, family members,” says Bellingham, referring to when he was racially abused.\n\n“I didn’t really receive anything from the DFB or FA or anything like that. And I always kind of compare it to when I said the thing about the referee in December.\n\nBellingham (center) plays for Borussia Dortmund in their group stage match against Lazio on October 20, 2020 at the Olympic Stadium in Rome, Italy. Revierfoto/Imago Images Sports/Reuters\n\n“They were very quick to get into contact to give me my fine, give me my punishment, kind of make it a big drama in the media.\n\n“I’ve learned from that. I know what I can and can’t say. I know that, you know, sometimes I have to control my emotion better,” he says.\n\n“But, you know, when you give that more energy than the situation that I was, I felt like I was going through … maybe we are alone and maybe they’re not interested, maybe they don’t care. And maybe it is down to me and down to us to work independently to get our message out.”\n\nPlayers or officials who engage in racist words or behavior can be sanctioned with a suspension lasting at least 10 matches, or “any other appropriate disciplinary measure,” according to ​the latest edition of the FIFA Disciplinary Code.\n\nClubs can be fined a minimum of CHF 20,000 ($20,076) if their supporters show discriminatory behaviour, the code adds. Other sanctions include points deduction, playing a match without spectators, forfeiting a match, expulsion from a tournament, or relegation to a lower division.\n\nIn September 2021, FIFA sanctioned the Hungarian Football Federation (MLSZ) for “numerous fans’” racist behavior during a World Cup qualifier match against England.\n\nThe MLSZ was fined $216,000 and ordered to play its next FIFA-sanctioned home match without supporters, after ITV reporter Gabriel Clarke, who was at the Puskas Arena in Budapest, says he heard monkey chants directed at Raheem Sterling, and at Bellingham as he was preparing to come on as a substitute, during England’s 4-0 victory earlier in September.\n\nCNN has reached out to the DFB for comment.\n\nBellingham looks on during Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga match against FC Bayern München at Allianz Arena on April 23, 2022 in Munich, Germany. Roland Krivec/vi/DeFodi Images/Getty Images\n\nBorn in 2003 ​and raised in Stourbridge, England, Bellingham joined the Birmingham City FC academy at the age of seven, according to the club’s website.\n\nHis parents, Denise Bellingham and Mark Bellingham, would drive him to training about five times per week, but it was only ​when he was scouted for the England Under-15 team that they realized how much potential he had, according to the club’s website.\n\nMark forged a prolific career in non-league football – netting over 700 goals across 22 years – while serving as a sergeant for the West Midlands Police, the website adds.\n\nDuring his meteoric rise on the world stage Bellingham has remained confident and poised, something he says wouldn’t be possible without his family’s support – especially his mother’s.\n\n“I speak a lot about my parents and the people that have kind of brought me up in football and not just in football, but in life as well,” he says.\n\n“My mom, my dad are two huge role models of mine because of the way they’ve obviously carried themselves, the things that they’ve had to face in their own journeys.”\n\n“She’s always given me a lot of lessons on how I’ll be perceived by other people sometimes because of the color of my skin, sometimes the way that we’re kind of stereotyped.”\n\n“I think for her to do a lot of the stuff that she’s done just to make sure me and my brother never have to want for anything,” he says. “I can’t put into words how much it means to me.\n\n“I’ve got a Black woman that I live with every day and I see the way she carries herself,” he adds. “My mom is certainly one of my heroes off the pitch, if not the biggest one.”\n\nDenise Bellingham (left), Jude Bellingham (second left), Jobe Bellingham (second right) and Mark Bellingham (right) on the red carpet prior to the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards 2021. David Davies/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nIt seems ​Bellingham ​may share some of​ his prodigious talent ​with his younger brother, 16-year-old Jobe, an up-and-coming professional footballer who also signed with Birmingham City FC.\n\nWhen Jobe made his debut for the club in January, Bellingham paid tribute to him on social media with the caption, “So f***ing proud.”\n\nBellingham celebrates his brother’s success, but is equally committed to making him aware of the obstacles that Black players face in football.\n\n“It’s important that I make him aware of challenges that he’ll face from a football point of view and also from a race point of view.\n\n“I can’t let down other kids that look up to me,” he says. “I think that that gives me great pleasure as well. And like I said, it’s a responsibility that I’m willing to carry.”\n\nThere are only five out of 91 managers and head coaches in England’s top four divisions who are from Black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds.\n\nWhile the proportion of Black, Asian and minority ethnic players in the UK is about 25%, such figures ​have not been replicated ​in recent years when it comes to positions of authority in football, CNN previously reported.\n\nBellingham says he has only worked with a handful ​of Black coaches across his career so far including Chris Powell, Michael Johnson, Deon Burton and Dele Adebola.\n\n“I can’t discredit any of the coaches that I’ve had because they’ve all been brilliant for my development,” he says.\n\n“But, you know, I do think about it from a different perspective, the way I think about opportunity and I think about, you know, what if I wasn’t a footballer and I wanted to go into coaching and I wanted to do this and I wanted to that – would I be given the same opportunity as some of my friends who are White, for example?\n\n“Racism … It feels like one of those things that will never go away,” he says. “I think ​there are people in power that can take more responsibility in that fight. And I don’t think they are.”\n\nBellingham became the second-youngest player to appear at Euro 2020 last year when he represented England in their match against Croatia, during the group stages of the tournament, according to the official UEFA website. ​\n\nThe team triumphantly reached the final of the prestigious European tournament, after winning a series of gripping matches against favorites including Denmark and Germany. It was the first time the men’s side had reached the last stage of a major competition since winning the World Cup in 1966.\n\nAmid a global pandemic – when many England fans were just emerging from the UK’s first national lockdown with feelings of grief and isolation – the team sought to bring the country together.\n\nBut when England lost the Euro 2020 final to Italy after an extremely fraught 3-2 penalty shootout defeat at Wembley Stadium, the country’s semblance of unity crumbled.\n\nMarcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were all targeted with racist abuse on social media by some fans, after they missed penalties in the final. The team’s manager, Gareth Southgate, described the abuse as “unforgivable” and “just not what we stand for.”\n\nJadon Sancho (left) and Jude Bellingham (right) of England in action during the England Training Session at St George's Park on June 14, 2021 in Burton upon Trent, England. Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty Images\n\nReflecting on the tournament, Bellingham says: “I think the biggest takeaway from the whole experience for me was the contrast.”\n\n“We showed real character to win the games and it felt like the country had united,” he says. “I know these are select idiots, of course, and it’s not the whole nation turning against them.\n\n“I’m sure that they probably had a bigger comeback of support, but the only support they should need is for missing the penalty, not for the racism that they’ve received after it.”\n\n“I’ve spent a lot of time with Jadon obviously because he’s from Dortmund, Bukayo I’d spoken to quite a bit and Marcus at the camp and you know … They’re human,” he adds.\n\n“Then you see them kind of brought down like that. It’s like it’s disgusting, but it’s hard to take, to be honest, as a teammate. All of a sudden, you know, you’re English for seven games, you miss a pen and you’re nothing.”\n\nSouthgate’s humble and temperate managerial style was praised throughout the tournament.\n\nAhead of Euro 2020, he wrote an open letter to fans titled “Dear England,” in which he defended his squad’s decision to take the knee before matches, as a show of support for anti-racism.\n\n“Gareth Southgate was brilliant. I remember the next camp after the Euros we did like a debrief for the tournament. And he took a lot of time to kind of talk about what had happened in that situation,” Bellingham says. “He’s always brought it up as a topic in meetings.\n\n“As a Black player, you feel very grateful for that. You shouldn’t have to deal with it again. And I will keep repeating that. But you know, it’s good to feel supported.”", "authors": ["Darren Lewis Sana Noor Haq Aleks Klosok", "Darren Lewis", "Sana Noor Haq", "Aleks Klosok"], "publish_date": "2022/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/sport/deshaun-watson-attend-game-houston-cleveland-browns/index.html", "title": "Deshaun Watson returned in Cleveland Browns game against ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAround 10 of the more than two dozen women who accused Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson of sexual misconduct were expected to attend his game in Houston on Sunday, according to their attorney.\n\nWatson returned to the field to a mix of boos and cheers Sunday for his first NFL regular season game in two years to play against his former team, the Houston Texans, after serving an 11-game suspension without pay following sexual misconduct allegations.\n\n“They thought it important to make clear that they are still here and that they matter. I was proud of them for that,” Tony Buzbee, the lawyer representing the accusers attending the game, told CNN in a statement. “I have made that opportunity available to them. I haven’t been to a Texans game in many years. But, because they are going, I will go too.”\n\nBefore his suspension, 24 civil lawsuits were filed on behalf of women alleging Watson sexually harassed or assaulted them during private massage appointments during his time with the Houston Texans. Watson denied wrongdoing in those cases, and 23 of the lawsuits were settled confidentially. Two grand juries declined to charge Watson criminally.\n\nLess than two months after settling the lawsuits, a new civil suit was filed by another woman in October, alleging that Watson pressured her into sexual activity during a professional massage session. Despite the new lawsuit, the NFL said his status would remain “unchanged.”\n\nWatson has repeatedly denied the allegations against him and said he has no regrets about any of his actions. He spoke to the media for the first time Thursday since returning from suspension, declining to answer any non-football questions that were asked.\n\n“I understand you guys have a lot of questions, but with my legal team and my clinical team, there is only football questions that I can really address at this time,” Watson told reporters, adding that he was “excited” to be back with his team and thanked those who stood by his side.\n\n“I also want to thank the Browns organization, the ownership, my teammates in that locker room and all of the coaching staff for all of the support that they had for me, especially my time away,” he said.\n\nWatson violated the NFL’s personal conduct policy in private meetings with massage therapists while he was with the Houston Texans, according to the initial ruling by Sue L. Robinson, a judge jointly appointed by the NFL and the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) to decide on Watson’s punishment.\n\nWatson’s “pattern of conduct is more egregious than any before reviewed by the NFL,” Robinson said in her ruling, adding that Watson’s “lack of expressed remorse” was a factor in the discipline that she chose.\n\nAnti-sexual violence organizations voice support for accusers\n\nWhen Watson plays at NRG Stadium in Houston against his former team on Sunday, among those watching him from the sidelines will be women who he allegedly sexually harassed and assaulted.\n\n“I think it’s important to note each of these women is different. You can’t paint them with a broad brush. I would never encourage any of them to attend,” Buzbee said. “Some never want to hear Watson’s name again. Others have put it in the past. Some are still angry. Others are defiant. Makes me proud they want to stand up and be counted rather than quietly go away.”\n\nThe NFL and the Cleveland Browns did not respond to CNN’s request for comment regarding the accusers’ attendance.\n\nDespite denying the allegations, Watson, who started the preseason game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in August, said that he is “truly sorry to all of the women that I have impacted in this situation” during a pregame interview shared by the Browns on Twitter\n\n“My decisions that I made in my life that put me in this position I would definitely like to have back, but I want to continue to move forward and grow and learn and show that I am a true person of character and I am going to keep pushing forward,” Watson said.\n\nWomen’s movement organizations and nonprofits dedicated to protecting victims of sexual assault and harassment have applauded the accusers for attending the game.\n\n“I’m proud of them for being strong enough to try and take some of the power back. Even today when survivors hear stories like this, they are triggered by it,” Donisha Greene, spokeswoman for local advocacy group the Cleveland Rape Crisis Center (RCC), told CNN. “By attending the game, the accusers are saying they are not willing to suffer in silence. What that says to other survivors is that you don’t have to suffer in silence either.”\n\nChristian Nunes, the president of women’s rights grassroots group National Organization for Women (NOW), echoed Greene’s sentiments.\n\n“What happens so often is people try to shame, victim blame, silence, and erase victims and survivors of violence and abuse,” Nunes told CNN. “For them to show up and say no, you wont erase me, is so powerful. I give them so much respect and admiration for standing up against him, letting him know nothing, including money, can or will silence them.”\n\nDespite Cleveland’s love for its NFL team, Greene says many in the local community have increased their support for advocacy organizations like the Cleveland RCC that support sexual abuse and rape survivors, promoting healing and prevention, and increasing education.\n\n“It’s a tough place to be in. We’re a huge football town, folks here have been lifelong fans of the Cleveland Browns,” Greene said. “It’s a big deal to try and straddle that fence between your fandom and recognizing you’re not comfortable with the story of Deshaun Watson.”\n\nEven with dozens of sexual misconduct allegations, the Browns traded three first-round picks with the Texans for Watson, then signed him to a 5-year, fully guaranteed $230 million contract, the most guaranteed money in NFL history.\n\n“It’s just like a big ‘screw you,’” Ashley Solis, one of Watson’s accusers, told HBO’s “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel” following the news of his signing. “That’s what it feels like. That we don’t care. He can run and throw, and that’s what we care about.”\n\nThe decision triggered outrage and inspired many to get involved, Greene said, adding that the Cleveland RCC received over $120,000 donations specifically related to Watson.\n\n“For those who are struggling with wanting to speak up for victims but also cheer for the Browns and find a medium can get involved with our work and mission,” she added. “Our place is with the survivors, We believe you, we hear you, we see you. Your stories and your experiences matter.”\n\n‘His punishment is not enough’\n\nWhile the league has faced scrutiny in the past for its handling of sexual misconduct accusations, this was the NFL’s harshest punishment for someone accused of sexual assault.\n\nThe NFL initially asked for a suspension covering its 17-game regular season and playoffs, but Robinson ruled on August 1 that Watson would receive a six-game suspension.\n\nNo player accused of non-violent sexual assault, as Watson has been, has received a suspension longer than three games, Robinson said in her ruling, and the most common discipline for domestic or gendered violence and sexual acts is a six-game suspension.\n\nUnlike in the past, however, the NFL pushed for more – appealing the decision and seeking a full-season suspension. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell called Watson’s behavior “egregious” and “predatory.”\n\nWhen asked why the league continued to seek a harsher punishment for Watson, Goodell said: “Because we’ve seen the evidence. (Robinson) was very clear about the evidence, she reinforced the evidence that there was multiple violations here and they were egregious and it was predatory behavior.”\n\nLater that month, the NFL and NFLPA agreed to suspend Watson for 11 regular season games and fine him $5 million, plus an extra $1 million each from both the league and the Browns to go towards nonprofit organizations working to prevent sexual assault, support survivors and educate youth on healthy relationships.\n\n“We as an organization and as individuals, we have tremendous empathy for the women involved and we have an opportunity to make a difference in this community,” Susan “Dee” Haslam, co-owner of the Browns, said in August.\n\nWatson also underwent “a professional evaluation by behavioral experts” and followed their ” treatment program,” according to the agreement.\n\nWomen advocacy groups argue none of that is enough.\n\nThe NFL has issued longer suspensions for violations including alleged drug use and gambling – and under his latest contract with the Browns, the suspension will not cost much of his guaranteed money, according to ESPN.\n\n“His punishment is not enough,” Nunes said, arguing that Watson should be banned entirely from the league. “Although they’ve done all this performative work, essentially they’re saying they will choose profit over actually protecting women and survivors.”\n\nJimmy Haslam, Dee Haslam’s husband and Browns co-owner, said, “People deserve second chances.”\n\n“Is he never supposed to play again? Is he never supposed to be part of society? Does he get no chance to rehabilitate himself? And that’s what we’re going to do,” he said, referring to Watson. “That doesn’t mean we don’t have empathy for people affected and we will continue to do so. We believe that Deshaun Watson deserves a second chance.”\n\nThe team’s “refusal to prioritize protecting women sends a disgusting message” to survivors of sexual assault, Nunes said.\n\n“The fact that Watson can continue working, with no real accountability, is outrageous,” she said. “The NFL needs to stop harboring abusers and sexual predators.”", "authors": ["Alaa Elassar"], "publish_date": "2022/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2016/06/18/the-latest-tomas-rosicky-has-scan-on-thigh-injury/86078854/", "title": "The Latest: Ronaldo takes selfie with fan after match", "text": "AP\n\nPARIS (AP) — The Latest from soccer's European Championship (all times local):\n\n___\n\n10:55 p.m.\n\nA fan ran on to the field after the Portugal match ended to take a selfie with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nRonaldo gestured to a security official to stay back and make sure the fan got the picture.\n\nThe man ran across half the field from behind one goal and caught up with Ronaldo near the halfway line.

In recent years, Smith has prosecuted war crimes at The Hague. His career in multiple parts of the Justice Department, as well as in international courts, has allowed him to keep a relatively low-profile in the oftentimes brassy legal industry.\n\nHis experience and resume will allow him, at least at first, to fly underneath the type of political blowback that quickly met former special counsel Robert Mueller’s team. It also shows he is adept at managing complex criminal cases related to both public corruption and national security – and that he has practice making challenging decisions with political implications.\n\nSmith is widely expected to be tasked with making policy decisions around whether to charge a former president of the United States. Garland’s statements on Friday and the recent steps taken in the Mar-a-Lago and January 6 investigations have signaled that, at the very least, Donald Trump is under investigation and could potentially be charged with a crime.\n\n“He knows how to do high-profile cases. He’s independent. He will not be influenced by anybody,” said Greg Andres, a former member of Mueller’s team.\n\nAndres, who has known Smith since the late 1990s when they started at a US attorney’s office together and ultimately became co-chiefs of the office’s criminal division, said it’s the breadth of Smith’s experience that will enable him to withstand the public scrutiny and make tough judgment calls.\n\n“He will evaluate the evidence and understand what type of case should be charged or not. He has the type of experience to make those judgments,” said Andres.\n\n“He understands the courtroom. He understands how to try a case. He knows how to prove a case,” he added. “Particularly in these circumstances it will be critical to understand what types of evidence is required to prove the case in court.”\n\nIn a statement following his announcement, Smith pledged to conduct the investigations “independently and in the best traditions of the Department of Justice.”\n\n“The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch. I will exercise independent judgment and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate,” Smith said.\n\nOne former colleague highlighted that Smith has prosecuted members of both parties.\n\n“He’s going to be really aggressive,” the person said, adding that “things are going to speed up.” Smith, they said, “operates very quickly” and has a unique ability to quickly determine the things that are important to a case and doesn’t waste time “hand-wringing over things that are real sideshows.”\n\nIn court, Smith comes off as very down-to-earth and relatable, this person said, characterizing that as a good attribute to have as a prosecutor.\n\nSmith also will not care about the politics surrounding the case, they said, adding he has very thick skin and will “do what he’s going to do.”\n\nA career prosecutor\n\nSmith began his career as an assistant district attorney with the New York County District Attorney’s Office in 1994. He worked in the Eastern District of New York in 1999 as an assistant US attorney, where he prosecuted cases including civil rights violations and police officers murdered by gangs, according to the Justice Department.\n\nAs a prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, one of Smith’s biggest and most high-profile cases was prosecuting gang member Ronell Wilson for the murder of two New York City police department detectives during an undercover gun operation in Staten Island.\n\nWilson was convicted and sentenced to death, the first death penalty case in New York at the time in 50 years, though a judge later found he was ineligible for the death penalty.\n\nMoe Fodeman, who worked with Smith at EDNY, called him “one of the best trial lawyers I have ever seen.”\n\n“He is a phenomenal investigator; he leaves no stone unturned. He drills down to get to the true facts,” Fodeman said.\n\nFodeman, who is still friends with Smith, said he is a “literally insane” cyclist and triathlete.\n\nBeginning in 2008, Smith worked for the International Criminal Court and oversaw war crimes investigations under the Office of the Prosecutor for two years.\n\nIn 2010, he became chief of the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department, where he oversaw litigation of public corruption cases. Lanny Breuer, the former assistant attorney general for the DOJ’s Criminal Division who recruited Smith, said his onetime employee was “a terrific prosecutor” with a “real sense of fairness.”\n\n“If you are going to have a special counsel, in my view, and you want someone who is going to be fearless, but fair, and not going to be intimidated and not overly bureaucratic, that’s Jack – he is all of these things,” Breuer told CNN.\n\n“Smith brings cases quickly. … He doesn’t sit on cases. He is a person of action,” Breuer added.\n\nAfter his stint at the Public Integrity Section, Smith was appointed first assistant US attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee in 2015.\n\nThough he is not widely known in Washington, DC, legal circles, Smith is described as a consummate public servant.\n\nAbout a decade ago, he hired waves of line prosecutors into the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department, supervising dozens over his years in charge there.\n\nBrian Kidd, whom Smith hired at the unit, recalled how his boss walked him through every step of a complicated racketeering case against corrupt police officers.\n\n“He was not going to tolerate a politically motivated prosecution,” Kidd said. “And he has an incredible ability to motivate the people working with him and under him. He’s incredibly supportive of his team.”\n\nSmith handled some of the most high-profile political corruption cases in recent memory – to mixed outcomes.\n\nHe was the head of the public integrity unit when then-Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was indicted in 2014, and was in meetings with the defense team and involved in decision-making leading up to the charges, according to a person familiar with the case.\n\nMcDonnell was initially convicted of receiving gifts for political favors, but then his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court.\n\nSmith was also at the helm of the unit when the DOJ failed to convict at trial former Senator and vice presidential candidate John Edwards.\n\nA Republican source familiar with Smith’s oversight of the investigation into former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay commended Smith’s non-biased approach, saying that he ultimately made a “just” decision to conclude the investigation without alleging DeLay committed any crime.\n\nIn recent years while working at The Hague, he has not lived in the United States. He’s no longer on the US Triathlon team but is still a competitive biker.\n\nSmith took over as acting US Attorney when David Rivera departed in early 2017 before leaving the Justice Department later that year and becoming vice president of litigation for the Hospital Corporation of America. In 2018, he became chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague, where he investigated war crimes in Kosovo.\n\n“Throughout his career, Jack Smith has built a reputation as an impartial and determined prosecutor, who leads teams with energy and focus to follow the facts wherever they lead,” Garland said during the announcement on Friday. “Mr. Smith is the right choice to complete these matters in an even-handed and urgent manner.”\n\nSmith interviewed as part of Republican-led IRS probe\n\nIn May 2014, the House Oversight Committee interviewed Smith behind closed doors as part of the Republican-led investigation into the alleged IRS targeting of conservative groups. Then-Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa launched the probe following a 2013 inspector general report that found delays in the processing of applications by certain conservative groups and requesting information from them that was later deemed unnecessary.\n\nRepublicans sought testimony from Smith, who at the time was Public Integrity section chief, due to his involvement with arranging a 2010 meeting between Justice Department officials and then-IRS official Lois Lerner, the official at the center of the IRS scandal. The meeting had been convened to discuss the “evolving legal landscape” of campaign finance law following the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, according to a May 2014 letter written by Issa and Rep. Jim Jordan, the Ohio Republican who is expected to be House Judiciary chairman next year.\n\n“It is apparent that the Department’s leadership, including Public Integrity Section Chief Jack Smith, was closely involved in engaging with the IRS in wake of Citizens United and political pressure from prominent Democrats to address perceived problems with the decision,” Issa and Jordan wrote in the letter seeking Smith’s testimony.\n\nSmith testified that his office “had a dialogue” with the FBI about opening investigations related to politically active non-profits following the meeting with Lerner, but did not ultimately do so, according to a copy of his interview obtained by CNN.\n\nSmith explained that he had asked for the meeting with the IRS because he wanted to learn more about the legal landscape of political non-profits following the Citizens United decision because he was relatively new to the public integrity section. He said that Lerner explained it would be difficult if not impossible to bring a case on the abuse of tax-exempt status.\n\nSmith repeated at several points in the interview that the Justice Department did not pursue any investigations due to politics.\n\n“I want to be clear – it would be more about looking at the issue, looking at whether it made sense to open investigations,” he said. “If we did, you know, how would you go about doing this? Is there predication, a basis to open an investigation? Things like that. I can’t say as I sit here now specifically, you know, the back-and-forth of that discussion. I can just tell you that – because I know one of your concerns is that organizations were targeted. And I can tell you that we, Public Integrity, did not open any investigations as a result of those discussions and that we certainly, as you know, have not brought any cases as a result of that.”\n\nSmith also testified that he was not aware of anyone at the Justice Department placing pressure on the IRS – and that he was never pressured to investigate any political groups.\n\n“No. And maybe I can stop you guys. I know there’s a series of these questions. I’ve never been asked these things, and anybody who knows me would never even consider asking me to do such a thing,” Smith said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Kara Scannell Jeremy Herb Katelyn Polantz Chandelis Duster", "Zachary Cohen", "Kara Scannell", "Jeremy Herb", "Katelyn Polantz", "Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/11/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/sport/tua-tagovailoa-miami-dolphins-buffalo-bills-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "NFLPA to initiate review into handling of Tua Tagovailoa's injury as ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) has told the NFL it wants to initiate a review into the handling of Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa’s apparent head injury suffered on Sunday, the players association confirmed to CNN on Sunday.\n\nIn the second quarter of the Dolphins’ 21-19 victory against the Buffalo Bills, Tagovailoa exited the game having appeared to suffer a head injury after a hit from linebacker Matt Milano caused his helmet to hit the turf.\n\nAs he attempted to make his way back to the line of scrimmage, Tagovailoa stumbled, almost losing his balance before being taken to the locker room for a concussion check. Milano was flagged for a roughing the passer penalty.\n\nThe Dolphins announced Tagovailoa was questionable to return with a head injury, with back-up quarterback Teddy Bridgewater taking three snaps in his absence, but he came back out onto the field in the third quarter after halftime.\n\nThe NFL-NFLPA joint concussion protocol states that “gross motor instability is determined by a team physician in consultation with the Unaffiliated Neurotrauma Consultant, to be neurologically caused.” Tagovailoa was cleared when evaluated.\n\nThe NFL confirmed to CNN that a joint investigation will happen. CNN has reached out to the Dolphins for comment.\n\nAfter the game, Tagovailoa told reporters that he fell onto his back before his head hit the turf causing his back to lock up and the resulting stumbling. He added that he was evaluated for a concussion but was ultimately cleared.\n\n“The adrenaline kept me going,” Tagovailoa said.\n\nDolphins head coach Mike McDaniel alluded to the back injury after the game also, saying that Tagovailoa’s back got “bent” on an earlier play but the hit “loosened his back” causing his legs to get wobbly. McDaniel added that Tagovailoa told him that his back was like “Gumby.”\n\nTagovailoa lays on the turf during the second quarter of the game against the Buffalo Bills. Megan Briggs/Getty Images\n\n‘Butt punt’\n\nTagovailoa’s brief stint in the concussion protocol was just one of many twists and turns in the thrilling division clash between the Dolphins and the Bills.\n\nBoth entered the AFC East division clash undefeated, with both looking impressive in the first two weeks of the season.\n\nBehind superstar quarterback Josh Allen, the red-hot Bulls offense looked to be rolling in the first half, but the Dolphins matched them step-for-step, with the two teams tied at halftime, 14-14.\n\nWith just over 10 minutes left in the game, the Dolphins took their first lead of the game – and the Bills went behind for the first time this season – as Chase Edmunds ran for his second touchdown of the afternoon.\n\nNeeding a touchdown to regain the lead, Allen led the Bills down the field but was unable to punch the ball into the endzone, eventually turning the ball over on downs on Miami’s two-yard line.\n\nHowever, the most bizarre incident of the weekend occurred with the Dolphins backed up in their own endzone.\n\nOn their own one-yard line, needing to punt the ball away with restricted space available, Miami punter Thomas Morstead kicked the ball off teammate Trent Sherfield’s backside and out of bounds for a safety.\n\nMorstead has his punt blocked by his own player in the fourth quarter of the game against the Buffalo Bills. Eric Espada/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nThe internet humorously coined the incident the “butt punt” in reference to Mark Sanchez’s infamous “butt fumble” while he was with the New York Jets.\n\nSanchez joked about the incident on social media afterwards, saying: “Woah… stay out of my lane bro.”\n\nDespite the oddity of the incident, it left the Dolphins in tough position, with a two-point lead with just over 90 seconds left and with Allen only needing a field goal to win the game.\n\nHowever, Miami’s defense – which had harassed Allen all day – managed to once again stifle Buffalo’s progress down the field, with time expiring as the Bills offense attempted to snap the ball on the Dolphins’ 41-yard line.\n\nThe victory, over many people’s favorite for Super Bowl success this year, was a statement win for Miami, leaving them top of the AFC East division and undefeated at 3-0. The Bills slip to 2-1.\n\nAfter the game, Miami head coach McDaniel said he learned a lot about his team during the gritty win.\n\n“I think we have a lot of team – I learned a lot about the resolve,” he told the media. “You don’t know until you have it happen.\n\n“The team got a lot of confidence in the offense last week. So when you worry that when push comes to shove and you’re trying to finish the game that if you get a first down, the game is over, and you can’t get a yard, you worry about the team’s resolve.\n\n“But I see much better than I hear. I was hoping, but to see the way they came back with confidence and played attacking football, I learned what I would hope to learn. You never know until you’re in those situations, but I was very happy with the entire team and how they pressed forward because even special teams, you know, we have an unfortunate situation.”", "authors": ["Ben Morse Jacob Lev", "Ben Morse", "Jacob Lev"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/08/football/uswnt-england-wembley-friendly-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "USWNT defeated by England in front of record Wembley crowd ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States Women’s National Team (USWNT) was defeated 2-1 by England at Wembley in an international friendly that spotlighted both the increasing popularity of women’s football and its failures.\n\nBilled as a match-up between the world and European champions, both teams had displayed impressive form in recent months – the USWNT arrived on a 21-game unbeaten streak and England on its own 23-game unbeaten run that included winning Euro 2022.\n\nBut the build-up to the match was dominated by matters off the pitch as, back in the US, women’s professional soccer had been left reeling from an independent investigation that found systemic abuse and misconduct within the sport.\n\n“It’s been an extremely difficult week for everybody and I’m proud of the players for even being on the field and playing the game,” US head coach Vltako Andonovski said after the match, according to the BBC. “It wasn’t easy.\n\n“I applaud their bravery and I applaud their fearless mentality and relentlessness. Once again they showed that nothing can stop them playing the game that they love. I’m very proud of them and hoping we never have to go through that again.”\n\nBefore kickoff, both teams came together, holding a banner that read, “Protect the Players,” while the Wembley Arch was illuminated with teal light to show support for the victims of abuse.\n\n“First and foremost, if the players aren’t protected, then you don’t have a game, you don’t have anything. So for us to put that at the forefront of such an important night and game was really amazing and powerful for all of us,” American soccer star Megan Rapinoe said after the game, per Sky Sports.\n\nThroughout the match, both teams also wore teal armbands in a further display of support.\n\n“To take the time to do that, get the armbands – I think they were flown in from California and a little tight on some people, I’m happy I have a skinny arm - just an incredible show by all of us, some things are bigger than the game and we were able to put that on display,” Rapinoe added.\n\n“Obviously the report came out about our league but … it’s probably a global issue as well. To anyone in the stands tonight who has been affected by it, obviously all the players, to just show that kind of support on a night like this.”\n\nAnd the night showcased the increasing reach of women’s football as 76,893 fans gathered at Wembley Stadium – the highest attended friendly match in USWNT history – to watch both sides beginning to fine tune their preparations for next year’s World Cup.\n\nEngland took the lead after just nine minutes, as Beth Mead played a ball into the box that eluded US defender Alana Cook and landed at the feet of Lauren Hemp, who guided the ball into the goal.\n\nLauren Hemp celebrates scoring her side's first goal.

But we can’t forget she’s 21 years old,” US head coach Vltako Andovnoski told media after the game, according to CBS Sports.\n\n“To come in an environment like this, and to be a difference maker … it just shows the potential that she has. I think that we haven’t seen the best of her [yet].\n\n“These are games that will expedite Soph’s development, and I’m excited to see what she’s going to look like six months from now, nine months from now.”\n\nSophia Smith is one of the USWNT's rising stars.

Georgia Stanway converted for a 2-1 lead.\n\nAnd the free flowing first half seemed to show no signs of abating as Smith opened up the English defense for Rapinoe who fed Trinity Rodman for a goal. But once again, the VAR intervened in England’s favor, ruling that Smith had been fractionally offside in the move.\n\nThe second half was an altogether cagier affair as England missed two opportunities to extend its lead, allowing the USWNT a glimmer of hope.\n\nWhen the referee awarded a penalty to the Americans for handball with just 10 minutes remaining, that glimmer widened a little but replays overturned the decision and England held on to close out its first win against the reigning world champions since 2017.\n\n“You are the best team in the world when you have won the World Cup. We haven’t,” England head coach Sarina Wiegman told reporters, per Reuters. “We are in a good place, but there are so many good countries.\n\n“We just have to do what we can, control, stick together and communicate with each other at all times.

In 2005, Pannick defended Thompson against prosecution by a Christian group accusing the BBC of blasphemy for airing Jerry Springer the Opera.\n\nAnd three years later, he successfully argued on behalf of the British Olympic Association, defending its refusal to allow sprinter Dwain Chambers to compete at the Beijing Olympics because of a prior doping offence.\n\nPannick then became a “surprise favourite” with Manchester City fans last month, noted the i news site, after being hired to defend the club against allegations of financial misconduct.\n\nWho is Lord Pannick?\n\nDavid Pannick “caught the legal bug at a young age”, said the BBC. At the age of 16 he “frequently attended the Old Bailey to watch cases”. The budding legal mind went on to study at Hertford College, Oxford University, before being called to the Bar in 1979.\n\nAged only 36, Pannick became a QC, specialising in public law. After winning several victories for claimants in the field of judicial review, he was soon appointed to defend the government of the day.\n\nHowever, he was “not interested” in serving as the government’s full-time counsel – “or in the judicial career that would follow”, according to The Jewish Chronicle. After concluding that a career on the bench would “offer him little intellectual stimulation” Pannick applied to become a “people’s peer” and joined the House of Lords in 2008 as a crossbencher, making contributions to debates and legislation.\n\nReflecting on his early career, Pannick recalled representing a man in Singapore facing the death penalty. “We lost,” he recounted to Sally Penni on the Talking Law podcast. “Our client was hanged. That’s not a good way to start your practice – you can only get better after a start like that. I tell that to clients – some are reassured, some are not.”\n\nAs a lawyer Pannick is “not known for doing much pro bono work”, said The Guardian, “but rather for his extremely high legal fees”. He charges in the region of £5,000 an hour for his services. Representing Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, during his divorce, the total lawyers’ fees for both sides “reached more than £70m”, said the paper.\n\nPannick’s public profile received a significant boost this year following his involvement in Manchester City’s legal dispute with the Premier League. His name was prominently displayed on a banner unfurled on the terraces, reading “Pannick on the streets of London” – a nod to a song by Manchester band The Smiths.\n\nFrom Johnson’s ‘opponent to advocate’\n\nIn 2016, Pannick gained “much merit” in legal circles after successfully leading the case, brought by Gina Miller, to allow Parliament a vote on invoking Article 50 to leave the European Union. Pannick acted for Miller again in 2019, successfully appealing to the Supreme Court against Johnson’s attempt to prorogue Parliament for five weeks amid the deadlock over Brexit. It was a case that marked him out “as one of the most skilled barristers of his generation”, said The Guardian.\n\nBut Pannick “has now moved from being Boris Johnson’s opponent in court to his advocate”, said the BBC. In September last year, Pannick was hired by the government to review the Privileges Committee’s approach to the investigation into whether Johnson knowingly misled Parliament over parties during coronavirus lockdowns. He wrote legal advice which concluded that their methods were “fundamentally flawed” and could have a “seriously chilling effect on MPs”. The committee, however, rejected his findings and accused him of a “systematic misunderstanding of the parliamentary process”.\n\nThe reaction to his taking on the case therefore “has been, inevitably, divided”, added the broadcaster.\n\n“Those who think that Boris Johnson is a martyr and should never have been removed, think I am a hero; those who are opposed to Boris Johnson think I’m a disgrace,” Pannick told Sally Penni. “I have had a number of emails saying I should resign – I’m not sure from what. I advise people, I represent them. It doesn’t matter if they are Boris Johnson or an asylum seeker, they get my view.”\n\nNevertheless, Pannick’s legal expertise remains widely respected, particularly his ability to convey complex legal concepts in a comprehensible manner. As The Guardian’s John Crace wrote during the Brexit case: “A Pannick attack is a thing of zen-like beauty… In his hands, a legal submission izs more a cosy bedside story than adversarial confrontation.”\n\nJohnson will appear in front of the committee on Wednesday, accompanied by Pannick – although the former prime minister’s barrister “will not speak himself”. He will, however, “be permitted to pass notes to his client”, said Politico – “so he’ll be the one scribbling furiously”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Uk", "Richard Windsor", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/football/qatar-fifa-world-cup-explainer-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "How Qatar ended up hosting the World Cup | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith the World Cup now underway in Qatar, many are wondering how this moment arrived – that a tiny Gulf nation with little footballing history ended up hosting the biggest event the sport has to offer.\n\nQatar had never previously appeared at a World Cup tournament – let alone staged one – and became the first host nation to lose the opening game of the tournament with a 2-0 defeat against Ecuador on Sunday.\n\nThe country’s World Cup debut was 12 years in the making, a period in which Qatar’s host status has stirred controversy within the footballing community and beyond.\n\n‘New lands’\n\nWhen Qatar was named as host of the 2022 World Cup back in 2010, it was selected ahead of bids from the United States, South Korea, Japan and Australia.\n\nDuring the bidding process, it faced several obstacles as FIFA, football’s governing body, flagged concerns in technical reports. Those included a lack of existing infrastructure and the region’s intense heat in the summer, when World Cup tournaments are traditionally held.\n\nIndeed, the reports even went as far as to label Qatar’s bid as “high risk,” but the country nevertheless triumphed with 14 votes to USA’s eight in the final round of balloting.\n\nAt the time, Qatar promised to make the world “proud of the Middle East” as the first country from the region to host the tournament, while then-FIFA President Sepp Blatter welcomed the prospect of football’s showpiece event going to “new lands.”\n\n“I’m a happy president when we speak of the development of football,” he said.\n\nTwelve years later, Blatter is more critical.\n\nEarlier this month, he told Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger: “Qatar is a mistake … the choice was bad.\n\n“It is too small of a country. Football and the World Cup are too big for it.”\n\nBlatter said FIFA amended the criteria it used to select host countries in 2012 in light of concerns over the working conditions at tournament-related construction sites in Qatar.\n\n“Since then, social considerations and human rights are taken into account,” he said.\n\nWith a population of three million, smaller than that of Connecticut, Qatar has invested billions in its football infrastructure in preparation for the 2022 tournament.\n\nBut questions about just how Qatar won the right to stage the World Cup continue.\n\nAs recently as March 2020, the US Department of Justice alleged that bribes were accepted by top officials as part of the voting process to elect Russia and Qatar as the tournament host for the 2018 and 2022 events – claims Russian officials denied and Qatari officials called “false” in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe DOJ has been investigating allegations of corruption in international soccer, including FIFA, for years. To date, there have been more than two dozen convictions and some cases are ongoing.\n\nA statement from FIFA in April 2020 said it “supports all investigations into alleged acts of criminal wrongdoing regarding either domestic or international football competitions and will continue to provide full cooperation to law enforcement officials investigating such matters.\n\n“FIFA is closely following these investigations and all related developments in the legal processes ongoing in the United States and other parts of the world.\n\n“It is important to point out that FIFA has itself been accorded victim status in the US criminal proceedings and senior FIFA officials are in regular contact with the US Department of Justice.”\n\nFIFA was handed victim status by US prosecutors as they viewed football’s world governing body as having been almost hijacked by a number of corrupt individuals.\n\nHuman rights criticism\n\nQatar’s human rights record has also been in the spotlight ahead of the World Cup, particularly around the welfare of migrant workers.\n\nGiven the minimal infrastructure Qatar had in place at the time it was awarded the hosting rights to the World Cup, seven new stadiums have been erected ahead of the tournament, as well as new hotels and expansions to the country’s airport, rail networks and highways.\n\nThat has placed a reliance on Qatar’s migrant workers, who account for 90% of the total workforce, according to Amnesty International.\n\nSince 2010, many migrant workers have respectively faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation, and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback FIFA president launches explosive tirade against Western critics of Qatar 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\nHowever, Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) said the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” with “significant improvements” made around workers’ rights.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino also told CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies that he has seen “great evolution” in Qatar’s labor reforms, and the International Labor Organization has noted reformes like a non-discriminatory minimum wage that Qatar is the first in the region to adopt.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar’s state-backed discrimination against LGBTQ people has also been criticized in the years leading up to the World Cup.\n\nSex between men is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison in the country, and a report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nA statement sent to CNN on behalf of the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup, pointing to the fact that the country had, it said, hosted hundreds of international and regional sporting events since being awarded the World Cup in 2010.\n\n“There has never been an issue and every event has been delivered safely,” the statement read.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nPerhaps the most obvious sign that this World Cup is different to most has been the decision to stage it in November and December, rather than June and July as is the norm.\n\nSweltering heat during the summer months in Qatar has necessitated the switch, although temperatures are still forecasted to rise above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) later this week.\n\nOther changes to the organization of the tournament have been rather more last-minute.\n\nOn Friday, FIFA announced that no alcohol would be sold at the stadiums, and then on Monday, captains from seven countries were warned they would receive yellow cards if they wore armbands promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination.\n\nFIFA announced earlier on Monday that it had brought forward its “No Discrimination” campaign – which also has a designated armband – adding that “all 32 captains will have the opportunity to wear this armband” during the World Cup.\n\nFIFA’s equipment regulations state that “for FIFA final competitions, the captain of each team must wear the captain’s armband provided by FIFA.”\n\nTime will tell what the legacy of this World Cup will be, but if the past few days, months, and years are anything to go by, it is likely to be complicated and controversial.", "authors": ["George Ramsay"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/02/23/julian-assange-whats-stake-if-u-s-prosecutes-wikileaks-founder/4734934002/", "title": "Why WikiLeaks' Julian Assange matters more than you think", "text": "LONDON – His hosts claim his indoor soccer games destroyed embassy equipment. And that he liked to ride a skateboard in the halls. Nearly a year after British police officers dragged him – heavily bearded, disheveled and resisting – into a waiting van, the cramped quarters where he spent seven years avoiding the long reach of the U.S. Justice Department still retain the odor of cat litter from his trusted feline companion.\n\nA court hearing that began here Feb. 24 could determine whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who published classified U.S. government communications as well as emails hacked by Russia from Hilary Clinton’s failed 2016 presidential campaign, will continue to be confined – and if so, where and how.\n\nThe hearing will decide whether Assange is sent to the U.S. to face trial in a case that could have serious implications for First Amendment protections. Yet the core issues at stake – media freedoms in the digital age and the global limits of the U.S. justice system – have been obscured by Assange's personal life, by the refuge he sought in Ecuador's London embassy and by curious claims about his behavior not that well supported.\n\nAssange extradition:Hearing opens with claims of Trump retribution against media\n\nSince May, the Australian national, 48, has been locked up at Belmarsh Prison, a facility that houses some of Britain's most dangerous lawbreakers.\n\nAssange is there because he was found guilty of skipping bail in 2012; he fled to Ecuador's embassy rather than turn himself in to British authorities for possible extradition to Sweden. At the time, investigators in the Scandinavian country wanted to question him over sexual assault allegations connected to two women.\n\n'Evidence has weakened':Julian Assange's rape investigation dropped by Sweden\n\nAssange hid from British police in Ecuador's poky red-brick embassy building, just yards from the famous luxury Harrods department store, because he feared Sweden would, in turn, extradite him to the U.S. The Department of Justice has indicted him on 18 counts, alleging 17 forms of espionage and 1 instance of computer misuse crimes connected to WikiLeaks' dissemination of caches of secret U.S. military documents provided to him by former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.\n\nAssange denies all the allegations. The Swedish case has since been dropped. In Britain, he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for jumping bail, a period he has already served. He has been denied bail for his extradition hearing because he is considered a flight risk.\n\nBut there's more at stake than one anti-secrecy advocate's freedom.\n\nShocking detail\n\nJohn Kiriakou, a former CIA analyst who blew the whistle on a U.S. government-sanctioned torture program in 2007 that was approved by President George W. Bush because of the feared threats posed by the al-Qaeda terrorist organization, said that Assange's U.S. case could set a precedent that would erode press freedoms for news organizations that publish classified information.\n\n\"If you are able to prosecute someone who has a strong case to be called a publisher, then who's next?\" said Kiriakou, who served jail time after pleading guilty to leaking the name of an officer involved in waterboarding.\n\nAssange describes himself as a political refugee.\n\nHe maintains that as a journalist he should be immune from prosecution and that his work revealed embarrassing and highly damaging facts about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the detainees held at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAssange's detractors say he doesn't write stories or interview anyone or provide sufficient explanatory context and that the dissemination of raw, unfiltered documents and data – the publication of stolen classified materials – should not count as journalism.\n\n\"WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service,\" then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo, now the U.S. secretary of State, said in April 2017, in his first public speech as head of the spy agency. \"Assange and his ilk,\" Pompeo said, seek \"personal self-aggrandizement through the destruction of Western values.\"\n\nIn fact, Department of Justice officials in President Barack Obama's administration ultimately decided they could not prosecute Assange for revealing national security secrets, described as one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history, because it risked criminalizing subsequent national security journalism.\n\n\"During the Obama administration it was called 'the New York Times problem,' \" after the newspaper's distinguished record of publishing information on national security matters the U.S. government has deemed secret, said Stephen Rohde, a historian and constitutional law expert, and a past chair of the Southern California branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"In other words, how can we indict him for espionage when we're confident he's a journalist, a publisher and enjoys First Amendment rights.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, the First Amendment, as it applies to the press, restrains the government from jailing, fining or imposing liability for what the press publishes.\n\nIt does not shield journalists from criminal liability.\n\nOn the opening day of Assange's extradition hearing, James Lewis, a British lawyer representing the U.S. government, said Assange was guilty of \"straightforward\" criminality for hacking and then publishing secret military and intelligence information that put secret U.S. sources at risk of torture or death in places from Iraq to China.\n\nThe information Assange published contained about 90,000 Afghanistan War-related \"significant activity\" reports, 400,000 Iraq War-related reports, 800 Guantanamo Bay \"detainee assessment\" briefs and 250,000 U.S. State Department cables.\n\nIf nothing else, this material illuminated in shocking detail U.S. military and diplomatic procedure and actions in far-flung places, and the light it shined was not flattering.\n\nWikiLeaks' Julian Assange:Journalist or criminal hacker?\n\nTo his supporters, Assange is a champion of free speech and the public interest whose exceptional computer skills helped him reveal, among other things, video footage allegedly showing U.S. air crews in Apache helicopters killing a dozen civilians in Iraq.\n\nThe dead included two Iraqis working for the Reuters news agency.\n\n\"Assange published evidence of war crimes by the U.S. government,\" said Andrew Wilkie, a left-leaning Australian politician who traveled to Britain in February with fellow Australian lawmaker George Christensen in a show of bipartisan support for Assange. Christensen represents Australia's right-of-center Liberal National Party.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of the Trump administration but I'm a bigger fan of free speech,\" said Christensen.\n\n\"Assange did the right thing,\" added Wilkie. \"He served the public interest.\"\n\nStill, the U.S. government alleges that Assange is a criminal who conspired with Manning to steal thousands of pages of national defense information that has risked the lives of U.S. forces, allies and collaborators from translators to political dissidents with whom it partners to fight repressive regimes.\n\n\"No responsible actor – journalist or otherwise – would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers,\" U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said when the indictment was announced in May 2019.\n\nManning served seven years in prison, including pre-trial custody, before Obama commuted her 35-year prison sentence. She is now back in jail for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. Manning, who was convicted of theft and espionage, says she acted on principle when she handed over the top-secret information to WikiLeaks.\n\nIf Assange is sent to the U.S. to stand trial, he could get a life sentence – 175 years – if a federal court finds him guilty on all 18 charges and the maximum penalty is imposed.\n\nA Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on whether there is any evidence that the WikiLeaks disclosures have directly led to injuries or deaths.\n\nTo date, no evidence of deaths or injuries precipitated by WikiLeaks' disclosures has emerged and Lewis, the lawyer representing the U.S. government in Assange's extradition hearing, said that while Washington believes that many of its informants who were outed by WikiLeaks later \"disappeared\" it can't yet prove the assertion.\n\nJulian Assange:WikiLeaks founder claims ‘spying’ in fight over extradition\n\nSelf-imposed isolation?\n\nEcuador insists it kicked Assange out of its embassy after he became an intolerable nuisance at its building in one of London's most upmarket neighborhoods.\n\nWhile living there, Assange occupied about a third of the embassy's rooms with his cat. He brought in a sun lamp, treadmill, stacks of books, computer equipment and insisted on his own fridge. He also regularly hosted well-known guests such as the musician Lady Gaga and the actor Pamela Anderson. He addressed admirers and gave news conferences from the embassy's tiny balcony – often, as unsuspecting tourists passed by and expensive cars belonging to Harrods' wealthy patrons idled across the street. Due to space constraints, embassy staff had to share a conference room with Assange. One senior diplomat even shared an office with him.\n\nMost people have suffered through a houseguest from hell.\n\nOver time, Ecuador says, that's exactly what Assange became, even allegedly going to the unhygienic length of smearing his own excrement on a bathroom wall. The allegations were first made public in an interview in April 2019 with Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno, who also accused Assange of not looking after his cat and attacking the embassy's security staff. No evidence was released to back up the allegations.\n\nAssange's supporters and legal team strongly deny the claims, which have not been verified. Ecuadorean officials told USA TODAY that some evidence of Assange's misbehavior in the embassy can be found online, such as a YouTube video that shows him standing on a skateboard. Ecuador says it has not released additional evidence because of possible legal retribution from Assange.\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that Ecuador started to reexamine its relationship with Assange around the time Moreno took office in 2017. Moreno sought to improve relations with its largest trading partner: the U.S.\n\nIn fact, shortly after Assange was expelled from the embassy, President Donald Trump's administration said it was opening a \"new chapter of cooperation\" with the South American nation that included economic development and natural disasters help.\n\nAnd, cosmetically at least, Assange's expulsion from the Ecuadorean embassy does appear to mark a sea change in U.S.-Ecuador relations that was foreshadowed on Oct. 16, 2018, when the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs wrote a letter to Moreno offering to \"advance crucial matters\" and \"warmer relations\" with Washington if Ecuador \"handed over Assange to the proper authorities.\"\n\nIn February, Moreno became the first chief of state from Ecuador to visit an American president in 17 years. Moreno's predecessor, Rafael Correa, who granted Assange asylum and even Ecuadorean citizenship before it was revoked by Moreno, embraced Iran, closed a U.S. military base, expelled the U.S.'s ambassador and generally railed against what he described as belligerent American imperialism and capitalism.\n\nVegan meal:Pamela Anderson’s present for Julian Assange\n\nWhen USA TODAY visited Ecuador's London embassy in mid-February, some modest refurbishments and redecorations were underway. Officials pointed to the bathroom where they allege Assange spread feces on the wall and also showed off the hotel-style kitchenette where he prepared his meals. But citing legal action in Ecuador and Spain on Assange's behalf, over claims that a security company was contracted by Ecuador's government to spy on Assange while he lived in the embassy, these officials would not reveal further details about what led to Assange's departure. Assange has also tried to sue Ecuador's government for \"violating his fundamental rights,\" by claiming it limited his contact with the outside world while he was holed up there.\n\nEcuador disputes all the allegations and insists it has done nothing wrong.\n\nBritish press reported that his cat, who went by various names including \"Embassy Cat,\" \"Meowchael Moore,\" after the American documentary filmmaker, and \"James,\" was given to a shelter when Assange was forced out of the embassy by British police.\n\nThe YouTube video footage Ecuador cited as evidence for Assange's poor houseguest manners was uploaded to the video-sharing platform in April 2019. It shows a pale and barefooted Assange attempting to stand on a skateboard in a room in the embassy.\n\nHe repeatedly stumbles.\n\nA First Amendment brawl\n\nAssange has been indicted in the U.S. under the Espionage Act of 1917.\n\nAccording to Rohde, the historian and law expert, before Obama took office the 102-year-old act was used just four times against government officials for providing classified information to the media. The Obama administration used it eight times, including against Manning and Edward Snowden, a National Security Agency contractor who leaked information about U.S. telecoms surveillance programs to the press.\n\nSnowden is currently receiving asylum in Russia.\n\nTrump has prosecuted eight government employees for leaking information to the media, according to U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, a press freedom advocacy organization. His administration's use of the act against Assange breaks new legal ground because it is the first time it's been deployed to target a media organization as opposed to a government whistleblower.\n\nYet while the First Amendment protects the publication of truthful information, it does so only if this information is acquired legally.\n\nThe Department of Justice alleges that Assange explicitly solicited – encouraged – Manning to break the law by helping her crack a password that gave her higher-level access to classified computer networks.\n\nManning disputes the allegation.\n\nAs does WikiLeaks.\n\nThe Department of Justice's prosecutors are expected to reveal \"forensic\" digital evidence for this allegation when evidence in Assange's extradition hearing is heard in May. Assange's defense team says it, too, has evidence that refutes the allegation.\n\nAccording to a report in the Associated Press from April 2019 the genesis of the Trump administration's dialing up of the rhetoric on Assange can be traced to WikiLeaks' release, in 2017, of thousands of pages of documents revealing details about CIA cyber-espionage tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and consumer electronics. However, there is an alternative explanation for Trump's interest in a case that Rohde said that if successfully prosecuted would have a \"chilling effect\" on First Amendment protections for the press: Trump's disdain for the media.\n\n\"Assange is low-hanging fruit to Trump,\" said Rohde. \"They can go through the whole process, and win or lose, the process will keep the ball in the air and reinforce that he's prosecuting leakers and the media.\"\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, agreed with this assessment.\n\nTrump \"probably believes he can profit politically from pursuing Assange,\" he said.\n\nWhile the U.S. indictment against Assange does not relate to WikiLeaks' 2016 publication of hacked emails belonging to Clinton's presidential campaign, at a preliminary hearing for Assange's extradition case in late February, Edward Fitzgerald, one of his lawyers, nevertheless said there is evidence that Trump, viathen-Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, offered him a pardon if he agreed to say Russia was not involved in leaking the emails. The White House and Rohrabacher deny a pardon was offered.\n\nAs the extradition hearing got underway, Fitzgerald told a British judge the U.S. indictments against Assange were part of the Trump administration's determination to put a journalist's \"head on a pike\" – part of its war on the press.\n\nWikiLeaks intrigue:Trump offered Assange a pardon if he cleared Russia, lawyer says\n\nIf Assange is extradited to the U.S., he will be tried in the same court – the Eastern District of Virginia – as Kiriakou, the CIA analyst, who was also charged under the Espionage Act, but took a lesser plea under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.\n\n\"It's known as the 'espionage court,'\" said Kiriakou, adding that \"Assange doesn't stand a chance\" in that federal district court because the jury pool tilts toward individuals who are members of the U.S. intelligence community and their families.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department chose not to comment on whether the Eastern District of Virginia would offer an impartial setting for jury selection in any Assange trial. The White House and U.S. State Department chose not to comment on whether the administration was concerned about the impact of Assange's case on the First Amendment.\n\nLewis, who represents the U.S. government in Assange's extradition hearing, has repeatedly reiterated Washington's position that journalism is not an excuse for breaking the law and that the court proceedings in Britain will prove that he did so.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters ahead of Assange's hearing, Kristin Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks' editor-in-chief, described the indictment against Assange as \"propaganda.\"\n\nAnd Jennifer Robinson, a member of Assange's legal team, said he did \"what all journalists, all honorable ones,\" do every day: take receipt of information, communicate about how to protect the source of that information (Manning), and publish it.\n\n\"What signal does it send to countries like Russia, China\" and other authoritarian governments around the world if this extradition goes ahead, she asked.\n\n'If the law is respected'\n\nStill, it's far from certain that Assange will lose his extradition case. And even if he does, it does not automatically follow he will be sent to the U.S., according to Anand Doobay, an expert in the rules governing extradition at London-based firm Boutique Law.\n\nDoobay said if the judge decides \"not to refuse\" the U.S. request then Britain's secretary of state will have to decide whether to order it, a call that involves scrutiny of factors such as whether there is a risk that by extraditing him Assange could face the death penalty. British law forbids extradition under such circumstances.\n\nWhile none of the current charges carry the death penalty, Assange's supporters have argued that the Trump administration can't be trusted and could decide to unveil additional charges that do carry a death sentence once Assange arrives on U.S. soil.\n\n'Angst, anger':Roger Stone intervention stokes uncertainty across justice system\n\nDoobay noted that most extradition requests the U.S. makes to the U.K. are granted. It's not clear what will happen if Assange prevails in the British court. Because he has already served the 50 weeks for skipping bail he could simply be free to go. But if he is deported to his native Australia, the U.S. could try to mount a new extradition case. It could also issue an international arrest warrant if he travels beyond Britain's borders.\n\nAssange's health will also be considered and Nils Melzer, the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture, said in an interview that when he visited Assange in Belmarsh Prison in May last year he was displaying symptoms akin to \"psychological torture\" likely caused by prolonged exposure to extreme stress, chronic anxiety and isolation.\n\n\"He was very agitated,\" he said. \"Not the normal stress you would see in a prisoner.\"\n\nIn a series of preliminary hearings Assange has attended in person and by video link from prison he has sometimes appeared frail and confused when questioned by the judge. He has also lost weight. However, appearing in court for the extradition hearing in late February he mostly looked relaxed and appeared able to follow along with the proceedings. Although he complained several times that he was struggling to hear the legal arguments being made by both sides because of being forced to sit behind a high glass barrier in the courtroom, a scenario he said that has also prevented him from giving \"confidential instructions\" to his lawyers.\n\n\"I'm as much a participant in the court as a spectator at Wimbledon,\" he told the court at one point, referring to the British tennis tournament. \"This case already has enough spying on my lawyers as it is,\" he added, an apparent reference to his claims that he was surveilled during his time in Ecuador's embassy.\n\nAssange's legal team asked the judge, Vanessa Baraitser, to consider whether he can sit in the well of court, next to them, when evidence in the case is heard in May.\n\nShe said she saw no reason to change the seating arrangement.\n\nWikiLeaks' Hrafnsson said Assange's health has been improving but his father, John Shipton, told reporters ahead of the hearing that his son's long confinement has damaged his health and he feared any U.S. extradition would be akin to a \"death sentence.\"\n\n\"His situation is dire, he has had nine years of ceaseless psychological torture where false accusations are constantly being made,\" said Shipton.\n\nRecently, more than 60 doctors wrote an open letter to Britain's secretary of state saying they fear Assange's health is so bad he could die inside Belmarsh Prison, while 130 prominent figures from the worlds of art, politics and the media in Germany urged authorities to release Assange from detention because of his \"critical health.\"\n\n\"If the law is respected, then I don't see any way for him to be lawfully extradited to the U.S.,\" said Melzer, the U.N.'s envoy on torture, noting that there is a \"political offenses exclusion\" in Britain's extradition treaty with the U.S. and that \"espionage really is the quintessential political offense.\"\n\nMelzer added that while governments often prosecute leakers and whistleblowers, government employees who actually implement official policy that involves the perpetration of crimes, such as systematic torture, generally enjoy complete impunity.\n\nInstead, he said, with Assange, \"we're sanctioning\" those that disclose this information.\n\n\"That can't be right,\" he added.\n\nAt the hearing, the prosecution has argued that Assange should not be able to rely on the \"political offenses\" exemption in Britain's extradition treaty with the U.S. partly because in publishing the information he did Assange was not expressly trying to overthrow or a cause a change in the U.S. government or its foreign policy.\n\nFitzgerald, for the defense, described this argument as \"absurd.\"\n\n\"What other reason would Mr. Assange have for publishing this information if it wasn't to cause a change in U.S. policy\" in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, he said.\n\nSteve Bannon testifies:Trump saw Roger Stone as 'access point' to WikiLeaks\n\nMelzer, who is an academic and a lawyer, also expressed concern over the allegations of rape and sexual assault made against Assange that date from 2010. Sweden's authorities ended their investigations without charging Assange in November due to what they characterized as weakened evidence. Melzer said the police reports are riddled with contradictions and possibly even exculpatory evidence, such as text messages that indicate one of the claimants didn't want to accuse Assange of anything and that it was the police who \"made up the charges.\" This claimant was only concerned about getting Assange to take an HIV test because they had unprotected sex.\n\nMelzer said he has written multiple letters to the Swedish authorities asking for clarifications over inconsistencies in internal police correspondence but the response from the Swedish government has been: \"We have no further observations.\"\n\nIn one letter Melzer wrote to Sweden's minister of foreign affairs in May last year he says Assange has effectively been \"publicly shamed\" and \"defamed.\"\n\nThe Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement to USA TODAY that its case against Assange is closed and it does not want to comment on Melzer's allegations.\n\nThe Swedish allegations may appear tangential to Assange's case, but they are in fact a central plank in the circumstances that have directly led to his current plight: It's unlikely Assange would have fled to the embassy without Sweden's original claims.\n\nAssange 'told the truth'\n\nGeoffrey Robertson, a human rights lawyer who previously represented Assange – Robinson, from Assange's defense team, works in the firm he founded, Doughty Street Chambers – said that there was \"no doubt\" that the Trump administration was prepared to pursue Assange \"to the ends of the Earth\" because it is \"determined to create precedents that will shackle investigative journalism\" and prevent it from airing the U.S.'s secrets.\n\n\"This is about deterrence,\" he said.\n\nStill, Robertson added that \"America is a beacon of free speech\" and the First Amendment is a \"phenomenal example to the world\" at a time when all over the planet autocratic governments are trying to jail journalists or \"shut them up.\"\n\nIt would be a shame, he said, if the U.S. \"abandons its principles when we need them.\"\n\nRobertson, who like Assange was born in Australia, has won landmark rulings on civil liberties from the highest courts in Britain, Europe and elsewhere. He has been a United Nations war crimes judge and defended scores of people facing death sentences.\n\n\"What the U.S. wants to do with Julian Assange – let him die in jail, essentially – is completely disproportionate to what he has done: told the truth. And no one has disputed that what Julian Assange did was anything but tell the truth,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/23"}]}

Sign up\n\nNicknamed “Teflon” for his ability to emerge unscathed from scandals that would sink most other politicians, Johnson’s time in No. 10 has been dominated by Brexit, Covid and scandals. Here are the highs and lows of his tumultuous premiership:\n\n24 July 2019: Johnson assumes office\n\nAfter becoming prime minister just over three years ago, Johnson promised to defy “the doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters” by delivering Brexit within 99 days.\n\nIn a speech outside 10 Downing Street that was “infused with patriotic pronouncements”, said The Guardian, Johnson declared that “people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts”. Following three years of “unfounded self-doubt”, the PM said, it was “time to change the record”.\n\nBrexit “broke” Theresa May, wrote Alan McGuinness for Sky News, but Johnson’s “unique blend of rhetoric and optimism” was “the perfect tonic for a party that wants to feel good about itself again”.\n\n3 September 2019: he loses his majority\n\nJohnson faced a major showdown with his own MPs as they sought to block the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe “opening gambit” in an “acrimonious” debate was the defection of Phillip Lee, a Conservative MP who crossed the floor to join the benches of the Liberal Democrats as the prime minister addressed the Commons, reported Politico. He accused the government of using “political manipulation, bullying and lies” to push through its plans on Brexit.\n\nJohnson later removed the whip from 21 rebel Tories for voting against the government. The rebels included Ken Clarke, an MP since 1970, and Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill.\n\n13 December 2019: a general election victory\n\nAfter forcing an election over the Commons stalemate on Brexit, Johnson secured a “crushing victory” as voters backed his pledge to “get Brexit done”, reported The Guardian.\n\nThe Conservatives won 364 of the 650 seats up for grabs, in what the paper noted was “the party’s best showing in a parliamentary election since Margaret Thatcher triumphed in 1987”.\n\nEqually “astonishing” were the crushing defeats in the historic Labour heartlands, said the BBC’s political correspondent Nick Eardley. “Labour, by contrast, could hardly be in a worse position,” Eardley wrote.\n\n7 April 2020: Johnson is admitted to intensive care with Covid-19\n\nJust four months after his election victory high, in what The New York Times described as a “cruel reversal” of fortunes, the PM was admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 – the first major world leader reported to have contracted the virus.\n\nThe then foreign secretary Dominic Raab deputised throughout Johnson’s illness, which briefly “plunged the country back into the uncertainty Britons thought they had left behind” after so recently emerging from the “paralysis and polarisation” of Brexit, said the paper.\n\nIn an interview with The Sun on Sunday, the PM later revealed that he needed “litres and litres” of oxygen during his three-day stay in St Thomas’ intensive care unit in London, and that it was “50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe”.\n\n13 November 2020: Dominic Cummings resigns\n\nDominic Cummings “was seen leaving No. 10 a short while ago carrying a box”, reported the BBC, as Johnson’s closest adviser and key ally quit following a dispute that also triggered the resignation of communications director Lee Cain.\n\nTheir departures would “mark the end of the Vote Leave clique’s iron grip on government”, said the Daily Mail. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg described Cummings’ exit as “a political explosion”.\n\nAlthough Cummings would frame his departure as part of a long-term master plan, insiders told the BBC’s political editor that he “jumped because otherwise he would be pushed soon”. Johnson had recently come to see that his former aide’s band of “Brexit Boys” were just “in it for themselves”, the source claimed.\n\n8 December 2020: vaccination programme begins to roll out\n\nOne of the biggest successes for Johnson and his government was the UK’s Covid-19 vaccination programme. Indeed, “Britain soared ahead of every comparable country in the weeks after the vaccines became available, with the one exception being Israel”, said Hugo Gye of the i news site.\n\nBut criticism was not far behind. “Global leadership is an unaccustomed status for a country with one of the highest rates of excess deaths in western Europe,” said the Financial Times. “Multiple missteps”, such as the much-maligned NHS Track and Trace system, meant that “cynicism” remained over the government’s handling of the pandemic, the paper reported.\n\n21 December 2020: Christmas is ‘cancelled’\n\nThe hopes of a Christmas with loved ones were “dashed” for almost 20 million people after Johnson placed London and large parts of the southeast under “draconian” Tier-4 coronavirus restrictions, said PoliticsHome.\n\nJohnson had previously promised that Britons would be allowed to form “bubbles” with two other households over the Christmas period.\n\n“I want to be clear, we don’t want to ban Christmas,” Johnson told a press conference on 16 December. “And I think that would be frankly inhuman and against the instincts of many people in this country.”\n\nBut a few days later, families were told they could not mix after all.\n\n29 May 2021: Johnson marries fiancée Carrie Symonds\n\nAfter a turbulent year, Johnson married Carrie Symonds in a secretly planned Catholic ceremony at Westminster Cathedral.\n\nOnly 30 people attended the Covid-compliant wedding, as Johnson became the first PM to marry in office for “nearly 200 years”, the BBC reported.\n\nSome “disgruntled” congregants questioned how “the twice-divorced prime minister was able to marry in a Catholic church”, said The Telegraph.\n\n19 July 2021: England’s ‘Freedom Day’\n\nAs England prepared for all social distancing rules to be lifted on what some newspapers dubbed “Freedom Day”, both Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were accused of trying to “dodge” self-isolation rules, after being in close contact with health secretary Sajid Javid, who had tested positive for coronavirus, reported the BBC.\n\nNo. 10 initially said that Johnson and Sunak would not isolate as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involved daily testing. But the duo were forced to “perform a full reversal little more than two-and-a-half hours” later, amid widespread anger as opposition parties suggested there was “one rule for them and one for the rest of us”, reported Sky News.\n\n30 November 2021: Partygate allegations\n\nThe first allegations that Boris Johnson and Downing Street staff might have broken the government’s own Covid rules by holding parties and events during the 2020 Christmas holidays were reported by the Mirror.\n\nThe paper said that at least two parties had taken place. The PM was reported to have given a speech at a “packed leaving do” for a senior aide. And at a second event, while the rest of the country was locked down at home, officials were said to have “knocked back glasses of wine during a Christmas quiz and a Secret Santa”.\n\nDowning Street did not deny that the events had taken place, but a spokesperson insisted that “Covid rules have been followed at all times”.\n\nHowever, in a hint that further damaging revelations were to follow, a source told the Mirror that there had been “many social gatherings” in Downing Street over the holiday season.\n\n25 January 2022: Scotland Yard launches probe\n\nThe Metropolitan Police launched an official investigation into alleged Covid rule-breaking by lawmakers and officials, following a string of damaging revelations in the press and an internal government investigation conducted by top civil servant Sue Gray.\n\nNamed Operation Hillman, the police probe focused on 12 alleged incidents on eight dates between May 2020 and April 2021, and examined more than 500 documents and 300 photographs gathered by the Gray investigation.\n\nThe force sent more than 100 questionnaires to those suspected of attending parties at Downing Street and Whitehall, including Johnson, that asked for “an account and explanation of the recipient’s participation”. According to the Mirror, Johnson was thought to have attended at least seven of the parties investigated by the Met.\n\n9 April 2022: Johnson visits Ukraine\n\nIn what No. 10 called a “show of solidarity” with Ukraine amid the Russian invasion, Johnson made an unannounced visit to Kyiv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nJohnson paid tribute to “Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people”, adding that “Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv”.\n\n“I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run,” the PM said. “We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.”\n\nJohnson pledged new lethal aid to Ukraine in the form of “120 armoured vehicles and anti-ship missile systems”, as well as further economic support for the embattled nation, “taking total UK loan guarantees to £770m”, the BBC reported.\n\nIn a televised statement, he said that Ukrainians had shown “the courage of a lion” and that their president had “given the roar of that lion”.\n\n12 April 2022: fined over lockdown parties\n\nJohnson became “the first sitting prime minister to be criminally sanctioned” after the Met issued him with a £50 fixed penalty notice for attending a party for his birthday at No. 10 in June 2020, reported The Guardian.\n\nHis wife was also fined for attending the surprise birthday party, as was Rishi Sunak.\n\nAfter Gray’s long-awaited report was published in May, pressure from within the Conservative Party grew on Johnson, with a “drip feed of no confidence letters” being sent to Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee, along with senior Tory MPs publicly calling for the PM to go.\n\n“Veteran Tory” Bob Neill, chairman of the Commons Justice Committee, added his name to that list, “saying he did not regard the PM’s explanations as ‘credible’”, reported Sky News.\n\n6 June 2022: narrowly wins confidence vote\n\nMounting dissatisfaction with Johnson finally boiled over in June when the necessary threshold of Tory MPs submitted letters to the 1922 committee withdrawing their support for the prime minister, triggering a confidence vote.\n\nIn the end, a majority of Tory MPs backed the prime minister. But the margin of victory – 211 votes for to 148 against – was much closer than many had expected.\n\nDespite Johnson describing the vote win as “decisive” and “an opportunity to put behind us all the stuff that the media goes on about”, the BBC said: “The scale of the rebellion against him showed his authority had been weakened.”\n\nNoting the vote share in support of Johnson was lower than the 63% received by former prime minister Theresa May when she won a party confidence vote in 2018 before resigning six months later over a Brexit deadlock, the BBC’s political editor Chris Mason said: “The simple truth is when more than four in ten of your own MPs think the country would be better off without you, you have a problem.”\n\nNevertheless, under existing Tory party rules, the win meant Johnson was immune from a Conservative leadership challenge for a year.\n\n15 June 2022: ethics adviser quits\n\nA week after the confidence vote, Lord Geidt, Johnson’s ethics adviser, quit, saying he had been put in an “impossible and odious position”.\n\nGeidt had threatened to quit the previous month after concluding that there were “legitimate” questions about whether the prime minister broke the ministerial code over the lockdown parties scandal in Downing Street.\n\n30 June: the Chris Pincher affair\n\nWhat started off as a sexual harassment story featuring yet another Tory MP in the end proved to be the final nail in the coffin of Johnson’s political career.\n\nChris Pincher, the MP for Tamworth and the deputy chief whip, resigned from the government on 1 July and was suspended from the Conservative Party a day later in the wake of allegations that he groped two men in the private members’ Carlton Club.\n\nYet as more historic allegations emerged, Johnson was accused of ignoring warnings of inappropriate behaviour by Pincher before appointing him to the role of deputy chief whip in February 2022.\n\n“Under mounting pressure to reveal what he knew” before appointing him to the whips’ office, which oversees discipline within the party, Johnson and his aides repeatedly obfuscated and changed their story, said the BBC.\n\nSpeaking to Sky News’ Kay Burley, education minister Will Quince said he had been given “categorical assurance” from No. 10 that Johnson was “not aware of any serious specific allegations” against Pincher when he was appointed. But within hours, the prime minister’s official spokesman admitted that Johnson had been “aware of media reports that others had seen over the years”.\n\nIn an attempt to put an end to the growing furore Johnson issued a full apology in an interview with the BBC’s Chris Mason but it was too late, with senior cabinet ministers Javid and Sunak announcing their resignations as the interview aired.\n\n7 July: he announces his resignation\n\nJavid’s decision to quit as health secretary on 5 July triggered the deluge of resignations that ultimately toppled Johnson.\n\nIn a seismic 48 hours in Westminster, more than 50 ministers followed Javid in protest at Johnson’s decision to remain in Downing Street.\n\nHaving initially sought to stem the tide by quickly appointing replacements to the cabinet, by the morning of 7 July the game was up after it became clear he had lost the support of almost all his MPs and a flurry of junior ministerial resignations left his government struggling to function.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation outside No. 10 surrounded by his family and closest aides, Johnson delivered what politics lecturer Paula Keaveney described on The Conversation as “a bitter resignation speech” that “was followed by objections over its tone and led to calls for him to depart straight away rather than staying on until his successor is appointed”.\n\n6 September: he finally stands down as PM\n\nHaving taken the dramatic step of calling – and winning - a confidence vote in his own government in the days after his resignation announcement Johnson was able to stay on in No. 10 while a new leader was chosen.\n\nDespite the UK being in the grips of a cost-of-living crisis, the outgoing prime minister was accused of shirking his responsibilities and leading a “zombie government” by his critics, a view not helped by his decision to take numerous holidays abroad over the summer.\n\nHe departed Downing Street with the threat of an ongoing Commons inquiry into whether he deliberately misled Parliament still hanging over him.\n\nYet even with the threat of losing his Uxbridge seat and the unceremonious way he was thrown out by his own MPs, many, including perhaps Johnson himself, see this not as the end but merely a prelude to a second act.\n\n“When it comes to Johnson’s numerous misdemeanours, Conservatives seem eager to forgive and forget as soon as possible, with many not seeming to think there is anything to forgive,” said Prospect.\n\nJohnson suggested as much with his final PMQs, signing off with the phrase “Hasta la vista, baby”.\n\nGiven his extraordinary political career it would be foolish to write off such a dramatic return completely.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Mark Gimein", "Theunis Bates", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Sorcha Bradley", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/24/economy/brexit-uk-economy/index.html", "title": "Brexit has cracked Britain's economic foundations | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN —\n\nIt’s been two years since former Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed his Brexit trade deal and triumphantly declared that Britain would be “prosperous, dynamic and contented” after completing its exit from the European Union.\n\nThe Brexit deal would enable UK companies to “do even more business” with the European Union, according to Johnson, and would leave Britain free to strike trade deals around the world while continuing to export seamlessly to the EU market of 450 million consumers.\n\nIn reality, Brexit has hobbled the UK economy, which remains the only member of the G7 — the group of advanced economies that also includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States — with an economy smaller than it was before the pandemic.\n\nYears of uncertainty over the future trading relationship with the European Union, Britain’s largest trading partner, have damaged business investment, which in the third quarter was 8% below pre-pandemic levels despite a UK-EU trade deal being in place for nearly two years.\n\nAnd the pound has taken a beating, making imports more expensive and stoking inflation while failing to boost exports, even as other parts of the world have enjoyed a post-pandemic trade boom.\n\nBrexit has erected trade barriers for UK businesses and foreign companies that used Britain as a European base. It’s weighing on imports and exports, sapping investment and contributing to labor shortages. All this has exacerbated Britain’s inflation problem, hurting workers and the business community.\n\n“The most plausible reason as to why Britain is doing comparatively worse than comparable countries is Brexit,” according to L. Alan Winters, co-director of the Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy at the University of Sussex.\n\nThe sense of gloom hanging over the UK economy is captured by striking workers, who are walking out in ever larger numbers over pay and conditions as the worst inflation in decades eats into their wages. At the same time, the government is cutting spending and hiking taxes to fill the hole in its budget.\n\nWhile Brexit isn’t the cause of Britain’s cost-of-living crisis, it has made the problem more difficult to solve.\n\n“The UK chose Brexit in a referendum, but the government then chose a particularly hard form of Brexit, which maximized the economic cost,” said Michael Saunders, a senior adviser at Oxford Economics and former Bank of England official. “Any hope for economic upside from Brexit is pretty much gone.”\n\nNHS nurses strike over pay outside St Thomas' Hospital in London on December 20, 2022. Maja Smiejkowska/Reuters\n\nBusinesses count the cost\n\nAlthough Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, its exit from the single market and customs union was finalized only on December 24, 2020, when the two sides finally agreed a free trade deal.\n\nThe Brexit deal, known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, came into effect on January 1, 2021.\n\nIt eliminated tariffs on most goods but introduced a raft of non-tariff barriers, such as border controls, customs checks, import duties and health inspections on plant and animal products.\n\nBefore Brexit, a farmer in Kent could ship a truckload of potatoes to Paris just as easily as they might send it to London. Those days are no more.\n\n“We hear stories every single day from small businesses about the nightmare of forms, transportation, couriers, things getting stuck for weeks at a time… the epic length of the problems is just gobsmacking,” said Michelle Ovens, the founder of Small Business Britain, a campaign group.\n\n“The way things have panned out in the last two years has been really bad for small businesses,” Ovens told CNN.\n\nResearchers at the London School of Economics estimate that the variety of UK products exported to the European Union declined by 30% during the first year of Brexit. They said that this was likely because small exporters had exited small EU markets.\n\nTake the example of Little Star, a UK company that makes jewelry for children. Its business took off in the Netherlands and it had plans to expand to France and Germany next. But since Brexit, only two of more than 30 of its Dutch customers are prepared to handle the costs and paperwork to obtain stock from the company.\n\nProducts that took two days to ship are now taking three weeks, while import duties and sales taxes have made it much harder to compete with European jewelers, according to Rob Walker, who co-founded the business with his wife, Vicky, in 2017. The company is now looking to the United States for growth opportunities.\n\n“Isn’t it mad that we have to look to the other side of the Atlantic to do business, because it’s so difficult to do business with people 30 miles away?” Walker said.\n\nA truck passes a Union Jack, at the Port of Dover on April 1, 2021. The UK government has delayed post-Brexit checks on EU food imports until the end of 2023. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA British Chambers of Commerce survey of more than 1,168 businesses published this month reported that 77% said Brexit has not helped them increase sales or grow their businesses. More than half said they were finding it difficult to adapt to the new rules for trading goods.\n\nSiteright Construction Supplies, a manufacturer in Dorset, told the Chamber that importing parts from the European Union to fix broken machines has become a costly and “time-consuming nightmare.”\n\n“Brexit has been the biggest-ever imposition of bureaucracy on business,” according to Siteright.\n\nNova Dog Chews, a producer of snacks for canines, said it would have lost all its EU trade had it not set up a base in the bloc. “This has cost our business a huge amount of money, which could have been invested in the UK had it not been for Brexit,” it added.\n\nA UK government spokesperson told CNN that the government’s export support service has provided exporters with “practical support” on the implementation of the Brexit deal. The deal is “the world’s largest zero tariff, zero quota free trade deal,” the spokesperson added. “It secures the UK market access across key service sectors and opens new opportunities for UK businesses across the globe.”\n\nPermanent damage to trade\n\nBritain won’t easily replace what it has lost by forfeiting unfettered access to the world’s largest trading bloc.\n\nThe only substantive new trade deals it has struck since exiting the European Union, which did not simply roll over the deals it had as an EU member, have been with Australia and New Zealand. By the government’s own estimate, these will have a negligible impact on the UK economy, increasing GDP in the long run by just 0.1% and 0.03% respectively.\n\nBy contrast, the UK Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces economic forecasts for the government, expects Brexit to reduce Britain’s output by 4% over 15 years compared to remaining in the bloc. Exports and imports are projected to be around 15% lower in the long run.\n\nInitial data has borne this out. According to the OBR, in the fourth quarter of 2021, UK goods export volumes to the European Union were 9% below 2019 levels, with imports from the European Union 18% lower. Goods exports to non-EU countries were 18% weaker than in 2019.\n\nThe United Kingdom “appears to have become a less trade-intensive economy, with trade as a share of GDP falling 12% since 2019, two and a half times more than in any other G7 country,” the OBR said in the March report.\n\nThe decline in exports to non-EU countries could be a sign that UK businesses have become less competitive as they battle higher supply chain costs following Brexit, according to Jun Du, an economics professor at Aston University in Birmingham.\n\n“The UK’s trading ability has been damaged permanently [by Brexit],” Du told CNN. “It doesn’t mean it can’t recover, but it’s been set back for a number of years.”\n\nResearch by the Centre for European Reform, a think tank, estimates that over the 18 months to June 2022, UK goods trade is 7% lower than it would have been had Britain remained in the European Union.\n\nInvestment is 11% weaker and GDP is 5.5% smaller than it would have been, costing the economy £40 billion ($48.4 billion) in tax revenues annually. That’s enough to pay for three quarters of the spending cuts and tax rises that UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced in November.\n\nA heavy economic toll\n\nThe United Kingdom is projected to have one of the worst performing economies next year among developed nations.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.4%, ahead only of sanctioned Russia. GDP in Germany is forecast to be 0.3% smaller.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of just 0.3% for UK GDP next year, ahead of only Germany, Italy and Russia, which are expected to contract.\n\nBoth institutions say high inflation and rising interest rates will weigh on spending by consumers and businesses in Britain.\n\nAccording to the Confederation of British Industry, a leading business group, the fall in private sector activity picked up pace in December and has now declined for five consecutive quarters.\n\nThe downward trend “looks set to deepen” in 2023, principal economist at the CBI Martin Sartorius said in a statement.\n\n“Businesses continue to face a number of headwinds, with rising costs, labor shortages, and weakening demand contributing to a gloomy outlook for next year. ”\n\n— Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/europe/952573/is-germany-on-the-verge-of-electing-its-first-ever-green-chancellor", "title": "Is Germany on the verge of electing its first Green chancellor? | The ...", "text": "When Angela Merkel became the first-ever female chancellor of Germany back in 2005, the opposition Green Party was the fifth-largest in the country after winning just 51 seats in the 614-strong Bundestag.\n\nBut while Merkel’s Christian Democrat Union (CDU) has continued to dominate Germany’s political landscape under her leadership, the nation now appears to be on the verge of another first.

Baerbock “has called for a political renewal” that encompasses not just “the challenges posed by a warming planet” but that also “delivers prosperity to all Germans, from poor single-parent families to industrial workers”, reports Al Jazeera.\n\nMeanwhile, after almost 16 years in office, Merkel’s CDU is “slipping and stagnant”, says the NYT. The ruling party is facing criticism over the country’s Covid vaccine rollout and appears to be “short of ideas on how to keep Germany vibrant and rich in a world where its industrial and export model is outdated”.\n\nThe other traditional mainstay of German politics, the left-wing Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP), is “in even worse shape, both electorally and ideologically”, the paper adds.\n\nBy contrast, says Al Jazeera, “worries about climate change, frustration with the government’s pandemic response, and fatigue at 15 years of conservative rule” are boosting public support for the Greens ahead of the upcoming elections, scheduled for September.\n\nFormed in the 1980s, the Greens had a stint in federal government as junior partner to Gerhard Schroeder’s SPD for seven years up to 2005. But as Deutsche Welle (DW) notes, “they rather stumbled into a coalition that few had expected, having gained just 6.7% in the 1998 election”, and were widely mocked for hosting conventions that featured “hours of chaotic arguments”.\n\nHowever, Baerbock’s Greens “are not the Greens of the Cold War, a radical party appalled by the nuclear stand-off between the Soviet Union and the United States over a divided Europe”, says the NYT.\n\nThe Greens “are now centrist, eager for power, with a surprisingly gimlet-eyed view of international affairs”, the paper continues.\n\nIndeed, says DW, they are “united as never before, standing united behind their party leadership and avoiding ugly attacks on political opponents”.\n\nBaerbock, a former trampolinist who studied Public International Law at the London School of Economics, has co-led the party with Robert Habeck for three-and-a-half years. Announcing Baerbock’s candidacy on Monday after weeks of speculation over which of them would stand, Habeck promised to throw himself into her election campaign, saying: “Annalena, the stage is all yours.”\n\nThe would-be chancellor has been a Green Party member since 2005 and joined the Bundestag in 2013, and has been widely praised for her political savvy. In fact, “some commentators liken her style and analytical approach” to that of Merkel, says CNBC - a comparison that bode wells for the Greens’ chances in September’s vote.\n\nSeismic shift?\n\nWhile the Greens have come a long way since their Cold War days, they have “remained largely true to their 40-year-old founding principles”, DW says. The party still champions “the fight against climate change”, pledging to cut greenhouse gases by 70% by 2030.\n\nThe Greens are pragmatic when it comes to the economic agenda, advocating for a “debt brake” that would allow Germany “to raise more money on public markets”, as well as calling for “higher taxes on the wealthy”, CNBC reports.\n\nOn foreign policy, “there will be a lot of continuity with the Greens”, says DW. Like most of Germany’s other parties, “they are betting on a strong Europe, or better, on making the EU strong again; they are betting on reviving the transatlantic relationship”.\n\nHowever, DW continues, the Greens have agitated for a more “critical approach toward Russia and China”, calling to cancel the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia through the Baltic Sea, which Merkel’s government has strongly defended.\n\nThe NYT also predicts that Baerbock’s arrival in the chancellery “would potentially herald a shift toward a more assertive foreign policy”, in marked contrast to Germany’s current flexibility as global politics becomes a “competition between authoritarian and democratic ideals”.\n\n“The Greens are the only party that can rock the boat a bit, especially on China and Russia,” Jana Puglierin, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, told the paper. “They will strike a better balance between the economy and human rights.”\n\nThe Greens have “openly shown support for opposition groups in China, Russia, and Belarus”, reports DW, “and we can expect clearer tones from the Greens toward China on its treatment of the Uighurs” if the party claims power - an outcome that looks increasingly likely.\n\nHowever the cards fall, the Greens “will be part of the next government”, Norbert Rottgen, a prominent CDU member of the Bundestag, predicted recently. “Either a big part or even the leading part.”", "authors": ["Joe Evans", "Last Updated", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "The Week Uk", "Rebecca Messina", "Harriet Marsden", "Sorcha Bradley"], "publish_date": "2021/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/08/courier-journal-150-anniversary-justice-fairness/1200347002/", "title": "A history of the Louisville Courier Journal", "text": "When an angry mob protesting the Courier Journal's support of school busing broke $3,000 worth of windows at the newspaper building in 1975, advisers to then-Editor and Publisher Barry Bingham Jr. suggested he seek a court order blocking demonstrations near Sixth and Broadway.\n\nHe wouldn’t hear of it. He said he didn’t want to infringe on the protesters’ free speech rights.\n\nIt may have been the family-owned newspaper's finest year, Alex Jones and Susan Tifft wrote in their book, “The Patriarch: The Rise and Fall of the Bingham Dynasty.”\n\nEven as 3,500 readers canceled their subscriptions, the Courier Journal and Louisville Times in 1975 published an astonishing 1,200 stories on school integration — including one that included the names of the newspaper's executives and the schools their children attended, dutifully noting that Bingham’s two daughters attended private schools.\n\nThe papers also ran 330 photographs capturing the tension — and the rare moments of reconciliation — including one that showed a black boy and white boy, both 8, shaking hands at Greenwood Elementary School. The images earned the photo staff a Pulitzer Prize — the sixth of 10 the Courier Journal and Louisville Times have garnered since 1918.\n\nThe Courier Journal, which celebrates its 150th anniversary Nov. 8, has championed civil rights, decried discrimination, battled strip mining and helped save Red River Gorge. It has fought for miners and farmers and to protect children and the elderly. And its reporters have been cursed, threatened, assaulted and arrested while covering the news.\n\nIt has made mistakes, of course, and been guilty of hypocrisy, condemning right-to-work legislation on its editorial pages, for example, while the Binghams built a new printing plant in Tennessee, a right-to-work state.\n\nIn recent decades, the Courier Journal has been confronted with challenges faced by most media companies, including shrinking advertising revenues, new technology — from desktop computers to tablets to smart phones — and the changing habits and expectations of readers in the digital age. That has brought cutbacks in staff and its statewide reach.\n\nCourier Journal's 150th anniversary celebration:\n\nThe stories behind the Courier Journal's 10 Pulitzer Prizes\n\nAmid radical change, the Courier Journal is still proud and powerful\n\nSaints, sinners and mistakes: The untold stories of the Courier Journal\n\nAnd conservatives have always loved to hate what they called “The Communist Journal,” published at what they scornfully labeled “Red Square.” To its critics, it could be patronizing, even arrogant.\n\nBut as columnist John Ed Pearce wrote in his memoir, “50 Years at The Courier-Journal,” readers “might loathe editorial policies of the paper, and consider it just short of anti-American, but they depended on it, were accustomed to it, and were proud, if secretly, of the paper’s national reputation.\n\n“They might refer to it as the “goddam Courier-Journal,” he said, “but they wanted it on the doorstep every morning, and raised unshirted hell with the circulation manager when they didn’t get it.”\n\nWith home delivery to all 120 Kentucky counties and news bureaus across the state, it had enormous impact.\n\n\"This state would have been far, far worse off had it not been for the Courier Journal,\" Thomas Clark, Kentucky’s historian laureate, said in 1999.\n\nIn a tribute published after the sale of the newspapers to Gannett in 1986, Courier Journal Vice President Don Towles wrote that “every major progressive step taken by Kentucky in the 1900s to drag itself into the 20th century, screaming and protesting most of the time, was suggested, encouraged and supported by the Louisville papers. The poor were helped, the needy were served, the helpless and infirm were tended because the newspapers did their jobs.”\n\nIts editorial page was unabashedly liberal. But Republican Larry Forgy, a conservative who ran three times for governor in the 1980s and 1990s and frequently tangled with the newspaper, said in a recent interview that it had a “civilizing influence on the state” and that it “doesn’t have the reach it once had but still stands for more than most papers.”\n\nPearce wrote that in his travels around the state, he found two things — the University of Kentucky and the Courier Journal — were chiefly responsible for “holding together the fragmented, dissimilar regions of the Disunited State of Kentucky.”\n\nIt has been a newspaper of firsts: The first to run corrections every day in the same place in the paper. The first to appoint an independent ombudsman to field complaints. The first major paper to appoint a woman to run its editorial pages (Molly Clowes, in 1966) and to be its managing editor (Carol Sutton in 1974).\n\nIn 1952, a group of several hundred newspaper publishers ranked it fourth among the nation’s top 10 papers, trailing only the New York Times, the St. Louis Post Dispatch and the Christian Science Monitor. Time magazine later twice ranked it among the top 10.\n\nBacked by the Binghams' fortune, it could afford to take tough stands that displeased advertisers and the public.\n\n“A newspaper cannot hope to please all readers,” Barry Bingham Sr., then-editor and publisher, wrote in 1968 on the newspaper’s 100th anniversary. “What it must do is to strive tirelessly to merit the respect of fair-minded people. It must accept legitimate criticism in good grace, as the best tonic a newspaper can take for its health.”\n\nUnder the Binghams and Gannett, the Courier Journal has transparently reported its own transgressions, starting with publisher Mark Ethridge, who upon his arrest for drunken driving leaving the Pendennis Club in 1950, used his one call from jail to ring the city desk to demand it write about the news. It did. During his 15 years as publisher, Barry Bingham Jr. ordered up stories when he was caught running a red light, speeding on River Road and hunting doves on a baited field.\n\nAnd when Gannett named Wes Jackson publisher in 2012, the tradition continued: The Courier Journal’s story about his appointment mentioned that years earlier, when he was a football player at the University of Kentucky, he was arrested for drinking while using the official car of his mother, then-Jefferson County Clerk Rebecca Jackson.\n\nThe Courier Journal under Gannett also has reported when it was fined $91,000 for failing to obtain an air-pollution permit for its printing plant, and how a contractor butchered 40 trees in its parking lots as the city worked to increase its tree canopy, prompting president Eddie Tyner to say, “Shame on us.”\n\nThe Courier Journal’s history can be divided into three eras.\n\nFirst there was the 50-year reign of mustachioed Henry Watterson, known as “Marse” — Southern for master — who fought for the Confederacy but loved Lincoln and became a nationally renowned champion of reconciliation between the North and South.\n\nThen there was the Bingham era — the 68 years the paper was led by three generations of the patrician family. The first was Judge Robert Worth Bingham, who bought it in 1918 after collecting a $5 million inheritance from his wife, the richest woman in America, who died under mysterious circumstances.\n\nAnd finally there is the 32 years that the paper has been operated by Gannett, the publicly traded owner of USA TODAY and 109 other local newspapers. During that period, the company has contracted the Courier Journal's state coverage but transformed it from a print-only operation to one that reaches a wider digital audience.\n\nCHAPTER 1: The Marse Watterson years\n\nThe first edition of the Courier Journal on Sunday, Nov. 8, 1868, was only four pages, but it was packed with news. The print was tiny, and there were no photographs or illustrations.\n\nOne of the stories that first day told how 37 people had died in the previous week, six from consumption, as tuberculosis was then called, four from measles, three from pneumonia, two each from apoplexy, typhoid fever and “softening of the brain.” The death toll includes 11 children under 3 years old.\n\nFrom the beginning, the paper set its sights high.\n\nFormed through the merger of the Louisville Daily Journal, which had opposed slavery, and the Louisville Morning Courier, which supported the Confederacy, it boasted in a note to readers that the new paper immediately “assumed a circulation, influence and value enjoyed by no paper out of New York.”\n\nIt was an unlikely alliance. The two papers had fought one another so bitterly that 11 years earlier, their editors fought a duel. They both survived.\n\nNow one of them, an ailing George Prentice, who would die in 1870, recruited Watterson, who was only 28, to edit the paper. Prentice had run the Journal, notoriously editorializing against Catholics and immigrants, whom he derided as “pestilent foreign swarms,” brewing hatred and hysteria that culminated in the “Bloody Riot” of 1855 in which 22 people in Louisville were killed as they tried to vote.\n\nWatterson’s claim to wartime fame came from editing the Rebel, a newspaper widely read throughout the South and popular with soldiers. But with W.N. Haldeman running the business side, Watterson wrote in favor of such then-radical causes as schools for blacks, which enraged so many readers that he was challenged repeatedly to duels, Joe Creason wrote in a history of the newspaper published on its 100th anniversary.\n\nWhile Watterson was more enlightened than most Southern Democrats and favored some rights for blacks, he was still a racist who supported segregation, said James C. Klotter, Kentucky’s state historian and professor emeritus at Georgetown College.\n\nAnd his newspaper was rife with vile slurs. In its first full year, in 1869, it printed 11 stories that used the N-word — though that word was used 292 times during the last year Prentice controlled the blatantly racist Louisville Daily Courier. In a 1903 speech in Chicago, Watterson said that after 30 years of observation, \"always directed from a sympathetic point of view, I am forced to agree ... that negro suffrage is a failure because Southern blacks are not equal to it. Where there is one negro fit for citizenship, there are myriads of negroes wholly unfit.\"\n\nThe news reporting under Watterson was weak by modern standards, though coverage of a devastating tornado in 1890 included a list of the damage to every home and building in Louisville. Still, the Courier Journal’s reputation was based entirely on Watterson's editorials.\n\nBy the time it celebrated its 25th birthday in 1893, the Courier Journal's editorial page was as widely quoted as any in the country, and Watterson was known as a political kingmaker, Creason wrote.\n\nLike virtually all newspapers of the day, the Courier Journal was affiliated with a political party, and throughout the South it was known as \"the Democratic Bible.\" Watterson himself briefly served in Congress, chaired a party convention and served five times as a delegate to the National Democratic Convention.\n\nBut when he opposed Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan in 1896, infuriated readers and advertisers bailed on the paper, Creason wrote. Only the popularity of the Louisville Times, an afternoon paper founded 12 years earlier by Watterson and Haldeman, saved the company from bankruptcy.\n\nIt made its comeback in part through a special newspaper train called \"The Owl\" launched in 1904 to carry the Courier Journal every day to towns across Kentucky in time for readers to enjoy at breakfast. The move allowed Watterson and Haldeman to boast that the paper had the largest circulation in the South.\n\nThough at heart an isolationist, Watterson recognized in 1913 the menace of an increasingly powerful Germany. And as the war intensified the next year, so did his editorials, which again put the newspaper at risk because many of its major advertisers were of German origin.\n\nBut he didn’t retreat, and his editorials calling for the U.S. to declare war on Germany — “To hell with the Hohenzollerns and the Hapsburgs” — he famously wrote, referring to two German royal dynasties — won a Pulitzer Prize in 1918, the newspaper’s first.\n\nBy the end of his career, an increasingly cranky Watterson railed against internationalism and women’s suffrage, denouncing “feminine freaks” and “horsey girls” who marched for the right to vote.\n\nChapter 2: A mysterious death and the Judge Robert Worth Bingham Era\n\nRobert Worth Bingham served only 10 months on the bench, but was forever more prominently known as “Judge Bingham.”\n\nAfter his first wife, Eleanor, was killed by a speeding commuter train in 1913 (some said she may have thrown herself in front of it), he wed Mary Lily Flagler, the widow of Standard Oil and railroad magnate Henry Flagler, and reportedly the richest woman in America.\n\nWhen she discovered soon after that she was afflicted with incurable syphilis, to get back in Bingham's good graces, she wrote a $5 million bequest — the equivalent of $90 million today — to Bingham in her will, after he previously renounced any interest in her estate, according to Tifft and Jones in \"The Patriarch.\"\n\nAs Mary Lily grew increasingly ill, Bingham \"made no attempt to locate the top medical practitioners in the country and rush them to Louisville, something a woman of her means could easily have afforded,” those authors wrote.\n\nWhen she died and her family learned about his inheritance, they hired the Burns Detective Agency to try to prove she'd been murdered and even secretly exhumed her body. The results of the autopsy were never released.\n\nKlotter, professor emeritus at Georgetown College, writes in his book, “Kentucky: Portrait in Paradox, 1900-1950,” that the “best available evidence suggests no criminality.”\n\nTifft and Jones, though, say that for the Binghams, the “ignoble roots of their great wealth would become ... 'the madwoman in the attic,' a painful, embarrassing topic rarely discussed.\"\n\nThe bequest made the Binghams one of America's richest families, according to \"The Patriarch,\" though Judge Bingham \"was well aware that it had come at a terrible price — a stain on his reputation.”\n\nJust days after collecting the money in 1918, Bingham bought the paper from Haldeman and vowed to use its power \"justly and wisely to further the progress of our city, our state, our nation.\" Bingham later wrote that the paper must \"never vary one iota on principle” and that “we are all that stands between the people of Kentucky and the power of those crooked scoundrels to plunder them without restraint.”\n\nAnd he acted nobly in many ways.\n\nWhen Henry Ford alleged that Jews were plotting world denomination, Judge Bingham denounced any form of anti-Semitism, and when the Ku Klux Klan burned a cross a half block from the mayor’s house, he lashed out at the organization as “un-American and un-patriotic.”\n\nIn 1924, when he was under mounting pressure from Democrats to run for governor, he refused, saying he thought it was improper for a newspaper owner to aspire to elected office.\n\nThe paper was hardly great; it thrived on a diet of accident stories and weird features. And while Judge Bingham promised to use the papers to advance the interests of the city, state and nation, he also deployed them \"to reward his allies, punish his enemies, and advance his pet political projects,” Tifft and Jones said.\n\nKlotter wrote that an “overtone of superiority” sometimes colored Bingham, especially when it came to Irish Catholic political bosses. “Part of the paradox of Bingham was that this man who often genuinely spoke for the people was himself an aristocrat through and through. His letters tell of his preoccupation with hunting lodges, full bred dogs, carefully crafted guns, English genealogy and ‘the right people.’’’\n\nStill, the pervasive sight of soup lines, apple sellers and the unemployed galvanized the belief of the Binghams in New Deal liberalism, which remained unshaken decades later.\n\nJudge Bingham funneled as much as $50,000 into Franklin Roosevelt’s first presidential campaign, putting him in an elite group of fundraisers that included Joseph P. Kennedy. (That same year, everyone on the paper got a 10 percent pay cut because of the Depression, which didn't sit well, John Herchenroeder, a reporter at the time, later said.)\n\nJudge Bingham hoped to be named secretary of state, but FDR tapped him instead to be ambassador to Great Britain at the Court of St. James's, the most prestigious diplomatic posting.\n\nThe stage was set for the transfer of the family business to his son, Barry Bingham Sr.\n\nChapter 3. Barry Bingham Sr. at the helm\n\nWith his father still in England but ailing (he would die the next year of Hodgkin’s lymphoma), Barry Bingham Sr. took over the newspaper, but in an unusual triumvirate that would preside for nearly three decades. Mark Ethridge ran the news side of the paper while Lisle Baker Jr. presided over the business.\n\nThat left Bingham free to set policies, including one that required running every letter to the editor not deemed libelous. He also launched an op-ed page that offered a wide range of views.\n\nFew papers published a higher percentage of indignant letters, Creason later wrote, including many that “rip the hide off owner, editors or staff members.”\n\nBingham made no bones about offending readers or advertisers.\n\nFive years after he took over from his father, on Easter Sunday morning, readers found a full-page ad for the National Committee for Planned Parenthood that said the \"first key to national health is birth control.” Bingham’s name was on the top of a list of sponsors.\n\nWhen angry readers canceled their subscriptions, he gave them their money back but wrote in an editorial that \"those objecting to the paper's conduct seem to think a newspaper should not have an opinion which a number of readers do not like. This would mean that a newspaper would have no opinion at all. And having no opinions at all,” he wrote, “is equivalent to having no principles.”\n\n\"Bingham Sr. liked bragging about excellence more than bragging about profits, which is what most newspaper owners talk about on the golf course,” Tifft and Jones wrote in \"The Patriarch.\" “He also seriously believed that his newspapers should lead public opinion, not just reflect it.\"\n\nBefore the word “environmentalism” was coined, Bingham’s leadership put the Courier Journal at the forefront of protecting the land.\n\nThe newspaper launched the Tom Wallace Farm Forestry Award (named for the then- editor of the Louisville Times) to recognize achievement in reforestation and created a Farm Incentive Program aimed at raising living standards of farm families. By the newspaper’s 100th anniversary, more than 2.5 million people had competed for the $5,000 in prizes offered annually.\n\nThe company's reputation for public service ironically rose up to bite it in 1949 when it tried to sell the family-held WHAS Radio, Creason wrote. The Federal Communications Commission refused to OK the sale, saying the company's record for public service was too valuable to risk losing the station to another owner.\n\nThe Courier Journal’s most prolonged environmental crusade was its two-decade battle against unregulated strip mining, which despoiled mountains, streams and forests. The newspaper's aggressive reporting and editorials finally produced tough federal legislation and brought the newspaper its fourth Pulitzer Prize, in 1967, for public service.\n\nBut it was in the field of civil rights that the Courier Journal took its strongest stand, pressing for integrated schools, equal job opportunities, open housing and other measures, Tifft and Jones wrote in \"The Patriarch.\"\n\nWithin days of the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, the papers began crusading for peaceful enforcement of the law. Bingham Sr. served on a mayoral committee to smooth the path for integrated facilities, making dozens of visits to theaters and restaurants to try to persuade owners to open their doors to blacks.\n\nBut while the newspapers supported civil rights, Bingham Sr. and his wife, Mary, affectionately referred to the large staff of blacks at Melcombe, their estate, as \"our dear nigs,\" according to \"The Patriarch.\" Mary notoriously insisted on draining the pool after one of her sons invited a black boy to swim in it, journalist Marie Brenner wrote in “House of Dreams: The Bingham Family of Louisville.”\n\nAnd through 1942, the newspaper ran a cartoon called \"Hambone Says\" that portrayed African-Americans with stereotypical drawings, used stereotypical diction and the N-word.\n\nAlthough the Louisville papers hired their first black reporter in 1961, black people continued to be banned from wedding photos and society columns in the women’s section. And the papers insisted on calling Muhammad Ali by his given name, Cassius Clay, for six years after he adopted his Muslim moniker in 1964.\n\nBingham Sr. had other shortcomings. He involved himself and his paper in politics and government in a way that would make modern-day editors blush. Like his father, Bingham Sr. thought it was wrong for a publisher to run for office, but he saw nothing wrong with palling around with presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson on a worldwide fact-finding trip. \"It didn't seem strange or peculiar,\" he said later to Tifft and Jones, admitting it would have evoked a furor later.\n\nIn 1959, he asked John Ed Pearce to assist Wilson Wyatt, the newspaper’s outside counsel, in his campaign for governor, while Pearce remained on the staff as an editorial writer. When Wyatt lost to Bert Combs, Combs persuaded Bingham to let Pearce serve on a state board to oversee expansion of the parks. Staff members protested that it was a conflict of interest.\n\nPearce also wrote speeches for Combs, which Pearce later realized was a mistake. “I thought I was obeying my publisher,” he wrote in his memoirs. “But in small ways the paper suffered, in that readers had but one more reason to suspect it was guilty of a conflict of interest.”\n\nCombs’ adversary, Happy Chandler, would say: “Pearce will write him a speech and Combs will stumble through it and Pearce will race back to Louisville and write an editorial about what a fine speech it was. You could say it is the shortest double play in history: Pearce to Combs to Pearce.”\n\nBut the newspaper was on the brink of a new era. Mary and Barry’s firstborn son, Worth, a dashing Harvard graduate who had served three years in the Navy, was being groomed to run it. He prepped first as a reporter in Minneapolis and San Francisco before joining the Courier Journal’s Washington bureau, then returned home to Louisville to apprentice as assistant to serve the publisher.\n\nOn July 12, 1966, driving to the beach on Nantucket Island with his wife, Joan, and daughter Clara, he had placed an 8-foot surfboard across the width of the car, sticking out the windows on both sides. One end hit a parked car and the board swung around and hit Worth in the back, killing him instantly. He was 34.\n\nHe was the second son to die tragically. Two years earlier, Jonathan had climbed a utility pole to tap electricity at Melcombe, to light up a barn for a reunion of his old Cub Scout troop. When he tried to make the connection, he was electrocuted. He was 22 and the youngest of five children — three boys and two girls.\n\nChapter 4: 'Mr. Clean'\n\nWorth’s death haunted Barry Jr., as he was almost universally known, Alex Jones later wrote in a New York Times story about the Binghams that won a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nGeorge Barry Bingham Jr., the second-born son, found himself unexpectedly forced to assume stewardship of the papers, a role intended for his older brother. Nine days after Worth’s death, Barry Jr. returned to Louisville from Washington, D.C., where he worked as a documentary filmmaker and took the title that had been briefly held by his brother, assistant to the publisher.\n\nFive years later, in 1971, when his father retired, Barry Jr. assumed the titles of editor and publisher.\n\nHe discovered such rampant conflicts of interest that \"it would make a harlot blush,” he later told Tifft and Jones. The farm editor was plugging his tractor dealership in the paper; a photographer was snapping extra pictures for the local gas and electric company; and reporters were taking free gifts, from theater tickets to bottles of whiskey.\n\nBarry Jr. initiated ethics rules that ended those practices and set the standards for the rest of the industry. Some of them bordered on the absurd. He insisted that his papers pay for review copies of books provided to news outlets for free, which irritated publishers because they had no way to account for the reimbursements. The Wall Street Journal dubbed him “Mr. Clean.”\n\nUnder his leadership, the newspapers won three Pulitzer prizes in 15 years and published award-winning stories that prompted reforms in coal-mine safety, the nursing home industry, coroners’ death investigations and the policing of negligent doctors.\n\nBut Tifft and Jones said his greatest legacy was his demand for ethics, and “in many ways, it was a more enduring contribution than anything his grandfather or father had accomplished.\"\n\nIn the latter 1970s, though, rising gas prices, the lingering resentments over busing and the rise of the Lexington Herald-Leader began pressing in on the Courier Journal’s dominance.\n\nAn internal review by news critic Bob Schulman found that the flagship paper was often out of touch. Stories rambled on endlessly, pocketbook issues were all but neglected, and arts stories were too highbrow to appeal to a wide audience. When Elvis came to town, for instance, the Courier Journal didn’t even assign a reviewer to cover the concert.\n\nSchulman concluded that if the Courier Journal were a person, it would be a “serious, often stuffy, upper-crust schoolmaster who wears his hair long and occasionally plucks a guitar to show he’s with it.”\n\nAfter taxes, the company barely broke even. An in-house study recommended cutting the news hole and reporter staff by 5 percent and reducing the number of pages of the paper circulated to distant counties. In an editorial in 1976 explaining changes at the papers, Barry Jr. conceded “the hard reality is that the newspaper must change to match the taste of communities they cover ... or die a lingering and needless death.”\n\nChapter 5: The fall of the house of Bingham\n\nThe first signs of a schism between Barry Jr. and his two sisters — Sallie, an author and feminist, and Eleanor — emerged in 1979, in a story in Louisville Magazine about the sisters titled “Bingham Black Sheep.” They called him sexist, even though five years earlier he’d named the first woman managing editor at a major daily paper and helped launch the downtown Jefferson Club, which admitted women and blacks who private clubs turned away.\n\nThe sibling rivalry boiled over in 1984 when he kicked his wife, Edith, and both sisters off the company board in favor of professional directors. \"If you can't read a budget,\" he said at the time, \"what in the hell are you doing approving one?\" He later complained to Fortune magazine about board meetings where “my wife was doing needlepoint, one sister was addressing Christmas cards and another didn't bother to attend.\"\n\nAdvisers warned him the move would backfire, and it did. Sallie announced she would sell her 15 percent stake in the company to an outside buyer if the family refused to meet her price. She demanded $42 million. The family countered with $25 million. Then she dropped her demand to $32 million. Barry’s financial advisers urged him to raise his offer to $28 million, but he refused, saying it would throw the company too far into debt.\n\nBarry Bingham Sr., then 79, threw up his hands and announced the company would sell all its holdings.\n\nTo maintain the newspapers’ value, management, which had always vigorously supported organized labor on its editorial pages, hired a consultant to break a nascent effort to organize a local chapter of the Newspaper Guild.\n\nThe announcement of the sale was posted Jan. 9, 1986, on a newsroom wall, in competing memos. Bingham Sr. called the decision an “unwelcome duty” but said “times change.” Barry Jr. called it a “betrayal,\" \"irrational\" and \"ill advised.\"\n\nThe staff and public largely blamed Sallie for the sale, but Tifft and Jones in \"The Patriarch\" cited multiple culprits, including Barry Jr.\n\n“He did not understand he was the head of a republic, not a dictatorship, and that much of his power derived from the confidence the rest of the family had in him,” they said. “He clung to the rigid assumption that his authority should be almost total.”\n\nAll told, the Binghams collected $448 million for the newspapers; radio and TV stations; Standard Gravure, the family's printing company; and other assets. Gannett, the nation’s largest newspaper chain, put in the winning bid for the newspapers, which it acquired on July 14, 1986, for $306.9 million.\n\n“I hope Gannett executives will pardon my candor when I say this is a day I had hoped never to live to see,” Barry Jr. said in a statement.\n\nIn his final words to the staff on July 14, 1986, he said: “Preserve this shrine of quality and integrity, which I have tried to help you build over the past 15 years. May you prosper and do great things. And may God’s peace be with you always. Farewell.”\n\nChapter 6: A new owner\n\nIn his first meeting with Courier Journal employees, Gannett chairman Al Neuharth promised to use “our substantial Gannett resources, money, talent and equipment to first preserve and then try to enhance the traditions of journalistic excellence that you have established.”\n\nBut by the next year, according to \"The Patriarch,\" Gannett established a 25 percent after-tax profit goal for the newspapers, compared with 12.6 percent in 1984, according to figures released at the time by Henry Ansbacher Inc., an investment banker.\n\nIt closed the Louisville Times in 1987, which Barry Jr. had already merged with the morning paper. The combined staff, which had 337 news employees before the merger, was trimmed to about 240 a year later after duplicative positions were eliminated. It now has about 60, according to the staff directory posted online.\n\nThe Courier Journal also eventually closed bureaus in Washington, Indianapolis, Southern Indiana and across Kentucky; ended home circulation in Eastern and Western Kentucky; and did away with its magazine, book page, Neighborhoods sections and stand-alone Business and Metro sections.\n\nIn an interview for his obituary, Barry Bingham Jr., who died in 2006, said he was saddened by the dismantling of the paper's bureaus and its shrinking news pages. “The Courier Journal is not what it used to be,” he said, \"but on the other hand, journalism in America is not what it used to be.”\n\nConsider this:Amid radical change, the Courier Journal is still proud and powerful\n\nStill, the Courier Journal expanded its reach when it took its first steps online in 1997, and later added photo galleries, videos and livestream coverage of news events and editorial board interviews with political candidates to its website, courierjournal.com.\n\nIn 2002, Gannett poured $85 million into a new production plant and press that allowed more use of color and had twice the printing speed. (The plant now prints the Lexington Herald-Leader, Evansville Courier Press and the Midwest edition of the New York Times, as well as the Courier Journal.)\n\nAnd while its reporting ranks shrunk, the newspaper continued to win awards and tackle tough stories.\n\nIn the year it was sold, two of its reporters won the George Polk Award for national reporting for stories about an air crash that killed 248 soldiers returning from a peacekeeping mission to Fort Campbell and the poor safety records of charter carriers hired by the Pentagon.\n\nIn 1989, the newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize, its ninth, for coverage of the 1988 bus crash near Carrollton, Kentucky, in which 27 people, 24 of them children, died in the worst drunken-driving crash in U.S. history.\n\nAlso:30th anniversary is 'a deep reminder' of deadly Carrollton bus crash\n\nIn 1999, the Courier Journal and two of its reporters won the Worth Bingham Prize for investigative reporting and a George Polk Award for “Dust, Deception and Death,” a series that revealed widespread cheating on coal-dust tests in Kentucky and other states. And in 2003, another pair of reporters won a Polk Award for “Justice Delayed, Justice Denied,” a series on how litigants and others suffered because of chronic delay in the courts in Bullitt County. A series on delays in the courts statewide was a Pulitzer finalist.\n\nThe staff rose to cover tragic national stories, including the 1989 mass shooting at Standard Gravure in which a disgruntled former employee killed eight workers, then himself; another in 1997 at Heath High School in West Paducah, in which a 14-year-old opened fire on fellow students in a prayer circle, killing three and wounding five others; and yet a third in January 2018 at Marshall County High School in Benton, in which a 15-year-old killed two fellow students and wounded 14 others.\n\nIts reporters told the story of the decline of Big Tobacco; the rise of addiction to OxyContin and opioids; and the abuse and neglect of children and the state's failure to prevent it.\n\nThey told how the Archdiocese of Louisville shamelessly moved priests and other employees from parish to parish after they abused children and adults, and ultimately paid a $23.7 million settlement to try to make amends for it.\n\nRead this:Sex abuse survivors don't trust priests — or Louisville's archbishop\n\nThey chronicled the rise of gay rights, starting with the hard-won Louisville Fairness Ordinance, which protects rights in employment and housing, and the historic 2015 Supreme Court ruling arising in part from a Kentucky case — the aptly titled Love v. Beshear — that established same-sex marriage as a constitutional right.\n\nIts reporters have uncovered corruption in City Hall, Frankfort and at the University of Louisville, where its stories about excessive pay and secrecy helped force the resignation of President James Ramsey.\n\nThe Courier Journal also has covered good news, of course, such the Kentucky Derby and associated festivities; the rise of the state's bourbon-related tourist industry; Louisville's burgeoning food culture; the opening of Louisville Slugger Field, the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory and KFC Yum Center, all downtown; and what was known until recently as Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium, just south of the University of Louisville’s campus.\n\nThe newspaper has chronicled championships of U of L and UK on the fields and the courts, as well as scandals off them. It broke the story of how coach Rick Pitino had sex with a woman at a Louisville restaurant, then paid her to get an abortion, as well as her conviction for trying to extort money, cars and houses from him. And it documented the more recent misconduct — including the shameful providing of prostitutes and strippers to recruits and players — that led to the ouster of Pitino and athletic director Tom Jurich.\n\nAnd of course the Courier Journal covered politics, including the election of Kentucky’s first Republican in 32 years, Ernie Fletcher; the rise of the next one, Matt Bevin, a dozen years later; and the GOP takeover of both houses of the state legislature, which allowed the passage of the party’s long-sought right-to-work legislation and the repeal of the prevailing wage.\n\nGannett initially brought in an outsider as top editor, Michael Gartner, the respected former editor and president of the Des Moines Register, which Gannett also had acquired. But after only one year, it put the Courier Journal in the hands of a home-grown talent, David Hawpe.\n\nHawpe knew the state intimately; he was often teased for claiming to be from both Louisville’s South End and the mountains of Eastern Kentucky, even when he lived in Anchorage or Crescent Hill.\n\nHe ran the news operation for 10 years until April 1, 1996, when Gannett brought in another outsider, Mark Silverman, the architect of a corporate program called News 2000, which focused on community news and diversity. In a 13-month stint, Silverman vigorously enforced Gannett policies, including limiting the number of stories that \"jumped\" off page one, and was notoriously tough on his editors, once asking a sports editor, “Are you being insubordinate, or are you just incompetent?”\n\nSilverman, who went on to run Gannett papers in Detroit and Nashville and is now retired, said in an interview that he was sent to Louisville to serve as a bridge between the Bingham and Gannett eras, but \"to be honest with you, I didn't handle it all that well. I was a bit of a jerk sometimes.\"\n\nSilverman was succeeded by the Courier Journal’s first African-American editor, Bennie Ivory, a founding editor of USA TODAY who had run Gannett papers in Jackson, Mississippi, and Wilmington, Delaware. He launched the Courier Journal’s first investigative unit and led expensive, yearslong court battles to make public records of the University of Louisville Foundation and University of Louisville Hospital. The newspaper’s outside First Amendment counsel, Jon Fleischaker, called him “a terrific force for openness.”\n\nIvory also reluctantly shuttered the paper’s bureau system, including its storied bureau in Hazard. \"We were not growing in the state, and there's real potential to grow our suburban market,\" he was quoted saying in his own paper. \"But we're not abdicating our responsibility for the big-impact stories. If there's a coal-mining disaster, we'll be there.\"\n\nIvory, who retired in 2013, was followed by Neil Budde, a Western Kentucky University alumnus who had previously been a reporter and editor at the Courier Journal, then helped launch the Wall Street Journal online. He was hired with the goal of expanding the news organization's digital and online presence but was forced out after three years.\n\nNext came Joel Christopher, in 2016, who remains as executive editor but now works under Editor Richard Green, whom Gannett appointed in May to oversee the Courier Journal, courierjournal.com and news operations at its other papers in the Midwest.\n\nAn Ohio native whose wife is from Louisville, Green, introducing himself in a column in June, vowed an “unflinching commitment to the First Amendment, to investigative journalism and to finding and then telling — through a host of new and exciting ways — the stories of Kentucky’s people, places, problems and potential in our 120 counties, starting right here in the state’s most-populated city and county.”\n\nGreen conceded that the news business has been “confronted by change and challenge this past decade.” But he promised to “fight like hell to protect and prioritize investigative journalism our community, state and nation so desperately needs in these polarizing times.”\n\nAnd he said, “We will kick over rocks, ask the tough questions, shine a bright light in those dark, unsavory recesses of government, protect Kentucky’s most vulnerable and celebrate the many good things that happen along this stretch of the muddy Ohio.”\n\nAndrew Wolfson: 502-582-7189; awolfson@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @adwolfson.

Disappointing results for the party in upcoming polls could also heap more pressure on Johnson, as Conservatives face two difficult parliamentary by-elections in late June.\n\nDespite the victory, the opposition Labour Party has said that by hanging onto power this time, Johnson makes the prospect of an early election even more likely. Labour Party leader Keir Starmer predicted to LBC that Monday’s vote would mark “the beginning of the end” of the Prime Minister’s political career – no matter which way the vote went.\n\n“If you look at the previous examples of no confidence votes, even when Conservative Prime Ministers survive those … the damage is already done,” the opposition leader told LBC Monday. “Usually, they fall reasonably swiftly afterwards.”\n\nFollowing the vote, Starmer said Johnson was “utterly unfit for the great office he holds” and accused Conservative lawmakers of ignoring the British public. “The Conservative Government now believes that breaking the law is no impediment to making the law.”\n\nScotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called Johnson an “utterly lame duck” on Twitter following the vote.\n\n“That result is surely the worst of all worlds for the Tories. But much more importantly: at a time of huge challenge, it saddles the UK with an utterly lame duck PM,” Sturgeon said in a tweet on Monday night.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'No way out': Commentator predicts Boris Johnson's future 02:10 - Source: CNN\n\nJohnson’s predecessor Theresa May was the last sitting British leader to face a no-confidence vote from their own party. May narrowly survived that vote, which had been called amid months of chaos over her doomed Brexit deal – but she ultimately resigned months later.\n\nMonday’s vote was triggered after more than 54 lawmakers sent letters to the chair of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, following a tidal wave of criticism over a number of scandals that have engulfed Johnson’s premiership for several months.\n\nLast month, a damning report by a senior civil servant found a culture of partying and socializing among Johnson’s staff during Covid-19 lockdown, while millions of Britons were banned from seeing their friends and relatives.\n\nBoris Johnson waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London in July 2019.

But Johnson has also been criticized for his response to a cost-of-living crisis, and his party suffered heavy losses at local elections in May.\n\nUnder Conservative party rules – which can be changed at any time – a leader who survives a confidence vote is safe from such a challenge for 12 months.\n\nBut with only 58.6% of Conservative MPs backing Johnson on Monday, the Prime Minister suffered a worse result than his predecessor May, who had the support of 63% of her lawmakers in a much smaller parliamentary party when she faced a confidence vote in 2018.\n\nDespite the worse performance, Johnson insisted it was an “extremely good” result, saying he was not interested in a snap election to gain a new mandate from the public.", "authors": ["Tara John Ivana Kottasová Rob Picheta Luke Mcgee", "Tara John", "Ivana Kottasová", "Rob Picheta", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/europe/boris-johnson-career-intl-cmd-gbr/index.html", "title": "How scandals of Boris Johnson's own making brought him down ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader Thursday, bringing his scandal-plagued tenure to an end after less than three years.\n\nJohnson was left with little choice but to step down after several high-profile members of his cabinet resigned in protest this week over his handling of misconduct allegations related to government officials. Dozens more members of his government have also quit.\n\nJohnson was ultimately undone by his response to fallout from the resignation last Thursday of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, amid allegations Pincher had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before. While he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson last week that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.” Other historical allegations of misconduct by Pincher emerged in the ensuing days.\n\nJohnson initially denied being aware of some of those allegations, but ultimately the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had been briefed years before and apologize for his decision-making.\n\nIt was the final straw for many political allies who had supported Johnson through crisis after crisis over the years. In recent months the Prime Minister had been facing a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices, for which he and others were fined.\n\nJohnson faced numerous other scandals that hit his standing in the polls – despite his 80-seat landslide general election victory just two and a half years ago. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and whipping lawmakers to protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Conservatives lost two key by-elections – results that were blamed on Johnson personally.\n\nIn early June, he survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nThat vote was triggered after months of speculation over Johnson’s future. The so-called “Partygate” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 laws by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday at a time when such events were banned, has dogged Johnson since the news broke late last year.\n\nA controversial rise\n\nWith the possible exception of his hero, Winston Churchill, Johnson was perhaps the most famous politician to enter Downing Street as Prime Minister, having forged a successful career as a journalist, novelist, TV personality and London mayor in the preceding decades.\n\nHe was a populist before populists really existed. His controversial comments – comparing Muslim women who wear face coverings to letterboxes, or calling gay men “bum boys” to name but two – appalled many. But he got away with his Lothario image, the public seemingly happy to accept his alleged affairs and love child. It seemed that Johnson could essentially laugh his way through any problem.\n\nYet, for all his ambition and charisma, the job of Prime Minister seemed out of reach for most of his adult life. Those who know Johnson personally say that he loathed the fact that many in the British Conservative elite saw him as a useful campaigning tool but more of a comedian cheerleader than a serious statesman.\n\nBoris Johnson waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London in July 2019.

Henry Nicholls/Reuters Johnson speaks outside No. 10 Downing Street on September 6. It was his last day as prime minister. Alberto Pezzali/AP In photos: Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Prev Next\n\nEven during his time as Mayor of London, winning two terms in a city that traditionally doesn’t vote Conservative, the most memorable moments of his time in office are images such as him inelegantly dangling from a zip wire or forcefully rugby tackling a 10-year-old child while on a trade visit to Tokyo. He just wasn’t considered serious enough for the top job.\n\nThen Brexit happened. Johnson led the successful campaign that defied the odds and saw the UK vote by a narrow majority to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\nOvernight, he went from being a man who seemed to have made a fatal political error by backing the wrong horse in the referendum, to the figurehead of a mass rebellion that had just overrun the entire British establishment.\n\nGuerilla journalism\n\nOn paper, Johnson was an unlikely candidate to become the voice of those who felt themselves to be voiceless. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York City in 1964 to an internationalist family. As a boy, Johnson would tell friends and relatives that he wanted to be “world king” when fully grown, his sister wrote in a family biography.\n\nHe was educated at Eton College, the most exclusive private school in the UK, alma mater of 20 Prime Ministers, followed by the University of Oxford. While at Oxford, he was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club: An elite all-male group for wealthy students, famed for ostentatious (and sometimes rowdy) displays of wealth such as vandalizing restaurants, then paying for the damage on the spot in cash. Johnson was never proven to have been personally involved in any such activity.\n\nJohnson worked as a journalist for establishment newspapers, most notably The Daily Telegraph, which made him its Brussels correspondent in 1989. It was here in Belgium that Johnson began writing what would become the most important chapter of his life story: Brexit.\n\nBoris Johnson speaks at a Brexit press conference in London in November 2019. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough the Telegraph was firmly Euroskeptic, the UK’s exit from the EU was not really on the cards at the time, and even English Conservatives seemed to accept this. However, they lapped up Johnson’s guerrilla journalism, which often stretched the truth of what was actually happening in Brussels.\n\nThe most famous example of this was a story by Johnson that claimed the EU was planning to ban the sale of bendy bananas. The EU repeatedly debunked that and many of the stories that Johnson published.\n\nIn 1999, Johnson was offered the editorship of The Spectator, a weekly magazine often jokingly called the “Conservative bible.” He accepted, agreeing with the owner that he would drop his by now well-known political ambitions, according to a biography by the political journalist Andrew Gimson. He kept his word for all of two years and stood to become a member of parliament in 2001.\n\nIn the years that followed, Johnson was swallowed by the conservative establishment. He carried on writing the conservative script as a journalist and building a base of loyalists both inside and outside of politics.\n\nAs Johnson’s confidence grew, he was determined to show the Conservative Party that his appeal went beyond the British right. In 2008, he was elected the Mayor of London – a liberal, cosmopolitan city that did not traditionally vote Conservative. Johnson believed that he was showing his party that he had the chops to drag them into the 21st century. The problem for Johnson was that they already had a new, young leader – his old schoolfriend and future Prime Minister, David Cameron.\n\nIt was Cameron who ultimately made Brexit possible. After winning his second general election as Conservative leader in 2015, he decided to hold the EU referendum on the understanding that Johnson would fall in line and be an asset for the “remain” campaign.\n\nInstead, in February 2016, Johnson shocked the nation by announcing on the front page of his old paper, the Telegraph, that he would defy Cameron and lead the Brexit campaign.\n\nThe rest is history. Johnson turned the establishment on its head and became the most influential politician in the UK. While he didn’t become Prime Minister immediately, he continued to build his power base, undermining then-incumbent Theresa May as she struggled with Brexit for three years.\n\nAs foreign secretary under May, he was blamed for worsening the predicament of the jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after wrongly saying in 2017 that she was in Iran teaching journalists, rather than on holiday, at the time she was detained. But his patchy record in the role did not appear to cost him much support within his party.\n\nA populist who became unpopular\n\nJohnson’s time finally came in July 2019 when he became leader of the Conservative Party, claiming around two-thirds of the membership vote. His brash style was vindicated later that year, when he silenced all of his opponents in a landslide election victory that would finally allow him to, as his own slogan boasted, “Get Brexit Done.”\n\nIt truly seemed that the stars had finally aligned for Johnson, who desperately wanted to be taken seriously. He made Brexit popular and personally dragged it across the line. He had completed his transition to the role of statesman. He had proved everyone wrong.\n\nYet, as the clock ticked down on so-called Brexit Day, January 31, 2020, a deadly virus was already causing alarm in Asia. It would soon start spreading across Europe and kick off the crisis that would remove him from office.\n\nJohnson had a mixed pandemic. He was lauded by the public for the amount of state spending unleashed to mitigate its impacts on those whose jobs and livelihoods were threatened, but panned by the more conservative elements of his party. He was accused of responding too slowly, but also for making lockdown rules so complicated even he and his team in Downing Street couldn’t follow them.\n\nThe breaking of these rules by Johnson and members of his team, the economic fallout of the pandemic leading in part to a cost-of-living crisis, his handling of the Pincher scandal and a general sense of the shine wearing off the Brexit golden boy were ultimately too much for his party. It seems its members couldn’t stand the thought of Johnson staying on and dragging the party into its grave.\n\nHis political career is a story of near-misses, sex scandals, celebrity, controversy and revolution that ended in personal tragedy. The man who only ever wanted to be taken seriously ended up, ultimately, as the joker once again.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959061/people-of-2022", "title": "People of 2022: from Meghan Markle to Matt Hancock | The Week", "text": "1.

Technically, those on the buses and planes are asylum-seekers who have been processed by federal immigration authorities and are awaiting court dates.\n\nWhere are the migrants coming from?\n\nWhile most of these migrants crossed the border with Mexico, they are fleeing poor economies and dangerous situations at home in Central America and, increasingly, South America. After crossing the border and claiming asylum, they are released in the US to wait for hearings on their asylum claim.\n\nRELATED: A ‘radical shift’ at the border is making things tougher for Biden\n\nOne person left in Massachusetts, a 45-year-old named Leonel, told The New York Times about his three-month journey from Venezuela through Colombia and Central America. He tried more than once to cross the US border with Mexico before being detained and then released in San Antonio.\n\nIt was there that he was approached and asked if he wanted to go to Massachusetts. It’s not clear if he knew he was headed to a wealthy island community unprepared for the arrivals.\n\nAre they being forced on the buses and planes? No, they are not\n\nAnger at the stunts is in part also fed by the idea that the people are being forced onto buses. That is not true, as CNN’s Gary Tuchman found when he visited a shelter in Eagle Pass, Texas, in August.\n\nHe met asylum-seekers planning to meet up with family and friends already spread around the country. Other migrants coming to the US without somewhere to go were happy for the free trip.\n\nWho is happy for the ride? These people have incredible stories\n\nTuchman talked to a 28-year-old woman named Genesis Figueroa from Venezuela who traveled for a month and a half by foot, bus and boat to get to Eagle Pass with her husband.\n\n“I got very tired. My legs hurt and I got sick,” she told Tuchman in Spanish. “I came down with pneumonia. I was hospitalized for three days in Guatemala.” Watch Tuchman’s report.\n\nHe also talked to cousins traveling from Venezuela; one man’s brother died during the journey after disappearing while they crossed the Rio Grande.\n\nNearly 750 migrants are known to have died at the southern border since October 2021, CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez recently reported.\n\n“We left in search of a dream, but now it’s a very difficult, hard situation,” Luis Pulido told Tuchman in Spanish. He was going to get on a DC-bound bus, hoping to get off in Kentucky to be met by relatives before moving toward Chicago.\n\nWhat happens after the bus ride?\n\nA week after their bus trip, Tuchman found Pulido and his cousin in Chicago, where they had met up with relatives, were sheltered in a small, shared apartment and were looking for work in a restaurant. They likely can’t legally work for at least 180 days, according to rules posted on the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website.\n\nWatch Tuchman’s follow-up.\n\nTuchman told me Pulido and his cousin went to their first appointments, but it was mostly administrative and they are waiting for their next appearance.\n\nIt takes a long time to get a work permit\n\nGetting a work permit can take up to a year, New York City officials told CNN’s Polo Sandoval, who also reported on this issue last month.\n\nHe went to a shelter in Brooklyn and met a young couple from Venezuela, Anabel and Crisman Urbaez, who are seeking asylum.\n\nThey showed him cellphone videos from their two-month, 10-country trek, often on foot, which started in Peru and continued through jungles in Colombia and the Darien Gap linking South and Central America – all with their 6- and 9-year-olds and their dog Max.\n\nHow long does it take to settle an immigration case?\n\nIt takes years. The average time to complete an immigration case is 1,110 days, according to data maintained by Syracuse University. During that time, migrants and asylum-seekers start to build American lives.\n\nHow many will be granted asylum?\n\nLess than half of asylum applications have been granted in recent years, according to Syracuse.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, the rate of denial was over 70%, but during the first year of the Biden administration the grant rate grew to nearly 40%.\n\nWhy are so many coming from Venezuela?\n\nAlvarez wrote recently about the mass exodus from Venezuela. The United Nations says similar numbers of people are fleeing the South American country – which has suffered from years of political repression and economic unrest – as war-torn Ukraine. Around 6.8 million Venezuelans are part of this diaspora.\n\nHow many people have crossed the border this year?\n\nThere have been nearly 2 million border encounters reported by US Customs and Border Protection so far in the fiscal year that ends September 30.\n\nSome of those encounters are repeat crossers. Others have been turned away under a Trump-era Covid-19 policy the Biden administration has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to end. A fraction are seeking asylum.\n\nWhy are officials declaring states of emergency?\n\nOfficials in New York City, Illinois and Washington, DC, have declared emergencies to deal with the buses, and they have complained they have no idea when or where to expect them, and they want warning from Texas, Arizona and now Florida.\n\nTexas has spent more than $12 million and bused around 9,000 migrants up north.\n\nOverall, the buses and now planes have moved thousands of migrants, but it’s a small fraction of the nearly 700,000 pending asylum applications slowly working through the justice system.\n\nThese stories are all unique, but so many of them share the theme of fleeing a home without opportunity and being comparatively happy for the trip inside the US from the border.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

The day after he was inaugurated, more than two million people across the world called for a \"revolution\" as a bulwark against the new administration they feared would roll back reproductive, civil and human rights.\n\nThe year that followed was no less dramatic.\n\nFormer National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was ousted from the White House over his Russian contacts. NFL players continued to kneel. There were multiple data breaches, but none larger than Equifax, which compromised the personal information of nearly half of all Americans.\n\nInevitably, there was tragedy. The catastrophic 2017 hurricane season brought us Harvey, Irma and Maria, which Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico will spend years recovering from. New York City saw its worst terrorist attack since 9/11. In Las Vegas, 58 people died in the worst mass shooting in American history.\n\nBut there was also wonder. For the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. We celebrated the news that one of our own, California native Meghan Markle, is set to wed Prince Harry and become the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIn the end, 2017 closes with hope. Women punctuated the year with the powerful rallying cry #metoo, prompting a national reckoning on a culture of sexual violence that has persisted unabated for far too long.\n\nAfter another eventful year, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state — the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about.\n\nAlabama: Roy Moore and America’s reckoning on sexual violence\n\nThe eyes of a nation were fixed on Alabama this December to see who the state would choose to take over its open Senate seat in an election that was seen not only as a referendum on President Trump — who supported embattled Republican candidate Roy Moore — but also on the country's tolerance of predatory sexual behavior. Trump was elected in spite of more than a dozen allegations of sexual assault and harassment against him. But Moore, who was accused in November of sexually assaulting and harassing multiple teenage girls when he was in his 30s, was defeated by Democrat Doug Jones. It is the first time in 25 years that Alabama has elected a Democrat to the Senate.\n\nThe Alabama special election came during what America has come to refer to as its \"post-Weinstein moment,\" a reckoning on powerful men who have abused women with impunity, and who, until recently, rarely faced consequences. Since the reports Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein harassed, abused and assaulted more than 80 women over several decades, women around the country who have long suffered in silence flooded social media under the hashtag #metoo and made public statements about the sexual misconduct they've endured. For many Americans, this reckoning is complicated by Trump's presence in the White House. Trump's accusers have revived calls for a congressional investigation into his misconduct. Some say Jones’ victory will embolden Democrats to do just that.\n\nAlaska: Fear of climate change rises after U.S. leaves Paris Accord\n\nIn 2017, America became the only country on Earth not part of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Trump decided to leave the pact in June. The Paris agreement, negotiated by former president Barack Obama, aims to combat global warming by gradually reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In Alaska, climate change is always front-of-mind. Many residents of Sarichef Island and an Iñupiaq village of 650 blame human-caused climate change for accelerating the island’s erosion and fear leaving the Paris agreement will supercharge destruction that's already occurring.\n\nArizona: McCain, battling brain cancer, stops Obamacare repeal\n\nIt was a tense July night on the Senate floor when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. — roughly a week after announcing his brain cancer diagnosis — sunk the GOP-backed \"skinny repeal\" of Obamacare with a dramatic \"thumbs down.\" Before the vote, congressional leaders had struggled to reach consensus on a plan to replace former president Barack Obama's signature health care law, which the GOP had promised for seven years to expunge the law from the books. Republicans ultimately scrapped a vote on a last-ditch Obamacare repeal effort in September, which McCain also opposed. As for his health, McCain said in September he would continue treatments for brain cancer while also doing his job on Capitol Hill.\n\nArkansas: Controversial Ten Commandments monument destroyed after less than 24 hours\n\nAfter years of fierce debate, Arkansas built a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol building. Less than 24 hours later, the monument was razed. Michael Tate Reed, 32, plowed his car through the statue while filming the incident on his cellphone and posting the video on Facebook, authorities said. The 6-foot, 6,000-pound memorial drew the ire of opponents like the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas and the Temple of Satan, who said the monument was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. Supporters saw it as a way to celebrate the role the Ten Commandments played in this country’s law. State Sen. Jason Rapert, who led the push to initially erect the monument, vowed to raise funds to build its replacement.\n\nCalifornia: Meghan Markle, America's fairy-tale royal bride\n\nRoyal wedding bells are ringing yet again. Suits actress and California native Meghan Markle is set to wed Prince Harry, the world's most eligible royal bachelor. The couple announced their engagement in November. Markle, who was raised in Los Angeles, will make history as the first divorced, biracial, Jewish American actress to join the British royal family. After they wed, Harry will likely receive a new royal title as a duke from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and Markle will, like Duchess Kate, be known as a titled royal duchess, HRH Meghan, Duchess of so-and-so. Also in royals: Prince William and Kate Middleton announced they are expecting their third child. Sister Pippa Middleton's May wedding was the A-list event of the year.\n\nColorado: Baker's confections vs. gay couple's affections\n\nIn 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins went into baker Jack Phillips' Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colo., to buy a cake for their wedding. But Phillips doesn't do cakes for same-sex weddings. Craig and Mullins said Phillips' refusal violated a Colorado anti-discrimination law. Five years later, their disagreement over a cake went all the way to the Supreme Court in a case testing the Constitution's guarantee of free speech and religion against state laws prohibiting discrimination. The court, bolstered in April by the addition of stalwart conservative and fellow Coloradan Neil Gorsuch, appeared split down the middle when the justices heard oral arguments Dec. 5. The decision, which will likely hinge on Justice Anthony Kennedy, isn't expected until next year.\n\nConnecticut: Hate crime, or roommate feud gone too far?\n\nIn late October, former University of Hartford student Briana Brochu was charged with breach of peace and criminal mischief for tampering with items that belonged to her roommate, who is black. Brochu admitted she licked Chennel \"Jazzy\" Rowe's eating utensils and smeared bodily fluids on her backpack. Rowe posted a Facebook video about the incident, which quickly viral, and prompted backlash on social media as many questioned whether Brochu's actions were racially motivated. The Connecticut NAACP and others called on Hartford prosecutors to file a hate crime charge against Brochu, but Brochu's lawyer, Thomas Stevens, told the Hartford Courant he does not believe the charge will be added. Stevens told the paper there was nothing \"racial that motivated\" the incident, and said they were simply roommates who did not get along.\n\nDelaware: Beau's death convinced Joe Biden not to run for president\n\nHad he run for president, Joe Biden believes he would have taken the oath of office Jan. 20 rather than the train home to Wilmington. The former vice president and Delaware senator, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom days before leaving office, revealed in his emotional book that he originally considered staying out of the 2016 race to pave the way for his son Beau's budding political career, and Beau’s death following a brutal bout with cancer ultimately convinced him it wasn’t the time to make the run. So what about a 2020 push? He hasn’t ruled it out quite yet.\n\nFlorida: Irma devastates the Gulf coast\n\nHurricane Irma sawed up Florida's Gulf coast in early September, the strongest hurricane the Sunshine State had faced in a decade. Its slow crawl toward Florida caused a run on hardware store and grocery essentials, while evacuation orders threw the state's highways into a standstill. After it pummeled Key West, the storm struck the Naples area, taking down trees and causing flooding across the state. All told, millions lost power and dozens died, including 14 people at a Hollywood nursing home, where a power outage left residents in sweltering conditions for three days. It sparked a criminal investigation in which 12 of the deaths were deemed homicides. Now, state lawmakers seek laws requiring assisted living facilities to have generators.\n\nGeorgia: Equifax data breach leaves millions of consumers vulnerable\n\nAtlanta-based company Equifax, once trusted to handle our credit scores, has become a pariah of the financial world since hackers stole the vital information of 145 million Americans in Equifax’s system. The breach announced this September included Social Security numbers, names, addresses and dates of birth. How did Equifax get into the mess? A security patch for a known system bug was issued but Equifax hadn’t installed it. Lawmakers asked questions, the CEO resigned, and a good chunk of America freaked out. One way consumers tried to protect themselves was by freezing their credit, but since everyone tried to do it at once, there were problems. Here's how to protect yourself from a breach.\n\nHawaii: Trump travel ban found trouble in paradise\n\nThe Aloha State was not a welcoming place for President Trump's plans to ban travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries. The administration issued three versions of the ban in 2017 and all three were blocked by a federal judge in Hawaii. But despite the Hawaii bench’s best efforts to thwart the ban, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this month that Trump’s order can take full effect while legal challenges against the latest version are still tied up in courts. By allowing the full travel ban to take effect for now, the justices may be signaling that they are likely to uphold it on the merits at a later date.\n\nIdaho: Bergdahl avoids jail time for disappearing from Afghanistan base\n\nSgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army soldier who disappeared from his base in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, avoided jail time despite pleading guilty to desertion and misbehavior in front of the enemy. Former president Barack Obama won freedom for the Idaho native in 2014 by negotiating a prisoner swap with the Taliban militants. His case even became the subject of the second season of the podcast Serial. Bergdahl faced a life sentence for abandoning his post, but a military judge ruled to reduce him in rank to private and dishonorably discharge him. President Trump slammed the decision in a tweet, calling it, \"a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military.\"\n\nIllinois: Conspiracy, obstruction charges in Laquan McDonald killing\n\nThe dash cam footage was chilling. Sixteen shots fired at Laquan McDonald as the 17-year-old walked away from police. Now prosecutors say three Chicago police officers were trying to \"conceal the true facts\" in McDonald's death. A Cook County grand jury indicted the officers in June with state charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and misconduct. \"These defendants did more than merely obey an unofficial 'code of silence,'\" special prosecutor Patricia Brown Holmes said of the alleged coverup. Officer Jason Van Dyke previously pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trail on first-degree murder charges.\n\nIndiana: A canceled wedding, but love prevails\n\nWhen an Indiana couple called off their $30,000 wedding a week before the big day, they were stuck with a non-refundable reception. What did would-be bride Sarah Cummins do? She invited guests from four area homeless shelters. Her generosity inspired a local man to donate suits for guests, his tailor donated a few more and another local business contributed dresses and accessories. The July dinner, which included chicken, salmon, wedding cake and even a late-night snack of pizza, turned a painful situation positive, Cummins said. She now volunteers for a center for homeless families in Indianapolis.\n\nIowa: A giant wave connects sick kids to the outside world\n\nThe new children's hospital practically hangs over the University of Iowa's Kinnick Stadium in Iowa City. Before the season kicked off, a fan named Krista Young had an idea: \"Kinnick should hold a 'wave to the kids' minute during every game.\" The Facebook post went viral and on Sept. 2, when the Hawkeyes' football team hosted the Wyoming Cowboys, 68,000-plus fans rose, turned to the hospital and offered a long, sustained wave to sick children — some of whom haven't left in months — gathered near the windows to watch the game. Kristen Brown, a nurse at the Stead Family Children's Hospital, said the now-regular waves connect kids to the outside world. \"Anytime we can make them feel normal and a part of something, it's very meaningful,\" she said.\n\nKansas: Principal resigns after student newspaper questions her credentials\n\nA team of high school journalism students in Kansas published an investigative story questioning their incoming principal's qualifications. And then she resigned. The student reporters received national recognition after they revealed that Amy Robertson, their would-be new principal, received her master's and doctoral degrees from Corllins University, an unaccredited online school. Robertson, who currently works with an education consulting firm in Dubai, said she received her degrees before the university lost accreditation. The Pittsburg School Board accepted Robertson's resignation in April.\n\nKentucky: Passenger's removal from United flight sparks uproar\n\nOn April 9, Kentucky doctor David Dao was shown on video being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight from Chicago to Louisville. Dao was among four passengers scheduled to be removed to accommodate crew members. The footage of Dao screaming as he was pulled from the plane went viral. Days later, Dao's lawyer said he suffered a concussion and broken nose. The incident prompted United to make changes to its passenger policies. Two security officers involved in the incident were fired.\n\nLouisiana: 'I'm back': Steve Scalise returns to Congress after shooting\n\nWith two words, \"I'm back,\" Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise tweeted his remarkable return to the U.S. Capitol after a gunman critically wounded him during a congressional baseball team practice on June 14 outside Washington, D.C. Four others were shot before the gunman was killed. Scalise was discharged from the hospital six weeks later to begin a process of intensive rehabilitation. On September 28, Scalise got back to work, tweeting a photo of him and his wife Jennifer looking out at the National Mall from the Capitol. His return to the House floor was met by a standing ovation. \"You have no idea how great this feels to be back here at work in the people's House.\"\n\nMaine: Thousands send Christmas cards to dying boy\n\nJacob Thompson just wanted to celebrate one more Christmas. The 9-year-old from Maine, who had been diagnosed with stage four neuroblastoma in February 2014, made a simple request when he was admitted to the hospital in October and was told he had only a month to live: Send Christmas cards. Tens of thousands of cards flew into Jacob's small hospital room as the boy's story captured the hearts of people across the nation. Having a love for penguins, he even got a special visit when the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut brought the tuxedo birds to meet their young fan. Thompson died Nov. 19.\n\nMaryland: The day the NFL took a knee\n\nNFL players responded in full force on a Sunday in September after President Trump repeatedly called for punishing players who didn’t stand during the national anthem. In the first game that day, a number of teammates from the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars either knelt or locked arms at a high-profile game in London. Landover, Md.-based Washington Redskins players stood with arms locked, though some players chose to kneel. And across the league demonstrations spread, as many players broke out of their routine by joining the protests or engaging in team-wide displays of unity. The protests first began in the 2016 season, when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick said it was his way of speaking out against racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nMassachusetts: Michelle Carter gets 15 months in prison for texting boyfriend to commit suicide\n\n\"You can't think about it. You just have to do it. You said you were gonna do it.\" Michelle Carter, 20, sent dozens of texts like this encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy III, 18, to commit suicide, which Roy eventually did after Carter instructed him to get back in a truck filling with carbon monoxide. Carter was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, of which she'll serve 15 months. The case was the first to determine the legality of telling someone to commit suicide. Legal experts are concerned that it could set a bad legal precedent.\n\nMichigan: '90s grunge lost an icon in Chris Cornell\n\nSoundgarden singer Chris Cornell's distinctive, nearly four-octave wail was nearly synonymous with the grunge-music era of the 1990s. Just hours after performing for a Detroit crowd in May, the 52-year-old was found unresponsive in his hotel room. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office ruled the death a suicide by hanging, although his family questioned the findings. Cornell was just one among many celebrities we lost this year.\n\nMinnesota: #MeToo movement hits Minnesota hard\n\nDemocratic Senator Al Franken announced his resignation in December after more than a half dozen women said he touched them improperly or made unwanted sexual advances. Franken disputed some accusations and suggested he was being held to a different standard than President Trump. Franken became the second member of Congress to announce his resignation due to sexual harassment allegations in 2017. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a civil rights icon first elected to the House in 1964, stepped down after several women accused him of harassment. Franken's fellow Minnesotan Garrison Keillor, the iconic Prairie Home Companion host, was fired in November after allegations of \"inappropriate behavior.\"\n\nMississippi: Bringing 'insane asylum' dead back to life\n\nUp to 7,000 dead bodies are buried underneath the University of Mississippi Medical Center campus. They are former patients of the state's first mental institution, called simply the Insane Asylum, built in 1855. Underground radar shows the coffins stretch across 20 acres of the campus. UMMC discovered 66 coffins while doing construction on the campus in 2013, but has since detected thousands more. UMMC is now teaming up with a professor from Millsaps College in Jackson for a possible National Endowment of Humanities grant that would fund a study of the asylum and its history as well as engage families whose ancestors lived there. The center is looking at exhuming the bodies, and preserving as well as studying the remains.\n\nMissouri: Girl mistakes elk for deer, shoots it dead, story goes viral\n\nAbby Wilson, 14, was hunting alone when she said she spotted a very large white-tailed deer and pulled the trigger. The problem? It wasn't a deer. It was an elk. Her father, Donald White, immediately called the conservation department upon realizing his daughter's mistake. Because there's no elk hunting season in Missouri, the animals are protected and wildlife officials are determining whether to issue any citations or warnings to the young hunter. After the story went viral, White said comments directed at her, including that she should be locked up, amounted to bullying.\n\nMontana: Body slam shows just one of many threats facing journalists\n\nThe first year of the Trump era was a tough one for American journalists. On top of competing with \"alternative facts\" and being labeled the \"enemy of the American people\" by the president, some reporters were physically stopped from doing their jobs. In May, wealthy businessman Greg Gianforte, who was running for Montana's open House seat, was arrested for assaulting Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs on the eve of the election. Gianforte won over Montana voters but apparently lied to investigators after the body slam.\n\nNebraska: Sasse sasses Trump\n\nIt's no secret that Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse took his fair share of jabs at President Trump this year. The young Republican from Plainview recently asked the president if he was \"recanting\" his oath of office following an apparent threat of the freedom of the press. He also called out Trump for his Twitter attack on the hosts of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" saying \"it's beneath the dignity of your office.\" Sasse's and other GOP legislators', well, sass, highlights Trump's struggle to make nice with Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nNevada: Deadliest year for mass killings in more than a decade\n\nOn Oct. 1, America changed forever when a gunman shattered his hotel windows at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas and opened fire on 22,000 country music fans at the outdoor Route 91 Harvest Festival. Fifty-eight would die in the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Nearly 500 were injured. The gunman's motive remains a mystery. A wounded country came together again in November when a gunman killed 25 people, including a pregnant woman whose unborn baby also died, during a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas. With that, 2017 earned a bitter honor of being the most deadly year for mass killings in the U.S. in more than a decade. Three of the five largest mass killings — in Sutherland Springs, Las Vegas and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. — have taken place since June 2016.\n\nNew Hampshire: Voter fraud or bogus claims?\n\nFollowing the 2016 election, President Trump called for a crackdown on voter fraud. Trump claimed he lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused to New Hampshire to cast illegal votes against him. The solution? A voter fraud election commission was set up to investigate the matter. To date, legal experts and the New Hampshire deputy secretary of state said there is no evidence of voter fraud and the commission itself seems to have gone dark in recent weeks, with the last meeting held Sept. 12 in the Granite State.\n\nNew Jersey: Chris Christie feels the heat over 'beachgate'\n\nJust before the Fourth of July, Governor Chris Christie was spotted lounging outside his residence on Island Beach State Park. The only problem? He'd just closed that beach to the public — and all the other state parks in New Jersey — thanks to a state government shutdown. The photo became the source of endless memes, and New Jersey residents told the governor to \"get the hell off the beach!\" A few weeks before \"beachgate,\" a poll found Christie's approval ratings had sunk to 15%, making him the least popular governor in any state in the past 20 years. After legislators struck a deal in ending the three day shutdown in time for the holiday, Christie announced he was headed right back to the beach.\n\nNew Mexico: Plague found, and this isn't the first time\n\nThe plague, once called the Black Death, wiped out nearly half of the European population in the Middle Ages. And while it sounds like a disease that should have no place in modern times, each spring and summer cases pop up, often in Western areas. In late June, New Mexico confirmed a total of three cases of the plague in Santa Fe County. According to the New Mexico Department of Health, all three were hospitalized and later released. So, how does one get the plague? It’s typically transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, and while terrifying sounding, it can be treated if the symptoms are recognized early.\n\nNew York: Terror in NYC\n\nIt was New York City's worst terrorist attack since 9/11, and occurred just a few blocks away from where the iconic twin towers crumbled. This November, Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan with ties to the Islamic State, ran down cyclists and pedestrians on a busy bike path before crashing into a school bus, killing 8 people and injuring 12. Saipov's killings occurred mere hours before the city's annual Halloween parade was to kick off, but revelers were undeterred. Amid heavier police presence, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio joined a million people who marched and danced down 6th Avenue in defiance of terror. De Blasio said, \"What New Yorkers showed already is we will not change, we will not be cowed, we will not be thrown off by anything.\"\n\nNorth Carolina: Gerrymandering case struck down case, but what’s next?\n\nThe United States Supreme Court in June struck down dozens of state legislative districts in North Carolina because they disadvantaged black voters. Then, federal judges rejected a request by North Carolina voters to hold special elections next March in new districts once lines are redrawn to eliminate illegal racial gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the deliberate process of redrawing lines to sway electoral outcomes in favor of a certain political party. As Karl Rove once said: \"He who controls redistricting can control Congress.\" The issue has also been disputed in other states across the USA this year, particularly Wisconsin, which has a gerrymandering case before the Supreme Court with far-reaching national implications.\n\nNorth Dakota: Dakota Access Pipeline flows amid controversy\n\nAfter months of protests from environmental groups and Native American activists, the Army said it would allow the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline to cross under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota, completing the disputed project. The 1,200-mile pipeline began transporting crude oil on June 1 from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution hub in Illinois. Activists renewed calls to shut it down after a federal judge ruled the Army Corps of Engineers complied with some, but not all, requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act before issuing a permit. The developer of the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, has since filed a $1 billion federal lawsuit against several environmental groups accusing them of fraud, eco-terrorism and participation in a criminal enterprise.\n\nOhio: Otto Warmbier's death, and a year of high-stakes tension with North Korea\n\nThe death of Ohio native Otto Warmbier was a heartbreaking moment in a year of marked tensions with North Korea. Warmbier, a college student at the University of Virginia, was arrested in North Korea on charges of trying to steal a poster. The 22-year-old was returned home in June in a coma; he died shortly thereafter. Pyongyang denied it tortured or mistreated him, claiming Warmbier contracted botulism and was given a sleeping pill. Throughout 2017, President Trump and Kim Jong Un, whom Trump dubbed \"Little Rocket Man,\" exchanged ever more heated threats over North Korea's rapid development of nuclear weapons that could strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nOklahoma: Another blow to Black Lives Matter\n\n\"Hands up, don't shoot,\" became a rallying cry after Michael Brown was killed in 2014 in Ferguson, Mo. Terence Crutcher had his hands up. Police shot. In May, a jury acquitted of first-degree manslaughter white Tulsa officer Betty Jo Shelby, who says she fired out of fear last year when she killed 40-year-old Crutcher. His family burst into tears at the verdict. In a video of the incident, the Tulsa Police Department can be heard saying Crutcher \"looks like a bad dude.\" Crutcher's twin sister later said, \"That 'big bad dude' was a father ... a son.\" The controversial verdict led to protests from Black Lives Matter. Shelby has since resigned from the Tulsa Police Department.\n\nOregon: The Great American Eclipse captivates a nation\n\nFor the first time in almost 100 years, a total solar eclipse spanned across the country. Americans paused and enjoyed some unity as the moon passed between the sun and the Earth. Many traveled to the path of totality to experience the eerie darkness. From coast to coast, Americans watched — hopefully while wearing eclipse glasses — as the moon's shadow traced its 67-mile wide path across the country starting in Oregon. Those 2-3 minutes of darkness brought millions of tourist dollars to hotels, campgrounds, restaurants and museums in cities in the eclipse path.\n\nPennsylvania: They gave him 18 drinks. Then, left him to die\n\nThe horrifying death of a 19-year-old fraternity pledge captured on video exposed dangerous hazing rituals by members of Penn State University's Beta Theta Pi. After frat brothers gave Timothy Piazza 18 drinks in less than one hour and 22 minutes, his blood-alcohol content was about four times the legal limit for driving. Piazza was found unconscious in the basement the next day and later died. At least two dozen face charges in the case. Three other pledges across the nation died this year in Greek-related drinking incidents.\n\nRhode Island: Michael Flynn, and the role of Russia in the 2016 election\n\nDespite being one of the most vulnerable figures in special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn remained beloved in his Rhode Island hometown in 2017. Flynn was ousted from the White House just weeks after President Trump's inauguration over his Russian contacts, and in December, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn is among four campaign aides charged so far in Mueller's investigation. Flynn is the only one who served in Trump's administration. The only other guilty plea is George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign associate Rick Gates have been charged and pleaded not guilty. In addition to Mueller's investigation, three Congressional committees are looking at Russia.\n\nSouth Carolina: Governor stands by Trump amid sanctuary city crackdown\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made it clear in October that the Palmetto State would not tolerate any cities acting as sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants. The governor's strong condemnation of sanctuary cities came months after President Trump's executive order cracking down on cities that limit cooperation with immigration agencies. Following the order, leaders of some of the nation's biggest cities, including New York City, Chicago, and Boston, flatly stated they would not cooperate with the president. In November, a federal judge permanently blocked Trump's executive order on sanctuary cities.\n\nSouth Dakota: Old gold mine might hold treasured info on why we exist\n\nResearchers are in search of a different kind of treasure in a rural South Dakota gold mine: potential secrets explaining how the universe was created. The mine in Lead, S.D., that once hosted gold rushes in the 1800s will serve as home to scientists participating in the largest U.S.-based particle physics experiment. The experiment will determine whether particles called neutrinos help explain our existence. Over the next 10 years, workers will remove more than 870,000 tons of rock and install a four-story, 70,000-ton neutrino detector. The collaboration will involve 1,000 scientists from more than 30 countries.\n\nTennessee: Tuition-free community college\n\nTennessee students can put away their checkbooks if community colleges are in their future. In May, the southern state became the first to offer a tuition-free education to nearly every resident without a degree. Even though Tennessee was the first state to pass the measure, it isn't without precursors. New York legislators passed a budget in April that covered tuition for families making less than $100,000 a year. In February, San Francisco voters passed a tax measure that would cover community college tuition for anyone who lived in the city for more than a year, though the state of California did not follow suit.\n\nTexas: Hurricane Harvey hit hard\n\nHurricane Harvey's historic downpour brought destruction to the Texas Gulf coast. Harvey killed dozens, dumped more than 50 inches of rain and drove thousands from their homes. Its effects will be felt for months and years into the future. Amid the destruction, people stepped up to help. There was Houston Texans star J.J. Watt raising more than $37 million in online donations, human chains pulling people to safety and an impromptu gospel singing performance at a shelter. Watt perhaps put it best: \"When times are the toughest, humanity stands at its strongest.\"\n\nUtah: Outcry over nurse's arrest for refusing to draw unconscious patient's blood\n\nA Utah police officer was fired after he arrested a nurse who refused to let him draw blood from an unconscious patient without a warrant. Body cam footage of the arrest shows Detective Jeff Payne dragging Alex Wubbels from University Hospital while she sobs \"this is crazy.\" An investigation was opened after video of the arrest went viral, and Wubbels received a $500,000 settlement from the city and the university that runs the hospital. She said she would give a portion of the settlement to the nurses union and help lead a campaign to stop physical and verbal abuse of nurses on the job.\n\nVermont: This 13-year-old wants to be governor\n\nEthan Sonneborn, 13, has some lofty political ambitions. The young Democrat announced this summer that he's running for governor in 2018, and with Vermont's founders imposing no age requirement for its highest office, his path to power is a little easier. The Bristol resident follows the news closely, chooses his words deliberately and sees his age as an asset, not a liability. \"We elected our oldest president ever,\" Sonneborn said, \"and he tweets like a kindergartner.\" His views on the president echo those of prominent Vermont progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told USA TODAY one year after the election that Trump's presidency is an \"unprecedented disaster.\" A hot topic Sonneborn would have to address if elected: recreational marijuana. Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a legalization bill in May, a decision with which Sonneborn took issue.\n\nVirginia: White supremacy in Charlottesville\n\nIt's 2017, and there were neo-Nazis in the streets. In August, hundreds of white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis descended upon Charlottesville, Va., for a \"Unite the Right\" rally to protest the removal of a Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee. The rally turned violent when James Alex Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, who had expressed support for neo-Nazi positions, drove his car at high speed into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. President Trump was reticent to condemn the white supremacists, saying \"many sides\" were to blame for the violence. After his comments, Heyer's mother said she wouldn't take phone calls from the president. The rally was headlined by far-right white nationalist Richard Spencer, who returned to the city for another protest in October. Here's why Charlottesville has become ground zero for white supremacists.\n\nWashington: Amazon's new dome home\n\nAmazon joined Apple and Google in the race to build futuristic tech headquarters, introducing the Spheres, three (you guessed it) spheres that will \"round\" out the Seattle cityscape. The tallest of the glass and metal orbs rises 90 feet and is more than 130 feet in diameter, with two smaller spheres on each side. The space will host up to 800 employees for potential meetings, meals and mingling. It will also feature plenty of plant life, along with tree-house meeting rooms, a river and waterfalls, and a green \"bird's nest\" conference room. The rest of the public can visit through shops located near the entrance or by signing up for tours once it opens next year.\n\nWest Virginia: Coal country digs Trump\n\nWest Virginia, once a Democratic stronghold, is now Trump country. West Virginia’s conservative shift has been so pronounced that Gov. Jim Justice changed his political stripes in August and flipped from Democrat to Republican after just seven months in office. The state hasn't gone Democrat in a presidential election since 1996, and Hillary Clinton lost there by more than 40%. President Trump, who promised to bring coal mining jobs back, also got 77% of the vote in the Republican primary there. Trump took a lot of heat for politicizing the Boy Scout Jamboree held in West Virginia in July (prompting an apology from the Boy Scouts) but he was right back in the state the following week to rally the base and tout an end to \"war on beautiful clean coal.\"\n\nWisconsin: Blacked-out vacationers suspect tainted booze\n\nAbbey Conner went on a family vacation to an all-inclusive Mexican resort in January, but shortly after arriving, she was found face down in the pool, brain dead. Connor's death days later sparked a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation that found 100-plus people saying they blacked out from moderate to light drinking at Mexican resorts. Some were robbed. Others were raped. Few ever found justice. The State Department issued an alert about possibly tainted or counterfeit alcohol. Mexican officials swept tourist spots and claimed to seize 10,000 gallons of illegal booze from a shoddy distributer. They reported no such evidence at the resort where Connor drowned.\n\nWyoming: Trump national parks moves met with backlash\n\nThis year may have been your last chance to visit Yellowstone without doling out $70 to do so. The Trump administration in October proposed a price increase for the Wyoming landmark and 16 other national parks. Trump also faced criticism — and legal action — for his decision to shrink federally protected land by about two million acres in Bear Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah earlier this month. In April, Trump signed an executive order to review more than a dozen national monuments across the USA.\n\nWashington, D.C.: Nation's capital becomes epicenter of the #resistance\n\nHome to the most massive manifestations of opposition to the Trump agenda in a year that saw #resistance protests and marches against the administration across the country, Washington, D.C., became a hotbed for public demonstrations countering the president. The Women's March on Washington was the first and fiercest, coming the day after Trump's inauguration (which did NOT draw the biggest crowd to the National Mall in history, despite some claims to the contrary) and drawing an estimated 500,000 people angered at a president accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct. Huge crowds also gathered for the March for Science, the People's Climate March and the March for Truth. Forgot about September's pro-Trump, Mother of All Rallies? It's understandable. Only a thousand folks turned out and it was held the same day as the historic Juggalo March.\n\nPuerto Rico: Maria devastates Puerto Rico, fueling feud with Trump\n\nHurricane Maria pounded Puerto Rico in late September, causing unprecedented devastation to the island of 3.4 million people. The storm knocked out the majority of Puerto Rico's power and sparked a feud between the island and President Trump. For those unclear, Puerto Rico is indeed part of the United States — it's a commonwealth — and yes, its residents are U.S. citizens. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz took shots at Trump for the government's response to Maria, which she called \"inadequate.\" Trump publicly bashed Cruz, saying she had \"poor leadership ability.\" Months after the storm, large parts of the island remained without power, prompting Washington to seek efforts to modernize Puerto Rico's power grid.\n\nGuam: Priest sex abuse cases shatter faith on Guam\n\nThe predominantly Catholic island of Guam was rocked when a Pacific Daily News investigation unearthed decades of sexual assault, manipulation and intimidation against children reared on the remote U.S. territory by some of its most revered men, the Catholic clergy. At least 143 cases of child sexual abuse have been reported against Catholic priests tied to Guam. Of those cases, 87 involve a single former priest and scoutmaster, Louis Brouillard, who allegedly committed horrendous sexual crimes against children, including accounts of rape, drugging and even tying up a boy before forced sex acts. Also among the accusations: a boy fondled on the way to his grandmother's burial, and another molested for the first time on his seventh birthday, then raped or assaulted 100 more times.\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands: Ravaged by back-to-back hurricanes\n\nBefore Hurricanes Irma and Maria made their way to Florida and Puerto Rico, they tore through the U.S. Virgin Islands, a cluster of American islands in the Caribbean. Weeks after the back-to-back September storms, Virgin Islanders – who are Americans by birth – were in the grips of a long and painful recovery. Thousands went without power, and telephone and internet coverage remained spotty. Many fled – perhaps never to return. When USA TODAY reporter Fredreka Schouten returned home, she found family and friends' houses torn apart, and her former school with windows blown out and metal littered about. The destruction brought back memories of past devastating storms – Hugo in 1989 and Marilyn in 1995.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nRemember when?\n\nThis is a compilation of stories from across USA TODAY and the USA TODAY Network.

Symbolism, colors ...", "text": "\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" Francis Scott Key's famed song that went on to become the United States' national anthem, pays tribute to a flag that has symbolized the American experiment for centuries.\n\nThe flag, made up of 50 stars and 13 stripes since 1960, has been flown on battlefields, Olympic podiums and even on the moon. Its bold red, white and blue color scheme has become synonymous with the United States, and the flag has earned nicknames like \"Old Glory\" and \"the Stars and Stripes.\"\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the flag's iconography and what it represents.\n\nThe Stars and Stripes:See the 27 different US flags and their histories\n\nIs the Betsy Ross flag a symbol for hate:Depends on who you ask\n\nHow many stripes are on the American flag?\n\nThere are 13 stripes on a standard American flag, alternating between red and white.\n\nThe flag also has 50 stars, which are white and set against a blue background in the upper left corner. They represent the 50 states.\n\nWhat do the 13 stripes on the American flag represent?\n\nThe 13 stripes on the American flag represent the 13 original colonies at the country's founding. Those colonies were:\n\nVirginia\n\nMassachusetts\n\nRhode Island\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew York\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDelaware\n\nMaryland\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGeorgia\n\nThe colors of the stripes do not have an officially designated meaning and are inherited from the British flag. However, PBS reports that, generally, red denotes hardiness and valor, while white symbolizes purity and innocence. The blue background behind the stars represents vigilance, perseverance and justice.\n\nThis day in history:Congress adopts the stars and stripes\n\nWhy are there 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes on the flag?\n\nThere is not a specific reason for the number of red versus white stripes. PBS reports that the Continental Congress, on June 14, 1777, passed an act that established an official flag. The act read: “Resolved, that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.”\n\nThe numbers shake out to seven and six based on the first of the 13 stripes being red.\n\nDoes the U.S. flag always have 13 stripes?\n\nStandard American flags always have 13 stripes, as established in the original 1777 statute.\n\nHowever, there was a brief period in which the American flag bore 15 stripes. The Smithsonian reports that the Act of January 13, 1794, allowed for 15 stripes and 15 stars after May 1795.\n\nThen, another act was passed in 1818 reverting to the original 13 stripes.\n\nJust Curious?:Your everyday questions, answered.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/19/apollo-11-moon-landing-what-you-cant-see-buzz-aldrin-flag-photo/1570334001/", "title": "Apollo 11 moon landing: What you can't see in Buzz Aldrin flag photo", "text": "USA TODAY first published this story in July 2019, the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. July 20, 2020, marks 51 years since the moon landing.\n\nYou know the photo: Buzz Aldrin, standing on the moon and saluting the American flag.\n\nZoom in. What's really in the image? Why is the flag waving? Where are the stars? And how did those shadows get there?\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, USA TODAY spoke with experts at NASA and reviewed its archives to explain the most notable details in the famed photo. Spoiler alert: Not everything went as the space agency planned it.\n\nThe flag, a topic of many a conspiracy theory, probably toppled over when the astronauts departed, and medals for Soviet astronauts lie on the surface as well.\n\nHere's the backstory of what you're seeing in the photograph.\n\nWho's in the suit? And how we got to the moon in the first place\n\nOn July 20, 1969, around 11:40 p.m. EDT, the scene depicted in one of the most iconic photos ever taken unfolded.\n\nAstronauts Neil Armstrong and Aldrin were more than 110 hours into the historic moon landing mission when they planted a U.S. flag. Video of the event was broadcast to millions back on Earth.\n\nInteractive:The new race to the moon\n\nAldrin stepped to the side to raise his hand in salute. Armstrong stepped back to photograph the moment.\n\n\"It's such an iconic image,\" said Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, a historian for the Johnson Space Center in Houston. \"This has become part of American culture. ... You see this photo in textbooks.\"\n\nThe photo was taken during the Apollo 11 mission, the first manned moon landing. Aldrin and Armstrong landed in the Sea of Tranquility on the lunar surface as Command Module Pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit.\n\nThe mission came amid an intense space race with the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Both the United States and the USSR rapidly advanced in technological achievements of spaceflight, a national security concern during the nuclear arms race.\n\nSpace race:Apollo 11 moon landing celebrated as pioneering milestone, but it was really about winning the space race\n\nThough the Soviet Union sent the first person into space, the United States took the lead in the space race when it landed two men on the moon.\n\nAbout the flag: It fell over\n\nPhotos of the U.S. flag planted on the moon have been topics of conversations concerning patriotism and conspiracies ever since the world first saw stars and stripes on the lunar surface.\n\nHowever, the flag probably isn't still standing.\n\nThe working presumption at NASA is that the flag fell, said John Uri, manager of the Johnson Space Center History Office. Aldrin said he thought he saw the flag tip over from the exhaust when the lunar module lifted off, and the shadow of the flag is not visible in satellite images.\n\nCelebrating 50 years:NASA put a man on the moon. Now, the Smithsonian is putting a rocket on the Mall\n\nUri said later Apollo missions placed flags farther from their lunar modules to prevent them from tipping over. It's likely that the colors have faded over the years from extreme exposure, Uri said.\n\nWhy isn't the flag drooping?\n\nAs expected, hoisting a flag presented NASA engineers with a number of technical problems, Anne Platoff wrote in a paper in August 1993 for NASA on the history of the Apollo 11 flag.\n\nBecause the moon has no substantial atmosphere, NASA scientists led by Jack Kinzler designed a horizontal crossbar to support the flag and keep it from drooping down, Platoff wrote.\n\nA hem was sewn across the top of the 3-by-5-foot nylon flag so the bar could go through, then be lifted and locked into place at a 90 degree angle. The flagpole had a base that allowed it to more easily be driven into the moon's surface, and a red circle was painted at 18 inches from the bottom to help judge how deep it needed to go.\n\nThe astronauts struggled to drive the flag's base beyond 6 to 9 inches deep into the surface, which probably contributed to the flag falling.\n\nThe flag traveled to space tacked onto the ladder on the lunar module, so the astronauts could access it when they walked on the moon. A protective shroud was built to protect the flag from the heat from the engines.\n\nPacking the flag involved a 12-step process and five people, Platoff wrote. Eleven steps were needed to mount the flag on the ladder. The astronauts were able to access it by removing pins and Velcro it was attached to. (And no, NASA didn't invent Velcro during the Apollo missions, though it did popularize its use.)\n\nWhat caused the ripples in the flag?\n\nMany say the flag in the photo looks like it's flowing in the wind. Conspiracy theorists cite this as evidence the moon landing was filmed in a warehouse with air conditioning creating the ripple. That's false.\n\nThe horizontal crossbar was supposed to give a slight wavy effect as in a breeze, Platoff wrote, and Aldrin and Armstrong said they had trouble pulling the flag out all the way.\n\nWhat you can't see: A golden olive branch and hidden messages\n\nThe flag was among various commemorative items that Aldrin and Armstrong left on the moon's surface.\n\nA stainless steel plaque noting the feat of the first manned moon landing, a silicon disc with messages from world leaders in tiny text and a small pouch with an Apollo 1 patch, medals honoring two Soviet astronauts and a small gold olive branch were also left on the moon, according to NASA.\n\nThe patch commemorates Apollo 1 astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee, who died in a launchpad fire in 1967.\n\n7 things on the moon:Here's what the Apollo 11 astronauts left on the moon\n\nAs for the Soviet medals, Aldrin and Armstrong honored Vladimir Komarov, who died during the Soyuz 1 mission when his parachute failed, and Yuri Gagarin, the first human in outer space. NASA did not officially acknowledge at the time that the Soviet items were left on the moon.\n\nAldrin's book \"Men from Earth,\" published in 1989, detailed the full contents of the packet they left, according to NASA.\n\nThe flag serves as \"a sign of what America really accomplished,\" Ross-Nazzal said. Though there were concerns that it would appear that the United States was \"claiming\" the moon, that was never the intention, she said.\n\n\"It shows a sense of accomplishment and proof that we've been there,\" she said.\n\nWhy the footprints are so distinct\n\nAs Armstrong put it, \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n\nWhen Aldrin and Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, they left well-defined footprints created by the outer boots of their spacesuits.\n\nVoices:My tio's unlikely journey from communist Cuba to key figure in Apollo 11 moon landing\n\n\"If we went back there today, the footprints would still be there,\" Uri said. NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter can show the disturbed topsoil in areas on the moon where lunar modules have landed, rovers have roamed and astronauts have walked, he said.\n\nThe Apollo 11 crew described the lunar regolith, or soil, as \"almost a little bit like wet sand,\" Uri said. In reality, the regolith is made of rocks that have been ground up into a fine material over many years under the bombardment of micrometeorites and solar wind radiation. Because the moon has no atmosphere, liquid water or wind erosion, the regolith probably remains well-preserved, Uri said.\n\nThere were even some fears that when a lunar module landed on the moon, the surface would be so thick with dust that it would sink, Uri said.\n\nIs that a moon rock in the bottom right corner?\n\nYes. Though the moon's surface is mostly made up of the fine regolith, various rocks are scattered throughout.\n\nThe white specks seen in the background of the photo are probably lunar rocks reflecting light.\n\nThe astronauts found two main types of rocks at their landing: basalts and breccias, according to the Universities Space Research Association.\n\nThe basalts are 3.6 billion to 3.9 billion years old and solidified from molten lava. The breccias are fragments of older rocks broken up over the years by meteorites hitting the moon. Small rock fragments are sometimes fused under the intense heat and pressure of the impacts, forming breccias.\n\nAldrin and Armstrong collected samples of the regolith and up to 50 rocks during their mission.\n\nThe sky is black in the photograph. Why are there no stars in the background?\n\nWhen people think of what it would be like in space, they might conjure images of a star-filled expanse. Though the stars are definitely there, none is visible in Armstrong's photo.\n\nConspiracy theorists who say NASA fabricated the moon landing cite this as evidence; however, there is a scientific explanation.\n\n\"The only time the astronauts really saw the stars clearly was when they were orbiting the moon and in the shadow of the moon,\" Uri said.\n\nSunlight reflecting off the moon's surface washed out any of the light the stars emitted, Uri said, making them invisible in the photographs. Even the Earth's own shine could be bright enough to block out the stars, he said.\n\nPoll:Americans support NASA but not a return to the moon\n\nThe cameras did not use long enough exposure times to document the stars. Rather than focusing on space, the purpose of taking photos was to document the engineering feat of landing on the moon, Uri and Ross-Nazzal said.\n\nArmstrong took most the photos the public associates with the landing. He used a 70mm Hasselblad, though NASA heavily modified the camera, so it would be easier to use while in a spacesuit. A variety of other cameras were also used during the mission.\n\nAccording to the Universities Space Research Association, cameras operated using a trigger and were mounted on the front of the astronauts' spacesuits, which discredits a popular conspiracy theory about not being able to see a camera in the reflection in Aldrin's helmet in one photo Armstrong took. (We can thank NASA's later work for the creation of small enough cameras for an essential device in our modern lives: the camera phone.)\n\nWhat made the long dark shadow behind the flag?\n\nThe lunar module, the spacecraft Aldrin and Armstrong used to get from the main command and service module in lunar orbit to the moon's surface, is seen in the top left of the photograph.\n\nThere were no external lights brightening up the photos and video taken of the mission. The light comes from sunlight and reflections off the moon's surface, the astronauts' suits and the lunar module.\n\nBuzz Aldrin's golden visor is shiny for a reason\n\nEach piece of the astronauts' spacesuit is meticulously designed and serves a very specific purpose.\n\nWhat's in the square pack on Aldrin's back? The Personal Life Support System, or PLSS, according to Cathleen Lewis, spacesuit curator at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum.\n\n\"It provided oxygen, carbon dioxide cleaning, suit cooling, electronic communications to the astronaut,\" Lewis said.\n\nLewis said the suit was made from as many as 26 layers of material, including layers of Mylar, Dacron, Beta Marcasite and Kapton. The suit's outer layer is Teflon-coated Beta cloth.\n\n\"Inside the suit, there are layers of high temperature nylon, fabric dipped in rubber, molded rubber, steel restraints, aluminum connectors, rubber gaskets, a double brass pressure zipper,\" Lewis said.\n\nThe gloves they wore were constructed from a fabric called Chromel-R, a woven stainless steel that insulated their hands. The fingertips of the gloves were made from silicone rubber for sensitivity, according to the Air and Space Museum.\n\nMysterious gray spots:What caused mysterious gray spots to appear on Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 moon landing glove?\n\nTo protect Aldrin's eyes from the intense sun exposure, his helmet had inner and outer visors.\n\n\"Worn on top of the clear bubble helmet, the visor had shades and an outer visor that was a plastic with a monomolecular layer of gold. The gold acted as a sunscreen, much in the way that sky goggles do,\" Lewis said.\n\nThey could have tripped on those wires in the bottom left\n\nIn the bottom left side of the photo, a series of cables appear to run along the moon's surface toward the lunar module.\n\nIt was those wires, powering a video camera, that allowed millions of people worldwide to watch Aldrin and Armstrong during their extravehicular activity, the official name for their moonwalk.\n\nBecause it was such a historic mission, NASA \"wanted to share the experience with rest of the world,\" Uri said.\n\nArmstrong set up the camera so most of their activities would be visible to the millions back on Earth, according to the Universities Space Research Association. The setup went smoothly, but the wiring created a tripping hazard for Armstrong and Aldrin.\n\nAccording to Ross-Nazzal, the public affairs office at NASA pushed hard to get TV cameras on board spaceflights as early as the time of the Gemini missions.\n\nThe astronauts and engineers feared the added weight and operation of the cameras would create unnecessary complications, and even when the first live televised mission occurred, Apollo 7, resistance persisted within NASA, Uri and Ross-Nazzal said.\n\n\"Pubic affairs thought the public needed to see what was going on and get excited about what was happening,\" Ross-Nazzal said. \"While the U.S. did it first, we really brought everyone else along.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/03/18/complete-us-state-flags-list/11025139002/", "title": "US state flags: Every state flag (plus D.C.) and meaning behind each", "text": "While most Americans are familiar with the stars and stripes of the U.S. flag, others may not know the details and symbols of the other 51 flags of the nation.\n\nEach state's flag is representative of its history and distinct symbols.Here are the 50 official state flags from Alabama to Wyoming, as well as Washington D.C., and their significances.\n\n50 U.S. state flags, plus the District of Columbia\n\nAlabama\n\nThe Alabama state flag is white with a red cross of St. Andrew. This design was adopted in 1895. The flag's design was inspired by the Confederate battle flag.\n\nAlaska\n\nAlaska's state flag features eight gold stars, which form the Big Dipper and Polaris, against a dark blue backdrop.\n\nThe Polaris, or North Star, on the flag is a symbol of Alaska’s northern location. The Big Dipper is a symbol of strength, while the blue background represents the night sky.\n\nArizona\n\nThe gold star on this state flag represents one of Arizona's five C's: copper. Arizona produces more copper than any other state in the nation. The 13 alternating gold and red stripes symbolize the sun.\n\nBlue and gold, which is featured on the flag, is also Arizona's state colors.\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas was the first state in the U.S. to produce diamonds, hence the large diamond in the center of its state flag. The 25 white stars represent Arkansas being the 25th state to join the Union.\n\nThe three blue stars under the state’s name symbolize represent the three nations Arkansas was part of before officially becoming a state: Spain, France and the U.S. The star above the word “Arkansas” represents the state’s membership in the Confederacy.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe California state flag adorns the state's official animal, the grizzly bear, which represents strength. The grizzly bear imagery was inspired by a 19th century painting by California artist Charles Nahl.\n\nColorado\n\nThe colors of Colorado's state flag represent the environmental features of the state. The white symbolizes the snowy mountains, gold for sunshine, red for the state's soil and blue for the sky.\n\nThe \"C\" stands the state's name, the columbine (the state's flower) and centennial. Colorado became a state in 1876 — the 100 year anniversary of American independence.\n\nConnecticut\n\nThe three grapevines on the Connecticut state flag are believed to represent the three settlements (Windsor, Wethersfield, and Hartford) or three colonies (Connecticut, Saybrook and New Haven) which merged together to form the state.\n\nThe state motto, “Qui transtulit sustinet,” is displayed in a white ribbon. It translates to “he who transplanted still sustains.\"\n\nDelaware\n\n\"December 7, 1787\" displayed at the bottom of Delaware's state flag is the date Delaware became the first state of of the Union.\n\nThe coat of arms contains several state symbols. The ship represents the shipbuilding industry and coastal trade. The militiaman symbolize the citizen-soldier who help maintain American liberties. The water represents the Delaware River.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nThe flag of Washington D.C. is based on the Washington family's coat of arms, which has three red stars and two red stripes against a white background.\n\nFlorida\n\nThe seal represents the state’s environmental features, such as sunshine, palmetto trees, lakes and rivers. There is some controversy over the St. Andrew’s cross on Florida’s state flag.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Gov. Francis P.

Sacrifice, skepticism ...", "text": "America's founding fathers left their descendants with little guidance on what the nation's flag means.\n\nTheir resolution from June 14, 1777, was surprisingly sparse for what would become one of the country's most enduring symbols. At just 32 words, it did not explain why red, white and blue were chosen or what the stripes meant.\n\nIn the centuries since, the American flag has been draped across the casket of presidents and veterans, spread across the field of Super Bowls, waved by children in Fourth of July parades, burned in a protest outside a political convention and hung upside down at the home of a U.S. Supreme Court justice.\n\nIn the vacuum of prescribed meaning, Americans have imbued the flag with their own: sacrifice, freedom, patriotism, nationalism, pride, disappointment and hope. The flag reflects how Americans feel about their country, its past and its future.\n\nAmid a polarizing election year and before the Fourth of July, several Americans shared what the American flag means to them.\n\nA family tradition for The Flag Lady\n\nLori Watson's mother used to sell the American flag door-to-door during her lunch break as a legal secretary. Now, Lori and her son Harrison run The Flag Lady, one of the largest flag companies in the country selling more than 15,000 American flags each year.\n\n\"My great-grandmother carried a little four-by-six-inch flag on a stick in the hopes that she could wave it someday,\" said Lori Watson from her shop in Columbus, Ohio. \"That pride and passion is unbelievable for such a simple, simple symbol.\"\n\nWith a vision of God and country, Watson's mother, Mary Haley Leavitt, started selling American flags when they were hard to purchase outside of hardware stores between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Leavitt passed the business down to her daughter and grandson, who recalls sweeping the back porch and climbing under the store's tables with his cousin.\n\n\"The American flag is a sideless symbol. In a world that seems dead-set on tearing itself apart, it is meant to be a symbol of unity,\" Harrison Watson said. \"At times, we have stood up together to show the best version of those ideals. At times, we've fallen short. We're human. But at the end of the day, that symbol represents the highest of those ideals.\"\n\nWhile every sale can be meaningful, Lori Watson recalls a World War II veteran visiting the store shortly after Sept. 11. The veteran hammered his walking stick on the floor to get customers' attention and said: \"I could die today knowing my country is not complacent about what I gave up.\"\n\n\"The flag means hope, that as a people, we will ultimately come together and do the right thing,\" Lori Watson said. \"It is a timeless symbol and that's why it has endured for all these years.\"\n\nFeelings about the flag shift after Jan. 6 attack\n\nKatrina Beals, a 30-year-old speech pathologist living in Grand Rapids, Mich., described herself as a staunch Democrat but wants to avoid polarization. Her goal is to “just become more open to conversations. Hearing other people's perspectives and seeing people as people first, and not their political affiliation.\"\n\nA Mexican American, Beals said she long considered herself patriotic − but events like the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and the temperament of national politics since former President Donald Trump’s election have dampened her outlook.\n\nAt times, the American flag can evoke emotions of shame and embarrassment for Beals.\n\n“It makes me a little bit sad. I love having pride for this country, but there's definitely that moment of hesitancy now when I see an American flag,” she said.\n\nStill, Beals believes the flag can represent values it’s long been associated with − saying this year’s presidential election will be a \"fight for the flag.”\n\n“I think it’s really going to depend on what the outcome is, and seeing what Americans are feeling. Right now, it doesn’t really feel like the flag represents freedom.”\n\nAn image shows solidarity, strength after Sept. 11\n\nAt 5:01 p.m. on Sept. 11, 2001, photographer Thomas E. Franklin watched as three New York City firefighters removed an American flag from a yacht's mast near the World Financial Center. They carried the flag to what would later be known as Ground Zero and hoisted it onto a pole amidst the rubble of the fallen World Trade Center towers.\n\n\"It was not a performance,\" said Franklin, who worked for The Bergen Record at the time. \"They didn't know they were being photographed. It was a very chaotic scene. They saw it was just an opportunity to do what they did.\"\n\nFranklin's photograph of that moment quickly became an iconic image of American resilience during a horrific tragedy. The photograph, distributed by the Associated Press, was published in newspapers across the country. It was featured on a postage stamp that raised more than $10 million for victims of Sept. 11.\n\n\"It was one of the only photos of 9/11 that did not directly depict death and destruction. It was a picture of three firemen who were essentially the soldiers in this war that we found ourselves in,\" said Franklin, now an associate professor of multimedia journalism at Montclair State University in New Jersey.\n\n\"The fact that these three firemen hoisted this flag, I think was viewed as a very strong act of patriotism and solidarity and strength that the country desperately needed in the hours after 9/11.\"\n\n'Deeper historical, cultural, and political messages' behind the flag\n\nGrowing up in Georgia, the American flag reminded Kia Smith of the Fourth of July, family, and cookouts. Now 42, her experiences abroad and observing political movements have made her skeptical of wearing or displaying the flag.\n\nSmith said she first questioned the flag when studying abroad in Tunisia in 2006. Following the United States’ declaration of its war on terror, she said people there felt the flag represented anti-Muslim sentiment – something she had to explain she did not hold just because of her nationality.\n\n\"As a Black woman in America, it was really interesting to be placed in a situation where I was seen as an American and confronted with a lot of the imperialism and colonialism that comes with being American,” Smith said. “Seeing what people outside of the United States, how they view the flag and American policy and values, was the first time when I had a moment of like, ‘what is this really?'”\n\nSmith said she again felt like the flag did not represent her when it was flown by groups like the Tea Party, Make America Great Again Republicans, and Black Lives Matter counter-protesters.\n\n“The only time I honestly feel tension is around the Olympics because there are so many incredible athletes and I want to have pride,” Smith said. “If I put on the U.S. flag, it’s not just about the games. There are deeper historical, cultural, and political messages behind that flag that don’t align with my lived values.”\n\nA symbol of respect\n\nScott Miller, of Washington, remembers pledging his allegiance to the American flag in school. When he grew up, he became a minister and made friends in law enforcement.\n\nAfter serving as a volunteer police chaplain, he was inspired to form the Thin Blue Line Foundation which offers resources for police officers and their families, including counseling and spiritual support. The nonprofit distributes a version of the thin blue line flag Miller created with a graphic designer.\n\n“The main thing we wanted to have there was the blue line representing what separates good and evil, chaos and order,” Miller said. “And then anybody that was law enforcement would recognize what it stood for.”\n\nMiller said the American flag reminds him of freedom and the military lives lost fighting for it. He added that it is a symbol of respect at a time when he senses a growing disrespect for authority, including police officers and politicians.\n\n“It's really hard for me when people burn the flag or call the flag racist,” Miller said. “We’re living in a time where people are trying to tear down everything that our country was founded on, and I think the flag is just one additional thing that they’re trying to do that with.”\n\n'You can be patriotic and liberal'\n\nThe evolution of Jessica DeWolfe’s relationship with the American flag is one of acceptance and realistic optimism.\n\nThe 37-year-old’s earliest memories of the emblem bring her back to elementary school, singing patriotic hymns and standing for the pledge of allegiance.\n\nThose positive emotions of unity evolved as she reached adulthood during the rise of the conservative Tea Party movement.\n\n“There’s a growing period when you realize the U.S. history that you were taught is not the truth or the whole story,” DeWolfe told USA TODAY in an interview. “That brings up a lot of complicated feelings because that flag did not represent everyone, and it could be argued that it still doesn’t represent everyone so far.”\n\nThe Minneapolis resident and public health worker has reflected on how far-right groups have used the national emblem to exclude marginalized communities.\n\nNow, DeWolfe isn’t convinced that either side of the aisle owns the flag.\n\n“You can be patriotic and liberal,” she said. “Those aren’t mutually exclusive.”\n\nCommunity and reflection in Flag City, USA\n\nWhen John B. Cooke moved to Findlay, Ohio in 1968, he had a vision of a city bedecked in American flags for Flag Day. A member of the Sons of the American Revolution, Cooke purchased 14,000 small flags with donations from local organizations and residents. Local scouts passed them out to neighbors and friends to display on June 14.\n\n\"One person had a vision and an idea and everybody rallied around it,\" said Findlay Mayor Christina Muryn, who coincidentally got married on Flag Day 10 years ago. \"That really is the essence of our community. When somebody has a good idea, we're doers.\"\n\nSix years after Cooke's grand idea, a resolution from the U.S. House of Representatives officially designated the city in Northwest Ohio as Flag City, USA. Findlay held that title exclusively until 1999 when Redmond, Oregon claimed the name, too.\n\nSarah Foltz's first memories of the American flag were of the small ones she'd wave at Findlay's many parades. She now serves as executive director of the Hancock Historical Museum, which recently celebrated the city's 50th anniversary as Flag City with children painting flags, playing ring toss and eating snow cones.\n\n\"You don't really question why you're flying flags as a child,\" Foltz said. But now, she said the flag signifies reflection. \"It means that our country has come so far − and not without struggle and not without challenges to this day.\"\n\nWhen the museum's education coordinator Deb Wickerham thinks about the American flag, she remembers the sacrifice her 19-year-old cousin made in the Vietnam War. She thinks of the veterans she helped visit the Washington D.C. memorials as co-founder of Flag City Honor Fight. \"We are allowed to wave that flag because of what those men and women did.\"\n\n'Totally out of control' flag collection\n\nPeter Keim's affection for the American flag began as a young boy in Erie, Pennsylvania watching his grandfather raise the stars and stripes during World War II.\n\n\"He taught me how to raise the flag, how to retire the flag, how to bring it in at sunset, make sure it didn't touch the ground at all, make sure if the weather didn't look too good to bring the flag in,\" Keim said. \"That was sort of the beginning.\"\n\nYears later, Keim bought an old flag stashed in a paper bag at an antique sale for $40. To Keim's surprise, his purchase was a hand-sewn 13-star flag. About a year later, he bought a second old flag.\n\n\"Then, it just got totally out of control,\" he said. \"I collected well over 700 historic flags and was recognized as probably the most complete collection in the United States.\"\n\nKeim's collection has been featured in museums and in Bergdorf Goodman's windows on the first anniversary of Sept. 11. He wrote a book titled \"A Grand Old Flag\" and often asks people to describe the American flag in one word.\n\n\"America,\" Keim said when asked to answer his own prompt. \"It's America and all that America stands for. Strength, freedom, liberty, perseverance, equality, all of these things have been within our flag over time.\"\n\nJessie Balmert is a political reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Columbus Dispatch, Cincinnati Enquirer, Akron Beacon Journal and 18 other affiliated news organizations across Ohio.

Doug Ducey responded by ordering the state to withdraw all financial incentive dollars for Nike to open a manufacturing plant in a Phoenix suburb. The deal had promised to bring some 500 full-time jobs to Goodyear, Arizona.\n\nDucey said he was \"embarrassed for Nike\" and accused the shoe and apparel company of calling Betsy Ross \"unworthy.\"\n\nSo who was Betsy Ross? And why is the flag often attributed to her a source of controversy for some? Here's what we know:\n\nIs the Betsy Ross flag used as a symbol for hate groups?\n\nThat depends who you ask, though generally it is not viewed that way.\n\nIn 2016, students waved the Betsy Ross flag and a Trump banner at a high school football game in Michigan, prompting the superintendent to apologize. The local NAACP chapter released a statement saying the flag was \"associated with 'racial supremacy' groups.\"\n\nOPINION:Nike blew it by capitulating to Colin Kaepernick and pulling Betsy Ross flag shoe\n\nThe Betsy Ross flag has been used by many different groups over the years, including extremist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, said Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow with the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. He said the association is weak compared to other symbols, though.\n\n\"Most white supremacists would not know what the Betsy Ross flag was if you asked them about it, compared to all the other symbols that they constantly use,\" Pitcavage said.\n\nThe anti-government \"militia movement\" also uses the Betsy Ross flag. Pitcavage said that tie wasn't strong enough for the average person to immediately connect the two.\n\nRoy Tatem, president of the East Valley NAACP in greater Phoenix, said he didn't believe the flag was intended to be racist or a racially motivated symbol. He said there wasn't evidence of Ross being a racist or a slaveholder and he didn't find the flag offensive.\n\n\"However, I believe that we should look at the nuance of it, the history around it,\" Tatem said.\n\nPitcavage said the League doesn't consider the flag a white supremacy symbol.\n\n\"It’s not on our hate symbols list,\" he said. \"We view it as a historical, patriotic flag that is usually innocuous.\"\n\nNike released a statement Tuesday it regularly makes \"business decisions to withdraw initiatives, products and services.\"\n\n\"Nike made the decision to halt distribution of the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation’s patriotic holiday,\" the statement read. \"Nike is a company proud of its American heritage.\"\n\nWhat's the history of the flag?\n\nThe flag we now call the Betsy Ross flag has a circle of 13 five-point stars in a blue patch on the top left corner. Thirteen alternating red-and-white stripes cut horizontally through the rest of the cloth.\n\nThe Continental Congress called for such a flag on June 14, 1777. The number of stars and stripes represent the 13 original colonies.\n\n\"This flag maintained familiar colors but was consciously designed to represent the new polity, and it's no coincidence that the states figured so importantly in the symbolism, since those loyalties ran high and the revolutionary government empowered the states,\" said Catherine O'Donnell, an associate professor of history at Arizona State University.\n\nDid Betsy Ross actually design the flag?\n\nIf she did play a role, she didn't act alone, according to experts.\n\nRoss was a real person. She did work in cloth, and she did make flags, according to Catherine O'Donnell, an associate professor of history at Arizona State University.\n\n\"Historians think she kind of started her own legend, by talking after the war, about her work with flags, telling her children and her grandchildren about what she did,\" O'Donnell said.\n\nO'Donnell said people like to have origin stories, so even though it's unlikely Ross made some crucial flag, it's appealing to have that story of a female heroine contributing to the birth of a nation.\n\nMarla Miller, a University of Massachusetts Amherst history professor and author of \"Betsy Ross and the Making of America,\" said Ross's contributions likely came from more of a craftsmanship standpoint than one of design.\n\n\"In the narrative recalled by her descendants, the emphasis is on her having pointed out to George Washington that five-pointed stars were more practical, from a production standpoint, than the six-pointed stars he initially envisioned,\" Miller wrote in an email.\n\nRoss's descendants played a large role in getting her name attached to the flag, according to Peter Van Cleave, clinical assistant professor of history at ASU.\n\nHe said the Betsy Ross story emerged after Reconstruction, when many white Americans were looking for points of reconciliation, one being the American Revolution.\n\n\"The story, through telling and retelling, became part of American lore, much like the story of Washington chopping down the cherry tree, also a fabrication,\" he wrote in an email. \"Indeed, calling it the Betsy Ross flag is misleading.\"\n\nContributing: Maria Polletta.

AZ professor ...", "text": "American flags on the moon are some of the most memorable images from the historic Apollo missions.\n\nBut what has become of the six American flags planted there by astronauts?\n\nCameras attached to NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have photographed five of the six flags left by astronauts from the Apollo missions of the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nScientists at Arizona State University studied photos taken at different times of day and saw shadows of the flags around the poles.\n\nWhile the flags are still there, it's doubtful whether the distinctive stars and stripes are still visible, said ASU professor Mark Robinson, the chief scientist for the cameras.\n\n\"I can only guess they are badly in need of replacement after 50-ish years of UV, hot-cold cycles, and micrometeorite bombardment,\" he said in a recent interview with The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.\n\nRobinson said the photos don't show the flags up close for a couple of reasons. The cameras can’t resolve details that small. The flags also hang vertically, making them an even smaller target to photograph. The orbiter's narrow-angle cameras are only black and white so they cannot detect color — if there is even any color left on the flags, he said.\n\nThe one flag that hasn't been photographed is the Apollo 11 American flag, the historic first human moon landing on July 20, 1969.\n\nRobinson wasn't surprised that orbiter cameras couldn't spot the Apollo 11 flag; astronaut Buzz Aldrin remembers seeing the flag blow over from the engine exhaust as Apollo 11 lifted off.\n\nRobinson said the Apollo 11 flag cannot be photographed because it's on the ground; the orbiter cameras can only capture the shadow of the flags around poles.\n\nBut even if the flags are fallen or faded, they continue to loom large in the history of space exploration.\n\nFROM THE FRONT PAGE: See how The Republic covered the first moon landing\n\nFlags represented U.S. space domination\n\nThe American flag became synonymous with the U.S. domination in space. Originally, there was talk within NASA of astronauts placing a United Nations flag on the moon. But the space agency ultimately went with just an American flag.\n\nThe 3-by-5-foot nylon flag and pole had to be specially designed because the moon's lack of atmosphere means flags can't fly in the breeze. A horizontal crossbar was added to keep the $5.50 flag outstretched. The flag was packed and mounted on the side of the lunar module, near the ladder, to make it accessible to astronauts, according to a history of the flags compiled by NASA.\n\nARIZONA TIES: How northern Arizona helped put men on the moon\n\nThe flagpole had to assembly easily because the heavy gloves that astronauts wore limited their movements.\n\nSubsequent Apollo missions would also plant flags, ending with Apollo 17 on Dec. 11, 1972.\n\nHow many countries have flags on the moon?\n\nThe United States is the only country where people have physically placed flags on the moon.\n\nFour other countries — China, Japan, India and the former Soviet Union — and the European Space Agency have sent unmanned spacecraft or probes to the moon. Those crafts carried emblems from their countries, according to reference.com.\n\nCan you see an American flag on the moon with a telescope?\n\nEven the powerful Hubble Space Telescope isn't strong enough to capture pictures of the flags on the moon.\n\nBut the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, the unmanned spacecraft launched in 2009, is equipped with cameras to photograph the moon's surface.\n\nUP CLOSE: Take a walk around the moon with these panoramas\n\nThe science operations center for the cameras is headquartered at ASU in Tempe, and it's where researchers plan and target where to take photos and then process the images.\n\nIn 2012, NASA announced the orbiter's cameras had captured five of the six American flags.\n\nBesides the flags, the cameras have photographed other remnants from the Apollo missions: tracks made by the lunar rovers, backpacks left by astronauts and their foot trails on the moon's surface.\n\nHow many Apollo missions landed on the moon?\n\nNASA's Apollo program was designed mainly to land humans on the moon and bring them back safely. Six missions accomplished this.\n\nOthers were not as successful. A cabin fire on Apollo 1 killed three astronauts during a launch-pad test in 1967. Apollo 13 was unable to land after an oxygen tank exploded and forced the crew to return to Earth in 1970.\n\nA PIECE OF HISTORY: Moon landing anniversary-themed food, drinks, souvenirs\n\nEven with the mishaps, the Apollo program is credited with igniting a generation's interest in space.\n\nThe last manned moon mission was Apollo 17 in December 1972.\n\nEarlier this year, President Donald Trump's administration announced its vision to return American astronauts to the moon by 2024, instead of the previous target of 2028.\n\nApollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt, in a recent interview with Business Insider, lauded the goal of returning astronauts to the moon.\n\n\"It's important, I think, just for the psychology of the human race — that they are still exploring,\" he said.\n\nReach the reporter at anne.ryman@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8072.

If so, brush up on proper flag etiquette as described in the National Flag Code.\n\nThe day, which marks the adoption of the United States flag on June 14, 1777 by resolution of the Second Continental Congress, is the perfect time to learn some does and don'ts.\n\nRecently, a Navy veteran had to school the Woodland Park post office, for what he called a breach of flag etiquette.\n\nWoodland Park's John Ulysses spent 20 years in the U.S. Navy as a torpedo man and said it's \"abhorrent\" when the U.S. flag is disrespected.\n\nThe post office on McBride Avenue has flown its U.S. flag overnight without proper lighting. He said the flag either needs to be taken down or illuminated throughout the night.\n\n\"When I think of all the dead veterans,\" Ulysses said, \"I can't understand people who think about the flag like that.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Ulysses has spotlighted a \"flag etiquette breach.\" A local school district was the offending party a few years ago. It too left the flag up overnight without proper lighting. In that instance, he took it down and dropped it off at the local police department.\n\n\"I thought they'd help me fold it,\" Ulysses said. Instead they told him they wouldn't touch it and he needed to put it back.\n\nOn Flag Day:Flags are supposed to unify us. In increasingly divided United States, that's not the case\n\nOpinion:Look up to me and stand proud. I’m your American flag\n\nAs far as the Woodland Park post office, employees there took him seriously and looked into the matter. Initially postal employees told him they thought the strip mall lighting was bright enough that it would suffice. As they reviewed etiquette, they also replaced the flag that was slightly worn.\n\nUnited States Postal Service administrators agreed with Ulysses and have vowed to repair the spotlight at the base of the pole.\n\n\"As one of this nation’s largest employers of veterans, we are especially mindful of the way the U.S. flag is honored and treated at our 30,000 facilities across the country,\" said spokesman George Flood.\n\nA local postal maintenance team will repair the lighting, Flood said. Until then a custodial staff will take down the flag at the end of the day.\n\nThe National Flag Code was adopted by the National Flag Conference June 14, 1923.

The jury remains out.\"\n\nSo it is with many of the colorful banners that cause chests around the world to swell with pride, often at a military or sporting event.\n\nMarshall, an experienced British journalist and foreign policy analyst, writes with the cool drollery that characterized the work of Christopher Hitchens or Simon Winchester. He tackles a topic that many people take seriously without taking himself seriously, and the result is a book that explains where many of the flags that capture the world's imagination come from and why.\n\nFlags, Marshall writes, are often designed with one idea and then adopted by groups with an entirely different agenda. For example, the Gadsden Flag, the hissing rattlesnake above the words \"Don't Tread on Me,\" was originally a warning \"to the British and served to help rouse public opinion against the empire.\"\n\nIn recent years, however, \"extremists opposed to the first black president appropriated the flag and gradually, in some minds, it became associated with racism, helped by the fact that Gadsden had been a slave owner.\"\n\nFor this flag as well as the Confederate battle flag, Marshall writes, \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and so sometimes is ugliness.\"\n\nSo it is with the Japanese flag with its simple red dot on a white background. Revered by the Japanese, it's considered \"a symbol of darkness\" by residents of nations attacked and colonized by Japan.\n\nIn Africa, new nations just shucking the yoke of European colonialism veered as far as they could from the colors and symbols associated with their former colonial masters. Many adopted the pan-African colors of green, gold and red for their flags, although the exact origin of these colors as symbols for Africa is unknown. Marshall traces some of this back to the flag of Ethiopia, which once featured a lion striding boldly over horizontal green, gold and red stripes.\n\nMarcus Garvey, the leader of the early 20th century Back to Africa movement, attributed various meanings to the colors, and while his reasoning may have been off, Marshall writes, \"the colors became associated with Africa, as did the red, green and yellow or gold on the Ethiopian flag.\"\n\nA Flag Worth Dying For is a fresh explanation of symbols we often take for granted, and a keen meditation on what flags mean to those who embrace or recoil from them.\n\nIt's not a book worth dying for, but it's one worth reading.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/958167/angela-lansbury-5-things-you-might-not-know-about-murder-she-wrote-star", "title": "Angela Lansbury: five things you might not know about Murder, She ...", "text": "Dame Angela Lansbury, star of film, TV, and theatre for 80 years, has died at the age of 96.\n\nThe Irish-British-American actor was best known for her leading role in the long-running US TV show Murder, She Wrote, in which she played Jessica Fletcher, a crime writer turned amateur detective. Lansbury was also a prominent star in films in Hollywood’s Golden Age, though her career was later defined by success on Broadway, including roles in Mame and Sweeney Todd.\n\nLansbury was “one of the biggest women of American theatre and screen” said Mark Lawson at The Guardian, and part of the “acting aristocracy” in Britain, Ireland and the US.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

A lifelong socialist, pacifist, and advocate of women’s rights, he led the Labour Party between 1932 and 1935 after its crushing election defeat in 1931.\n\nHe was “at the vanguard of a new generation of Labour leaders in London”, said The Guardian, and he “paved the way” in positioning Labour as the “radical representatives of the working class”.\n\nAngela Lansbury was “inordinately proud of her family’s political stance” said The Times, and politics would have been her “second choice of career” if it weren’t for acting.\n\nShe was Oscar nominated for her first film\n\nAs the Blitz began to ravage London in 1940, Angela’s mother decided to move her family to the United States “aboard the last passenger ship to leave England until 1945” said The Times. After studying at the Feagin School of Dramatic Art in New York she moved to Hollywood with her mother in 1942 and was quickly cast in the movie Gaslight, released in 1944.\n\nLansbury was an “instant success” said the BBC, earning a Best Supporting Actress Nomination at the Oscars for her role as a maid in the film. Despite her early success, “her looks did not fit the MGM mould for glamorous stars” wrote The Telegraph, and she was often cast as characters older than her. She acquired two more Academy Award nominations for The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962).\n\nShe was married twice\n\nLansbury was married to actor and producer Peter Shaw for more than 50 years, from 1949 until his death in 2003.\n\nBefore that she was married to actor Richard Cromwell in 1945. A “matinee idol”, wrote the BBC, he was 16 years older than 19-year-old Lansbury when they eloped, but the marriage ended later that year when he abruptly left, subsequently revealing he was gay.\n\n“I had no idea that I was marrying a gay man,” Lansbury told Radio Times. “He simply couldn’t continue – he just left. It was just a terrible error I made as a very young woman. But I don’t regret it.”\n\nHer daughter knew cult leader Charles Manson\n\nLansbury had two children with second husband Shaw, son Anthony and daughter Deidre, both of whom suffered with drug addiction while they lived in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the 1960s her daughter Deidre “was in with a crowd” led by Charles Manson, the cult leader later convicted of multiple murders. “She was one of many youngsters who knew him – and they were fascinated,” Lansbury told the Daily Mail.\n\nShe then told her husband that the family needed to leave, relocating to County Cork in Ireland, where she said the “simplicity of life” helped with her children’s recovery. “I have no doubt we would have lost one or both of our two if they hadn’t been removed to a completely different milieu”, she said.\n\nShe holds two Guinness World Records\n\nLansbury’s most notable character, Jessica Fletcher, the protagonist of the long-running Murder, She Wrote, holds an official Guinness World Record as the world’s ‘most prolific amateur sleuth’. The “high point” in her acting career, said the BBC, Lansbury’s character in the 12-year series solved crimes for a record 265 episodes and four feature films.\n\nLansbury also holds a world record in her own right, winning the most Tony Awards for Best Actress in a Musical over her glittering career.", "authors": ["Richard Windsor", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Irenie Forshaw", "Harriet Marsden", "Justin Klawans", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Adrienne Wyper", "Rebecca Messina", "Joel Mathis"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/09/06/delaware-backstory-famous-flag-history-myth/71829148/", "title": "Delaware Backstory: Famous flag, history or myth?", "text": "robin brown\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe arrival of September renews a battle you’ll only find in Delaware.\n\nThis good-natured battle focuses on whether the so-called “Betsy Ross” flag first flew in the first state.\n\nHistorians debate whether Miss Betsy of Philadelphia even made such a “first flag,” noting many flag-makers and credit-takers.\n\nAnd where it first flew, well that’s a whole other tussle.\n\nFor a long time, you could read a monument in Delaware and know for sure that the flag first flew here.\n\nOr so you would have thought.\n\nThe monument was dedicated in 1901, on the anniversary of the Battle of Cooch’s Bridge, near the namesake span.\n\nChildren who were descendants of Revolutionary War soldiers did the honors of unveiling the monument.\n\nThe Revolutionary War fight the monument still commemorates erupted on Sept. 3, 1777, sprawling over miles of farmlands and woods around Iron Hill, also giving the skirmish its other name as the Battle of Iron Hill.\n\nThe monument in front of the Cooch home, which the British made their headquarters, said definitively that the 13-star, 13-stripe flag first flew in battle there.\n\nBut there was no solid historical proof, as challengers pointed out.\n\nAnd, ultimately, the monument was changed.\n\nIn 1932, the State Historic Markers Commission removed the plaque placed by patriotic groups and citizens, replacing it with one that changed the wording to say the battle is “claimed to have been the first in which the Stars and Stripes were carried.”\n\nThat did not, however, stop the late Edward W. “Ned” Cooch Jr. from believing.\n\nAs generations of Delaware school children and history groups of various types visited the Cooch home, the gracious host always would point out the hoof marks on the first floor from the British officers’ horses and the tradition that the first “Stars and Stripes” flew on the battlefield encompassing his family’s farm.\n\nEven absent the type of proof historians required to state the story as fact, he said there had to be reason behind the longtime local account and he found no harm in believing that reason was truth.\n\nAnother battle\n\nMore than a century after an unknown number of militia members and Hessian soldiers fell and were buried in unmarked graves on the battlefield, there came what The New York Times reported “almost became the Second Battle of Cooch’s Bridge.”\n\nThat skirmish swirled around a painting of the state’s only Revolutionary War battle, painted in the 1980s by the late artist Jack Lewis of Bridgeville.\n\nLewis, who died in 2012 just days shy of turning 100, was commissioned to paint 10 historic-scene murals for the 200th anniversary of Delaware being first to ratify the U.S. Constitution, earning its First State nickname.\n\nSo of course, one of his paintings depicted the Battle of Cooch’s Bridge.\n\nAnd anyone who heads down to our capital can see it hanging proudly in Legislative Hall, even cite it as “proof” that the flag was flown there.\n\nBut the painting didn’t always show “history” that way.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Richard Cooch shared the backstory on the painting with The News Journal a couple of years ago, explaining that he and his father made sure the battle painting showed the flag.\n\nWhen Lewis first finished the painting, the flag wasn’t there.\n\nThe story, in part, goes back to the good judge’s grandfather.\n\nHe was Lt. Gov. Edward W. Cooch Sr., whom News Journal columnist Bill Frank regarded as an eminent Delaware historian and whose book on the battle endures as a state history classic.\n\nFrank called him “a stouthearted defender of the story about the American flag’s having been first subjected to military fire in the vicinity of the Cooch mansion.”\n\nThe prominent columnist admitted he was skeptical.\n\nBut over the years, he wrote, he had “come to believe” the flag story, included in the notable Works Progress Administration’s 1938 classic “Delaware; A Guide to the First State.”\n\n“Tradition declares,” the famed tome says, “that here the Stars and Stripes was first unfurled in battle.”\n\nAnd if the Cooches had their way, it would fly in Lewis’s painting.\n\nDuring the 1986 painting controversy, Richard Cooch told The News Journal, “My father and I pointed out that circumstantial evidence indicates that battle may have been the first one where the Stars and Stripes was flown.”\n\nTag-teamed by Cooches, Lewis added the flag. Placed in the lower right corner of his painting, it dominates the scene.\n\nAnd that, too, lends credence and weight to the tale that continues to evade being proven or disproven.\n\nEvery September, when the anniversary of the battle rolls around, I always wonder about the flag.\n\nSome regular Delaware Backstory readers asked what I think of the ongoing skirmish.\n\nLike generations of Cooches and the late Bill Frank, I guess I want to believe.\n\nHow about you?\n\nDo you have a Delaware Backstory?

A dozen years later he would have been barred from running for a third term because of the 22nd Amendment. That amendment was ratified in 1951.\n\nSection 1 provides that “(n)o person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice….” And no person who has held the office, “…or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President(,) shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.”\n\nThe Amendment did not apply to a president holding office when the amendment was proposed by Congress.

So, the 22nd Amendment took effect in 1951; and the office is limited to a maximum of two full terms, or eight years.\n\nI served a term of about eight years as the Attorney General of Tennessee. I can personally attest that as AG, such is a full-time job, 24/7. I appreciate and am thankful for having had the opportunity to serve my home state. It was a rewarding experience.\n\nCertainly the same is true of a person serving as president. The job of president is 24/7/365. There is a daily crisis somewhere in the world which affects our nation. Eight years is a reasonable, sufficient, lengthy time to accomplish the mission of serving as President of the United States.\n\nWe shall continue our study in the next article about the 23rd Amendment.

We have that answer for ...", "text": "Kevin Wagner\n\nPalm Beach Post\n\nQ. Since it would be non-consecutive with his previous term as President, can Donald Trump serve two more terms?\n\nA. The U.S. Constitution sets the requirements necessary to serve as President. Article II, section The Constitution lists only three qualifications for the Presidency in Article II Section 1. The President must be a natural born citizen, at least 35 years of age and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. For most of our history, Presidents could serve as many terms as they could get elected and re-elected to by the Electoral College.\n\nHowever, George Washington set a standard when he chose not to run after having served two terms. In explaining why he would not run for re-election, Washington wrote in his Farewell Address, “I have the consolation to believe that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.” Washington was confident that the system and people could persevere without him. He saw a future where “[t]he free constitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue.”\n\nMore from the Civics Project:Why the way we pick presidential nominees kind of makes sense | Opinion\n\nThe example of leaving after two terms proved to be persuasive. It was not until the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt to a third term in 1940 that the precedent was broken. Roosevelt was not the first to try for a third term, but he was the first who succeeded. He went on to be elected to a 4th term in 1944 but died 2 months and 23 days into that term.\n\nMotivated in part by Roosevelts’ length of time in office, the 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951 limiting Presidents to two terms. The 22nd Amendment reads, in part: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than once.”\n\nMore from the Civics Project:Does immunity apply to former presidents? | Civics Project column\n\nEssentially, a person can be elected twice and only twice. The fact that there might be a gap between the 1st and 2nd terms does not change the limitation. Since Donald Trump was elected in 2016, he is only eligible to serve one additional term. Barack Obama and George W. Bush, having both been elected to the Presidency twice, are barred from serving again under the 22nd Amendment. For that to change, the 22nd Amendment would need to be repealed, which would be difficult and highly unlikely.\n\nServing two non-consecutive terms is unusual. Only Grover Cleveland managed it serving as president from 1885 to 1889 and from 1893 to 1897. There is a reason it is uncommon. It is difficult for a political leader to leave the political life and then recapture the momentum to win the highest office in the land. However, it can be done — but only for one more term.\n\nKevin Wagner is a noted constitutional scholar and political science professor at Florida Atlantic University.

Bush and his son George W. Bush have served as presidents. Of course, the elder Bush was a Navy fighter pilot in World War II, where he served with distinction. He later became CIA director, then served as vice president to Ronald Reagan before winning the White House himself.\n\nThere is only one other family in U.S. history with such a presidential tradition. The Adams family produced a father-son presidential duo, with John Adams serving as president from 1797-1801 and John Quincy Adams serving from 1825-1829. The Harrison family had a grandfather-grandson combination in William Henry Harrison who was president for only 31 days, dying in office in 1841, and his grandson, Benjamin Harrison who served as president from 1889 to 1893.\n\nThe Roosevelt family produced two presidents who were fifth cousins, Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt and then Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Teddy earned fame with the Rough Riders, while FDR became the longest serving U.S. president, elected to four consecutive terms. FDR became the man responsible for causing the passage of the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, limiting a president to two elected terms.\n\nFDR is famous for his controversial New Deal legislation, which established the framework for the nation's recovery from the Great Depression. The New Deal was foundational when Lyndon Johnson maneuvered his “Great Society” social welfare legislation through Congress.\n\nFDR also led the nation through almost all of World War II. His leadership was critical in not only the U.S. military involvement in the war, but perhaps more importantly he came up with the lend-lease program that kept arms flowing into the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, thus ensuring both nations could stay in the fight during seriously dark times as they faced the Nazi war machine.\n\nAmerica’s most tragic presidential family is, without doubt, the Kennedy family. Joe Kennedy, the patriarch, had aspirations to be president himself, but his work as ambassador to the United Kingdom became an embarrassment to the Roosevelt administration. He was strongly antisemitic and his efforts to forward the policy of appeasement with Germany put him at odds with Roosevelt and United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His public comments eventually led to his recall and the end of his political aspirations.\n\nKennedy’s oldest son, Joseph Kennedy Jr., the Kennedy most likely to be president after his father's dreams were unfulfilled, was killed while flying a dangerous mission over the English Channel during World War II.\n\nMore:Want to ban books? That's what tyrants do | GARY COSBY JR.\n\nIt was John F. Kennedy who eventually became the Kennedy in the White House. Everyone, of course, knows the romanticism surrounding the Kennedy presidency, as well as the tragedy. Joe Kennedy’s other children to attain high political office were Bobby Kennedy who was also felled by an assassin during his presidential campaign, and Teddy, a longtime U.S. senator. Teddy Kennedy sank his own chances for the presidency with the Chappaquiddick incident.\n\nEven today, after many trials and travails, there is a Kennedy running in the Democratic presidential race, attempting to add another name to the Kennedy political legacy. One hopes his name will not also be added to the tragic family legacy.\n\nIf we look back throughout history, a few names stand out like stars in the night sky for their service to the nation. Abraham Lincoln is widely regarded as the greatest U.S. president for his leadership through the time of the most severe crisis the country has ever faced, as well as for his abolition of slavery. Those are two accomplishments that would be hard to top.\n\nFDR and George Washington are the two presidents who could contend for the top spot and for obvious reasons.\n\nThe worst president in U.S. history is considered to be James Buchanan, whose presidency came before Lincoln’s and whose leadership created the mess that was passed to Lincoln. Donald Trump is ranked as the second-worst president. He is, of course, the only president who attempted to overthrow his own country’s government and will ever be known for his chaotic handling of the COVID-19 crisis. The third-worst president is considered to be Andrew Johnson who came immediately after Lincoln. The Tennessean did nothing to safeguard the rights of freed slaves and his inaction would lead to nearly 100 years of legal discrimination against Blacks, particularly in the former slave states.\n\nU.S. News and World Report compiled the list of worst presidents based upon a trio of metrics developed by experts in the field of presidential history.\n\nWhile you might not agree with either the best or the worst presidents mentioned above, the one thing we can all agree on is that the best former president is Jimmy Carter. I can’t think of a more decent man who has ever served in the office of the president. While his tenure in the White House is never going to be considered great, and many will look back on those years as among the worst in our history due to the rampant inflation and the horrors of the Iran hostage crisis, his performance since leaving office has been nothing short of spectacular. If nothing else, Carter is a great human being.\n\nGary Cosby Jr. is the photo editor of The Tuscaloosa News.

He met up with the Light Horse of Philadelphia, a volunteer cavalry corps that crossed the Delaware River with Washington, inspiring an iconic Revolutionary War painting\n\n\"The City Tavern was the place to go, practically every day,\" Gordon Lloyd, a professor emeritus at Pepperdine University, told USA TODAY.\n\nLloyd discovered a summary of Washington's tavern bill that night while digging through Independence Hall documents. According to the bill, the soon-to-be first president and 54 other guests did indeed order 54 bottles of Madeira, 60 bottles of Claret, 8 bottles of whiskey, 8 bottles of cider, 12 bottles of beer and seven “large bowls” of punch.\n\nThat would be about two bottles of wine, several shots and a few cups of punch and beer for every guest.\n\nGeorge Washington's night out:\n\nThe Washington Post reported the night’s tab to be estimated at about 89 pounds, four shillings and two pence – the rough equivalent of $15,400 today.\n\nIn addition to the drinks, the tab included dinner for all 55 guests, fees for broken glasses and meals and drinks for musicians and “servants.”\n\nBut the party might not have been all that much fun for Washington, according to Alexis Coe, historian and author of the Washington biography \"You Never Forget Your First.\"\n\n\"Washington really did not want to be there,\" Coe said of the Constitutional Convention. \"He was happy to provide the stable unifying presence that the founders and framers needed in order to sign the Constitution ... but he was exhausted, he was without his wife – who he really liked to be with – and he knew there was no way she would join him.\"\n\nFact check: Shouting profanity about the president is protected by the First Amendment, legal experts say\n\nThe future president likely didn't let the party get out of control, either.\n\n\"He was famously self-controlled,\" Coe said. \"If anyone had gotten out of hand, if anyone had done more than break a few glasses or made excessive toasts, he would have put them in place.\"\n\nOur rating: True\n\nBased on our research, we rate TRUE the claim that a bill shows a hefty bar tab for an extravagant 1787 party attended by George Washington.

Bush\n\nThe most recent one-term president was George H.W. Bush. The Republican incumbent served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993, but lost re-election to Democrat William (Bill) Clinton, who went on to complete two terms.\n\nBush's White House biography attributes his defeat to the country's \"discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending.\"\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nThe 39th president of the United States, Democrat James (Jimmy) Carter, served from 1977 to 1981. He lost his re-election campaign to Republican Ronald Reagan, who went on to two full terms.\n\nCarter's biography points to several factors that contributed to his loss — including a short recession and the hostage-taking of U.S. embassy staff in Iran. On the day Carter left office, Iran released 52 Americans.\n\nGerald Ford\n\nServing from 1974 to 1977, Gerald Ford was the 38thpresident of the United States. The Republican incumbent lost re-election to President Carter.\n\nFollowing the resignation of President Richard Nixon after the Watergate scandal, Ford became the first unelected president in U.S. history. Ford's controversial pardon of Nixon had consequences — and many blame it (along with numerous issues including a poor economy and the fall of South Vietnam) to have cost him the presidency.\n\nHerbert Hoover\n\nRepublican Herbert Hoover was the 31stpresident of the United States, serving from 1929 to 1933. He lost re-election to Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, who went on to complete three full terms.\n\nWithin months of Hoover's election, the stock market crashed — spiraling the country into the Great Depression.\n\n\"His opponents in Congress, who he felt were sabotaging his program for their own political gain, unfairly painted him as a callous and cruel President,\" reads his White House biography. \"Hoover became the scapegoat for the Depression and was badly defeated in 1932.\"\n\nWilliam Howard Taft\n\nThe 27th president of the United States, Republican William Howard Taft, served from 1909 to 1913. He lost his re-election campaign to Democrat Woodrow Wilson, who went on to complete two full terms.\n\nAccording to Taft's biography, the president \"alienated many liberal Republicans who later formed the Progressive Party.\" The party's divide ended his presidency. When Republicans renominated Taft in 1912, Roosevelt left to lead to Progressives, guaranteeing the election of Wilson.\n\nBenjamin Harrison\n\nServing from 1889 to 1893, Benjamin Harrison was the 23rd president of the United States. The Republican incumbent lost re-election to Democrat Grover Cleveland. Many point to growing discontent of third-party Populists, unpopularity of high tariffs and government spending at contributors to his defeat.\n\nHarrison had initially replaced Cleveland in the Democrat's 1888 campaign for re-election. But Cleveland ran again in 1892 and won — making him a two-term (though not consecutive) president.\n\nMartin Van Buren\n\nThe 8th president of the United States, Democrat Martin Van Buren, served from 1837 to 1841. He lost his re-election campaign to William Henry Harrison of the Whig party, who died not long after taking office.\n\nHis biography points to the panic of 1837, where hundreds of banks and businesses failed — halting prosperity the country had witnessed in recent years. Van Buren \"devoted himself to maintaining the solvency of the national Government,\" but his remedies prolonged the depression, and he lost reelection.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams\n\nServing from 1825 to 1829, John Quincy Adams of the Whig party was the 6th president of the United States. The incumbent lost re-election to Andrew Jackson of the Democratic-Republicans.\n\nAccording to his White House biography, Adams' loss is attributed to Jacksonian opponents' accusations of corruption and public plunder — \"an ordeal Adams did not easily bear.\"\n\nJohn Adams\n\nThe first one-term president was John Adams.

Liberia, then a West African colony, had been founded by freed American slaves a few years earlier. Throughout the early and mid-1800s, organizations like the American Colonization Society encouraged formerly enslaved Americans to relocate there. Hanson went on to become a senator in Liberia.\n\nWorking with the America Colonization Society in the late 1850s, a Black photographer named Augustus Washington captured portraits of Liberia’s emigrants, including a daguerreotype of Hanson.\n\nThe white John Hanson served as a delegate in the Continental Congress in the early 1780s under the Articles of Confederation, America’s initial form of federal governance. After the Articles were ratified in 1781, the Continental Congress became known as the “Congress of the Confederation” or the “United States in Congress Assembled.\" Hanson was selected among the delegates to serve as the first president of this body.\n\nThe Founding Fathers intentionally constricted the authority of the federal government under the Articles of Confederation, said Peter Michael, author of “Remembering John Hanson: A Biography of the First President of the Original United States Government.”\n\n“It was weak by design,” Michael said. “No one was more acutely aware of this than the nine men who served as president of the first government.”\n\nMore:Fact check: Fake story claims former President Barack Obama was arrested for espionage\n\nHanson held few of the executive powers later bestowed upon U.S. presidents from Washington on. He served his one-year term as president and died in 1783.\n\nRealizing its federal government needed broader authority to levy taxes and regulate trade, the United States wrote a constitution in 1787, which created the structures of federal government we have today.\n\nMore:'Democracy prevailed': Joe Biden passes 270-vote threshold to win Electoral College\n\nPerhaps Washington wasn't first\n\nWhether the white John Hanson should be considered the first president of the United States is open for debate, historians say.\n\n“He was the first president of the United States, but it depends on how you define that,” said Mark Croatti, an adjunct professor of comparative politics and the American presidency at George Washington University. “There’s qualifiers involved.”\n\nCroatti suggests a number of men could reasonably be called the first president before Washington was elected in 1789.\n\nMichael, who is a descendent of the white John Hanson, noted that leaders in that era, including Washington himself, referred to Hanson as the first president. Yet neither Hanson nor any of the men who held the title of president before Washington were Black.\n\nAmericans of all races have embraced the John Hanson myth, Robinson of the Durkeeville Historical Society said, in part because American history narratives often overlooked the accomplishments of Black leaders.\n\n\"I believe the Black community has true heroes that have been woefully underreported,\" he said. \"As a result, the community tends to latch onto heroes that sound right, even without historical basis.\"\n\nOur ruling: False\n\nThe John Hanson who served as the first president of the Congress of the Confederation was white. The photograph purporting to be of the first Black president of the U.S. is actually of another John Hanson, who served as a Liberian senator in the mid-1800s. Daguerreotype photography wasn’t invented until the 1830s, making it impossible for a photograph of the first U.S. president to exist.

The fact it took this long tells the tale of America’s bitter, fractured politics.\n\nThe former first couple will attend the unveiling of their official White House portraits — an honor accorded to all former Presidents and their spouses. The 44th President was back at his old digs earlier this year for a health care event with President Joe Biden, but it will be Michelle Obama’s first return since she handed the presidential mansion over to the Trumps on January 20, 2017.\n\nGenerally, the portrait ceremony takes place during the succeeding presidency – typically a lighthearted affair to show bipartisanship and continuity across party lines. Yet, to no one’s surprise, Obama’s portrait dedication didn’t happen during his successor’s White House term; ex-President Donald Trump had no interest in sharing the presidential limelight with anyone. And Obama was hardly going to stand beside the man who authored a racist conspiracy theory that he wasn’t born in the United States. So it has fallen to Biden to do the honors.\n\nSuch ceremonies also serve as a reminder that presidents serve all Americans, and that some things – like respect for an office first held by George Washington – supersede politics. Sitting presidents often pay tribute to their predecessor’s record in office, going out of their way to find areas of agreement even if they were from different parties. In the portrait ceremony during then-President Bill Clinton’s first term, he praised predecessor George H.W. Bush – an ex-World War II pilot, US representative to China, CIA chief, vice president and President – for an “entire lifetime of public service.” Bush was gracious in return. And like all returning presidents, he said how much he loved the permanent White House staff and even confessed to missing the press corps.\n\nThe event was especially poignant as a show of unity because Clinton had beaten Bush in an acrimonious election in 1992 – though they later became friends.\n\nNine years later, Bush’s son, George W. Bush, later repaid the compliment when he unveiled portraits of Clinton and ex-first lady Hillary Clinton.\n\n“Welcome home,” the 43rd President told them. “Bill Clinton loved the job of the presidency. He filled this house with energy and joy,” he added.\n\nGeorge W. Bush returned to the White House for his portrait unveiling in 2012, more than three years after his two terms ended.\n\nObama, in his turn, recalled how his predecessor embodied national resolve after the carnage of the September 11 attacks in 2001. And he quipped that he also left him a great cable TV sports package.\n\nBut it’s hard to imagine Biden welcoming Trump back to the executive mansion for a portrait unveiling – not least because the ex-President still insists falsely that he won the 2020 election. And if Trump or another hardline Republican wins the White House next, Biden could be kept waiting, too.\n\nWhen his portrait – which hangs in the presidential mansion alongside his counterparts throughout history – was unveiled, Clinton yearned for an earlier age. “I hope that I will live long enough to see American politics return to the vigorous debate where we argue who is right and wrong, not who’s good and bad.” That is more of a pipe dream now than when Clinton spoke.\n\nThis week’s presidential portrait ceremony – and the interruption to this one tiny part of Washington convention – shows how far from normal things have become.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that the Obamas left the White House on January 20, 2017.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson Caitlin Hu Shelrose", "Stephen Collinson", "Caitlin Hu"], "publish_date": "2022/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/12/09/simon-estes-iowa-leaders-want-george-washington-carver-us-capitol-statuary-hall/3859671001/", "title": "Iowa leaders want George Washington Carver statue in U.S. Capitol", "text": "Simon Estes wants to see one of Iowa's famed African American leaders honored nationally in the U.S. Capitol.\n\nEstes has lived his 82 years performing for U.S. presidents with his booming bass-baritone voice and carving a path as one of the first successful African American opera singers.\n\nHe hopes that soon, another African American pioneer, George Washington Carver, will be recognized nationally as an innovator, role model and leader in Iowa and the country.\n\nCarver's likeness could one day be enshrined in the U.S. Capitol Statuary Hall, thanks to a small group of Iowa leaders like Estes and former U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Quinn.\n\n\"He was not born in Iowa, but it was the one state that recognized his talent and helped him along the way,\" Estes said. \"I just admire him oh so very much.\"\n\nStatuary Hall contains two statues from each of the 50 states.

I had gone to Kennebunkport, Maine, to honor my friend Barbara Bush at a literacy event — and to see President George H.W. Bush. Before the event, I got the phone call, asking if I was free for some private time with President Bush. They’d been bringing in authors and friends to read to him.\n\n“I’d be honored,” I replied. My wife and I made our way over to Walker’s Point, eager to see him, but also a bit nervous. President Bush was 94 years old. There’s no joy in final goodbyes.\n\nOn the way in, they warned us that our visit would most likely be short — he’d probably fall asleep at some point during our stay. My wife made a joke about how I’m used to putting people to sleep. I laughed, pretending this was all normal.\n\nWe were playing with his service dog Sully as they wheeled him in. To my surprise, President Bush looked great. Alert. Big smile. Happy to see us. He wasn’t talking much, but he’d nod to answer questions. What caught me more off-guard was what was on his desk: three or four books, including one that was dog-eared from being read and clearly reread. It was my new non-fiction book, The First Conspiracy, about a real-life plot to kill George Washington during the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe aide told me how much he enjoyed reading it and then left us alone, just me, my wife, Sully and President Bush. He’d had offices in the CIA, Congress and, of course, the Oval Office. But here we were, the final stop, in a small office overlooking the ocean with nothing more than a desk, a few keepsakes, and a really nice rocking chair engraved with the Presidential Seal.\n\n“You want me to read from this?” I asked the president, holding up my book. He nodded so I read him some of my favorite passages, telling him the story about how George Washington fought back against those plotting against him. President Bush was listening, sometimes sleeping. But this was the moment that got to me: when I got to the part where, for the very first time, the Declaration of Independence was read aloud to George Washington and his troops. Slowly, I started reading the words out loud: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal…”\n\nRight there, President Bush shot awake — he was listening the entire time, but now, his eyes were wide, soaking up every word, like it was part of his lifeblood. He couldn’t get enough. As I read the Declaration, the tears swelled in my own eyes, as well as my wife’s. For President Bush, it was like a transfusion. At the end of each chapter, I kept asking him if he wanted to hear another chapter. Yes. Yes again. We kept going, moving on to that part of the Revolutionary War where George Washington is pinned down in the Battle of Brooklyn.\n\nIt’s a moment where Washington easily could’ve died. He was outgeneraled. Our troops got outmaneuvered. It would’ve been easy for Washington to beat his chest and go out in a blaze of glory, rushing in while trying to take out as many of the British as he could. Instead, Washington did what he always did best. He adapted.\n\nThat night, during a massive downpour, George Washington and his officers devised a secret plan — a daring escape. They arranged for all nearby watercraft to be commandeered and brought across the East River. One by one, regiment by regiment, the soldiers snuck onto the boats. Most important, the troops witnessed something else. George Washington, their leader, made sure that every soldier was evacuated before he himself got on a boat. In other words, the soldiers saw Washington risk his own life to save the lives of his men.\n\nIt’s one of my favorite stories about George Washington because it reveals his leadership, his sense of honor and, most of all, his decency. When President Bush died last month, there was one word that was mentioned over and over in nearly every tribute: Decency. In truth, it’s because President Bush was a truly decent man. But it’s also because our country is currently starving for decency. Our current political discourse … the way we talk to each other … we’ve lost that sense of decency. It’s time to get it back.\n\nMonths ago in Maine, after a full hour, I finished one of the most rewarding experiences of my life: reading about the humility and decency of our first president to the man who was our oldest living president. Putting the book back on his desk, I said my final goodbyes. President Bush shook my hand and didn’t have to say a word. He’d given me lessons I’ll carry with me forever.\n\nBrad Meltzer is a No. 1 bestselling thriller writer.

Wallace, George Washington ...", "text": "About 120 years ago on what was then the far western edge of Des Moines lived a bright teen named Henry A. Wallace.\n\nGiven the use of 5 acres of his family's land, he planted corn for use in experiments that, drawing on lessons in plant genetics he had learned from none other than George Washington Carver, launched him on the path to devising hybridized strains of corn — the cornerstone of Iowa row crop agriculture today.\n\nSo goes the story told on a historic marker at the corner of 38th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, where Grace United Methodist Church now stands on the site of the Wallace home. The plaque depicts a rapt Henry listening as Carver instructs him in a field of tall grass.\n\nIs this charming and remarkable story true? I've been intrigued with it since I first spotted the marker while on a walk near my Drake neighborhood home.\n\nI learned to be skeptical about historical markers during my years as an Atlanta resident. My neighborhood there was thick with memorials to Civil War battles, and as I did my own reading and research, I realized a brass casting often is an invitation to hagiography.\n\nBut there's plenty of evidence to back the story of the tie between the Scotch-Irish-descended boy who went on to be vice president of the United States and the brilliant former slave who later worked to enhance the commercial viability of peanuts and sweet potatoes, providing poor Southern farmers an escape from the bondage of cotton.\n\nWallace was the third generation of an Iowa family that dedicated itself to farming with a scientific approach. When he was around 5 or 6, his father, Henry C., a future U.S. secretary of agriculture, was a professor at the Iowa Agricultural College, now Iowa State University.\n\nMore:How the Des Moines metro's booming population helped it become the 'Goldilocks' of the Midwest\n\nCarver, born in Missouri during the Civil War, was the first Black student at the university, arriving in Ames to study botany after a stint at Indianola's Simpson College. After graduating, he served briefly on the faculty of the future ISU and became a friend of the elder Wallace, occasionally dining with the family. During those visits, he would take Henry for nature walks, introducing him to the plants he found so intriguing. Henry would later call him the \"kindliest, most patient teacher I ever knew.”\n\nThe Wallaces moved in 1899 to Des Moines, where Henry's father and grandfather, also named Henry, achieved great success publishing Wallace's Farmer, a progressive agriculture journal. In the early 1900s, when Henry was a student at Des Moines' West High School, he got his family's consent to plant 5 acres of corn on land that was on or near the site of the present-day church.\n\nThat's where facts veer from the plaque's account.\n\nAccording to the authoritative biography \"American Dreamer: A Life of Henry A. Wallace,\" by the late Iowa U.S. Sen. John Culver and longtime Des Moines Register reporter John Hyde, Henry wasn't conducting genetic experiments. He was trying to disprove a popular agronomist's contention that the best-shaped, most visually appealing ears of corn had the best yields.\n\nPlanting the scientist's preferred strains and some that were ugly but dependable, Henry succeeded in showing that, as he suspected, the less well-groomed corn produced more food for hogs — who, as he observed, didn't care a whit for what corn looked like.\n\nThe claim that Henry had learned plant genetics from Carver in the early 1890s strains credibility, given that the science was in its early stages then and that no matter how brilliant, a kindergartner was unlikely to grasp the complexities of it. Henry himself would later relate in an address that Carver had awakened his interest in plants by teaching him to recognize different species and praising him for having a good eye.\n\nMore:Iowa boy killed in homecoming accident was 'super positive kid' who dreamed of becoming a professional athlete\n\nAlso, as Henry's brother James would point out in an address he made in the 1970s, Henry didn't invent hybrid corn, and never claimed to have. His achievement was to recognize the value of hybrid crops, experiment with and improve them and form what became Pioneer Hi-Bred Seed Co., an early marketer of the seed. The company was a predecessor to Corteva Agriscience, the global seed giant that today has major facilities in Johnston.\n\nThe wealth Wallace amassed allowed him to pursue a career in public service. Bolting to the Democrats after a policy disagreement with his ancestral Republican Party, Wallace followed in his father's footsteps, serving as secretary of agriculture in the first two terms of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, then winning election in the third as vice president before a run-in with the party's conservative wing saw him relegated to secretary of commerce.\n\nHe himself wasn't given to the hyperbole of the plaque that honors him. In a 1962 speech, he recalled the family's first Des Moines home as a \"dilapidated old house\" with \"slanting floors and cracked linoleum,\" no electricity and outdoor plumbing. He walked 4 miles round trip to school and complained he didn't have time for extracurriculars, grousing, \"My parents had held me in a pioneer status too long.\"\n\nBut there is no exaggerating the fascination of the story of the two very different people, both bound for greatness, who found their common humanity in a fascination with plants.\n\nMore:Iowa State professor awarded a 'genius grant' reflects on the moment, what comes next\n\nBill Steiden is the business and investigative editor for the Register.

Blake is a 1989 graduate of Benedictine Military School.\n\nThe current provost and executive vice president for academic affairs at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., Blake is the first Black president in the university’s 114-year history and will become Georgia State’s eighth president.\n\nBlake became provost at George Washington in 2019. Before that, he was an administrator at Drexel University in Philadelphia, at the University of Miami and Notre Dame. He began his academic career as a computer science professor at Georgetown after working as a software developer.\n\nBlake earned a bachelor's degree from Georgia Tech, a master's degree from Mercer University and a doctorate from George Mason University. He takes over for outgoing Georgia State President Mark Becker.\n\n“I’m deeply honored to have been selected as Georgia State president,” Blake said. “I’m keenly aware of what President (Mark) Becker and the faculty, staff and students have accomplished, and I am anxious to build on the university’s great momentum. Working together, I know we can take our university to new heights in the coming years.”\n\nMore:Kimberly Ballard-Washington outlines goals, next steps as Savannah State's new president\n\nIn a 2019 interview with his alma mater, Benedictine, after being named provost at George Washington, Blake hinted about his preferred career path — \"I would love for the university to have a football team,\" he said, adding, \"I'd like to be in a major city in the east.\"\n\nWhile he said he also suggested he'd like to be at a private institution, Georgia State does hit on his other wishes.\n\n\"I’m gearing up for a really big announcement in the next couple of years,\" Blake said then.\n\nThat announcement came Thursday for Blake, who ran track and participated in the marching band and drama club.\n\n“The Benedictine Military School of Savannah, Ga., is elated to hear of the promotion of Dr. Blake and honored to have been a part of his development,\" said Benedictine Military School Headmaster Fr. Frank Ziemkiewicz. \"Dr. Blake’s naming as president of Georgia State University not only is a well-deserved response to his considerable accomplishments to date but sends the signal to a younger generation of the great potential for service that is within their grasp. Our prayers and best wishes go with Dr. Blake at this time.”\n\nRegents also voted Tuesday to name T. Ramon Stuart at president at Clayton State University. Stuart has been provost and vice president of academic affairs at Fort Valley State University for the past five years.\n\nBoth men are the first African Americans to lead the universities.\n\nBecker announced last September that he would retire June 30. Over 12 years, Becker won widespread acclaim for increasing the number and share of students graduating from Georgia State, even as the school has grown to nearly 54,000 students. He oversaw a merger with the former Perimeter College and worked to increase financial and other support for students.\n\nUnder Becker, Georgia State also marched into the highest tier of college athletics and increased research and academic productivity at an institution that was founded as a night school aimed at working white men but which has grown into a major institution that anchors downtown Atlanta.\n\nBlake was a finalist to lead the University of Rhode Island in April but withdrew from the search.\n\nStuart shifts into the president's chair at 7,000-student Clayton State, where President Tim Hynes is retiring after 12 years.\n\nBefore coming to Fort Valley, Stuart had worked at West Virginia State University. He earned degrees from West Virginia University before earning a doctorate from Ohio University. He was faculty member of the year at West Virginia State Community and Technical College before moving to West Virginia State.\n\n\"Dr. Stuart brings outstanding experience and a passion for helping students to a campus that is poised to expand on its success and become a regional powerhouse in metro Atlanta,\" Chancellor Steve Wrigley said in a statement.\n\nIn May, Kimberly Ballard-Washington, who served as interim president of Savannah State University, was named by the Board of Regents to the permanent position.\n\nRana L.

Bush and his son George W. Bush have served as presidents. Of course, the elder Bush was a Navy fighter pilot in World War II, where he served with distinction. He later became CIA director, then served as vice president to Ronald Reagan before winning the White House himself.\n\nThere is only one other family in U.S. history with such a presidential tradition. The Adams family produced a father-son presidential duo, with John Adams serving as president from 1797-1801 and John Quincy Adams serving from 1825-1829. The Harrison family had a grandfather-grandson combination in William Henry Harrison who was president for only 31 days, dying in office in 1841, and his grandson, Benjamin Harrison who served as president from 1889 to 1893.\n\nThe Roosevelt family produced two presidents who were fifth cousins, Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt and then Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Teddy earned fame with the Rough Riders, while FDR became the longest serving U.S. president, elected to four consecutive terms. FDR became the man responsible for causing the passage of the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, limiting a president to two elected terms.\n\nFDR is famous for his controversial New Deal legislation, which established the framework for the nation's recovery from the Great Depression. The New Deal was foundational when Lyndon Johnson maneuvered his “Great Society” social welfare legislation through Congress.\n\nFDR also led the nation through almost all of World War II. His leadership was critical in not only the U.S. military involvement in the war, but perhaps more importantly he came up with the lend-lease program that kept arms flowing into the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, thus ensuring both nations could stay in the fight during seriously dark times as they faced the Nazi war machine.\n\nAmerica’s most tragic presidential family is, without doubt, the Kennedy family. Joe Kennedy, the patriarch, had aspirations to be president himself, but his work as ambassador to the United Kingdom became an embarrassment to the Roosevelt administration. He was strongly antisemitic and his efforts to forward the policy of appeasement with Germany put him at odds with Roosevelt and United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill. His public comments eventually led to his recall and the end of his political aspirations.\n\nKennedy’s oldest son, Joseph Kennedy Jr., the Kennedy most likely to be president after his father's dreams were unfulfilled, was killed while flying a dangerous mission over the English Channel during World War II.\n\nMore:Want to ban books? That's what tyrants do | GARY COSBY JR.\n\nIt was John F. Kennedy who eventually became the Kennedy in the White House. Everyone, of course, knows the romanticism surrounding the Kennedy presidency, as well as the tragedy. Joe Kennedy’s other children to attain high political office were Bobby Kennedy who was also felled by an assassin during his presidential campaign, and Teddy, a longtime U.S. senator. Teddy Kennedy sank his own chances for the presidency with the Chappaquiddick incident.\n\nEven today, after many trials and travails, there is a Kennedy running in the Democratic presidential race, attempting to add another name to the Kennedy political legacy. One hopes his name will not also be added to the tragic family legacy.\n\nIf we look back throughout history, a few names stand out like stars in the night sky for their service to the nation. Abraham Lincoln is widely regarded as the greatest U.S. president for his leadership through the time of the most severe crisis the country has ever faced, as well as for his abolition of slavery. Those are two accomplishments that would be hard to top.\n\nFDR and George Washington are the two presidents who could contend for the top spot and for obvious reasons.\n\nThe worst president in U.S. history is considered to be James Buchanan, whose presidency came before Lincoln’s and whose leadership created the mess that was passed to Lincoln. Donald Trump is ranked as the second-worst president. He is, of course, the only president who attempted to overthrow his own country’s government and will ever be known for his chaotic handling of the COVID-19 crisis. The third-worst president is considered to be Andrew Johnson who came immediately after Lincoln. The Tennessean did nothing to safeguard the rights of freed slaves and his inaction would lead to nearly 100 years of legal discrimination against Blacks, particularly in the former slave states.\n\nU.S. News and World Report compiled the list of worst presidents based upon a trio of metrics developed by experts in the field of presidential history.\n\nWhile you might not agree with either the best or the worst presidents mentioned above, the one thing we can all agree on is that the best former president is Jimmy Carter. I can’t think of a more decent man who has ever served in the office of the president. While his tenure in the White House is never going to be considered great, and many will look back on those years as among the worst in our history due to the rampant inflation and the horrors of the Iran hostage crisis, his performance since leaving office has been nothing short of spectacular. If nothing else, Carter is a great human being.\n\nGary Cosby Jr. is the photo editor of The Tuscaloosa News.

He has worked as a systems architect for the Department of Defense, has advised the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Department of the Navy.\n\nHe gives the impression that he thrives on solving problems by analyzing the systems they're in, studying the people, enlisting everyone in identifying priorities, as well as qualifying workers to answer employer needs, finding unusual solutions such as teaming with a business to build a hotel on campus or letting learners from other countries virtually sit in the same class, through technology, with U.S. students.\n\nMore:With URI president David Dooley retiring in June, search for successor underway\n\nMore:URI embroiled in controversy over professor's comments about transgender individuals\n\nMore:A less invasive option: URI researchers have developed a saliva-based COVID test\n\nOf URI, he said the quadrangle is amazing and he loved how students interact with it.

He could see a straight line from URI to the top 100, he said.\n\nCurious about how to keep students engaged so they forget about dropping out, he said he helped bring about a study that gave one group of students the best professors and the best schedules, and kept them together as they advanced.\n\n\"The retention rate had a huge increase,\" he said. The study then tried to provide the favored students with an opportunity to make up for any gaps.\n\nHe also advocated for giving students a chance during college to adjust to the person they're becoming.\n\n\"We've worked to allow students to have an opportunity to improve.\"\n\n\"Why URI?\", asked Jeannette E. Riley, the dean of Arts & Sciences URI.\n\nBlake said he grew up in Savannah, Georgia, a small city that resembles Providence in climate, proximity to the ocean, interesting architecture, graceful neighborhoods and pirates in their past. His wife fell in love with Providence, he said, and he sees great potential for growth in the URI system.\n\nSearch Committee Chairman Thomas M. Ryan, former chairman and CEO of CVS, said more than 200 people applied. Ryan especially wanted someone experienced in the following areas: “Improving the student experience; research and scholarly success; diversity and equity; and financial stability.”\n\nIf success pushes Blake forward, it could be because he applies a few simple tools: hard work, thorough observation and research, getting everyone's participation and then their views and applying analysis to the information, solutions suggest themselves.\n\nOr, another way: \"Look for what's positive and strive for increasing that.\"\n\nA second finalist for the president's job, Marc Parlange, was scheduled to be interviewed Tuesday.

The New York Times similarly reported that the vice president has the power to declassify, while noting the scope of that authority \"has never been definitively tested.\"\n\nMaterials that could be classified include military plans, foreign government information or scientific, technological or economic matters relating to national security, according to the order.\n\n\"It is longstanding practice in the executive branch to treat the vice president as having the same amount of authority in that respect as the president unless the president explicitly says otherwise,\" McClanahan said.\n\nFact check: False claim that Biden ordered the FBI search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate\n\nBradley Moss, a national security attorney at the law office of Mark S.

Coe was basically apolitical, or nonpartisan, as an informal chaplain to those in high places, left or right politically.\n\nThe authors characterize George Washington as not very religious. His religious inclinations are clear to biographers who look at him in the Anglican church context.

Even before Hollande began his presidency last year, the Obama administration coordinated closely with the French on Afghanistan and Libya.\n\nFrance has also played a key role in dealing with security challenges in combating the rise of Islamic militants in places like Mali and the Central African Republic, with airlift and other logistical support coming from the Untied States.\n\nThe two leaders will also spend plenty of time talking about economic issues, including ongoing negotiations for a major U.S.-European Union trade deal, and France's ailing economy.\n\nBoth Obama and Hollande are facing declining popularity -- in Hollande's case, he has the lowest favorability rating of any modern French president.\n\nAlthough U.S. unemployment has fallen to 6.6%, Obama has repeatedly acknowledged that too many Americans are struggling, and he has made addressing income inequality a central focus of his remaining time in office.\n\nHollande faces a more difficult situation, with French unemployment hovering around 11% and 0.4% economic growth in the last quarter.\n\nThe two returned to Washington on Monday night, where Hollande was to have dinner with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde and World Bank President Jim Yong Kim.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hollande and Obama will meet again at the White House and hold a joint news conference.\n\nHollande will also be honored with a luncheon by Vice President Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday afternoon, and the official visit will be wrapped up with a state dinner on Tuesday night at the White House.\n\nWhite House executive chef Cristeta Comerford and White House pastry chef William Yosses appear ready for the challenge of cooking for the leader of the gastronomic epicenter of the universe and have come up with their \"Across America\" menu for the dinner.\n\nIf the dinner isn't impressive enough, the evening's entertainment should be.

Both were experienced military men. President Thomas Jefferson had chosen Lewis to lead an expedition up the Missouri River. Lewis, with Jefferson’s approval, chose Clark. It was a multi-task expedition, but one of the main objectives was to seek out a water route to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe expedition had been more than a year in the planning when they arrived at the confluence of the great rivers.\n\nThe two American commanders planned to make their winter camp on the western shore of the Mississippi River near the mouth of the Missouri River in what was then still the Louisiana Territory, an 828,000-square-mile swatch of North America claimed by France and governed by Spain but soon to be transferred to the United States for the bargain basement price of $15 million.\n\nBut Carlos Dehault Delassus planned otherwise.\n\nDelassus was the Spanish commander in St. Louis. And although the Louisiana Purchase had already been agreed to between the United States and France, the Spanish had been granted control of the territory and Delassus had not been formally notified by his government of the purchase, and thus would not allow the American expedition to establish a camp west of the Mississippi. Lewis and Clark abided by the Spanish commander’s decision. They stayed on American soil, which meant staying east of the Mississippi.\n\nClark, who had the responsibility of establishing the military camp while Lewis attended to business at the territorial courthouse in Cahokia and nearby St. Louis, led his group to the River Dubois, which met the necessary requirement of being in United States territory. They landed near the mouth of the river on the south shore, across the Mississippi from where the Missouri emptied into it. Clark explored the landscape and determined it suitable for their winter camp, which he later designated Camp River Dubois. Final preparations for the Lewis and Clark Expedition had begun.\n\n‘Boot camp’ of the Lewis and Clark expedition\n\nIt was by most accounts a rough-and-tumble affair. The men were young, spirited and restless. The winter military camp was rigid and boring. Clark apparently had no hesitancy in administering discipline. He knew the trip ahead would be difficult. Success and survival would hinge on the functioning of an organized, well-disciplined military unit. He and Lewis were determined to form one.\n\n“I would consider this place the boot camp of the Lewis and Clark expedition,” said Brad Winn, site manager for the Lewis and Clark State Historic Site just off Highway 3 near here. The property includes an impressive 14,000-square-foot visitor’s center and a replica of the original Camp River Dubois, which is hardly larger than a subdivision residential lot.\n\n“He (Clark) had to muster together what we today call the Corps of Discovery,” Winn added. “They had to learn to trust each other. And they had to learn to trust the captains. It all comes together at Camp Dubois.”\n\nThe exact location of the original camp is unknown, although Winn says it is likely underwater, having been swallowed by the shifting Mississippi.\n\n“The confluence of the Missouri and the Mississippi in 1803 was about 5 miles north of where it is today,” Winn said. “Over the past 200 years the Mississippi River has moved east and the Missouri River has moved south. We don’t know for sure where the camp was. What we can say with certainly is that the original site was east of the Mississippi River.”\n\nMore:American beginnings: The source of the Mississippi River\n\nClark, who would become the expedition’s mapmaker, took regular sextant readings (he stationed the instrument on a stump from where timber had been cut to construct the fort) and kept copious notes. But he was early in the cartography learning curve.\n\nFrom Clark’s notes, Winn said, the original site was likely about 1 1/8 miles north of the state historic designated site.\n\n“As good a cartographer as he would become, Clark was a little off in his latitudinal and longitudinal readings,” Winn said.\n\nThe current display includes a reconstructed fort. The fort area was closed for maintenance and storm damage repair the day I visited, but a walk around revealed it to be a roughhewn affair, but one designed with order and symmetry. It was built to military specifications of the early 19th century.\n\nWinn notes that the fort’s size and its building placement are estimates based on Clark’s notes and sketches of the compound, which Winn describes as “doodling.”\n\n“Clark’s sketches of the fort are just that: sketches,” he said. “But we know some things about how it was laid out from military requirements of the day.”\n\nThe winter camp was also a time of fine-tuning who would be included in the expedition. Men were added; others were dismissed. Clark also apparently employed practical solutions to thorny problems. Winn said military regulations permitted the hiring of a civilian to provide laundry services. Clark employed a local woman for the work. Army regulations also required she be provided with housing, food and medical care. Clark assigned men who had been fighting the job of building the washerwoman’s lodging, effectively forcing them to work together, communicate and cooperate.\n\nClark and about 40 men departed Camp Dubois on May 14, 1804. Clark noted the event in his journal: “I Set out as 4 oClock P.M. in the presence of many of the Neighbouring inhabitents, and proceeded on under a jentle brease up the Missourie.”\n\n“This is where it began,” Winn added.\n\nLewis, who was wrapping up affairs in St. Louis and would join the group in the village of St. Charles a few days later, agreed, recording in his notes from May 1804, “The mouth of the River Dubois is to be considered as the point of departure.”\n\nThe Lewis and Clark State Historic Site is located just off Highway 3, on the Illinois side of the Mississippi and across the river from where the Missouri joins the Mississippi. Hours of operation vary by season.

It is also getting some new energy thanks in part to the spotlight provided by the HBO series Treme.\n\n\"All the things sacred to New Orleans bubbled up from that neighborhood, because Treme had such a mixture of people and cultures,\" said Toni Rice, a spokeswoman for one of the neighborhood groups organizing its bicentennial celebration. \"It wasn't just slaves. It wasn't all white or all black. It was German, Spanish, Haitian, Italian.\"\n\nBorn from the immigration that followed the Haitian revolution of the early 1800s and named for French milliner and property owner Claude Treme, the neighborhood became an entertainment center where white and black Creoles gathered.\n\nThe wave of Haitian refugees added to a New Orleans that was already a mix of French, Spanish and African-American culture, with American influence filtering in after the 1803 purchase of the territory from France. New Orleans was still largely confined to the French Quarter - the original city founded in 1718. Treme and other outlying neighborhoods were farms or swamps until efforts to drain the land took hold as the population grew.\n\nIt's the site of St. Augustine, one of the oldest African-American Catholic church parishes in the nation, where famed clarinetist Sidney Bechet was baptized in 1897 and where Homer Plessy was a parishioner. In 1892, Plessy triggered the infamous U.S. Supreme Court case, Plessy v. Ferguson, which upheld the constitutionality of state laws requiring racial segregation in public facilities under the doctrine of \"separate but equal.\"\n\nIt's also the site of Congo Square, where during the 18th and 19th centuries slaves were permitted to dance, trade goods and play music that would evolve into jazz. Generations of musicians hail from Treme, among them Troy \"Trombone Shorty\" Andrews and his grandfather, the late Ooh Poo Pah Doo singer Jesse Hill.\n\nIt was also home to the recently deceased Lionel Batiste - the vocalist, drummer and assistant leader of the Treme Brass Band who was known simply as \"Uncle Lionel.\" And it was the birthplace of jazz singer and trumpeter Lionel Ferbos, who at 101 is believed to be the oldest working musician in the city. He performs regularly at the Palm Court Jazz Cafe in the French Quarter.\n\nPercussionist Shannon Powell, 50, has lived in Treme his entire life. It's where at age 11 he performed Bourbon Street Parade at a now-closed jazz club near his house and where as a teenager he was discovered by singing banjo and guitar player Danny Barker, who helped launch Powell's career.\n\n\"I caught the tail end of a lot of good things, of old ways of doing things,\" Powell said. \"Jazz funerals meant a lot more than they do now. They were so respectful and dignified. The procession dressed in suits, wore black and white, and they played a slow dirge until the body was put in the ground. It's not like that anymore. Now you have kids out there in jeans playing all kinds of stuff.\"\n\nStill, after years of blight and crime problems, a slow revival is taking shape. Treme is now part of a multimillion dollar Department of Housing and Urban Development revitalization plan, which could include the removal of the interstate highway. Work is under way to turn an unused rail corridor into a miles-long walking and bike path called the Lafitte Greenway.\n\n\"This neighborhood is an example of survival,\" said Wayne Baquet, who operates Lil Dizzy's restaurant. \"The city lost a big part of the middle class due to white flight and then black flight to newer neighborhoods like New Orleans east and Gentilly.\n\n\"After Katrina, which practically destroyed those two areas, Treme is coming back. People have realized that the closer they are to the older parts of the city the less problems they're having in terms of infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nFloodwaters from levee failures during Hurricane Katrina, which struck in August 2005, inundated much of the city. But the French Quarter and nearby neighborhoods are built on higher ground and suffered less damage.\n\nTreme consists of roughly 150 square blocks. According to 2010 census figures, 4,155 people live there.\n\nRice said that as Louisiana celebrates its statehood bicentennial, it was fitting that New Orleans commemorates the establishment of Treme. Festivities begin on Tuesday and continue through Sunday. They include discussions of the neighborhood's history and performances by jazz trumpeter Kermit Ruffins, clarinetist Doreen Ketchens and the Treme Brass Band.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/27/lewis-clark-cemetery-indiana/76466240/", "title": "From Lewis and Clark to a cemetery in Indiana", "text": "Kevin Cullen, For the Journal & Courier\n\nWAYNETOWN — Old cemeteries are filled with surprises.\n\nOne stone in this particular resting place remembers a baby who died in 1830. Beneath another lies a Civil War sailor. Many cast shadows over the graves of pioneers who worked themselves to death turning forests into corn fields.\n\nBut the Old Pioneer Cemetery on U.S. 136, at the eastern edge of town, contains a much bigger surprise. Among its weathered stones is one that marks the grave of William Bratton.\n\nBratton, who lived from 1778 to 1841, settled near here in 1822. He was more than an early Montgomery County farmer, more than a justice of the peace, more — even — than a War of 1812 veteran.\n\nHe was a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition that crossed the territory of the then-new Louisiana Purchase in 1804-06. President Thomas Jefferson’s 40-person “Corps of Discovery” spent 28 months and logged 8,000 miles seeing things that no white man had seen before.\n\nThe journals speak of adventure, danger and new information about native peoples, animals, plants, waterways, weather, mineral deposits and land forms.\n\nMost of the inscription on Bratton’s headstone has eroded, but the magical words, “With Lewis and Clark to the Rocky Mountains” are still legible.\n\n“Bratton was an active member, and part of the permanent party — the 33 people bound to go clear to the (Pacific) coast. It was a select group; the others went only to North Dakota, then returned,” professor Gary E. Moulton, of the University of Nebraska, said in a 1996 interview.\n\n“His name appears quite often in the journals, often as (a) hunter,” he said. Montana’s Bratton River was named after him.\n\nForgotten graves of notable Indianapolis people\n\nBratton was well-suited for the odyssey. Born in Virginia, he was apprenticed to a blacksmith and learned the gunsmith’s trade. Standing more than 6 feet tall, he was among nine young members from Kentucky whom Meriwether Lewis described as “good hunters, stout, healthy, unmarried men, accustomed to the woods, and capable of bearing bodily fatigue in a pretty considerable degree.”Moulton spent years editing the expedition journals, which total more than 1 million words. The result: a definitive, 12-volume opus.\n\nBratton joined the corps in 1803 at age 26 as an Army private. He mended kettles, guns and tools, made axes, and shot bighorn sheep, deer, elk and other game. On May 11, 1805, he arrived in camp, breathless, after being chased a half-mile by a wounded grizzly bear. Bratton had shot it through the lungs, but it took two head shots to kill it.\n\nCrossing the Rockies, the starving explorers sometimes had to live on dog meat, horse flesh, a she-wolf and roots.\n\nBratton was one of five men sent to the Pacific shore to boil water for salt on Dec. 28, 1805. Salt was a precious meat preservative.\n\nCheering crowds greeted Bratton and his comrades on Sept. 23, 1806, in St. Louis. Most had presumed them dead. They hadn’t been heard from for 17 months. Incredibly, only one man had died — of a burst appendix.\n\nFor his service, Bratton received $178.33 and 320 acres in Missouri. He and his wife, Mary, had 10 children, and settled near Waynetown in 1822. According to one old family tale, his thrift was legendary. Once, some men ridiculed him for picking up scattered grains of corn at a corn husking.\n\n“He replied that he had seen the time when he would have been thankful for a few grains of corn,” great-granddaughter Maud Bratton Chesterton wrote in a 1931 reminiscence.\n\nHe died Nov. 11, 1841, at age 63.\n\nIn 2002 — thanks largely to the work of history buff and historical re-enactor Esther Duncan — a state marker was erected at the cemetery, telling Bratton’s story. The old tombstone was restored, and a plaque was added.\n\nThe goal was to “breathe new air into the life of William Bratton,” Duncan said. “It’s about time.”\n\nCullen can be reached at irishhiker@aol.com.\n\nEight Crown Hill Cemetery residents who deserve to be famous\n\nPriest's mysterious death in 1868, then � miracles?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/09/25/west-palm-rally-protests-us-treatment-haitians-border/5868470001/", "title": "'We fought for this land': Dozens protest in West Palm over treatment ...", "text": "WEST PALM BEACH — Outraged by recent images of horse-mounted U.S. border police chasing down desperate Haitians trying to enter the country, dozens of people rallied Saturday morning in West Palm Beach to demand justice for the migrants, accountability for the border agents and action from President Joe Biden.\n\n“Biden, give us humanitarian parole now!” congressional candidate Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Haitian-American, said to a nodding crowd of more than 50 people gathered on the steps of the Fourth District Court of Appeals on Tamarind Avenue.\n\nUntil this week, more than 15,000 migrants — most of them Haitians — had been living in a crowded encampment under the Del Rio International Bridge in Texas. They sought asylum status, hoping for better lives in the United States.\n\nNews outlets recorded videos showing horse-mounted border police grabbing Haitians trying to cross from Mexico into the United States. One infamous picture that spread across the internet showed a mounted officer clutching a Black Haitian man by the shirt with what some thought was a whip.\n\nEditorial:Haitians at the border: They're only human. Are we?\n\nCommentary:Help Haiti with sustainable development\n\nBorder Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said Monday the agent was swinging his horses’ reins, not a whip. Still, the imagery caused outrage. The use of horseback patrol has been suspended, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday.\n\nByrnes Guillaume, a Palm Beach County attorney who helped organize the Saturday rally, laid out three demands: Hold the border agents accountable, treat Haitians with dignity and have an “action plan” to accept and house them.\n\nBiden said Friday, “There will be consequences” for those patrolmen, adding that an investigation will be conducted. “Those people will pay,” he said. “It’s beyond embarrassing. It’s dangerous and it’s wrong.”\n\nBut the Texas encampment has been cleared of Haitians, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Friday. He said about 12,400 migrants have been allowed to enter the country, at least temporarily, while they make claims before an immigration judge.\n\nMayorkas said another 5,000 were in DHS custody and being processed to determine whether they will be expelled or allowed to press their claim for legal residency. Some returned to Mexico. Flights to Haiti continued Saturday and were scheduled to continue Sunday, a U.S. official told the Associated Press.\n\nThe clearing of the camp infuriated the crowd of mostly Haitians and Haitian-Americans gathered Saturday. They wanted the U.S. immigration system to legally process those migrants.\n\n“Everybody deserves a hearing!” Cherfilus-McCormick yelled. “We’ve paid our dues! We held up the health care system! During COVID it was us who were working! It was us who were getting sick!” The crowd cheered and clapped in response. The Homeland Security Department said Wednesday it is releasing Haitians into the U.S. but did not disclose how many.\n\nThat message, “we’ve paid our dues,” rang from rally speakers and was echoed by attendees.\n\n“We fought for this land,” audience member Cherdeline Pierre-Louis, 39, of West Palm Beach said. “And you’re telling us we don’t belong here? That makes no sense to me.” The proud Haitian-American mother of four, who helps ship basic supplies to Haiti, was referencing a piece of U.S. history not taught in many schools.\n\nIn October 1779, three years into the American Revolutionary War, 545 Haitian free Blacks joined the Continental army and French troops in Savannah, Ga., to fight the British. Their unit was bigger than the American one. The Brits won that battle, driving back the pro-independence coalition and killing hundreds of Americans and their French and Haitian allies. But the surviving Haitian troops tasted battle and learned its tactics.\n\nWhen they returned home, they led their people in a struggle for freedom against the French. Haiti was still a slave colony of France at the time called Saint-Domingue.\n\nHelping Haiti:Palm Beach County groups weigh need, safety in coordinating Haiti earthquake relief\n\nRelated:Migrants find safe space for vaccinations at Guatemalan Mayan Center in Lake Worth Beach\n\nAs the rebellion came close to throwing off colonial rule in 1803, Emperor Napoleon could see the writing on the wall. France would lose. He had hoped to sell sugar, spices and other goods in New Orleans from the slave colony in Saint-Domingue. But that seemed unlikely with the success of the Haitian revolt.\n\nSo he sold the French Empire’s largest territory to the United States, the deal known as the Louisiana Purchase, spanning an area now occupied by 15 states, from Louisiana through Montana.\n\nSpeakers at the Saturday rally in West Palm Beach emphasized that point: Without Haiti, America might not exist.\n\n“We owe Haiti a great debt,” state Rep. Omari Hardy said Saturday at the West Palm Beach rally. “But we are treating them with disrespect.”\n\nHardy and Cherfilus-McCormick, both Haitian-American Democrats, are running for the same seat in Congress, Florida’s 20th House District. The winner will represent Black neighborhoods in the Glades as well as Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties.\n\nSaturday's speakers included another contender for the seat, Jamaican-American Democrat Dale Holness, and Boynton Beach resident Golene Gordon, who said she will run for mayor of that city next year.\n\nMany people like those at the rally voted for Biden, hoping to end the inhumane treatment of immigrants under former President Donald Trump, Hardy said, so it was dismaying to see migrants continue to face such treatment at the hands of the Biden administration.\n\n“That a Democratic president is doing this is disrespectful,” Hardy said. “We need an immigration system that is based on fulfilling the needs of human beings and on furthering the interests, or at least the stated interests, of this country.”\n\n'We are human, too'\n\nCrisis after crisis has plagued Haiti in recent months.\n\nAn earthquake ravaged the country Aug. 14, killing more than 2,200 people, damaging or destroying more than 137,000 homes and leaving more than 40% of the population in need of humanitarian assistance, the Haitian Civil Protection General Directorate reported.\n\nDays later, Hurricane Grace, a Category 3 storm, ripped through Hispaniola, the island where Haiti is located.\n\nA month earlier, on July 7, President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated. Violent gangs financed by powerful politicos have sprouted to fill the power vacuum, the Associated Press reported.\n\nMany of the Haitians who gathered under the Del Rio bridge had come from South American countries such as Chile, where they had lived for years until a recent surge of COVID-19 infections.\n\nSaturday’s rally goers repeated a grievance long held by some Haitians and their children in America: The U.S. government treats people coming from Haiti worse than migrants from other nations, even though Haitians fleeing to America are trying to escape terrible conditions in their home country, like migrants from other places.\n\n“When Afghanistan needed help, did America ... go and get them?” radio show host Kelline Jean Baptiste asked the audience. “Yes!” they replied. The U.S. has flown more than 116,000 Afghans out of that country after ending its 20-year war there and conducting mass evacuations in August. The country quickly fell to the Taliban, an oppressive group of Islamic fundamentalists.\n\nJean Baptiste also argued that the U.S. government has treated Haitian migrants worse than people coming from Cuba, ruled for decades by a Communist dictatorship. Until 2017, the U.S. granted Cubans who made it to American soil the chance to stay for a year and apply for a fast track to citizenship.\n\n“We are human, too,” she said. “We deserve to be treated like humans.”\n\nSome attendees expressed indignation and a sense of betrayal towards Biden.\n\n“Just remember that Haitian people voted for you,” Gabriel Jean Baptiste, a 34-year-old pastor from West Palm Beach said. “You were down here dancing with us, singing with us, showing us some love. Show us you’re a president.”\n\nChris Persaud is a data reporter for The Palm Beach Post.

The Union Jack flew over the post for less than a week.\n\nOn June 30, 1803, with the great Louisiana Purchase, we came under the protective canopy of the Stars and Stripes for the first time.\n\nA few years later, around 1810, a man named James Mooney, came from then the Territory of Missouri, and settled above present day Cotter.\n\nJames was the son of Irish immigrant, Jacob Mooney and was the eighth of 10 known siblings. James was born about 1775 in Old Tryon County, North Carolina. In 1796 he married Miss Retta Parnell and they lived on the land grant James had received on Jan. 4, 1793 “on the waters of Knob Creek, adjoining Mooney’s Corner.”\n\nLater they moved to Rutherford County, then on to Warren County, Tennessee. In 1811, already the father of nine children, James decided it was getting too crowded in Tennessee, so he headed toward Arkansas, which was then the wild and wooly western frontier.\n\nHe and four male slaves, four Melungeons — the mysterious, swarthy dark skinned people who were already living in the hills along the Eastern seaboard when the first white settlers arrived — and a cousin named McDonald brought a flatboat loaded with supplies up White River.\n\nJames fell in love with a wide valley just above present day Cotter. There he established a trading post.\n\nThe next fall Mooney and McDonald decided to return to Tennessee, leaving the slaves and Melungeons in charge of the post and their farming interests. Business had been brisk with the Indian tribes living nearby and with the white settlers venturing into the Ozarks, and they were running low on supplies. They planned to return in the spring, if all was well at home.\n\nIt wasn’t, and James and his cousin rode south to serve with “Old Hickory” Col. Andrew Jackson during the War of 1812. James was commissioned an “ensign” in the 29th Regiment of the Tennessee State Militia on March 22, 1813.\n\nHe was following in the footsteps of three older brothers: Daniel, David and Jonathan who had all served with North Carolina regiments during the Revolutionary War.\n\nShortly before the Battle of New Orleans, McDonald was killed in action and James had such a close call that he later declared, “I got religion, right then and there.” After the war — actually the war was over before New Orleans — he joined the Concord Primitive Baptist Church Dec. 28, 1816.\n\nJames was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the Tennessee Militia and served three more years.\n\nIn 1820, James decided to move his family to Arkansas, but Retta, who was a great lady, refused to leave her comfortable home for (as she put it) “that wild, god forsaken wilderness.” So James returned alone, stopping at the Wolf House, where he had Major Wolf draw up contracts selling each of the slaves to themselves. James continued to operate the trading post and cotton plantation until the mid-1830s when his son, Jesse Mooney, took over the operations. He was probably this nation’s first commuter, with the longest commute — back and forth to Tennessee, seemingly often as he and Retta were the parents of 14 children. She never came to Arkansas, but did move to Greene County, Mo., with one of their children. She died there in 1850.\n\nJames and his household — including one of the former slaves who had taken an Indian wife, and their children, and at least one of the Melungeons and his Indian wife and children — moved to what was later known as the “Uncle Bye Mooney Place” on what is now Wildcat Shoals Access, just behind the old Whiteville School. (Mooney’s descendant, Allen Franks and family live there today.)\n\nThe rest of the household left with the Indian tribes when they were removed to Oklahoma. James was always called Jacob or Jake here. I have been told that Jake is the Irish short for James (not Jim.) He died about 1840 and was buried on his property where other members of his household were also buried — including several babies.\n\nShortly after James Jacob Mooney died, a bluish-green mineral light, a will-o-wisp, began appearing around and over his grave and lightning periodically struck the large oak tree at the foot of his grave.\n\nPious folks declared the Good Lord was pouring out His wrath on Mooney because he had “lived with the foreigners” — meaning the Melungeons. Most of the settlers were from Tennessee and North Carolina where the Melungeons, who claimed to be Portuguese, were always ostracized. The swarthy people were recognized here and the prejudice continued by a few “powers that be.”\n\nThrough the years, James’ land passed from family hands.\n\nThe Whiteville Baptist Church was organized in 1891 on part of the old home place and other burials took place next to the church. When the cemetery was fenced, the Mooney graves were fenced out, as some deemed him “such an old reprobate that he was not fitten to be buried with decent folks.” For a time, those graves were lost.\n\nNot long ago, I was able to pinpoint my great great grandfather’s grave and placed a small tombstone there. It simply reads, “James Jacob Mooney” and is placed just inside the fence with his grave lying outside. By now his story was well known, and that first Decoration Day when family members gathered to put an American Flag and flowers on his grave, everybody in the cemetery wanted to follow suit.\n\nThat day the grave of James Mooney, veteran of the War of 1812, was the most beautifully decorated in the entire Whiteville Cemetery.\n\nJustice had finally prevailed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/06/20/archaeological-traces-late-colonial-buildings-linger-pensacola/7713469002/", "title": "Archaeological traces of late colonial buildings linger in Pensacola", "text": "Elizabeth D. Benchley\n\nSpecial to the News Journal\n\nEditor's note: This is the 18th of a series of stories that will be featured in the Pensacola News Journal each week leading up to the 200th anniversary of Escambia County. Look for these stories each Monday in print.\n\nToday only a few buildings remain standing from the second Spanish occupation of Pensacola, which ended July 17, 1821, when Florida became an American territory. However, there are still underground traces of colonial buildings in the heart of downtown Pensacola. UWF archaeologists have identified and studied these vestiges for more than 30 years, and new evidence of the Spanish and British colonial landscape is often revealed during modern construction.\n\nThe colonial occupation of downtown Pensacola began with the first Spanish military and colonists (circa 1750-1763) who built a temporary settlement that developed into the permanent fort and town of San Miguel de Panzacola. Residential areas outside the fort included compounds with a main house, detached kitchen, warehouse and other buildings arranged around a central courtyard where daily household and craft activities occurred. The courtyard was swept clean and debris accumulated at the edges of the compound. Buildings were made from local wood (pine and cypress) posts placed in narrow trenches in the ground. The gabled end buildings were roofed with bark and palmetto leaves. Large bricks (ladrillos) were made from local clays exposed in the bluffs along the bay and were used in hearths, bake ovens, flooring and chimneys, but rarely in building foundations.\n\nBritish Pensacola was established as the capital of West Florida, the 14th British colony (1763-1781). The town plan included a grid of streets forming blocks of 12 rectangular house lots that surrounded the central fort district. House and garden lots were given to incoming colonists with the provision that they be fenced and a house measuring at least 15 by 30 feet be built within two years. Houses were timber frame buildings built of local wood with hipped roofs covered with thatch or shakes. The houses were placed on the ground or on brick piers. Bricks were usually made from local clays and were smaller than ladrillos, but larger than later American bricks. Bricks were often used for interior chimneys in houses and for foundations of military buildings inside the Fort of Pensacola. British brick military foundations are visible today in the outdoor exhibits of the Colonial Archaeological Trail in downtown Pensacola. They include foundations of several military kitchens and the British Government House. British house lots also included detached kitchens and storage buildings and wells behind the house. The British deposited their trash and kitchen debris close to their houses, kitchens and across their yards. Sharp items such as broken bottles, glasses, and ceramic dishes were discarded in abandoned wells and trash pits.\n\nThe Spanish occupied Pensacola for a second time after they defeated the British in the 1781 Battle of Pensacola. Over 130 British-built houses became available for reoccupation by the new Spanish residents. At the beginning of the Second Spanish period, however, Pensacola had few residents and was administered from New Orleans. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Pensacola became the administrative capital of Spanish West Florida. Many French and Spanish Catholic residents of Louisiana moved to West Florida to avoid being controlled by the Protestant Americans. Revolts against the Spanish and French in the Caribbean also brought new settlers and architectural traditions to the Spanish Gulf Coast.\n\nAlthough some British-built buildings continued in use, new Gulf Coast Creole-style houses were constructed in vacant lots or replaced deteriorated British buildings. The new Creole frame buildings had central brick chimneys and shake-covered, gabled roofs that sloped over porches on one or both sides of the building. Exterior walls were covered with horizontal boards or white-washed stucco. Most houses were elevated on brick piers. A few buildings, called Gulf Coast Creole High Houses, were multi-storied, and built on tall brick piers, presumably to protect the buildings from flooding.\n\nThe house lots laid out in 1765 by the British witnessed multiple construction episodes, and occupations by people from different cultures over time. One house lot studied by UWF archaeologists had an early British occupation dating before 1765 that included two small houses, and several outbuildings, as seen below.\n\nThe archaeology revealed that one initial small house had been a timber framed structure placed in a shallow wall trench. Its northwest corner post had been replaced at least once and the deeply set replacement post had been reinforced with a stack of bricks. An outbuilding at the back of the lot also was a wood structure that had plastered walls. The owner in 1765 was Lt. James Hooke, who was not mentioned in the historic record after 1765. By 1778 a larger wood frame house set on brick piers had replaced the 1765 house. Early British household and architectural artifacts were found associated with the house. During the second Spanish period, the lot was owned by land speculators and by 1799, Spanish maps showed no buildings remained on the lot.\n\nThe house lot to the west may have had a British house on it by August of 1765 when ownership was awarded to David Dewar provided he build a house by the following day. By 1778 a British map showed two houses on the lot. UWF archaeologists investigated the house at the northwest corner of the West lot and found evidence of an early British timber frame house with deep wall posts set every six feet, a large corner post, a small cellar, and a brick chimney on the south wall. A later British house at the same location had a wide wall trench and plastered walls. Architectural remains included bricks, plaster with lath impressions, nails, and window glass. Other artifacts included abundant animal bones, broken dishes, and bottles dating from the British and Second Spanish occupations.\n\nThe second Spanish owner of the West lot was Beltran Suchet (Souchet) who bought the lot and its single wooden house in 1804 and sold it in 1821. The West lot and several surrounding lots were bought by George Barkley between 1825 and 1835. He built what became the last surviving stuccoed brick Gulf Coast Creole High House in Pensacola. Suchet probably did not live in the 1804-1821 wood house in his West lot, however. Like many late Spanish residents, Suchet owned multiple properties in town. According to the 1784 census, Suchet, 30, was living on Michel Street with his Black slave, Juan, 19, and four-month-old Maria Josefa, who was mixed race and probably his daughter.\n\nBetween 1787 and 1809, Suchet owned six house lots with eight houses on them. His expensive 1809 house on the main plaza was two stories high. It probably became his residence. In 1817, Suchet petitioned for an 800 arpent parcel at the mouth of Bayou Mulatto for a farm to support his family and slaves and a pasture for his cattle. Also in 1817, he began to sell his lots in town. Another Suchet lot on Alcaniz was subsequently owned by Celestino and Pauline Graupera Gonzalez. The Gulf Coast Creole Cottage on the lot was well-known as Pauline’s home as she lived there for 52 years after Celestino’s death. Descendants of the Beltran Suchet, Pauline Graupera Gonzalez and George Barkley families still live in the Pensacola area today.\n\nElizabeth D.

The United States Navy recognized the song in 1889 and President Woodrow Wilson declared it the anthem of the country's armed forces in 1916\n\nThe first documented instance of the song being played at a sporting event was in 1862, the tradition was popularized by the 1918 World Series.\n\nThe song was played spontaneously during the seventh-inning stretch of the opening game between the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs. According to the New York Times the Chicago crowd gave the performance a, \"thunderous applause and rent the air with a cheer that marked the highest point of the day’s enthusiasm.\" When the series moved back to Boston, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee had the song played before the game\n\nCalvin Coolidge signed a bill to make the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" the country's national anthem on March 3, 1931.\n\nHere are five notable performances of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\".\n\nWhitney Houston Super Bowl XXV 1991\n\nDays into the First Gulf War, Whitney Houston provided the nation a lasting glimpse of patriotic naivete. A bombastic rendition of the country's anthem delivered on the heels of Cold War victory but before entrenchment in the Middle East, a bombing in Oklahoma City and a school shooting in Colorado. It is often listed as the best version of the anthem, earning its spot through technical excellence and Houston's unmatched presence.\n\nJimi Hendrix: Woodstock Music and Arts Festival 1969\n\nOn a dairy farm in upstate New York, Jimi Hendrix performed a version of the national anthem that encapsulated the spirit of a generation. If Houston's rendition was American optimism at its zenith, Hendrix's reinterpretation was American cynicism blended with a demand for change. Hendrix's wailing guitar can soundtrack Vietnam or Civil Rights protest footage or hippy hedonism and be equally at home with either.\n\nMarvin Gaye: NBA All Star Game 1983\n\nWhile the culture of a decade often bleeds outside the calendar's measure, Marvin Gaye's performance of the anthem at the 1983 NBA All Star Game announced that the 80's were here. Performed at The Forum in Inglewood, California during the rise of the \"Showtime\" era of the Los Angeles Lakers Gaye looked the part of what 80's Hollywood wanted to see itself as: slick, smooth and seductive. He delivers in a way that only a soul singer of his caliber could.\n\nRosanne Barr: San Diego Padres vs. Cincinatti Reds 1990\n\nOne year before Houston's last gasp of unbridled patriotism, the sports world caught a glimpse of the coming wave of cynicism that would define the 1990's. Rosanne Barr screeched her way through the song ahead of a game between the lowly San Diego Padres and the soon to be World Series champion Cincinatti Reds, ending the performance by spitting and grabbing her crotch.\n\nThe problems for the performance have since been pinned on the sound delay in the stadium and Barr starting the song on too high of a note. Barr told the Washington Post that the crotch grab and spit were a mocking of habits of baseball players. Barr was thoroughly criticized for the performance with then President George H.W. Bush calling the performance, \"disgraceful\" eventually resulting in an apology from the comedienne.\n\nCarl Lewis: Chicago Bulls vs New Jersey Nets 1993\n\nThere are some people who should stick to what they are good at.\n\nCarl Lewis took a swing at the anthem ahead of a game between the Chicago Bulls and New Jersey Nets on January 21, 1993. The first few bars are passable but when Lewis reaches \"when the rockets\" the performance falls off the tracks and winds up somewhere in the New Jersey swamplands.\n\nNotably called 'Francis Scott off-Key' by then ESPN anchor Charlie Steiner the performance has stuck with Lewis since that night.\n\n\"I'm actually glad it happened because it's a part of your journey,\" Lewis told Oprah.com, \"The great thing about it, you know, is kids will come up and they'll say, 'Oh, I saw your anthem. Boy, I didn't realize you were that fast.'\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/07/01/origins-behind-american-patriotic-songs-yankee-doodle-fourth-of-july/7784530001/", "title": "Bet you didn't know the stories behind these patriotic songs", "text": "Jim Beckerman\n\nNorthJersey.com\n\nOn July 4, we sing America's praises.

Yada yada yada.\n\nBut did you know where the tune comes from?\n\nIt is from a song of – shall we say – questionable character. Some would call it a drinking song. Some would call it worse.\n\n\"The Anacreontic Song\", also called \"To Anacreon in Heaven\", was the anthem of an 18th-century British gentlemen's club. Composed by John Stafford Smith, its original lyrics ran: \"To Anacreon in Heav'n, where he sat in full Glee / A few Sons of Harmony sent a Petition.\" (Try singing it to the tune of the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\")\n\nAnacreon was a Greek poet. He was known, especially, for drinking songs and erotic poetry. The song is a plea for inspiration in both departments. \"That he their Inspirer and Patron would be.\"\n\nFrom heaven – in the midst of who knows what debauch – Anacreon sends a reply: \"I'll instruct you, like me, to intwine, The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.\"\n\nBacchus, as in drink. Venus, as in sex. Basically, this song is a request to a heavenly playboy: \"Will you be the MC of our stag party?\"\n\nThat's what you're singing at the beginning of every football game.\n\nAre banks open on July 4th?

We cheer them in the Bronx. We send the Yanks \"Over There.\" And of course \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" conjures up pictures of George Washington, Valley Forge and the heroes of 1776.\n\nWell, sorry to disappoint. But \"Yankee Doodle,\" the hero of that popular Revolutionary War ditty, was a clod.\n\n\"Doodle\" is 18th-century-ese for \"nincompoop.\"\n\n\"Yankee Doodle came to town / Riding on a pony\" was originally a British song, from the point of view of the Europeans. Look at that ridiculous American!\n\nYankee Doodle then makes himself even more embarrassing by sticking a feather in his cap and calling it \"Macaroni.\" A \"Macaroni,\" in those days, was a dandy, a fop – in line with contemporary prejudice that Italians were effeminate.\n\nBut Yankee Doodle isn't even a fop. He's a wannabe fop. \"Stuck a feather in his cap and called it Macaroni\" is the equivalent of \"Dyed my hair green and called myself Lady Gaga.\"\n\nJuly 4th at the White House is an annual tradition. Here’s how it started.\n\nFlying on July 4 weekend? Delta has good news for you: No fare difference when rebooking travel\n\n'You're a Grand Old Flag'\n\nThis song might have gotten you into a fight – if you sang it with the original lyrics.\n\n\"You're a Grand Old Flag\" was first published and performed in 1906 as \"You're a Grand Old Rag.\"\n\nIt wasn't meant as an insult. George M. Cohan, the musical comedy writer famous for this, \"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,\" \"Over There,\" and other patriotic tunes, had no beef with the flag. Neither did the old Civil War veteran he had encountered carrying a tattered but much-loved flag – possibly from Gettysburg, where he'd fought. \"She's a grand old rag,\" the man had remarked wistfully.\n\nCohan was taken with the phrase. So much so that he wrote a song about it. And so much so that even when people started complaining (\"You can't call the Stars and Stripes that!\"), he was loath to change the lyric.\n\nHe tried \"You're a grand old flag / Though you're torn to a rag.\" No sale. Finally, reluctantly, he changed it to, \"You're a grand old flag, you're a high-flying flag.\"\n\nWhich is a non-rhyme – but at least it didn't offend the music-buying public. \"You're a Grand Old Flag,\" in sheet-music form, became the first million-selling musical comedy song.\n\nIn other news:Will you have to have to eat your July Fourth hot dog or hamburger without mustard?\n\n'My Country 'Tis of Thee'\n\nYou will have noticed that the tune of this familiar song – a de facto national anthem for many years, until \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" became our official one in 1931 – is the same as \"God Save the Queen.\"\n\nWhat you may not know is that the same tune is used in dozens of countries.\n\nIt's the national anthem of Liechtenstein: \"Oben am jungen Rhein.\" It's the royal anthem of Norway: \"Kongesangen.\" The Swiss call it \"Rufst du, mein Vaterland\" (it's their former national anthem). Germany and Russia have their own versions.\n\n“All the brass instruments and big drums in the world cannot turn 'God Save the King' into a good tune,\" remarked George Orwell in 1943. Clearly the minority opinion.\n\nBut did you know that, even in America, there were two versions of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\"?\n\nThere's the one you grew up with. And there was an abolitionist version, popular in the 1840s, which you probably did not sing in grade school: \"My native country, thee / Where all men are born free, if white's their skin…\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter was a thing then, too.\n\nHoliday pet care:How to keep your dog calm during fireworks this 4th of July\n\n'The Stars and Stripes Forever'\n\nIf you were at a circus or the theater, and the house band started playing this beloved 1896 march by John Philip Sousa, you knew you were in trouble.\n\nThat march, back in the day, had a very specific meaning. It meant: Get out!\n\n\"The Disaster March,\" as it was known in the trade, was never to be played except in the case of the most extreme emergency. The march was code. The point was to signal the staff, without letting the public know.\n\nThis was the music people heard at the infamous fire at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus on July 6, 1944, in Hartford, Connecticut, according to historian Michael Skidgell (\"The Hartford Circus Fire: Tragedy Under the Big Top,\" 2014). For some, it was the last music they heard. At least 168 were killed that day, and the incident led to Ringling Bros. abandoning the canvas \"big top\" in favor of arenas.\n\nBut it didn't lessen the popularity of \"The Stars and Stripes Forever.\" In 1987, \"The Disaster March\" became the national march of the U.S.\n\n'God Bless America'\n\nThis is the song many people wish was our national anthem – if only because Irving Berlin's tune is easier to sing than \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nBut people have loved \"God Bless America\" ever since Kate Smith introduced it on her Armistice Day broadcast in 1938. Coming on the eve of World War II (it was actually a rewritten version of a song Berlin had penned in 1918, for the previous war, but never published), the song seemed like a national prayer for deliverance in a dark moment. Since then, \"God Bless America\" has been popular in good times and bad. Presidents since Ronald Reagan have invariably ended their speeches with, \"God Bless America.\"\n\nWhere did Irving Berlin get the inspiration for this passionate, transcendent hymn to all things American?\n\nApparently, from a 1906 novelty song called \"When Mose with his Nose Leads the Band.\"\n\nAt least, the first six notes of the chorus are the same as \"God Bless America,\" as music historian Jody Rosen has pointed out.\n\nSuch humorous \"ethnic\" ditties were all the rage in the early 1900s, when Berlin began his career. \"It Takes the Irish to Beat the Dutch,\" \"Come Down to Your Italian Romeo,\" \"Abraham Jefferson Washington Lee\" were some of the more mentionable ones.\n\nBerlin, though Jewish himself, was not above writing \"Yiddle on Your Fiddle Play Some Ragtime.\" So Mose and his nose were probably not unknown to him.\n\nFrom such questionable beginnings came a patriotic treasure. Only in America.\n\nWhat does the Juneteenth flag look like?:Can it be celebrated with July 4th? It's complicated\n\n'This Land Is Your Land'\n\n\"Answer records\" are an old story in pop music. Chuck Berry wrote \"Back in the U.S.A.,\" The Beatles responded with \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" Tenafly's Lesley Gore answered her own hit, \"It's My Party and I'll Cry if I Want to\" with \"It's Judy's Turn to Cry.\" In 1984, the hip-hop hit \"Roxanne, Roxanne\" was followed by \"Roxanne's Revenge,\" \"Do the Roxanne,\" \"The Parents of Roxanne,\" \"Roxanne's a Man\" and at long last \"The Final Word – No More Roxanne (Please).\"\n\nThis is the great tradition that folk singer Woody Guthrie was tapping into when he responded in 1945 to \"God Bless America\" with \"This Land Is Your Land\" – originally titled \"God Blessed America for Me.\"\n\nHe had become tired, he tells us, of hearing \"God Bless America\" everywhere – he felt it was jingoistic. The original lyrics contained verses (often omitted now) critical of capitalism and private property: \"There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me / Sign was painted, it said private property / But on the back side it didn't say nothing / This land was made for you and me.\"\n\nThe chorus was meant to be confrontational. This land is made for you and me – not them (millionaires and big business).\n\nIronically this song, with its left-wing lyrics, is now widely viewed as a patriotic anthem equal to \"God Bless America\" – most people, if pressed, could not detect any difference in sentiment. Both were added to the Library of Congress National Recording Registry in the same year: 2002.\n\nTraveling for July Fourth?:Here are 5 things to know before flying, driving this weekend.\n\nJuly Fourth gas prices:How much will gas cost?

May we suggest \"spacious skies\" and \"fruited plain\"? What a difference a word makes!\n\nAnd while we're on the subject of \"America the Beautiful,\" let's give a shout-out to the LGBTQ+ community – In 2015, Bates was one of 31 gay icons named by Equality Forum for LGBT History Month.\n\nA Fourth of July message from dogs:Why the loud fireworks? Can't you just wag your tails?\n\n'Only in America'\n\nGet Me Rewrite – Part 2. \"Only in America\" was a No. 25 Billboard hit for Jay and the Americans in 1963. And its sunny optimism struck a chord with lots of people. Cuban immigrants, fleeing Castro, made it a kind of anthem: \"Only in America / Can a guy from anywhere go to sleep a pauper and wake up a millionaire.\"\n\nBut those weren't the original lyrics.\n\nSongwriters Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil originally intended the song for The Drifters, the Black R&B group that had hits with songs like \"Up on the Roof\" and \"On Broadway.\" And the original lyrics were quite different: \"Only in America / Land of opportunity / Can they save a seat in the back of the bus just for me.\"\n\nNo can do, said Atlantic Records – which refused to release a song with such incendiary lyrics.\n\nThe Drifters refused to release the rewritten version. So the original instrumental track was used to back up the white group Jay and The Americans, who could sing the cheerful new words with some conviction.\n\nRelated:5 products to ease PTSD and anxiety during Fourth of July\n\nAs hopefully we will all do this July 4, as \"America the Beautiful,\" \"This Land Is Your Land\" and \"Yankee Doodle\" bring us together in song.\n\nAssuming we can be brought together, these days, by anything.\n\n\"The Fourth of July gives us an opportunity to put aside our disagreements and come together for love of country,\" Gillespie says. \"That's when we see that coming together, rallying together.\"\n\nBoom:The fireworks shortage is over, but prices have exploded this year\n\nJuly Fourth weekend travel:Here are the best and worst times to leave for your road trip", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/11/17/scarsdale-historian-tells-story-star-spangled-banner/19047501/", "title": "Author hits high note with 'Star-Spangled Banner' book", "text": "Alex Taylor\n\nartaylor@lohud.com\n\nFrancis Scott Key wrote the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" in 1814 after watching the bombardment of Fort McHenry\n\nFor much of the 19th-century it was one of several songs vying for the title of national anthem\n\nIn 1916, President Woodrow Wilson decreed the \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" be played at military events\n\nCongress officially declared it the national anthem only in 1931\n\nMost Americans know the basic facts about \"The Star-Spangled Banner\": how Francis Scott Key scribbled his vocal chord stretching ode in September 1814 after watching the bombardment of Fort McHenry as a prisoner aboard a British ship.\n\nBut it's the next 200 years that really fascinates historian Marc Ferris, author of \"Star-Spangled Banner: The Unlikely Story of America's National Anthem.\"\n\n\"Francis Scott Key is interesting, but I wanted to tell the rest of the story,\" Ferris said during a recent interview at his home in Greenwich, Connecticut. \"'The Star-Spangled Banner' is the most controversial song in American history. It's been kicked around like a political football ever since it was written.\"\n\nA native of Scarsdale, Ferris, 51, spent nearly two decades writing and researching the 328-page book, which was published in August by Johns Hopkins University Press. He'll be signing copies Thursday at Anderson's Book Shop in Larchmont.\n\nThe idea came to him in 1996, Ferris said, when he was a graduate student at Stony Brook University. Three years later, armed with a fellowship from the Smithsonian Institution, he traveled to Baltimore and Washington, D.C., to dig through archives.\n\nHe was struck by the fact that the \"Star-Spangled Banner,\" which became an instant hit after Key's lyrics were printed in Baltimore newspapers, didn't become our official national anthem for 117 years. Plus, most Americans don't exactly praise the tune.\n\nIt's forgotten today, Ferris said, but for much of the 19th-century the \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was one of several songs vying for the title of unofficial national anthem. \"Hail, Columbia\" and \"Yankee Doodle\" were the two others.\n\nThen as now, many Americans complained Key's tune is too militant and too hard to hit the high notes. They also took exception to the fact that Key cribbed the melody from from \"To Anacreon in Heaven,\" an old English drinking song.\n\nKey owned slaves and his entire family fought for the Confederacy. But during the Civil War, Northerners adopted \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as an anthem of hope and national unity. Meanwhile, Southerners sang \"Dixie,\" which was written by Daniel Decatur Emmett — an Ohio-born, anti-slavery songwriter.\n\n\"It's one of the greatest ironies in America history,\" Ferris said.\n\nIn the decades after the Civil War, the anthem become a powerful rallying point for groups like the Veterans of Foreign War and Daughters of the American Revolution during debates over the national character and democratic ideals.\n\nIn 1916, President Woodrow Wilson decreed the \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" be played at military events. Congress officially declared it the national anthem only in 1931 — a political gesture to win the support of veterans during the depths of the Depression, Ferris said.\n\nIn addition to his passion for history, Ferris is also an avid guitarist who plays in a bluegrass band. One of the things he loves about the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" is that the song is endlessly adaptable to vernacular American musical forms, from Jose Feliciano's singing of the national anthem in 1968 World Series to Jimi Hendrix's wild and wooly Woodstock version.\n\n\"There are many unorthodox versions,\" he said shortly before picking up his Yamaha guitar and strumming away. \"You have swing bands who start jazzing up the anthem. Hendrix isn't the first to do a controversial version.\"\n\nOver the years, there have been numerous suggestions for songs that could replace \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" But none have succeeded.\n\n\"'God Bless America' is not the greatest song,\" Ferris said. \"'America The Beautiful' is kind of wimpy. It's neither here nor there. But the 'Star-Spangled Banner' has history, it's got gravitas.\"\n\nTwitter: @alextailored\n\nIf you go\n\nMarc Ferris will be visiting Anderson's Book Shop, 96 Chatsworth Ave., in Larchmont, from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Nov. 20.

From big-city stadiums to small-town high school fields, those broad stripes and bright stars are the expected musical preamble to our ballgames.\n\nNow, with the Dallas Mavericks not playing the national anthem at home games this season, there is a new national debate stirring. Some believe the melody means respect for the fallen among our military and police. Others believe it means the entirety of the American experience. The answer often depends on the ear of the beholder.\n\nColin Kaepernick, then of the San Francisco 49ers, began a protest movement in the NFL in 2016 that used the anthem as a moment of maximum impact to call attention to social injustice. In 2017, former President Donald Trump called for firing players — he called them SOBs — who protest during the anthem.\n\nHow did the dawn’s early light and twilight’s last gleaming become so politicized?\n\n“National anthems are political,” Marc Ferris tells USA TODAY Sports. He is the author of \"Star-Spangled Banner: The Unlikely Story of America’s National Anthem.\" And he knows the history of how our anthem, born of war, became intertwined with our sporting life.\n\n“Sports are a kind of bloodless warfare,” Ferris says, “a sort of war without death.”\n\nNANCY ARMOUR:Mark Cuban's decision to not play national anthem before games will surely draw outrage. But it’s long overdue.\n\nThe song is about a battle in the War of 1812. The first documented time that it was played at an American sporting event came at a baseball game in 1862, during the Civil War. The tradition of playing it at sports events got a dramatic boost at the 1918 World Series, during World War I. And the tradition of playing it before games was popularized during World War II.\n\n\"We’re a patriotic country and we’re different from the rest of the world in that respect,” Ferris says. “As we grew and as we prospered, people wanted to show their patriotism.”\n\nFrancis Scott Key wrote the song in 1814 and it became the nation’s de facto anthem not long after. Congress made it official in 1931. World War I vets had been lobbying for it for years.\n\nFerris says that in one respect Yankee Doodle Dandy should be the national anthem because it dates to the nation’s roots in the Revolutionary War. “But the Star-Spangled Banner is a better piece of music,” he says. “It’s got gravitas. It’s got history. It’s got emotional resonance.”\n\nAnd bombs bursting in air. North and South wrestled over which side could claim the song during the Civil War.\n\n“The North won the tug of war,” Ferris says. “The irony is that the South’s anthem, Dixie, was written by an anti-slavery Northerner whereas the Star-Spangled Banner, the anthem of the North, was written by a slave-holding Southerner whose family supported the Confederacy” long after Key died in 1843.\n\nKey's song was played at some baseball games in the 1890s, often with great pomp, Ferris says, but the World Series in 1918 offered a star-spangled moment. Babe Ruth’s Boston Red Sox opened in Chicago against the Cubs. The game came 17 months — and 100,000 American deaths — after the U.S. entered the war to end all wars. During the seventh-inning stretch, a military band spontaneously played the country’s still-unofficial anthem.\n\nRed Sox third baseman Fred Thomas, on furlough from the Navy, saluted. Other players put hands over hearts. The crowd, already on their feet to stretch, began to sing along. The New York Times reported the song’s final bars were met by “thunderous applause and rent the air with a cheer that marked the highest point of the day’s enthusiasm.”\n\nWhen the Series moved to Boston, the Red Sox played the song during pregame festivities and paired it with the introduction of wounded soldiers. Ferris credits the theatrical move to Red Sox owner Harry Frazee. “He thought, ‘I’m an impresario, I’ll show those Midwesterners in Chicago how it’s done,’ ” Ferris says.\n\nThe song did not yet catch on at all games for the simple reason that owners didn’t hire bands except for big events like the World Series or Opening Day. Sound systems, in place by World War II, changed that.\n\n“The anthem was heard everywhere” during the second world war, Ferris says. “Before the opera, before the movies, before the theater.”\n\nAnd, of course, before all manner of sports. Most teams continued to play the anthem in the surge of postwar patriotism. Ferris says the Cubs stopped playing it after the war but picked it up again in 1967, during the Vietnam war, and have played it since.\n\nAmid the upheaval of Vietnam, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle enforced a policy that players stand at attention during the anthem, with helmets tucked under their arms. They were not to talk, chew gum or move their feet.\n\nThe government cannot restrict speech under the First Amendment. Employers can. Today’s “owners could say to the players, ‘If you take a knee, you’re gone,’ ” Ferris says. “But of course they won’t. They want to win football games.”\n\nThe anthem is played so often at games that it can sometimes seem perfunctory. That will clearly not be the case for the foreseeable future. Ferris is fine with that.\n\n“We are actually debating real issues,” he says. “We are having an adult discussion and that is great, as long as it’s civil.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/faith/2017/06/26/words-faith-national-anthem-star-spangled-banner-writer-francis-scott-key-credited-god/429920001/", "title": "Words of faith: National anthem writer credited God", "text": "By Bebe Green\n\nSpecial to The Desert Sun\n\nTo most Americans, one can hardly say the word “life” without following it, at least in thought, with the word “liberty.” To think of living without the ability to choose our own paths is, to us, unthinkable. This was also the philosophy of a young lawyer and amateur poet, Francis Scott Key, in 1813, when he wrote the “Star Spangled Banner”.\n\nKey was on an errand of mercy to release a prominent local physician, (a Dr. Beane), who had been taken prisoner by the British, at Fort McHenry. The officers had decided to let him go, but not until the current battle was over.\n\nHelplessly, Key watched, from a distance, all throughout the night, as that bloody battle in the War of 1812 ensued. His heart was heavy, as there was little hope that these brave, but few, tired fighters for freedom could withstand the strong, well equipped British warhead.\n\nIn the “dawn’s early light” of Sept. 14, Key noticed that the British had stopped firing. He knew that Major Armistad had specifically asked for a huge flag to be flown, “so large, that the British would have no difficulty seeing it from a distance,” if the victory was ours. Key strained to see through the smoke, if the flag was still there.\n\nHe later described his feelings of exquisite gratitude, as he looked across the bay, through the clouds of war. He said, “In that hour of deliverance, and joyful triumph, my heart ‘spoke.’ Such defenders and a country deserve a song.”\n\nHe scribbled the first words of this song, (it was never meant to be just a poem) on a piece of paper, and finished it later, back on shore.\n\nHe showed it to a relative by marriage, Judge Nicholson, who was most impressed with it, and took it to a newspaper, “Baltimore America.” They began to distribute it around Baltimore, making poster-sized copies of it. Each man serving at Fort McHenry gratefully received a copy. Everyone who got it was excited to share it with others.\n\nThe immortal words were put to the music of John Stafford Smith’s “To Anacreas in Heaven,” and thus we have our national anthem.\n\nFrancis Scott Key remained most humble about this great gift. He said, “Let the praise, if any be due, be given not to me. God is the inspirer of that song; and the men who died for the freedoms of this country were the ones who deserve the credit.”\n\nWe all have a destiny to perform, and we were created for higher purposes than we can now even imagine. May we zealously seek for civil ways to love and serve our country.\n\nHappy Birthday, with gratitude to all who have served our nation and its people, in any way.\n\nBebe Green is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Mid-Valley Interfaith Council.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/07/01/national-anthem-star-spangled-banner/86592372/", "title": "Oh say, how much do you know about the national anthem?", "text": "David Jesse\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nYou've heard Carl Lewis butcher it. You've heard Whitney Houston magnify it. And if you watch a baseball game this weekend or listen to a marching band in a Fourth of July parade, you're apt to hear it.\n\nBut how much do you really know about \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and its history?\n\nMark Clague, associate professor of musicology at the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance, is pretty sure you don't know as much as you might think.\n\nThat's why Clague — the founding board chairman of the Star Spangled Music Foundation and editor and producer of the \"Star Spangled Songbook\" and its associated recording project \"Poets & Patriots: A Tuneful History of 'The Star-Spangled Banner.'\" — has compiled a list of common misconceptions about the song.\n\nHere's eight of them. Click on the myth number for more detail.\n\nMyth No. 1: Francis Scott Key was held prisoner aboard a British ship during the bombardment of Baltimore when he penned what would become our nation's national anthem. Reality: Key was aboard his own American truce ship during the battle.\n\nMyth No. 2 : Key drafted \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" on the back of an envelope or letter. Reality: Most likely, Key wrote his draft on a clean sheet of paper using pen and ink.\n\nMyth No. 3 : Key wrote a \"poem\" later set to music by someone else. Reality: \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was always conceived of by Key as a song, and he wrote his \"lyric\" to fit a specific melody of his own choosing.\n\nMyth No. 4 : Key's \"Banner\" is based on the melody of a bawdy old English drinking song. Reality: \"The Anacreontic Song\" was the constitutional anthem of an elite, London-based, amateur music society.\n\nMyth No. 5 : \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as baseball's game day ritual begins with Babe Ruth and the 1918 World Series. Reality: The earliest documented performance in pro sports was on opening day at a baseball game in 1862.\n\nMyth No. 6 : A 1931 act of Congress made \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" the official anthem of the U.S. Reality: This is absolutely correct in terms of the anthem's legal status, but the bill approved by the House and Senate and signed by President Herbert Hoover simply recognized what had been true in American cultural practice for decades.\n\nMyth No. 7 : There is a sanctioned traditional or otherwise official version of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Reality: The 1931 act making Key's song America's anthem does not identify an official arrangement, in part because the song as sung in the 20th Century had already departed from what Key had known. During World War I, attempts were made to codify the arrangement, resulting in both a military \"service version\" and a \"standardized version\" endorsed by the Department of Education.\n\nMyth No. 8 : A mug shot offers proof of composer Igor Stravinsky's arrest by the Boston Police for desecrating a national symbol after conducting a performance of his own arrangement of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" with the Boston Symphony. Reality: The well-known image is not associated with an arrest at all, but it is true that Stravinsky's anthem was controversial. The supposed mug shot is actually part of Stravinsky's 1940 visa application for residence in the U.S.\n\nClague began studying the song as part of a class on musical history he taught at U-M. He was using the performance of the anthem by Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock to teach his students about the song's meaning and what the artist was trying to communicate. That led him to do more research on the anthem.\n\n\"This song really becomes a statement about what it means to be an American,\" he told the Free Press. \"All of us have some sort of relationship with that song. It has a resonance that cuts across demographics.\"\n\nIt was common in the 19th Century to rewrite lyrics to songs — there are more than 100 sets of lyrics around this song, including an 1844 abolitionist version written in Michigan.\n\nAs for the enduring popularity of Key's version? That came from the timing and his words.\n\n\"Key caught the right moment,\" Clague said. \"The War of 1812 was seen as a second American Revolution. National pride was weak. Victory over the British led to an infusion of patriotism. Key's lyrics are also somewhat abstract. There's no reference to Ft. McHenry or even to himself. He uses the word \"you\" to place you there.\n\n\"It used to be played much faster. It was a party song — a victory song. Now it's the sacred hymn of our country.\"\n\nContact David Jesse: 313-222-8851 or djesse@freepress.com.

Lawyer Francis Scott Key peered through thick smoke and rain to see the resolute American flag waving above Fort McHenry along the Baltimore Harbor. The Americans had won, inspiring Key to write the lyrics to the song that eventually became the national anthem.\n\nBaltimore is celebrating Key— and his song — with a multitude of events aimed at exposing visitors to important American history. And city travel experts expect the crowds to turn out. \"We expect a Super Bowl-esque kind of crowd,\" says Tom Noonan, president and CEO of Visit Baltimore.\n\nPlan a weekend in Charm City exploring these historic highlights:\n\nStart your journey through American flag history at the Star-Spangled Banner Flag House museum, which showcases how the original banner was sewn and then unveiled to the public. Visitors can admire a magnificent replica of the original 30-foot-by-42-foot flag. The new permanent exhibit, \"Family of Flagmakers: The Women Who Created the Star-Spangled Banner,\" focuses on the life of Mary Pickersgill, the maker of the grand flag.\n\nThen step back in time with a visit to Pickersgill's house, which is part of the museum. You can see where the flag-maker actually lived and sewed the iconic flag. Touch a piece of its original material (British wool bunting that would have been very expensive at the time), and view interesting period pieces such as wooden nutcrackers and a toilet that doubled as a nightstand.\n\nAcross the street from the Flag House sits the popular Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture. The \"For Whom It Stands\" exhibit showcases Grace Wisher, an African-American indentured servant who helped sew the original Star-Spangled Banner in 1812 alongside Mary Pickersgill.\n\nAlso on display are photographs of Americans from all generations and ethnic groups holding the American flag. \"I gave them the flag and they decided what to do with it because every generation has a different perspective of the American flag,\" says Sheila Pree Bright, artist in residency.\n\nSports fans should pay a visit to Babe Ruth's boyhood home-turned-museum, which has linked its sports theme to the banner's bicentennial with the exhibit, \"'O' Say Can You See: The Star-Spangled Banner in Sports.\"\n\n\"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was first sung at a baseball game in 1918 in Chicago, during Game One of the World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs. Fast forward to present-day Baltimore, a city that pays tribute to its Major League Baseball Orioles by singing the anthem with an emphasized \"O!\" Visitors can view a short film depicting a composite of the song pulled from dozens of renditions dating from the 1930s to the present.\n\nAfterwards, head to the Maryland Historical Society and view the original manuscript of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" poem showcased in a protective case.

Housed in a chamber that keeps oxygen and lighting very low and temperature and humidity constant, it should last for generations more.\n\nAnd lest we be too harsh on our forebears, Jones credits the revolutionary-era tradition of souvenir-keeping for maintaining the flag's value, which \"probably led to its ability to survive 200 years.\"\n\nWith Maryland celebrating its Defenders' Day on Friday and America's victory over the British 200 years ago Sunday, at least two families recently inquired whether their fragments might have historical value.\n\nMuseum conservators are using microscopes, x-rays and other equipment to analyze their weaves, stains and soils to see if they match. Family histories and documents also help prove provenance.\n\nSince the flag came to the Smithsonian in 1907, about 17 pieces have been donated or bought at auction. The museum last acquired pieces in 2003 but has no plans to try to recover them all or reattach them to the original flag.\n\nIt's difficult to determine exactly where each piece came from, and the Smithsonian wants to lend pieces to other museums.\n\nBut some are more valuable than others. The 15th cotton star was cut away sometime before 1873, and remains missing.\n\n\"We'd love to have that back,\" said the flag's chief conservator Suzanne Thomassen-Krauss. \"That one I might put back on.\"\n\nKey's poem propagated a misunderstanding that persists today, by suggesting that the garrison flag had withstood British cannon fire. In fact, soldiers hoisted the huge American flag at dawn as the British fleet retreated, replacing a smaller storm flag that had flown during the bombardment. The garrison flag flew at the fort for another year or so, until it was acquired by Fort McHenry's commander, Lt. Col. George Armistead.\n\nThe first documented clipping was taken in 1818 at the request of a widow, to be buried with her husband who fought at the battle.\n\nThe Star-Spangled Banner was passed down through Armistead's family and protected through the Civil War. In 1873, his daughter Georgiana Armistead Appleton lent it to historian George Preble for a lecture series across New England.\n\nHistorians believe Preble made many clippings for friends, patriotic citizens and his own family.\n\nSome pieces turned up in Minnesota, where another Armistead daughter settled. Another piece was placed in a keystone for the Francis Scott Key Memorial in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Historical societies have donated fragments to the Smithsonian, and the U.S. Naval Academy sent a thumb-size piece in a gold frame.\n\n\"We suspect there are more fragments that have just lost their history,\" Thomassen-Krauss said. \"People see them, but they don't know what they are.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/02/25/gop-bill-would-require-anthem-before-sports-events-some-wisconsin-venues/6813931002/", "title": "Republican bill would require 'The Star-Spangled Banner' before all ...", "text": "STEVENS POINT – Any taxpayer-funded venue in Wisconsin would be required to play the national anthem before all sporting events under a new bill from Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe bill, from Sen.

It carries no penalties for venues that do not comply.\n\n\"Some will tell you that our country is broken, and that our traditions no longer have purpose,\" Testin said in a statement. \"I disagree. American symbols like the flag and our national anthem have the power to unite. They remind us that despite our differences, we share a common bond.\"\n\nA statement from Testin's office indicates Wisconsin veterans groups support the bill.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin, Testin said the bill is written broadly and doesn't specifically target professional, college or youth sports. The bill doesn't mandate player or spectator participation in the anthem. He said he's open to adjustments on the bill's language.\n\nThe legislation comes in response to the decision by billionaire Mark Cuban to not play \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" during Dallas Mavericks games earlier this month.

He cited the Legislature's COVID-19 relief and unemployment insurance reform bills that Gov. Tony Evers vetoed. Evers vetoed the package for a number of reasons, including that it limited the power of local health officials to respond to COVID-19 and gave lawmakers a say in how federal coronavirus aid is spent.\n\nJohnson said she thinks the proposed anthem legislation is disrespectful given that the controversy surrounding \"The Star Spangled Banner\" at sporting events in recent years stems from athletes of color kneeling during the song as a way to protest societal and racial injustices.\n\nTestin said he believes the bill is anything but that. With the 20th anniversary of 9/11 approaching, he said he hopes the nation's flag and anthem can evoke the sense of unity it had the years after the terrorist attacks.\n\n\"I would contend that these aren't minimizing those efforts.

In fact, the federal government still uses its former name, according to the Department of State.\n\nThere's a lot to know about the first president from his successful liquor distiller business to only being a scholar in name because he never attended college.\n\nBut he's not the only U.S. president with information many are unaware of. Here are some lesser-known fun and interesting facts about U.S. presidents.\n\n'National treasure':FBI searching for stolen 200-year old George Washington painting\n\nJohn Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on July 4\n\nSecond president John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the third president, died just within hours of each other.\n\nWhat made the coincidence even more odd was that the two died on July 4, 1826, just 50 years after the original American Independence Day.\n\nJames Madison was the shortest president\n\nBefore there were \"short kings\" there was James Madison. America's fourth president was also the shortest standing at 5’4” and weighing just over 100 pounds.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams went skinny-dipping daily\n\nSixth president John Quincy Adams used to go skinny-dipping in the Potomac River. The activity was part of his morning routine for years.\n\nMartin Van Buren was the first president born in the US\n\nUnlike Washington, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president, was the first president to be born in the U.S. The previous seven were born as Britain subjects.\n\nJohn Tyler was a father to 15 children\n\nJohn Tyler not only ran a country but a village. The 10th president fathered 15 children, more than any other. From 1815 to 1860 he welcomed eight sons and seven daughters before his death in 1862.\n\nAbraham Lincoln may have had Marfan Syndrome\n\nSixteenth president Abraham Lincoln was considered to be the tallest president. His 6'4 height could be explained by him possibly having Marfan Syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue from the fibers that support organs to other body structures.\n\nAndrew Johnson befriended mice at the White House\n\nThe rumors that Andrew Johnson did not officially have any pets isn't entirely true. The 17th president apparently befriended a family of white mice during his impeachment.\n\nJohnson was also the first president to ever be impeached when the House of Representatives voted to do so after he removed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton from the cabinet, breaching the Tenure of Office Act. The Senate acquitted in a 35-19 vote - just one vote short of the two-thirds required to convict him.\n\nBenjamin Harrison was afraid of touching light switches\n\nPresident Benjamin Harrison was the first president to live in an electrified White House. The 23rd president and his wife Caroline Harrison both refused to touch light switches out of fear of an electric shock as electricity was very new in the U.S. at the time.\n\nWhite House staff took on the extra task of turning on and off light switches to avoid taking any chances of electrocution.\n\nPresidents Day:Promotions include sandwich, food and drink specials\n\nWilliam McKinley was on discontinued $500 bill\n\nWilliam McKinley, the 25th president, had his face and likeness featured on the $500 bill.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury discontinued the bill in 1969. The bill is now worth more than just $500, with some collectors willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars under the right conditions.\n\nRacoons lived at the White House during Calvin Coolidge's term\n\nIt was quite common to find raccoons around the White House when Calvin Coolidge lived there. The 30th president grew up surrounded by wildlife when he lived on a secluded farm in Plymouth Notch, Vermont and he took his affinity for raccoons when he moved to the Oval Office.\n\nIn November 1926, a \"cohort of well-intentioned admirers\" shipped him a live racoon to roast for Thanksgiving dinner. The Coolidge family refused to eat their friend and a few weeks later the racoon appeared for Christmas in a red ribbon along with the title \"Rebecca Raccoon of the White House.\"\n\nAccording to a book on Calvin Coolidge, Rebecca even had a presidential diet during his tenure where she ate chicken, eggs, persimmons, green shrimp and cream. She even made public appearances at summer parties and Easter egg rolls.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was a movie buff\n\nBecoming president doesn't mean the end of having hobbies. In addition to being the only president to ever serve more than two terms, Franklin D. Roosevelt was known for his love of cinema. The 32nd president found movies to be an escape from the responsibilities of being president during the Great Depression and World War II.\n\n\"He especially liked comedies, particularly the work of the 1930s and 1940s comedy team Abbott and Costello. He even invited them to perform at the White House several times while he was President,\" the FRD Library and Museum website reads.\n\nGerald Ford used to be a model before president\n\nThere's no denying that appearances often matter for voters in presidential elections. It might have helped that Gerald Ford, the 38th president, had some modeling experience before his term.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1941, Ford earned extra cash as a model. After joining the Navy in 1942, he even appeared on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine in his uniform, though he never received official credit.

But with just two years left until the 250th anniversary of our independence, it’s important to look at how our nation’s birthday has evolved and how the White House’s role on this holiday has contributed to our national identity.\n\nWe should begin by remembering how audacious it was for revolutionaries to break away from their mother country – and to pledge “our lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor” to one another.\n\n“That was more than rhetoric,” President Ronald Reagan reminded Americans on July 4, 1986, with the Statue of Liberty in the background. “Each of those men knew the penalty for high treason to the crown.”\n\nIf our second president, John Adams, had his way, we’d celebrate on July 2 – the day in 1776 that the Continental Congress in Philadelphia officially declared freedom from Great Britain. But the Declaration of Independence wasn’t signed for two more days, and it was Adams’ successor, Thomas Jefferson, who began the tradition of observing the Fourth of July at the White House in 1801.\n\nThe early Fourth of July celebrations at the White House\n\nOn that day, President Jefferson opened the White House to diplomats, civil and military officers, citizens and Cherokee chiefs in what was known as the Oval Saloon (today’s Blue Room). The Marine Band played in the Entrance Hall, and a festival on the north grounds featured horse races and parades, along with cakes, wine and punch for the revelers.\n\nThe celebration on July 4, 1803, featured a history-making reveal, when Jefferson stood on the front steps to announce news of the Louisiana Purchase, which had just reached the White House.\n\nAs annual receptions and other commemorations became customary, the national symbolism of Independence Day grew stronger in 1826, when Adams and Jefferson both died on July 4 – exactly 50 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFive years later, James Monroe, the last Founding Father to become president, also died on July 4.\n\nTest your knowledge about Camp David:Pop quiz: Where do presidents vacation and hold historic events?\n\nFireworks were sometimes part of these early July Fourth celebrations, including a tragedy in 1845, when they discharged into a crowd assembled along the south wall of the White House, killing a local carpenter.\n\nOn July 4, 1848, President James Polk witnessed the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument. (Future President Abraham Lincoln was also in attendance.)\n\nLincoln's last Fourth of July was historic\n\nSome of the most important and resonant days of the Civil War came on July 4, with the president and the White House at the center.\n\nOn Lincoln’s first July 4 as president, just a few months after the war began in 1861, he reviewed New York militia regiments marching on the White House lawn, raised an American flag at the Treasury Department, and addressed Congress to call for more troops and war funding.\n\nAfter the Union won a decisive victory at Gettysburg on the day before July 4, 1863, Lincoln harkened back to America’s Independence Day, citing its writing “four score and seven years ago” when he visited the battlefield that November to deliver his iconic Gettysburg Address.\n\nThe following July 4 – the last of Lincoln’s life – the president opened the White House South Grounds to picnickers from Black schools, churches and religious groups, moving the nation one symbolic step closer to fulfilling the promises made on the first Fourth of July.\n\nBecoming a federal holiday\n\nIt wasn’t until 1870 that Independence Day was made an official federal holiday. On our nation’s 100th birthday in 1876, President Ulysses Grant and first lady Julia Grant greeted guests and opened a centennial exposition in Philadelphia by starting up a newfangled Corliss steam engine that powered most of the exhibits.\n\nPresidents sometimes used Independence Day to get away from the office and the heat. President Andrew Jackson went home to the Hermitage, Presidents Polk and Grant vacationed in New Jersey, while Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft escaped to “summer White House” locations farther north. President Woodrow Wilson returned to Gettysburg on the battle’s 50th anniversary.\n\nPresidential diplomacy:White House state dinners put America on display. They're crucial for US diplomacy.\n\nCalvin Coolidge – the only U.S. president born on July 4 – traveled to Philadelphia to celebrate the 150th anniversary of our founding.\n\n“Amid all the clash of conflicting interests, amid all the welter of partisan politics,” he said, “every American can turn for solace and consolation to the Declaration of Independence.”\n\nAmerica celebrates 200 years of independence with Queen Elizabeth\n\nPresident Harry Truman marked the 175th with an address at the Washington Monument, saying, “The ideas on which our government is founded ‒ the ideas of equality, of God-given rights, of self-government ‒ are still revolutionary.”\n\nBy 1976, the celebration of the 200th anniversary of American independence became more elaborate. President Gerald Ford spent the day shuttling to Valley Forge, to Philadelphia’s Independence Hall and to the New York Harbor to ring a bicentennial bell on the flight deck of the USS Forrestal – ending the night at the White House, watching fireworks over the National Mall with first lady Betty Ford from the Truman Balcony.\n\nThe Fords also invited a special guest ‒ Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, who appeared on the Truman Balcony three days later with President Ford to greet 7,000 guests on the White House lawn. A state dinner was held in her honor (in a tent in the Rose Garden), broadcast live on public television, and featured a Julia Child interview with White House Executive Chef Henry Haller as he made Maryland vegetables and Georgia peach custard.\n\nWhere past and present coexist:White House furniture is America's living history\n\nJuly 4 'unleashed not merely a revolution against the British'\n\nDuring recent Independence Days, the White House South Lawn has been opened to staff, military families and special guests for barbecue, ice cream and a seat on the grass to watch the fireworks burst over the National Mall.\n\nAs we approach our nation’s 250th birthday, we’ll have many opportunities to look beyond the bands and fireworks to consider that day in Philadelphia that changed world history.\n\nAs President John Kennedy said on Independence Day 1962, the Declaration of Independence \"unleashed not merely a revolution against the British, but a revolution in human affairs.”\n\nJuly 4 is not just a day to celebrate our ideals and the people who envisioned them. It’s also a time to honor the generations who came after our Founders, to fulfill these promises and renew our nation. That’s why a number of presidents have marked the holiday by attending naturalization ceremonies where new citizens take their oath of allegiance to the United States.\n\n“From this day forward,” President George W. Bush told new Americans in 2008, “the history of the United States will be part of your heritage. The Fourth of July will be part of your Independence Day.”\n\nHere’s hoping that your July 4 weekend includes rest, relaxation and reflection – on our nation’s history, its promise and the part we can all play in carrying forward the American experiment.\n\nStewart D. McLaurin is president of the White House Historical Association, a private nonprofit, nonpartisan organization founded by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/06/30/words-declaration-independence-still-inspire/86530366/", "title": "Words of Declaration of Independence still inspire", "text": "Robert Evins Pickard\n\nOn July 4, 1826, Americans were celebrating 50 years of independence. At dusk, 91-year-old John Adams spoke his last words, “Jefferson survives.\" He did not know that on that morning, his onetime ally, enemy and friend, Thomas Jefferson, had passed. The fact that two presidents died on the same day pops up on quiz shows occasionally. What is even more astounding is that it was on the day celebrating the document that those two did more than anyone to create.\n\nWhen the gathering of colonial elite known as the “Continental Congress” decided to go for broke and declare independence, one delegate told Jefferson, “When they hang us, I’ll go quickly, because I am very fat. You will dangle for a while.” He was only half-joking. Benjamin Franklin, possibly the most respected man in the world, chaired the committee responsible for writing the declaration; he left it to the committee's younger members, Adams and Jefferson, saying that he did not want his work edited by others. Adams told Jefferson that he must be the author, for three reasons: 1. Having a Virginian author would bring the most populous colony and the rest of the South into the struggle; 2. Jefferson was much better liked than the obnoxious Adams; and 3. Jefferson was a far better writer.\n\nAt a time when equality was not even a pipe dream for slaves, free blacks, Indians, women, religious minorities and non-property owners, Jefferson wrote what historians see as a promise: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among them, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” It is a promise that still inspires us. The black historian John Hope Franklin said, “I thought that they were beautiful words. They reinforced what my parents told me, that no one was better than I was.” When Congress adapted the declaration, Adams presciently wrote his wife Abigail: \"It ought to be celebrated by pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other... .\"\n\nOn July 4, 1863, the United States was at war with itself. President Abraham Lincoln, however, had reason to celebrate: The Union had not only prevailed at Gettysburg the previous day, but Vicksburg had surrendered that day to General Ulysses S. Grant, giving control of the Mississippi to the Union. On Nov. 19, Lincoln dedicated the Gettysburg Battlefield by reminding the country that the founding fathers had created a nation “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal” and called for them to continue the cause for which the dead on this ground had given “their last full measure of devotion” so that “government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth.”\n\nOne hundred years later, on Memorial Day 1963, Vice President Lyndon Johnson told an audience at Gettysburg: “Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation, but not a fact.” A year later, President Johnson pushed through Congress the first of three civil rights acts, fulfilling, more than anyone, Jefferson’s promise.\n\nIn 1946, the U.S. relinquished sovereignty of the Philippines. The Filipinos celebrate their independence on June 12, the day in 1898 when they declared independence from Spain, but they celebrate July 4 as Filipino-American Friendship Day. Others have been inspired as well: When Ho Chi Minh, a former resident and admirer of the United States, wrote Vietnam’s declaration of independence from France in 1946, he quoted Jefferson’s words. Ironically, he would face a long struggle against both France and the U.S. “Born on the Fourth of July” is a line from a song by George M. Cohan, as well as the name of a movie by Oliver Stone. Louis Armstrong claimed to be born on the Fourth of July, 1900; he wasn’t, but he might as well have been. Willie Nelson’s Fourth of July picnic in Texas is an annual event.\n\nJefferson’s promise has inspired many over the years. In view of recent events, it is now time, more than ever, for our national leaders to rededicate themselves to his promise.\n\nRobert Evins Pickard, MA, MPA, is an adjunct professor of U.S. and world history at Nashville State Community College.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/green-sheet/2017/07/04/day-history-july-4/438873001/", "title": "This day in history — July 4", "text": "Associated Press\n\nToday’s highlight in history\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence was adopted by delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia.\n\nOn this date\n\nIn 1802, the United States Military Academy officially opened at West Point, N.Y.\n\nIn 1826, 50 years to the day after the Declaration of Independence was adopted, former presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died.

Adams moved into the White House in late 1800.\n\n(Adams, by the way, initially believed Independence Day celebrations would be on July 2, the day the Continental Congress approved a resolution of independence. Over the years, however, Americans began to celebrate July 4, the day the Congress approved the actual document known as the Declaration of Independence.)\n\nIn general, presidents like to meet with large groups of people on July 4. In the early days, they even threw open the doors of the White House to greet members of the public.\n\nThomas Jefferson, the third president and Adams' successor, held the first Fourth of July reception at the Executive Mansion in 1801.\n\nIn more recent times, amid heavy security around the president, White House holiday events are by invitation only.\n\nPresidents also like going to famous places on July 4, Heintze said. Gettysburg, Valley Forge and Philadelphia's Independence Hall (where the Declaration of Independence was signed) have been on holiday presidential schedules.\n\nThe Fourth of July also holds a somber place in presidential history.\n\nAdams and Jefferson both died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Another early president, James Monroe, died on July 4, 1831.\n\nOn a happier note, one president was born on the Fourth of July (Calvin Coolidge in 1872). So was at least one presidential family member: Malia Obama, who turns 16 on Friday.\n\nPresidents have often used the holiday as a call for renewal of the nation's heritage.\n\nAs the nation faced Civil War on July 4, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called an extraordinary session of Congress to discuss the crisis and urge national unity.\n\nEighty years later, with Nazi Germany in control of Western Europe and imperial Japan threatening the Pacific, President Franklin Roosevelt delivered a somber address from his home in Hyde Park, N.Y., on July 4, 1941.\n\nThe United States broke from Great Britain to fight for its freedom, Roosevelt said, but \"the fundamentals of 1776 are being struck down abroad and definitely they are threatened here.\"\n\nLittle more than five months later, the United States plunged into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nObama's predecessor, George W. Bush, often discussed the war on terrorism during July 4 events that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. On his last Fourth of July as president, in 2008, Bush became the fourth president to visit Jefferson's home at Monticello, Va., where he presided over naturalization ceremonies.\n\nObama, swearing in immigrant service members in 2012, called it \"a perfect way to celebrate America's birthday — the world's oldest democracy, with some of our newest citizens.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html", "title": "Fact check: A look at Biden's first year in false claims | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nWhen President Joe Biden passingly said in a voting rights speech last week that he had been “arrested” in the context of the civil rights movement – even suggesting this had happened more than once – it was a classic Biden false claim: an anecdote about his past for which there is no evidence, prompted by a decision to ad-lib rather than stick to a prepared text, resulting in easily avoidable questions about his honesty.\n\nBiden’s imaginary or embellished stories about his own history were the most memorable falsehoods of his first year in office. They were not, however, the only ones.\n\nThe President also made multiple false claims about important policy matters, notably including three subjects that occupied much of his time: the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnd Biden was incorrect on numerous occasions when ad-libbing about a wide assortment of facts and figures – sometimes in a way that appeared inadvertent, but other times in a way that helped him make a political point.\n\nUnlike his uniquely dishonest predecessor, Biden did not bury fact-checkers in a daily avalanche of serial falseness. Biden never came close to making a dozen false claims in a single speech, let alone five dozen false claims in one address, as Trump once did. In fact, the total number of Biden false claims so far is in the dozens, while Trump delivered well over 1,000 total false claims in his own first year and more than 3,000 the next year.\n\nSo Biden is no Trump. With that said, dozens of false claims from the President of the United States is not nothing. And considering that Biden added dozens more claims that were misleading or lacking in important context, he provided more than enough material to keep fact-checkers on their toes.\n\nHere is a roundup of Biden’s first year in inaccuracy. The White House declined to comment for this article; it has previously commented for individual fact checks on some of the false claims we are discussing again below.\n\nFalse claims about his own past\n\nBiden made a series of claims about his own past that were just not true. It was these easy-to-understand, hard-to-defend personal falsehoods – more than his false claims about complex policy issues or obscure statistics, which supporters could more easily dismiss as good-faith errors – that provided the best ammunition for opponents looking to portray him as deceptive.\n\nAnd like some of Trump’s tall tales about his past, Biden’s tended to be peripheral to his message. In other words, he was hurting his reputation for little possible gain.\n\nWhile talking in November to technical college students standing near a truck, Biden claimed, “I used to drive a tractor-trailer,” though only for “part of a summer.” This was similar to something he had said at a Mack Trucks facility in July, when he claimed, “I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man,” adding, “I got to.” There is no evidence Biden ever drove a big truck; the White House previously noted to CNN that he once had a job driving a school bus (which is not an 18-wheeler or a tractor-trailer) and that, as a senator in 1973, he spent a night riding in a cargo truck (not driving it).\n\nBiden repeatedly told a story about a supposed conversation during his vice presidency with an old friend, an Amtrak train conductor, that could not possibly have happened because the man was dead at the time. He repeatedly boasted that he had traveled “17,000 miles” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though that number is not even close to correct.\n\nBiden distracted from his voting rights message with the baseless claim last week, which he had made before, about having been arrested during a civil rights protest; in some of the previous versions of the story, he had merely claimed a police officer had taken him home from a protest. (There is evidence Biden participated in some civil rights activities in his youth but no record of any arrest.)\n\nAnd Biden told two different inaccurate stories while trying to emphasize his connection to the Jewish community.\n\nAt a September event in honor of the High Holy Days, Biden told Jewish leaders that he remembered “spending time at” and “going to” Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, the site of an antisemitic massacre in 2018; he had spoken by phone to the synagogue’s rabbi in 2019 but never went. At a Hanukkah event in December, Biden claimed that late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir had invited him to meet with her during the Six-Day War of 1967 (he actually met with her weeks before the Yom Kippur War six years later) and, more significantly, that she had wanted him to be “the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.”\n\nThere is zero evidence Meir ever wanted to use a 30-year-old rookie US senator as a “liaison” with a major adversary.\n\nFalse claims about Afghanistan\n\nBiden was bedeviled over the summer by his chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. And he made a variety of false claims as he tried to defend his handling of the situation – further undermining his authority on an issue on which he was already struggling to persuade the public.\n\nIn August, the President said, “What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point, with al Qaeda gone?” Al Qaeda had been degraded in Afghanistan, but it wasn’t “gone” – as a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged on camera that same day. In an interview that week, Biden defended the US withdrawal in part by claiming that the concept of nation-building in Afghanistan “never made any sense to me” – though, in fact, he had explicitly advocated nation-building in the early years of the war, both in Afghanistan and more broadly.\n\nIn July, when Biden was under pressure to quickly relocate Afghans who had assisted US troops, he said “the law doesn’t allow” Afghan translators to come to the US to await the processing of their visa applications. But experts in immigration law immediately said this wasn’t true, given the administration’s authority to grant “parole,” and, indeed, the Biden administration ended up using parole later in the summer to do what Biden had claimed wasn’t permitted.\n\nIn December, Biden said in another interview that “I’ve been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning.” While he eventually grew opposed to the war, he was not against it from the start – as fact-checkers pointed out when he had made similar remarks during his presidential campaign.\n\nFalse claims about the economy\n\nThe state of the economy was a key rhetorical battleground between Biden and his critics: He argued it was thriving; they argued it was failing. And although both sides often cited valid data points, the President also made some false claims to bolster his case.\n\nBiden occasionally overstated progress and understated problems. Asked at a CNN town hall in July about inflation in automobile prices, he claimed that the cost of a car was “kind of back to what it was before the pandemic”; the cost had actually increased substantially since late 2019 and early 2020. In an economic speech in November, he greatly exaggerated the extent of the decline in the unemployment rate during his tenure.\n\nTo try to sell his economic policies, Biden sometimes made inaccurate statements about what experts had said about them. In May alone, he falsely claimed that there was a consensus among economists about how many jobs his American Jobs Plan would create, significantly overstated how many jobs the firm Moody’s Analytics in particular predicted the plan would create and falsely claimed that the last five leaders of the Federal Reserve had said the plan would produce economic growth – wrongly describing both the contents and the authorship of an article that was actually written by five former Internal Revenue Service chiefs.\n\nLater in the year, Biden misleadingly framed another Moody’s jobs estimate. And he repeatedly omitted the key phrase “longer-term” from an assertion by Nobel-winning economists that his $1.9 trillion Build Back Better agenda would “ease longer-term inflationary pressures” – leaving Americans to believe that these economists might have said his agenda would reduce the inflation hurting their bank accounts today.\n\nFalse claims about the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nMany of Biden’s first-year speeches were devoted to the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden was almost incomparably more accurate on this subject than Trump was, tending to factually convey the severity of the situation rather than match his predecessor’s fantastical rhetoric about how bad numbers were not actually bad numbers and how the virus would just disappear.\n\nBut Biden made a smattering of false claims on this topic, too.\n\nAt the CNN town hall in July, Biden made the inaccurate categorical promise that “you’re not going to get Covid” if you’re vaccinated. It was clear even before the emergence of the Omicron variant that vaccinated people were still getting infected with the virus, though the vaccines made them much less likely to get seriously ill; vaccinated people on the President’s own staff had been infected. Biden also went too far at the town hall when he categorically pledged that “if you’re vaccinated, you’re not going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in the ICU unit and you’re not going to die”; these outcomes happen, too, though they are much less common among vaccinated people.\n\nBiden sometimes exaggerated on the subject of his administration’s work to get Americans vaccinated – misleadingly playing down the Trump administration’s own vaccine purchases and, in May, overstating how the US vaccination rate compared with those of the rest of the world. And he made various errors in discussing pandemic-related facts and figures.\n\nIn February, Biden claimed that “suicides are up” amid the pandemic; experts said at the time that the claim was premature, and it turned out to be wrong (though suicide rates did increase for some specific demographic groups). In October, the President wrongly told Americans that there were “over 800,000” vaccination sites in the country; he had added an extra 0 to the correct figure he usually used, 80,000.\n\nFalse claims in unscripted settings\n\nWhen Biden stuck to prepared speeches vetted by his staff, he tended to be factual (though certainly wasn’t perfect). When he ad-libbed or participated in unscripted exchanges with journalists and citizens, he was more likely to sprinkle in inaccuracies – making false or misleading claims about everything from his handling of the situation at the southern border to Virginia political history to gun laws to the size of a tax break for people who own racehorses.\n\nDuring Biden’s first 100 days in the Oval Office, he was repeatedly incorrect or misleading in describing the actions of the Trump administration.\n\nAnd he made one particularly notable misleading claim during that early period. At a heated moment of the national debate over Georgia Republicans’ new elections law, Biden did a television interview in which he criticized the law in part by misstating what it says.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/07/04/ny-state-mind-going-presidential-brief-history/86669298/", "title": "NY State of Mind going presidential: A brief history", "text": "Richard Liebson\n\nrliebson@lohud.com\n\nAfter 12 consecutive U.S. presidents from somewhere else, this year the Empire State strikes back. Whether it’s Queens native Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, who now hails from Chappaqua, the next occupant of the White House undoubtedly will bring some New York style, swagger, smarts and strangeness to the highest office in the land.\n\nThere have been six commanders-in-chief who called New York home. Not all did big things or are even remembered. Some are considered giants, and others got their share of Bronx cheers. Not one of them, as you’ll see, was boring.\n\n‘Old Kinderhook’\n\nOK, let’s start with the first American president. No, it wasn’t George Washington. Washington may have been the father of our country, but he and all of the founding fathers were born in British colonies and considered themselves Englishmen. Technically, there was no United States of America until the Continental Congress said there was in the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence. So that makes Martin Van Buren, who was born in 1782 in New York state, the first U.S.-born president.\n\nVan Buren, a Democrat who served as the nation’s eighth president from 1837 to 1841, was one of nine chief executives who never went to college. He quit school at age 14, but still managed to pass the bar and become a lawyer when he was 23. While his presidency is largely overlooked and forgotten, Van Buren’s legacy remains a constant even today. Van Buren frequently and affectionately referred to his upstate hometown as “Old Kinderhook.” His political cronies used the phrase as his nickname, and helped popularize the abbreviated version: “OK.”\n\nMemorable quote: “As to the presidency, the two happiest days of my life were those of my entry upon the office and the day of my surrender of it.”\n\nThe book-loving, firefighting, home improver\n\nWhen the Library of Congress caught fire on Dec. 24, 1851, President Millard Fillmore raced over and helped put it out. Fillmore, born in a log cabin in the Finger Lakes village of Summerhill, served as the 13th president from 1850 to 1853, completing the term of Zachary Taylor, who died after a year in office. A member of the Whig Party, Fillmore was the last president not to be a Democrat or Republican. Although he had little formal education, Fillmore loved reading and books. Soon after the Library of Congress fire, he signed a funding bill to replace all of the books lost in the blaze. To help improve his vocabulary, Fillmore carried a dictionary at all times. Despite his intellect, when Oxford University wanted to award him an honorary degree, Fillmore turned it down, saying he didn’t have “the literary or scientific attainment.”\n\nFillmore installed the first library in the White House. He also had the mansion fitted with its first bathtub and kitchen stove. When the cook couldn’t figure out how to work the stove, the president went to the U.S. Patent Office, read the patent, and taught the kitchen staff how to use the newfangled contraption.\n\nMemorable quote: “May God save the country, for it is evident that the people will not.”\n\nLiving large\n\nChester A. Arthur was born in Vermont, but grew up in various upstate New York villages before his family settled in Schenectady. As a young abolitionist lawyer, he represented Elizabeth “Lizzie” Jennings Graham, a black woman, in a civil-rights lawsuit that resulted in the desegregation of New York City street cars in 1855 — a century before Rosa Parks more famously refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nArthur, a Republican, served as 21st president from 1881 to 1885, assuming office when James Garfield died two months after being shot by an assassin. “Elegant Arthur,” as he was known, played the banjo, liked to socialize and had a taste for fashion and the good life. He changed his clothes frequently for different occasions and reportedly owned 80 pairs of pants. Upon moving into the Executive Mansion and not finding it to his taste, Arthur had 20 cartloads of furnishings hauled away and hired Louis Comfort Tiffany (yes, that Tiffany) to redecorate. Not exactly an early-to-bed, early-to-rise guy, President Arthur was known to take walks around Washington, D.C., as late as 2 or 3 a.m.\n\nMemorable quote: “I may be president of the United States, but my private life is my own damn business.”\n\nThe ‘Buffalo Hangman’ skipped a term\n\nThe man whose face graces the seldom-seen $1,000 bill is Grover Cleveland, the only president to serve nonconsecutive terms. Born in New Jersey, the future 22nd and 24th president lived in western New York and was elected sheriff of Buffalo in 1870. Not one to leave all the dirty work to his underlings, Cleveland earned his “Buffalo Hangman” moniker by virtue of having personally pulled the gallows lever for at least two executions.\n\nCleveland was elected president in 1884, becoming the first Democrat elected the Oval Office after the Civil War. He dedicated the Statue of Liberty during his first term and had a reputation for answering the White House telephone himself. Despite a 27-year age difference, Cleveland became the only president to marry while in office, tying the knot with the prophetic Frances Folsom, who was 21 at the time. Cleveland lost his 1888 re-election bid to Benjamin Harrison. As Cleveland and his bride were moving out, the young First Lady told the White House staff to “take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now when we come back again.”\n\nSure enough, in 1892, Cleveland defeated Harrison to recapture the presidency.\n\nMemorable quote: “Sometimes I wake at night in the White House and rub my eyes and wonder if it is not all a dream.”\n\nThe force of nature\n\nThe 26th president was the living embodiment of hyperactivity. There’s a photograph of 6-year-old Theodore Roosevelt peering down from the second floor of his New York City home as Abraham Lincoln’s funeral procession passes by. It may be the last time Roosevelt ever stood still. He was, at various times, a lawyer, cowboy, big-game hunter, taxidermist, mountain climber, war hero, author of 38 books, New York City police commissioner, environmentalist and politician. A Republican, Roosevelt served from 1901 to 1909, taking office after the assassination of William McKinley. His smarts, charisma, confidence, drive, boundless energy, optimism and exuberance were the stuff of legend.\n\nIn 1903, Roosevelt’s name was attached to a favorite children’s toy, the Teddy Bear. Three years later, he became the first president to win the Nobel Prize. Roosevelt frequently cajoled cabinet members to join him in long, vigorous hikes, wrestling and boxing matches and “refreshing” nude swims in the icy Potomac River. After losing sight in one eye during a boxing match with a young Army officer, the president decided, at age 50, to retire from the sport and take up jujitsu. The first president to travel outside the United States, Roosevelt visited Panama, where he was largely responsible for the building of the canal.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, he embarked on an African safari that supplied many of the plant and wildlife specimens still on display at the Smithsonian. In 1912, he survived being shot in the chest during an unsuccessful bid to return to the White House as a third-party candidate. Roosevelt was 58 at the outbreak of World War I, and lobbied relentlessly to lead an infantry unit, but was turned down. All four of his sons fought in the war, and his youngest, Quentin, was shot down flying over Germany. Roosevelt remained active politically and physically until his death, in his sleep, in 1919.\n\nMemorable quote: “It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.”\n\nThe favorite son\n\nIn 1887, President Grover Cleveland told a 5-year-old White House visitor, “My little man, I am making a strange wish for you. It is that you may never be president of the United States.” Oh well. Our 32nd president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who led the country through the Great Depression and World War II, was so popular that he was elected four times and served from 1933 until his death in 1945, four months into his fourth term.\n\nHe was born into a wealthy family and raised in Hyde Park, in Dutchess County. Some may be familiar with a photo showing him as a toddler, wearing a ruffled white dress and shoulder-length hair. That’s how boys from rich families were dressed for portraits back then, until about age 5, when they also received their first haircuts. Stricken with polio when he was 39, Roosevelt was paralyzed from the waist down — a fact he hid from the public.\n\nA fifth cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt, FDR married another fifth cousin, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. His presidency was one of many firsts. A Democrat, Roosevelt was the first and will be the last to serve more than two presidential terms — thanks to the limit set by the 22nd Amendment in 1951. He was the first president to have an airplane, the first to appoint a woman to his cabinet and the first to appear on television. Roosevelt was most likely the only president to have a horse tail hanging in his White House bedroom. The tail in question was once attached to Gloucester, a racehorse owned by his father. Despite his background, Roosevelt had the common touch. His “Fireside Chats” on the radio endeared him to the nation. He liked playing poker, loved dogs and once served hot dogs to the King and Queen of England.\n\nMemorable quote: “Whenever you are asked if you can do a job, tell ‘em, ‘Certainly I can!’ Then get busy and find out how to do it.”\n\nTwitter: @RichLiebson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/07/18/fact-check-claims-leaders-deaths-vaccines-false/7931318002/", "title": "Fact check: Claims on leaders' deaths, vaccines are false", "text": "The claim: Leaders of countries died unexpectedly after refusing to accept COVID-19 vaccines\n\nSocial media posts link the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and the \"unexpected deaths\" of other countries' leaders to their opposition to COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nSeveral posts mention Haiti, Burundi and Tanzania's presidents, and others suggest the fates of other countries' leaders are tied as well.\n\nOne now-deleted Instagram post pulled the Ivory Coast and Eswatini into the theory with Haiti, Tanzania and Burundi.

Though four countries hesitated initially, all but Madagascar and Burundi have accepted vaccines. And two presidents – those of Haiti and Tanzania – died after declining COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nFour countries initially declined vaccines, three now accept them\n\nAs some of the posts claim, Tanzania, Burundi, Madagascar and Haiti all “refused” the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nHealth Minister Dorothy Gwajima said in February that Tanzania had “no plans in place to accept COVID-19 vaccines” because it was “not yet satisfied that those vaccines have been clinically proven safe,” according to The Lancet, a medical journal.\n\nBurundi’s health minister, Thaddee Ndikumana, said in February that “vaccines are not yet necessary” and that prevention was more important.\n\nMadagascar initially declined to participate in the COVAX initiative, a program supported by the World Health Organization that provides the world’s poorest countries with free shots.\n\nHaiti refused a shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines from COVAX, citing concern about side effects, according to the New Humanitarian. Haitian Ministry of Health Director Laure Adrien told Bloomberg the country asked that a different vaccine be sent.\n\n“Haiti did not reject the offer of vaccines from COVAX,” Adrien said to the outlet in a telephone interview. “All we asked was that they change the vaccine they were providing us.”\n\nIn the past few months, three of those countries have accepted vaccines.\n\nFact check:Yes, viruses can mutate to become more deadly\n\nHaiti authorized the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in mid-May and said it would accept vaccines from COVAX, according to the Miami Herald. Tanzania requested vaccines in mid-June, also through COVAX, The Wall Street Journal reported. And Madagascar received its first batch of 250,000 AstraZeneca doses from COVAX in May.\n\nIvory Coast, Eswatini, Zambia did not refuse vaccines\n\nVarious social media posts said the leaders of Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire), Eswatini and Zambia died after refusing vaccines. All faced shortages and delays related to vaccines, but there is no evidence the leaders took a stance against COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nThough vaccine administrators faced widespread hesitancy among citizens, Ivory Coast received 504,000 AstraZeneca vaccines in February out of 1,740,000 doses allocated to it by the COVAX program.\n\nEswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) received its first doses in March. The World Health Organization reported the country administered nearly 110% of those 32,000 vaccines, saving the small extra amount of liquid in each vial to provide more doses.\n\nFact check:COVID-19 deaths didn't cause US labor shortage\n\nBloomberg reported in March that Zambia failed to plan for the vaccine rollout. However, there are no reports of an outright refusal, as one post claims. The country received 228,000 doses from the COVAX initiative April 12.\n\nNo evidence presidents’ deaths were tied to vaccination response\n\nThe leaders of Haiti, Burundi, Tanzania, Eswatini and Ivory Coast died unexpectedly in recent months. Some may have died of COVID-19. The presidents of Madagascar and Zambia are still alive.\n\nBurundian President Pierre Nkurunziza died June 8, 2020, after suffering from cardiac arrest – long before vaccines were available for distribution. Nkurunziza was set to step down as president in August, a role he held for 15 years.\n\nTanzania’s president, John Magufuli, died March 17 from heart complications. Moïse, president of Haiti, was assassinated July 7 in his home. The investigation into his killing is ongoing.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Ivory Coast Prime Minister Hamed Bakayoko, who was receiving treatment for cancer, died this year. He was pronounced dead at a German hospital in March.\n\nWhat we know:Florida resident detained as part of Haiti investigation\n\nIn two other cases, the posts wrongly named a former president who died rather than a current leader.\n\nOne post claimed \"Madagascar's president\" Didier Ratsiraka died unexpectedly. Ratsiraka, a former president, was 84 years old when he died March 28, RFI reported.\n\nAnother post suggested a connection between Zambia's delayed vaccine rollout and the death of Kenneth Kaunda in June. Kaunda, 97, had not been in power since his term as the country's first president ended in 1991, the BBC reported.\n\nFact check:Viral meme makes false claim about delta variant\n\nThe BBC reported that no cause of death was given for Eswatini's prime minister, Ambrose Dlamini, but that he had tested positive for the coronavirus four weeks before and had been receiving treatment for it when he died in December 2020.\n\nThere is no evidence to support the assertion that there are “dots\" to be connected between the leaders’ deaths and their countries' vaccine rollouts.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nWe rate FALSE claims that leaders of some countries died unexpectedly after refusing to accept COVID-19 vaccines. The presidents of Tanzania and Haiti died unexpectedly this year and rejected initial vaccine offers, but there is no evidence those two facts are linked. Burundi's president died in June 2020, long before vaccines were available.\n\nOf the other countries listed in various posts – Madagascar, Ivory Coast, Zambia and Eswatini – only Madagascar initially declined COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAnd there's no evidence of any deaths tied to national decisions on the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

A look at White House history", "text": "Stewart D. McLaurin\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nThis Fourth of July week will feature the picnics, parades and fireworks that Americans love. But with just two years left until the 250th anniversary of our independence, it’s important to look at how our nation’s birthday has evolved and how the White House’s role on this holiday has contributed to our national identity.\n\nWe should begin by remembering how audacious it was for revolutionaries to break away from their mother country – and to pledge “our lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor” to one another.\n\n“That was more than rhetoric,” President Ronald Reagan reminded Americans on July 4, 1986, with the Statue of Liberty in the background. “Each of those men knew the penalty for high treason to the crown.”\n\nIf our second president, John Adams, had his way, we’d celebrate on July 2 – the day in 1776 that the Continental Congress in Philadelphia officially declared freedom from Great Britain. But the Declaration of Independence wasn’t signed for two more days, and it was Adams’ successor, Thomas Jefferson, who began the tradition of observing the Fourth of July at the White House in 1801.\n\nThe early Fourth of July celebrations at the White House\n\nOn that day, President Jefferson opened the White House to diplomats, civil and military officers, citizens and Cherokee chiefs in what was known as the Oval Saloon (today’s Blue Room). The Marine Band played in the Entrance Hall, and a festival on the north grounds featured horse races and parades, along with cakes, wine and punch for the revelers.\n\nThe celebration on July 4, 1803, featured a history-making reveal, when Jefferson stood on the front steps to announce news of the Louisiana Purchase, which had just reached the White House.\n\nAs annual receptions and other commemorations became customary, the national symbolism of Independence Day grew stronger in 1826, when Adams and Jefferson both died on July 4 – exactly 50 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nFive years later, James Monroe, the last Founding Father to become president, also died on July 4.\n\nTest your knowledge about Camp David:Pop quiz: Where do presidents vacation and hold historic events?\n\nFireworks were sometimes part of these early July Fourth celebrations, including a tragedy in 1845, when they discharged into a crowd assembled along the south wall of the White House, killing a local carpenter.\n\nOn July 4, 1848, President James Polk witnessed the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument. (Future President Abraham Lincoln was also in attendance.)\n\nLincoln's last Fourth of July was historic\n\nSome of the most important and resonant days of the Civil War came on July 4, with the president and the White House at the center.\n\nOn Lincoln’s first July 4 as president, just a few months after the war began in 1861, he reviewed New York militia regiments marching on the White House lawn, raised an American flag at the Treasury Department, and addressed Congress to call for more troops and war funding.\n\nAfter the Union won a decisive victory at Gettysburg on the day before July 4, 1863, Lincoln harkened back to America’s Independence Day, citing its writing “four score and seven years ago” when he visited the battlefield that November to deliver his iconic Gettysburg Address.\n\nThe following July 4 – the last of Lincoln’s life – the president opened the White House South Grounds to picnickers from Black schools, churches and religious groups, moving the nation one symbolic step closer to fulfilling the promises made on the first Fourth of July.\n\nBecoming a federal holiday\n\nIt wasn’t until 1870 that Independence Day was made an official federal holiday. On our nation’s 100th birthday in 1876, President Ulysses Grant and first lady Julia Grant greeted guests and opened a centennial exposition in Philadelphia by starting up a newfangled Corliss steam engine that powered most of the exhibits.\n\nPresidents sometimes used Independence Day to get away from the office and the heat. President Andrew Jackson went home to the Hermitage, Presidents Polk and Grant vacationed in New Jersey, while Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft escaped to “summer White House” locations farther north. President Woodrow Wilson returned to Gettysburg on the battle’s 50th anniversary.\n\nPresidential diplomacy:White House state dinners put America on display. They're crucial for US diplomacy.\n\nCalvin Coolidge – the only U.S. president born on July 4 – traveled to Philadelphia to celebrate the 150th anniversary of our founding.\n\n“Amid all the clash of conflicting interests, amid all the welter of partisan politics,” he said, “every American can turn for solace and consolation to the Declaration of Independence.”\n\nAmerica celebrates 200 years of independence with Queen Elizabeth\n\nPresident Harry Truman marked the 175th with an address at the Washington Monument, saying, “The ideas on which our government is founded ‒ the ideas of equality, of God-given rights, of self-government ‒ are still revolutionary.”\n\nBy 1976, the celebration of the 200th anniversary of American independence became more elaborate. President Gerald Ford spent the day shuttling to Valley Forge, to Philadelphia’s Independence Hall and to the New York Harbor to ring a bicentennial bell on the flight deck of the USS Forrestal – ending the night at the White House, watching fireworks over the National Mall with first lady Betty Ford from the Truman Balcony.\n\nThe Fords also invited a special guest ‒ Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, who appeared on the Truman Balcony three days later with President Ford to greet 7,000 guests on the White House lawn. A state dinner was held in her honor (in a tent in the Rose Garden), broadcast live on public television, and featured a Julia Child interview with White House Executive Chef Henry Haller as he made Maryland vegetables and Georgia peach custard.\n\nWhere past and present coexist:White House furniture is America's living history\n\nJuly 4 'unleashed not merely a revolution against the British'\n\nDuring recent Independence Days, the White House South Lawn has been opened to staff, military families and special guests for barbecue, ice cream and a seat on the grass to watch the fireworks burst over the National Mall.\n\nAs we approach our nation’s 250th birthday, we’ll have many opportunities to look beyond the bands and fireworks to consider that day in Philadelphia that changed world history.\n\nAs President John Kennedy said on Independence Day 1962, the Declaration of Independence \"unleashed not merely a revolution against the British, but a revolution in human affairs.”\n\nJuly 4 is not just a day to celebrate our ideals and the people who envisioned them. It’s also a time to honor the generations who came after our Founders, to fulfill these promises and renew our nation. That’s why a number of presidents have marked the holiday by attending naturalization ceremonies where new citizens take their oath of allegiance to the United States.\n\n“From this day forward,” President George W. Bush told new Americans in 2008, “the history of the United States will be part of your heritage. The Fourth of July will be part of your Independence Day.”\n\nHere’s hoping that your July 4 weekend includes rest, relaxation and reflection – on our nation’s history, its promise and the part we can all play in carrying forward the American experiment.\n\nStewart D.

It's a day to commemorate the nation's 46 chief executives dating back to the face of the one-dollar bill.\n\nDid you know Presidents Day, a federal holiday, is originally meant to celebrate the first U.S. president George Washington and was just called \"Washington's Birthday\" when established in 1879? In fact, the federal government still uses its former name, according to the Department of State.\n\nThere's a lot to know about the first president from his successful liquor distiller business to only being a scholar in name because he never attended college.\n\nBut he's not the only U.S. president with information many are unaware of. Here are some lesser-known fun and interesting facts about U.S. presidents.\n\n'National treasure':FBI searching for stolen 200-year old George Washington painting\n\nJohn Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died on July 4\n\nSecond president John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the third president, died just within hours of each other.\n\nWhat made the coincidence even more odd was that the two died on July 4, 1826, just 50 years after the original American Independence Day.\n\nJames Madison was the shortest president\n\nBefore there were \"short kings\" there was James Madison. America's fourth president was also the shortest standing at 5’4” and weighing just over 100 pounds.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams went skinny-dipping daily\n\nSixth president John Quincy Adams used to go skinny-dipping in the Potomac River. The activity was part of his morning routine for years.\n\nMartin Van Buren was the first president born in the US\n\nUnlike Washington, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president, was the first president to be born in the U.S. The previous seven were born as Britain subjects.\n\nJohn Tyler was a father to 15 children\n\nJohn Tyler not only ran a country but a village. The 10th president fathered 15 children, more than any other. From 1815 to 1860 he welcomed eight sons and seven daughters before his death in 1862.\n\nAbraham Lincoln may have had Marfan Syndrome\n\nSixteenth president Abraham Lincoln was considered to be the tallest president. His 6'4 height could be explained by him possibly having Marfan Syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue from the fibers that support organs to other body structures.\n\nAndrew Johnson befriended mice at the White House\n\nThe rumors that Andrew Johnson did not officially have any pets isn't entirely true. The 17th president apparently befriended a family of white mice during his impeachment.\n\nJohnson was also the first president to ever be impeached when the House of Representatives voted to do so after he removed Secretary of War Edwin Stanton from the cabinet, breaching the Tenure of Office Act. The Senate acquitted in a 35-19 vote - just one vote short of the two-thirds required to convict him.\n\nBenjamin Harrison was afraid of touching light switches\n\nPresident Benjamin Harrison was the first president to live in an electrified White House. The 23rd president and his wife Caroline Harrison both refused to touch light switches out of fear of an electric shock as electricity was very new in the U.S. at the time.\n\nWhite House staff took on the extra task of turning on and off light switches to avoid taking any chances of electrocution.\n\nPresidents Day:Promotions include sandwich, food and drink specials\n\nWilliam McKinley was on discontinued $500 bill\n\nWilliam McKinley, the 25th president, had his face and likeness featured on the $500 bill.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury discontinued the bill in 1969. The bill is now worth more than just $500, with some collectors willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars under the right conditions.\n\nRacoons lived at the White House during Calvin Coolidge's term\n\nIt was quite common to find raccoons around the White House when Calvin Coolidge lived there. The 30th president grew up surrounded by wildlife when he lived on a secluded farm in Plymouth Notch, Vermont and he took his affinity for raccoons when he moved to the Oval Office.\n\nIn November 1926, a \"cohort of well-intentioned admirers\" shipped him a live racoon to roast for Thanksgiving dinner. The Coolidge family refused to eat their friend and a few weeks later the racoon appeared for Christmas in a red ribbon along with the title \"Rebecca Raccoon of the White House.\"\n\nAccording to a book on Calvin Coolidge, Rebecca even had a presidential diet during his tenure where she ate chicken, eggs, persimmons, green shrimp and cream. She even made public appearances at summer parties and Easter egg rolls.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was a movie buff\n\nBecoming president doesn't mean the end of having hobbies. In addition to being the only president to ever serve more than two terms, Franklin D. Roosevelt was known for his love of cinema. The 32nd president found movies to be an escape from the responsibilities of being president during the Great Depression and World War II.\n\n\"He especially liked comedies, particularly the work of the 1930s and 1940s comedy team Abbott and Costello. He even invited them to perform at the White House several times while he was President,\" the FRD Library and Museum website reads.\n\nGerald Ford used to be a model before president\n\nThere's no denying that appearances often matter for voters in presidential elections. It might have helped that Gerald Ford, the 38th president, had some modeling experience before his term.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1941, Ford earned extra cash as a model. After joining the Navy in 1942, he even appeared on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine in his uniform, though he never received official credit. He eventually served in World War II until its end in 1945.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/07/04/ny-state-mind-going-presidential-brief-history/86669298/", "title": "NY State of Mind going presidential: A brief history", "text": "Richard Liebson\n\nrliebson@lohud.com\n\nAfter 12 consecutive U.S. presidents from somewhere else, this year the Empire State strikes back. Whether it’s Queens native Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, who now hails from Chappaqua, the next occupant of the White House undoubtedly will bring some New York style, swagger, smarts and strangeness to the highest office in the land.\n\nThere have been six commanders-in-chief who called New York home. Not all did big things or are even remembered. Some are considered giants, and others got their share of Bronx cheers. Not one of them, as you’ll see, was boring.\n\n‘Old Kinderhook’\n\nOK, let’s start with the first American president. No, it wasn’t George Washington. Washington may have been the father of our country, but he and all of the founding fathers were born in British colonies and considered themselves Englishmen. Technically, there was no United States of America until the Continental Congress said there was in the July 4, 1776, Declaration of Independence. So that makes Martin Van Buren, who was born in 1782 in New York state, the first U.S.-born president.\n\nVan Buren, a Democrat who served as the nation’s eighth president from 1837 to 1841, was one of nine chief executives who never went to college. He quit school at age 14, but still managed to pass the bar and become a lawyer when he was 23. While his presidency is largely overlooked and forgotten, Van Buren’s legacy remains a constant even today. Van Buren frequently and affectionately referred to his upstate hometown as “Old Kinderhook.” His political cronies used the phrase as his nickname, and helped popularize the abbreviated version: “OK.”\n\nMemorable quote: “As to the presidency, the two happiest days of my life were those of my entry upon the office and the day of my surrender of it.”\n\nThe book-loving, firefighting, home improver\n\nWhen the Library of Congress caught fire on Dec. 24, 1851, President Millard Fillmore raced over and helped put it out. Fillmore, born in a log cabin in the Finger Lakes village of Summerhill, served as the 13th president from 1850 to 1853, completing the term of Zachary Taylor, who died after a year in office. A member of the Whig Party, Fillmore was the last president not to be a Democrat or Republican. Although he had little formal education, Fillmore loved reading and books. Soon after the Library of Congress fire, he signed a funding bill to replace all of the books lost in the blaze. To help improve his vocabulary, Fillmore carried a dictionary at all times. Despite his intellect, when Oxford University wanted to award him an honorary degree, Fillmore turned it down, saying he didn’t have “the literary or scientific attainment.”\n\nFillmore installed the first library in the White House. He also had the mansion fitted with its first bathtub and kitchen stove. When the cook couldn’t figure out how to work the stove, the president went to the U.S. Patent Office, read the patent, and taught the kitchen staff how to use the newfangled contraption.\n\nMemorable quote: “May God save the country, for it is evident that the people will not.”\n\nLiving large\n\nChester A. Arthur was born in Vermont, but grew up in various upstate New York villages before his family settled in Schenectady. As a young abolitionist lawyer, he represented Elizabeth “Lizzie” Jennings Graham, a black woman, in a civil-rights lawsuit that resulted in the desegregation of New York City street cars in 1855 — a century before Rosa Parks more famously refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nArthur, a Republican, served as 21st president from 1881 to 1885, assuming office when James Garfield died two months after being shot by an assassin. “Elegant Arthur,” as he was known, played the banjo, liked to socialize and had a taste for fashion and the good life. He changed his clothes frequently for different occasions and reportedly owned 80 pairs of pants. Upon moving into the Executive Mansion and not finding it to his taste, Arthur had 20 cartloads of furnishings hauled away and hired Louis Comfort Tiffany (yes, that Tiffany) to redecorate. Not exactly an early-to-bed, early-to-rise guy, President Arthur was known to take walks around Washington, D.C., as late as 2 or 3 a.m.\n\nMemorable quote: “I may be president of the United States, but my private life is my own damn business.”\n\nThe ‘Buffalo Hangman’ skipped a term\n\nThe man whose face graces the seldom-seen $1,000 bill is Grover Cleveland, the only president to serve nonconsecutive terms. Born in New Jersey, the future 22nd and 24th president lived in western New York and was elected sheriff of Buffalo in 1870. Not one to leave all the dirty work to his underlings, Cleveland earned his “Buffalo Hangman” moniker by virtue of having personally pulled the gallows lever for at least two executions.\n\nCleveland was elected president in 1884, becoming the first Democrat elected the Oval Office after the Civil War. He dedicated the Statue of Liberty during his first term and had a reputation for answering the White House telephone himself. Despite a 27-year age difference, Cleveland became the only president to marry while in office, tying the knot with the prophetic Frances Folsom, who was 21 at the time. Cleveland lost his 1888 re-election bid to Benjamin Harrison. As Cleveland and his bride were moving out, the young First Lady told the White House staff to “take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now when we come back again.”\n\nSure enough, in 1892, Cleveland defeated Harrison to recapture the presidency.\n\nMemorable quote: “Sometimes I wake at night in the White House and rub my eyes and wonder if it is not all a dream.”\n\nThe force of nature\n\nThe 26th president was the living embodiment of hyperactivity. There’s a photograph of 6-year-old Theodore Roosevelt peering down from the second floor of his New York City home as Abraham Lincoln’s funeral procession passes by. It may be the last time Roosevelt ever stood still. He was, at various times, a lawyer, cowboy, big-game hunter, taxidermist, mountain climber, war hero, author of 38 books, New York City police commissioner, environmentalist and politician. A Republican, Roosevelt served from 1901 to 1909, taking office after the assassination of William McKinley. His smarts, charisma, confidence, drive, boundless energy, optimism and exuberance were the stuff of legend.\n\nIn 1903, Roosevelt’s name was attached to a favorite children’s toy, the Teddy Bear. Three years later, he became the first president to win the Nobel Prize. Roosevelt frequently cajoled cabinet members to join him in long, vigorous hikes, wrestling and boxing matches and “refreshing” nude swims in the icy Potomac River. After losing sight in one eye during a boxing match with a young Army officer, the president decided, at age 50, to retire from the sport and take up jujitsu. The first president to travel outside the United States, Roosevelt visited Panama, where he was largely responsible for the building of the canal.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, he embarked on an African safari that supplied many of the plant and wildlife specimens still on display at the Smithsonian. In 1912, he survived being shot in the chest during an unsuccessful bid to return to the White House as a third-party candidate. Roosevelt was 58 at the outbreak of World War I, and lobbied relentlessly to lead an infantry unit, but was turned down. All four of his sons fought in the war, and his youngest, Quentin, was shot down flying over Germany. Roosevelt remained active politically and physically until his death, in his sleep, in 1919.\n\nMemorable quote: “It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.”\n\nThe favorite son\n\nIn 1887, President Grover Cleveland told a 5-year-old White House visitor, “My little man, I am making a strange wish for you. It is that you may never be president of the United States.” Oh well. Our 32nd president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who led the country through the Great Depression and World War II, was so popular that he was elected four times and served from 1933 until his death in 1945, four months into his fourth term.\n\nHe was born into a wealthy family and raised in Hyde Park, in Dutchess County. Some may be familiar with a photo showing him as a toddler, wearing a ruffled white dress and shoulder-length hair. That’s how boys from rich families were dressed for portraits back then, until about age 5, when they also received their first haircuts. Stricken with polio when he was 39, Roosevelt was paralyzed from the waist down — a fact he hid from the public.\n\nA fifth cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt, FDR married another fifth cousin, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt. His presidency was one of many firsts. A Democrat, Roosevelt was the first and will be the last to serve more than two presidential terms — thanks to the limit set by the 22nd Amendment in 1951. He was the first president to have an airplane, the first to appoint a woman to his cabinet and the first to appear on television. Roosevelt was most likely the only president to have a horse tail hanging in his White House bedroom. The tail in question was once attached to Gloucester, a racehorse owned by his father. Despite his background, Roosevelt had the common touch. His “Fireside Chats” on the radio endeared him to the nation. He liked playing poker, loved dogs and once served hot dogs to the King and Queen of England.\n\nMemorable quote: “Whenever you are asked if you can do a job, tell ‘em, ‘Certainly I can!’ Then get busy and find out how to do it.”\n\nTwitter: @RichLiebson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/03/obama-presidents-july-fourth-john-adams/12021999/", "title": "Presidents promote patriotism on July 4", "text": "David Jackson\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhen America declared its independence back in 1776, John Adams wrote wife Abigail that future generations should celebrate the day \"with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other.\"\n\nAdams couldn't have predicted how presidents themselves would come to mark the day — both to promote patriotism and their political agendas.\n\nOver the past 238 years, the nation's presidents — from George Washington and Adams himself to current commander-in-chief Barack Obama — have found a variety of ways to commemorate the Fourth of July and the ideals of the day.\n\nWhether it's a barbecue on the White House lawn — as Obama plans again this year for military service members — or a visit to an historical shrine like Independence Hall in Philadelphia, presidents have sought to summon the patriotic spirit of the founders.\n\nMany presidents have also tailored July 4 ceremonies to fit the times, whether they involve civil war or foreign threats of terrorism.\n\n\"They try to represent what is on the mind of the American people at that particular time,\" said James Heintze, a librarian emeritus at American University who has studied presidential activities on July Fourth.\n\nIn recent years, veterans from wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have had pride of place at Independence Day ceremonies at the White House and elsewhere.\n\nIn addition to the barbecue on the South Lawn, on Friday Obama, as he has in previous years, will preside at a naturalization ceremony for immigrant active duty military service members, veterans, reservists and spouses.\n\n\"This Independence Day will be their first day as American citizens,\" Obama said earlier this week.\n\nAt last year's military barbecue, Obama said that \"on July 4, 1776, a small band of patriots declared that we were a people created equal, free to think and worship and live as we please.\" The president told members of the military they are \"part of a long line of folks who are willing to fight for those ideals.\"\n\nPresidents have echoed similar sentiments in July 4 ceremonies that have evolved over time.\n\nPresident George Washington and his successor, Adams, had relatively low-key Fourth of July commemorations, back when the national capital was located first in New York City and then in Philadelphia. Adams moved into the White House in late 1800.\n\n(Adams, by the way, initially believed Independence Day celebrations would be on July 2, the day the Continental Congress approved a resolution of independence. Over the years, however, Americans began to celebrate July 4, the day the Congress approved the actual document known as the Declaration of Independence.)\n\nIn general, presidents like to meet with large groups of people on July 4. In the early days, they even threw open the doors of the White House to greet members of the public.\n\nThomas Jefferson, the third president and Adams' successor, held the first Fourth of July reception at the Executive Mansion in 1801.\n\nIn more recent times, amid heavy security around the president, White House holiday events are by invitation only.\n\nPresidents also like going to famous places on July 4, Heintze said. Gettysburg, Valley Forge and Philadelphia's Independence Hall (where the Declaration of Independence was signed) have been on holiday presidential schedules.\n\nThe Fourth of July also holds a somber place in presidential history.\n\nAdams and Jefferson both died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Another early president, James Monroe, died on July 4, 1831.\n\nOn a happier note, one president was born on the Fourth of July (Calvin Coolidge in 1872). So was at least one presidential family member: Malia Obama, who turns 16 on Friday.\n\nPresidents have often used the holiday as a call for renewal of the nation's heritage.\n\nAs the nation faced Civil War on July 4, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called an extraordinary session of Congress to discuss the crisis and urge national unity.\n\nEighty years later, with Nazi Germany in control of Western Europe and imperial Japan threatening the Pacific, President Franklin Roosevelt delivered a somber address from his home in Hyde Park, N.Y., on July 4, 1941.\n\nThe United States broke from Great Britain to fight for its freedom, Roosevelt said, but \"the fundamentals of 1776 are being struck down abroad and definitely they are threatened here.\"\n\nLittle more than five months later, the United States plunged into World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nObama's predecessor, George W. Bush, often discussed the war on terrorism during July 4 events that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. On his last Fourth of July as president, in 2008, Bush became the fourth president to visit Jefferson's home at Monticello, Va., where he presided over naturalization ceremonies.\n\nObama, swearing in immigrant service members in 2012, called it \"a perfect way to celebrate America's birthday — the world's oldest democracy, with some of our newest citizens.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/06/27/fourth-of-july-patriotic-songs-that-are-misunderstood/74237602007/", "title": "Misunderstood 'patriotic' songs for the Fourth of July, from 'Born in ...", "text": "Fourth of July is fast approaching, and with it, the wave of patriotic playlists featuring rousing anthems, nostalgic rock 'n' roll favorites and all sorts of other songs with \"America\" in the title. Yet, many of the classic songs that casual listeners assume are patriotic are anything but, from misunderstood anti-war protests to singalong favorites masking darker meanings.\n\nHere's a list of songs with meanings that go deeper than their patriotic or America-centric first impressions.\n\n'Born in the U.S.A.,' Bruce Springsteen\n\nPerhaps the most famous song to be widely mistaken for a patriotic anthem, Springsteen’s famous 1984 single has been used by politicians including presidents Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. Yet, listen past the song’s booming chorus, and its lyrics tell the story of a young American kid sent against his will to fight in Vietnam, only to return home to a country arguably as hostile. Starting in the ‘90s, Springsteen abandoned the song’s cheerful original melody in his live performances, choosing to play a darker, more skeletal acoustic version that better reflects the song’s status as a protest song, which is the version that appeared in Springsteen's Broadway show in 2017 and 2021. − Maeve McDermott\n\n'Fortunate Son,' Creedence Clearwater Revival\n\nIf \"Born in the U.S.A.\" is rock ‘n’ roll’s preeminent misunderstood protest song, Creedence Clearwater Revival’s \"Fortunate Son,\" from 1969, is a close second. The song has been similarly treated as a patriotic working-class anthem, but listen past its star-spangled opening lines − \"Some folks are born made to wave the flag / Ooh, they're red, white and blue\" − for John Fogerty's anti-establishment storytelling about how the poor were sent to fight and die in Vietnam while the wealthy were spared. − McDermott\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n‘Pink Houses,’ John Mellencamp\n\nBack when he was John Cougar Mellencamp, the thoughtful singer/songwriter was moved to write the opening verse of his 1983 strummer after driving past a Black man sitting in front of his house with his cat. “There’s a Black man, with a black cat/Livin’ in a Black neighborhood/He’s got an interstate runnin’ through his front yard/You know he thinks he’s got it so good.” Mellencamp wrote the song to spotlight race and class inequalities. But politicians John Edwards and the late John McCain overlooked the depth of the lyrics during their respective presidential campaigns, opting to focus on the “Ain’t that America” refrain, which Mellencamp intended as pure sarcasm. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'This Land Is Your Land,' Woody Guthrie\n\nWoody Guthrie’s enduring classic may be seen as an alternative to the national anthem, but it wasn’t intended as such when the singer/songwriter wrote it in 1940 after being irritated by radio stations playing Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America” on a constant loop.\n\nAlongside lyrics extolling the redwood forests and Gulf Stream waters, Guthrie’s original lyrics included pointed social commentary that reflected his leftist politics, like this all-too-relevant verse that the singer allegedly left out of his original recordings for fear that Sen. Joseph McCarthy would persecute him as a communist: “There was a big high wall there that tried to stop me / The sign was painted, said ‘private property’ / But on the backside, it didn't say nothing / This land was made for you and me.”\n\nAnother unrecorded verse included in Guthrie’s original written lyrics depicts Depression-era America and paints a picture of the country’s economic disparity: “One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple / By the relief office I saw my people / As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering / If God blessed America for me.” − McDermott\n\n‘American Life,’ Madonna\n\nNo stranger to controversy, Madonna landed in the crossfire not because of her usual forms of titillation (sex, abortion, religion) but politics. Written during the presidency of George W. Bush, the song is dedicated to exposing the shallowness of American culture (“I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef/Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver and a jet”) and limitless consumerism that ultimately leads to dissatisfaction. “I’m just livin’ out the American Dream, and I just realized that nothin’ is what it seems,” she concludes. − Ruggieri\n\n'Rockin’ in the Free World,' Neil Young\n\nBoth Trump and Bernie Sanders used Young's 1989 track during their respective presidential campaigns. Perhaps both rabble-rousing candidates found something to agree with in Young's tale of George H.W. Bush-era disillusionment as he rails against wealth inequality, consumerism and the general decline of American society. The \"keep on rockin' in the free world\" refrain may be a rah-rah catchphrase that was used at the time of its release to celebrate the collapse of communism, but Young's words are almost certainly intended to be taken ironically, making the song less the patriotic anthem than it may initially seem. − McDermott\n\nIcons unite: Billy Joel and Stevie Nicks enchant on their dual tour playing throughout the year\n\n‘Independence Day,’ Martina McBride\n\nYes, there are fireworks, but they have nothing to do with celebrating America. McBride’s tale of an 8-year-old girl watching the physical abuse of her mother by her alcoholic father presents a different kind of independence. “Well she lit up the sky that Fourth of July,” McBride sings, illustrating how the protagonist set her abuser’s house on fire as her means of escape. “Let freedom ring/Let the white dove sing/Let the whole world know that today is a day of reckoning” is a potent message about personal strength, not patriotism. − Ruggieri\n\n'American Woman,' The Guess Who\n\nGive it a casual listen, and \"American Woman\" sounds like an ode to the alluring qualities of our nation's female sex. That's certainly not what Canadian rockers Guess Who intended in 1970, with guitarist Randy Bachman calling the track an \"anti-war protest song,\" its titular woman representing a warmongering Uncle Sam in the era of Vietnam. Guess Who singer Burton Cummings disagreed with Bachman's take on the song in a separate interview, claiming the song is less about politics and more about the \"dangerous\" reputation of its main character. \"When I said ‘American woman, stay away from me,’ I really meant ‘Canadian woman, I prefer you,'\" he said. Whatever interpretation you agree with, the song isn't intended to be complimentary. − McDermott\n\n‘American Pie,’ Don McLean\n\nWith so many cultural touchpoints rattled off inside the nearly nine-minute song – Buddy Holly, the Vietnam War, Charles Manson − it’s difficult to whittle the 1970s opus down to a key point. But so often overlooked in the verbose singalong is the weariness woven into the lyrics: “Bye, bye, Miss American Pie … them good old boys were drinking whiskey in rye singing ‘this will be the day that I die.’” Between that chorus and the frequent circling back to “the day the music died,” McLean is spotlighting palpable disillusionment. − Ruggieri\n\nTop tour:Why The Cure's U.S. outing is rightfully being heralded as one of the best of the year", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/01/03/who-was-first-president-george-washington/10696864002/", "title": "Who was the first president?

At dusk, 91-year-old John Adams spoke his last words, “Jefferson survives.\" He did not know that on that morning, his onetime ally, enemy and friend, Thomas Jefferson, had passed. The fact that two presidents died on the same day pops up on quiz shows occasionally. What is even more astounding is that it was on the day celebrating the document that those two did more than anyone to create.\n\nWhen the gathering of colonial elite known as the “Continental Congress” decided to go for broke and declare independence, one delegate told Jefferson, “When they hang us, I’ll go quickly, because I am very fat. You will dangle for a while.” He was only half-joking. Benjamin Franklin, possibly the most respected man in the world, chaired the committee responsible for writing the declaration; he left it to the committee's younger members, Adams and Jefferson, saying that he did not want his work edited by others. Adams told Jefferson that he must be the author, for three reasons: 1. Having a Virginian author would bring the most populous colony and the rest of the South into the struggle; 2. Jefferson was much better liked than the obnoxious Adams; and 3. Jefferson was a far better writer.\n\nAt a time when equality was not even a pipe dream for slaves, free blacks, Indians, women, religious minorities and non-property owners, Jefferson wrote what historians see as a promise: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among them, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” It is a promise that still inspires us. The black historian John Hope Franklin said, “I thought that they were beautiful words. They reinforced what my parents told me, that no one was better than I was.” When Congress adapted the declaration, Adams presciently wrote his wife Abigail: \"It ought to be celebrated by pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires and illuminations from one end of this continent to the other... .\"\n\nOn July 4, 1863, the United States was at war with itself. President Abraham Lincoln, however, had reason to celebrate: The Union had not only prevailed at Gettysburg the previous day, but Vicksburg had surrendered that day to General Ulysses S. Grant, giving control of the Mississippi to the Union. On Nov. 19, Lincoln dedicated the Gettysburg Battlefield by reminding the country that the founding fathers had created a nation “dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal” and called for them to continue the cause for which the dead on this ground had given “their last full measure of devotion” so that “government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth.”\n\nOne hundred years later, on Memorial Day 1963, Vice President Lyndon Johnson told an audience at Gettysburg: “Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation, but not a fact.” A year later, President Johnson pushed through Congress the first of three civil rights acts, fulfilling, more than anyone, Jefferson’s promise.\n\nIn 1946, the U.S. relinquished sovereignty of the Philippines. The Filipinos celebrate their independence on June 12, the day in 1898 when they declared independence from Spain, but they celebrate July 4 as Filipino-American Friendship Day. Others have been inspired as well: When Ho Chi Minh, a former resident and admirer of the United States, wrote Vietnam’s declaration of independence from France in 1946, he quoted Jefferson’s words. Ironically, he would face a long struggle against both France and the U.S. “Born on the Fourth of July” is a line from a song by George M. Cohan, as well as the name of a movie by Oliver Stone. Louis Armstrong claimed to be born on the Fourth of July, 1900; he wasn’t, but he might as well have been. Willie Nelson’s Fourth of July picnic in Texas is an annual event.\n\nJefferson’s promise has inspired many over the years. In view of recent events, it is now time, more than ever, for our national leaders to rededicate themselves to his promise.\n\nRobert Evins Pickard, MA, MPA, is an adjunct professor of U.S. and world history at Nashville State Community College.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/07/03/people-working-preserving-democracy/74138235007/", "title": "These people still believe in democracy (little d) and are working to ...", "text": "WASHINGTON ‒ For Joseph Atou, democracy is sharing with hundreds of visitors the history of America’s foundation.\n\nFor Gregg Amore, it’s teaching the younger generation the importance of civic engagement.\n\nAnd for John Suttles and Tina Barton, democracy means ensuring elections work.\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, democracy is government by the people.

In January, 49% of Democrats and 29% of independents cited the future of democracy as the top issue facing America, according to an exclusive USA TODAY/Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll in New Hampshire. A Washington Post poll released last week found that the majority of voters of all political beliefs consider \"threats to democracy in the U.S.\" important. And that's true of more than 70% of voters who say they strongly support either President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump.\n\nAhead of the nation’s July 4 celebrations, USA TODAY talked to a range of people dedicated to democracy, including a former election official, a veteran of the civil rights moment and a tour guide at the U.S. Capitol, about what democracy means to them and how they’re doing their part to move it forward.\n\nAs the stories of these citizens show, sustaining democracy takes work. And support for these efforts remains crucial, Daley-Harris said.\n\n“It's the political will of the people that makes and sustains the political will of governments,’’ he said. “Make sure there's a next step that people can take to take the enthusiasm onward rather than have it fizzle.\"\n\nWelcome to the United States\n\nJoseph Atou\n\nJoseph Atou, dressed in a bright red jacket, handed each of the 40 tourists a headset at the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center.\n\n“Over here,’’ he directed. \"Move forward, please.’’\n\nAtou is one of dozens of guides leading tours of the U.S. Capitol, offering visitors a chance to see and hear how democracy here works. During the peak from March through August, about 10,000 people a day visit the center.\n\nAtou believes he’s helping educate Americans and foreigners about the nation, its checks and balances, its history and its evolution.\n\n“A lot of the time people see the government as far away,’’ Atou explained between tours on a recent afternoon. “They don’t really understand a lot of how it really works.’’\n\nBut after the nearly hourlong tour, Atou is excited when visitors tell him, ‘‘Oh, I didn’t know that is how it is.’’\n\nAt the start of that day's tour, Atou asked foreign visitors where they were from. \"France,\" \"Austria,\" \"Indonesia\" and \"South Korea,\" they yelled out.\n\n“Welcome to the United States of America,’’ he responded.\n\nAtou then guided them through the Capitol, pointing to paintings like the presentation of a draft of the Declaration of Independence, busts of icons like Martin Luther King Jr., and statues of presidents like Thomas Jefferson.\n\nThe group circled the Grand Rotunda at the heart of the Capitol, where Atou pointed way up to the dome and shared that dignitaries like Sen. John McCain had lain in state there. Visitors peppered Atou with questions. He rattled off answers.\n\nAtou especially enjoyed explaining how each state selects statues to represent them in the National Statuary Hall, only steps from the Rotunda. He urged visitors, while on Capitol Hill, to reach out to their congressional representative.\n\n“It’s a way for me to tell them to get involved,’’ Atou said.\n\nAt the end of the tour, visitors applauded.\n\nTheresa Raffeiner from Austria said she appreciated the lesson and Atou’s humor. “It wasn’t so serious,’’ she said. “I don’t want to feel like I was on a field trip.’’\n\nAtou, 50, an independent who lives in Rockville, Maryland, has been a tour guide for 11 years.\n\nHe was born in Cameroon in central Africa and later lived in France. He combined passions of his grandfather, an artist, and his father, a high school history teacher, to study art history in Paris. He later did research in Germany for his masters in art history.\n\nBecause of his background, Atou said, it’s easy to incorporate history with art during his tours.\n\nHe also uses his experiences in other countries to relate to foreign visitors. At stops on his tour, he explained in French to tourists why histories of the countries were connected. He also speaks German and Greek.\n\nAtou said he learned a lot about American history while living in other countries.\n\n“But you have to come here to actually understand that,’’ he said. “When they talk about slavery, for example, they will tell you that there were horrible things, but they will never tell you about Emmett Till. They will never tell you about Dred Scott. They will just portray that as evil. They were mean people. They enslaved people.”\n\n“Working here really helped me to understand the position of African Americans.”\n\nAll those experiences help drive Atou’s passion for his work. He also helped design the Heroes of Civil Rights tour at the Capitol.\n\n“It’s fun,’’ he said. “I try to teach, but the American system is a little bit complex.’’\n\nPreserving fair and safe elections\n\nTina Barton\n\nTina Barton has traveled to more than 30 states in the past two years. In each place, she has met with local, county and state officials, those who conduct hazmat details, and people who work in Homeland Security or for the FBI.\n\nIt's all in the name of preserving fair and safe elections, which she considers a crucial part of the democratic process.\n\nBarton helps municipalities create plans for Election Day.\n\nShe spent 32 years working in government across Oakland County, Michigan, half as an elections clerk.\n\nThis type of preparation is Barton’s passion. And after facing death threats, it has become personal.\n\n“The goal is to have an operations plan in place with anybody who has some sort of stake in the voting process in case there is an event that could range from intimidation, de-escalation to threats to lives,” said Barton, vice chair of the nonprofit Committee for Safe and Secure Elections.\n\n”We walk through several scenarios to try to make their communities safer,” added Barton, also a senior expert for The Elections Group. “The demand has been so great. They come away with their eyes more wide open. We want them to prepare their plans. To implement them. To test them.”\n\nA married mother of two adult children, Barton said election workers have faced increased scrutiny since 2016, but it intensified in 2020. A Republican, Barton doesn’t believe doubting election workers is a partisan issue, either. “We’re living in pretty divisive times right now,” she said.\n\nShe cites a recent poll by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a liberal or progressive nonprofit law and public policy institute, that found nearly 40% of local election officials had been threatened, harassed or abused on the job. “That’s a 10% increase,” Barton said. “A huge number.”\n\nThe poll also showed that more than 90% of municipalities have increased their election security since 2020. “Another huge number,” Barton said.\n\nAndrew Nickels, of Carmel, Indiana, has been convicted of threatening Barton’s life and her family. After the 2020 election, he left a menacing voicemail and accused her of fraud when Trump and then-Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel alleged voter irregularities in Oakland County, where Barton was in charge.\n\nBarton denounced the accusations and state officials said McDaniel’s claims had no merit.\n\n“It was hurtful, shocking, stunning, all the things I never expected,” Barton said. “You can either let it defeat you or define you. I clearly let it define me and I’m absolutely stronger. I’m using my experiences and skills to help others not go through what I did.”\n\nBarton said she plans to give a victim impact statement when Nickels is sentenced next month.\n\n“His threat did not cause me to back down. In fact, it made me stronger,” Barton said. “It makes election officials stronger. They work incredibly hard to make sure voters can have a free, safe and accurate election.”\n\nOn a bridge and at a crossroads\n\nJohn Suttles\n\nWhen John Suttles takes Highway 80 into Selma, Alabama, he’s struck by how much the city still looks like six decades ago when he and others marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to demand voting rights for its Black citizens.\n\nThere’s still a gas station, a sign welcoming visitors and the bridge.\n\nThe 76-year-old veteran of the Civil Rights Movement makes the pilgrimage nearly each year in part to share with young people the importance of voting.\n\n“You have to vote because that's the way democracy works,’’ he said. “If you don't vote, you don't have a democracy and that is where we at now at this crossroads in the United States.”\n\nFor Suttles, a working democracy means his efforts 60 years ago are paying off with more people of color registering to vote and casting ballots. To continue that effort, Suttles champions the importance of voting at events, including a Juneteenth panel in his hometown of Johns Creek, Georgia. Earlier this year, he joined a virtual panel hosted by the federal Election Assistance Commission.\n\n“I am constantly looking for opportunities to talk about it with anybody that wants to listen,’’ said Suttles, a retired Minnesota transit worker. “There’s a lot of naysayers about the vote. But that just doesn't make sense to me.’’\n\nSince he was a teenager, Suttles said, he has been working on “this thing called voting and democracy and human rights.’’\n\nSuttles, who lived outside Selma, joined peaceful protesters crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965. Like others, he was beaten by police on that \"Bloody Sunday.\"\n\nSuttles donated the bloodstained Army jacket he wore that day, loaned to him by his uncle, to a National Park Service interpretive center in Selma.\n\nHe and his wife, Kay, often join the annual bipartisan pilgrimage to Selma when civil rights veterans, U.S. presidents, members of Congress and others gather to commemorate the march. Georgia Rep. John Lewis, the late civil rights icon, used to lead the trip.\n\nSuttles, a Democrat, appreciates the chance to talk to young people who often ask about his experience on ''Bloody Sunday.''\n\n“They're always fascinated that a young person like myself back in them days would have enough to get up knowing that there's a 99% chance that you're going to get beat up and (yet) you go fight for somebody else's civil rights and voters' rights and human rights,’’ he said.\n\nSuttles said he would have it no other way.\n\n“I bought into it in the '60s,’’ he said. “It’s sort of like a religion. It’s part of me now. I have to be involved in some capacity that can make a difference.’’\n\nStanding up for women\n\nPoojitha Tanjore\n\nIn March, a group of female politicians, activists and other prominent community leaders came together at a local high school in Virginia to discuss the importance of women raising their voices and fighting for change.\n\nAmong the group was 22-year-old Indian American Pooja Tanjore, a master’s student at Columbia University in New York and a diplomatic fellow with USAID, which administers foreign aid and development assistance.\n\n“I borrowed my mother's blazer. … I didn't feel like I knew all the etiquette to be in this space,\" she joked to an almost equally youthful audience of high schoolers, according to the Loudoun-Times Mirror. \"I'm going to have to buy my own blazers.”\n\nTanjore, a Cincinnati native, told USA TODAY that women have “really always been at the core of what's important to me about democracy.”\n\nEveryone has the right to speak and have a voice, she said.\n\n“And I think women have historically been neglected in that space, and so it's very important that they have the right to speak and feel empowered.”\n\nThe fight for womens’ rights and representation is something Tanjore has been involved in since her teens ‒ starting at the grassroots level.\n\nAt age 16, she founded a Virginia chapter of the national nonprofit Rise to Run, aimed at encouraging high school and college women to run for office.\n\nWorking on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, Tanjore said, helped her form a strong network to launch the chapter. The group helped bring together young women from different backgrounds and connect them with mentors.\n\nThough the chapter is now defunct, she has continued serving in other ways, such as campaigning for female lawmakers and speaking at summits aimed at empowering women. Last year, she worked as a legislative fellow in Democratic Virginia Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s office.\n\n“I grew up with people knocking doors (and) I worked on a bunch of political campaigns, and you just see all this energy of people who really care about local politics, like the causes in their local communities, because people know that change is made locally,” she said.\n\n“So even just on that grassroots level, it's so inspiring, and it just continues to reinforce how important democracy is.”\n\nHer great-grandmother, forced to marry as a child, was her biggest source of inspiration to get involved in this work, she said. The older woman, who died two years ago, had children while still a teenager herself and was widowed just a few years later.\n\n“Seeing what that did to her really inspired me to work toward women's rights.”\n\nKeeping democracy is everyone's job\n\nGregg Amore\n\nIt's tough to keep teenagers from their phones these days. Gregg Amore managed to keep a hotel ballroom-full laughing, raising their hands and nodding along this spring as he talked about the importance of maintaining American democracy.\n\nPower, he reminded his audience of high schoolers at the Rhode Island Civic Leadership Summit, is something you want to hold onto once you have. He doesn't want to give up his own job as Rhode Island's secretary of state, he noted.\n\nHis 30 years of teaching high school students have helped him hone his message. Some of the students had even heard him give this talk before. But they didn't seem to mind. A few of the anecdotes were fresh and his questions kept them awake, several said.\n\nA lifelong Rhode Islander with the accent to prove it, he doesn't talk down to the high schoolers, many of whom will be voting in their first election in November. He has nailed a tone that says \"I respect your intelligence, but I also have information you'll want to know.\"\n\nAmore, 57, a former hockey and baseball coach, mentioned the charge that the 2020 election was stolen. Instead of dismissing it out of hand, as many fellow Democrats do, he explained that in 2020, three Rhode Islanders voted in both Florida and Rhode Island. All three were caught and prosecuted.\n\n\"Is there voter fraud? Yes. Is there widespread fraud? No,\" he said, explaining the auditing process his state and others use to ensure that the vast majority of votes are counted accurately.\n\n\"We don't have a voter fraud problem in this country,\" Amore told the students. \"We have a voter suppression problem in this country.\"\n\nAncestors of many of the people who have trouble accessing the polls today were prevented from voting by intimidation tactics or so-called literacy tests that asked impossible questions, like \"How many bubbles does this bar of soap create?\" he said, holding up a bar to emphasize the absurdity.\n\n\"If Americans don't pay attention, if we don't push back, you will see proposals for some sort of literacy test for future voters.\"\n\nHe closed his talk by citing Benjamin Franklin, who, at age 81, ran into a friend as he was walking out of the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia.\n\n\"What do we have?\" she asked him about their newly established form of government. \"A republic or a monarchy?\"\n\n\"Madam, we have a republic ‒ if you keep it,\" Franklin supposedly replied.\n\n\"That's your job,\" Amore charged the young people listening to his vision of democracy. \"To keep it.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/02/18/presidents-day-federal-holiday-what-to-know/72452026007/", "title": "What is Presidents Day? Is it a federal holiday? Everything to know", "text": "Presidents Day is fast approaching, which may signal to many a relaxing three-day weekend and plenty of holiday sales and bargains.\n\nBut next to Independence Day, there may not exist another American holiday that is quite so patriotic.\n\nWhile Presidents Day has come to be a commemoration of all the nation's 46 chief executives, both past and present, it wasn't always so broad. When it first came into existence – long before it was even federally recognized – the holiday was meant to celebrate just one man: George Washington.\n\nHow has the day grown from a simple celebration of the birthday of the first president of the United States? And why are we seeing all these ads for car and furniture sales on TV?\n\nHere's what to know about Presidents Day and how it came to be:\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2024?\n\nThis year, Presidents Day is on Monday, Feb. 19.\n\nThe holiday is celebrated on the third Monday of every February because of a bill signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Taking effect three years later, the Uniform Holiday Bill mandated that three holidays – Memorial Day, Presidents Day and Veterans Day – occur on Mondays to prevent midweek shutdowns and add long weekends to the federal calendar, according to Britannica.\n\nOther holidays, including Labor Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day, were also established to be celebrated on Mondays when they were first observed.\n\nHowever, Veterans Day was returned to Nov. 11 in 1978 and continues to be commemorated on that day.\n\nWhat does Presidents Day commemorate?\n\nPresidents Day was initially established in 1879 to celebrate the birthday of the nation's first president, George Washington. In fact, the holiday was simply called Washington's Birthday, which is still how the federal government refers to it, the Department of State explains.\n\nFollowing the death of the venerated American Revolution leader in 1799, Feb. 22, widely believed to be Washington's date of birth, became a perennial day of remembrance, according to History.com.\n\nThe day remained an unofficial observance for much of the 1800s until Sen. Stephen Wallace Dorsey of Arkansas proposed that it become a federal holiday. In 1879, President Rutherford B. Hayes signed it into law, according to History.com.\n\nWhile initially being recognized only in Washington D.C., Washington's Birthday became a nationwide holiday in 1885. The first to celebrate the life of an individual American, Washington's Birthday was at the time one of only five federally-recognized holidays – the others being Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July.\n\nHowever, most Americans today likely don't view the federal holiday as a commemoration of just one specific president. Presidents Day has since come to represent a day to recognize and celebrate all of the United States' commanders-in-chief, according to the U.S. Department of State.\n\nWhen the Uniform Holiday Bill took effect in 1971, a provision was included to combine the celebration of Washington’s birthday with Abraham Lincoln's on Feb. 12, according to History.com. Because the new annual date always fell between Washington's and Lincoln's birthdays, Americans believed the day was intended to honor both presidents.\n\nInterestingly, advertisers may have played a part in the shift to \"Presidents Day.\"\n\nMany businesses jumped at the opportunity to use the three-day weekend as a means to draw customers with Presidents Day sales and bargain at stores across the country, according to History.com.\n\nHow is the holiday celebrated?\n\nBecause Presidents Day is a federal holiday, most federal workers will have the day off.\n\nPart of the reason Johnson made the day a uniform holiday was so Americans had a long weekend \"to travel farther and see more of this beautiful land of ours,\" he wrote. As such, places like the Washington Monument in D.C. and Mount Rushmore in South Dakota – which bears the likenesses of Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt – are bound to attract plenty of tourists.\n\nSimilar to Independence Day, the holiday is also viewed as a patriotic celebration. As opposed to July, February might not be the best time for backyard barbecues and fireworks, but reenactments, parades and other ceremonies are sure to take place in cities across the U.S.\n\nPresidential places abound across the U.S.\n\nOpinions on current and recent presidents may leave Americans divided, but we apparently love our leaders of old enough to name a lot of places after them.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau pulled information from its databases showcasing presidential geographic facts about the nation's cities and states.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the census data shows that as of 2020, the U.S. is home to plenty of cities, counties and towns bearing presidential names. Specifically:\n\n94 places are named \"Washington.\"\n\n72 places are named \"Lincoln.\"\n\n67 places are named for Andrew Jackson, a controversial figure who owned slaves and forced thousands of Native Americans to march along the infamous Trail of Tears.\n\nContributing: Clare Mulroy\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.
