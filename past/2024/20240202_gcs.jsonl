The system continuously monitors maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, contractions, and labor progression to help clinicians quickly identify any concerning developments for faster intervention.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center delivers more than 750 babies each year. Stacy Wood, RN, director of women’s services, indicates this new technology is an important resource to support maternal/fetal health and safe deliveries.\n\n“Every delivery is unique and the health and well-being of every mom and baby is our priority during childbirth,” says Jeanette Toney, MD. “While most births happen without complication, there are some inherent risks in the delivery of a newborn. This new technology adds another layer of protection throughout the labor process to help our maternity team recognize, prevent and respond to avoidable complications.”\n\nThrough pattern recognition, the technology can also pinpoint opportunities for overall improvement based on consolidated data from multiple births. As the maternity team reviews trends and identifies areas where improvement is possible, the hospital can use that information to develop protocols that further increase safety and may lead to better outcomes for mothers and babies.\n\n“By investing in this technology, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center is making labor and delivery safer for mothers and babies,” said Colin McRae, chief executive officer, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center. “Our physicians and nurses are highly skilled medical professionals and excellent caregivers and they appreciate the use of technology to support their work, especially when it helps keep our patients safe.”\n\nThe team at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center has received the Daisy Team award for exceptional prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. Additionally, the spacious birthing suites at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center feature a labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum (LDRP) model that keeps mother and child together from admission to discharge. The larger rooms also accommodate larger family support networks.\n\nTo learn more about Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center childbirth services or to find a physician, visit tennovanorthknoxville.com/maternity-care-services or call 865-859-8000.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center offers a free e-newsletter with a monthly dose of health and wellness inspiration sent directly to your inbox from a trusted medical source.

(June 20, 2022) – A team of University of Tennessee Health Science Center researchers has been awarded $2.19 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for their investigation of the neurotoxic effects of toluene, a common chemical found in many household products.\n\nAlex M. Dopico, MD, Van Vleet Chair of Excellence and professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science, and Toxicology (PHAST) in the UTHSC College of Medicine, and Anna N. Bukiya, PhD, professor in the same department, are principal investigators on the award. Jeff Steketee, PhD, also professor in the PHAST Department and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, is a co-investigator.\n\nToluene reaches the brain through inhalation. Intoxication with toluene, whether accidental or following recreational use (e.g., “glue sniffing”), leads to dizziness, blurred vision and even neurological deficits with catastrophic outcomes, including death. A reduction in blood flow to the brain is thought to contribute to these toxic effects, but how and why toluene exposure affects the brain circulation is not known.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that toluene reduces the activity of a protein (the BK channel) located in the cerebral artery muscle cells, causing the brain arteries to constrict upon exposure. Performing tests at the molecular level using computational methods, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of BK channel function in animal models, the team aims to identify the specific mechanism and site of action in BK channels that makes cerebral arteries constrict in the presence of toluene. Their tests will include delivering new selective drug therapies for early intervention in toluene-induced brain ischemia.\n\nThe project, titled “Ionic mechanisms of toluene cerebrovascular actions,” is being funded over five years.\n\nAs Tennessee’s only public, statewide, academic health system, the mission of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center is to bring the benefits of the health sciences to the achievement and maintenance of human health through education, research, clinical care, and public service, with a focus on the citizens of Tennessee and the region. The main campus in Memphis includes six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. UTHSC also educates and trains medicine, pharmacy, and/or health professions students, as well as medical residents and fellows, at major sites in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Nashville.

This show and Women Artists: Highlights from the Hunter Museum of American Art (one floor up) document what two important Tennessee cultural organizations are doing to support and empower women artists.\n\nLike the Hunter, the KMA has actively sought to acquire outstanding works by women, who have long lagged behind their male counterparts when it comes to museum-level recognition. The selection on view reflects the broad technical and aesthetic range found in contemporary art by women. A mixed media painting on wooden sections by Alison Moritsugu conveys a monumental landscape, expansive yet incomplete. Nancy Rubins elevates graphite drawing into a large sculptural construction apparently shaped by violent forces. British artist Marilène Oliver constructs provocative portraits of her family in the form of acrylic sheets imprinted with digital medical scans. Patty Chang uses water and mirrors to transform her own image taken in a Belgian church into a complex photographic work fragmented by harsh angles and provocative reflections. In her video Joan of Arc, Alex McQuilkin responds to Maria Falconetti’s memorable lead role in the legendary 1928 French silent film by Carl Dreyer, and to the film’s themes of adolescent desire, faith, and suffering. These and other selected works call overdue attention to women’s significant role in reshaping the contemporary art landscape.\n\nThe artists featured in this exhibition are Patty Chang, Janet Fish, Marcia Goldenstein, Michelle Grabner, EJ Hauser, Julie Heffernan, Jean Hess, Kate Katomski, Karen LaMonte, Pam Longobardi, Lauren Luloff, Alex McQuilkin, Alison Mortisugu, Althea Murphy-Price, Marilène Oliver, Amy Pleasant, Sumi Putman, Nancy Rubins, Tommie Rush, Denise Stewart-Sanabria, Jemima Stehli, and Toots Zynsky.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to celebrate Fourth of July with midnight parade patio party\n\nGatlinburg, Tenn. – Ole Red Gatlinburg will offer one of the best ways to celebrate Fourth of July this year when they host their Midnight Parade Patio Party during the annual Gatlinburg parade.

We partner with them because their mission of taking care of families is part of who we are as well.”\n\nTo take advantage of Sevier County Days, Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood (June 13-19) or Dollywood’s Splash Country (now- June 12) ticket booth.

Giving back is part of who we are as both people and as professionals,” said Lyle Irish, KAAR CEO. “Together with NAR, we encourage local Realtors who have a heart for service and a passion for giving back to participate in one of the many opportunities available to them.”\n\nAs part of Realtor Volunteer Days, which will be held the week of June 4-12, NAR is encouraging associations, brokerages and Realtors nationwide to organize and participate in a local volunteer activity of their choice, and log their hours in the Realtors Are Good Neighbors program.\n\nVisit Knoxville announces return of Bike Boat Brew & Bark\n\nVisit Knoxville is pleased to announce the return of Bike Boat Brew & Bark to take place June 4, 2022 from 10am – 3pm at Knoxville Adventure Collective (900 Volunteer Landing).\n\nBike Boat Brew & Bark celebrates the outdoor adventurer, the dog lover, the craft beer enthusiast, the local and the tourist looking to discover a secret in Knoxville’s urban wilderness.

Ever notice those historical markers along Volunteer Landing? They tell a non-chronological story of soldiers, authors, and sailors who had something to do with Knoxville's waterfront since 1791, connecting Cherokee chiefs to the Civil War to the Tennessee Vols. Jack Neely, historian of the Knoxville History Project, did the research for those markers back in the 1990s, and will help tell the stories, including that of Vagabondia, the long-vanished riverfront home of author Frances Hodgson Burnett that inspired the title of one of her early novels. It was surprisingly near the ramshackle houseboat home of Cornelius Suttree, the stoic protagonist of a very different novel by Cormac McCarthy.

As one of the most sought-after youth sports complexes in the country, Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge will be able to host teams from around the country on 10 total fields, including access to the newly renovated fields at Pigeon Forge’s Wear Farm City Park.\n\nThe park’s four fields will be completely upgraded and reimagined prior to the start of the 2023 season. Similar to the original six fields at Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge which opened in 2016, each field at Wear Farm City Park will become a youth replica of famous Major League Baseball parks of the past and present.\n\nResidents of Pigeon Forge will benefit from the renovations as Wear Farm City Park will continue to host tournaments throughout the year on state-of-the-art artificial turf that closely replicates real grass.\n\n“Every year, our teams and their families take home countless fond memories of the Pigeon Forge area when they participate in The Ripken Experience™,” said Cal Ripken, Jr., who co-founded Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill Ripken. “The views are unbelievable and the feeling you have when you experience our complex is special. The demand to play here is through the roof. This is an exciting opportunity to expand and welcome even more baseball families to Pigeon Forge.”\n\nWear Farm City Park’s four fields will be transformed into youth replicas of the following big league stadiums: St. Louis’ Busch Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. The $3 million renovation project will begin this summer.\n\n“Pigeon Forge’s partnership with Ripken Baseball is a successful one, as demonstrated by the annual increase in demand for the ball fields and the direct impact on our city’s tourism industry due to the many families who visit,” said Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster. “The upgrades to Wear Farm City Park are a win-win for The Ripken Experience™ and our Pigeon Forge residents as these fields bring vast improvements for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nPigeon Forge residents and local youth teams will enjoy the renovations immediately following completion. The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge’s access to Wear Farm City Park applies primarily to daytime hours during the summer season, allowing the four baseball fields to remain available for Pigeon Forge residents during evenings, weekends, and most Fridays. The addition of artificial turf provides longer days during the winter months (November through early March), earlier year-round start times, and quicker turnaround during the event of rain. Wear Farm City Park is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park, which also has soccer and youth football facilities, will continue to host youth baseball leagues.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts more than 1,000 teams annually from over 30 states, traveling from as far away as California, Alaska, and overseas. Players’ families, many of whom are first-time visitors to Pigeon Forge, have a significant impact on the Pigeon Forge economy. A 2018 economic impact study attributed $33.8 million in visitor spending to The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge during the facility’s nine-month season that year.\n\nThe appeal of Pigeon Forge as a family vacation destination was a major reason the city built the $22.5 million complex and contracted with Ripken Baseball to operate it. During seven seasons of operations, the facility has solidified Pigeon Forge as a major sports tourism destination. In addition, research indicates that 99 percent of those who visit the facility reside outside of Sevier County.\n\nTournament participants, coaches, and their families contribute to the local economy through overnight lodging stays ticket purchases to area attractions, restaurant dining, and other purchases.\n\nPigeon Forge is located in Sevier County just six miles from the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nSince opening its doors in March 2016, more than 5,000 youth baseball teams and 250 high school softball teams have taken to the six fields at The Ripken Experience Pigeon Forge. In total, more than 75,000 players and coaches have traveled to play ball on fields that offer unobstructed views of the Great Smoky Mountains, with an additional 1,000 teams expected to travel to the complex for competition in 2022.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge is located on a ridge above Pigeon Forge. Each field borrows its design inspiration from current and former ballparks highlighting the professional player progression from the Minor to Major Leagues, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n\nThe others are Calfee Park in Pulaski, Va., the oldest park in the Appalachian League; Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C., known as “Little Fenway”; Engel Stadium in Chattanooga, Tenn., a filming location for the “42” movie about Jackie Robinson; BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts tournaments nine months out of the year and offers year-round branded events in its 14,000-square-foot clubhouse. Tournaments are free to spectators, and parking is free at the complex.\n\nVisitor information about Pigeon Forge is available online at MyPigeonForge.com and toll-free at 800-251-9100.

Find out here at the Shopper News blog. We'll have updates on people, places, businesses, schools and sports in your community. Check back throughout the week.\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nLand Use committee looks to the future\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThere is no better way to see an area than by examining it firsthand, and that’s just what the Comprehensive Land Use Committee (CLUP) did in mid-May when they walked about four miles along both sides of Watt Road.\n\nCLUP is a volunteer group composed of interested residents, town staff and elected officials. Community Development Director Mark Shipley and Assistant Director Bart Hose spearhead the committee. About a dozen members meet every four to six weeks to discuss and debate the direction the town will take with zoning and development.\n\nWith available open land in Farragut limited now, the committee looks at how to achieve smart growth for the long term, allowing commercial use while preserving quality of neighborhoods.\n\nResidents have been invited to participate in surveys and public meetings over the past year; a mid-March presentation provided examples of streetscapes, business use including building size and scale, and road design. Results from the group overwhelmingly showed a preference for small commercial use (no big-box stores) that would complement existing and new neighborhoods.\n\nMaking neighborhoods pedestrian and bike friendly with sidewalks and multi-use paths is another priority.\n\nTo that end, a new zoning district was developed and presented by Shipley’s department. “The Neighborhood/Convenience Commercial Zoning District was recommended for approval at the last planning commission meeting. It will go to BOMA in June. This district could help implement some of the land use concepts that were desired based on feedback we reviewed from the public workshop,” he said.\n\nPlanning for the town looks many years ahead; Shipley poses the question, “How would you envision Farragut in the next five, 10 or 20 years?” It’s a good question, as development and rezoning take time. Property owners have to come on board and topographical challenges have to be considered.\n\n“We have also to consider what people want to see in town,” said Alderman Ron Williams. And people want to see continued development of a town center at Kingston Pike and Campbell Station Road.\n\n“It’s underway right now with renovation of the Campbell Station Inn and construction at the new Farragut Gateway (old Silver Spoon location),” Williams said. A Starbucks with a drive-through and large patio will share space with a restaurant and other retail, according to Paul Schaffer, one of the developers of the project.\n\nResidents have been frustrated by the vacant buildings at the old Kroger and Ingles properties, but have to realize that the town can’t compel the owners and lessees to redevelop them. The good news is the town has been in talks with them about plans and both sites may see progress soon.\n\nNORTH\n\nJoshua and Sarah Ivester: pay it forward\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nJoshua and Sarah Ivester live by a philosophy that informs every corner of their work and their lives. “We’ve always just gone after what we love and what’s going to help our relationships and families stay strong,” says Sarah. “And we know if we continue working for the people who care about us, caring for each other and caring for the community, we’ll be fine.”\n\nTogether five years, they’re raising their 3-year-old son, Wyatt, in a home full of creativity, where their livelihoods represent much more than “just work.”\n\nNative Knoxvillian Joshua met art school student Sarah in Savannah, Ga., while he was working for Habitat for Humanity. Their first two years together were spent in Sarah’s home state, Colorado. Looking for a fresh start after Wyatt’s birth, “we saw that Knoxville is growing,” says Sarah, “and we thought it would be a cool thing to be a part of.”\n\nJoshua and his dad, Mike, are licensed electricians; they are A1 Electrical Service. Sarah’s passion was and is coffee; she is the coffee specialist at Wild Love Bakery on Central Avenue. “There’s a work ethic in serving the community this way. Working in coffee I’ve gotten to know a lot of the regulars. I’ve seen their pregnancies and births of babies, engagements, relationships – I’ve also seen tragedy in their lives and then been that person that they first see in the morning. I give them a good cup of coffee and just kind of ‘be that hug’ for people when they need it.” She knows a lot about her product, too. “The Bolivian coffees are just killing it this year.”\n\nMeanwhile, in addition to electrical work, Joshua fell into the business of scouting for and refurbishing furniture from the mid-20th century. He’s now a partner with Mid Mod Collective; his workshop adjoins the retail space.\n\n“You know, mid-century modern is often imitated,” he says. “But with these designers you have real craftsmanship. I don’t take that for granted.” He doesn’t take any shortcuts either, carefully selecting the products and the methods that best serve each piece. “There’s a right way and a wrong way to do this,” he says. “I want these pieces to last another 60 years.” His favorite moments are when a customer “might not even know that I’ve refurbished something, but they spot it and they just light up.”\n\nFollowing one’s passion, supporting each others’ successes and giving back – the Happy Holler business community is rife with this philosophy. “Keep paying it forward,” says Sarah, “and it pays you back.”\n\nMore:Falafel House owner Yassin Terou honored with Knoxville Peace Award\n\nMore:Sierra Hucklebee and Gibbs check region title off the list\n\nGIBBS\n\nGibbs JROTC builds its own challenging course\n\nAli James, Shopper News correspondent\n\n“One of our students, Jordan Bishop, approached me last fall as he needed to earn an Eagle Scout badge,” said First Sgt. Kirk Tower of Gibbs High JROTC Eagle Battalion. “I said I have this wild idea to put in an obstacle course.”\n\nUltimately, Bishop’s Eagle Scout troop and the JROTC members plan to install eight or nine obstacles — some in front of the entrance to the quarter-mile nature trail and others in the woods beyond the outdoor classroom on the Gibbs High campus.\n\nConstruction has been slow. First, the students found it challenging to translate the Army drawings of the various obstacles. “The course was based off regular Army courses,” said Tower. “For safety reasons we followed their design.”\n\nThe students started working with the plans last fall, then submitted them to Knox County Schools for approval. “They had to create a bill of materials and get costings to be approved before they could start,” said Tower.\n\n“We have used volunteer labor, cash and materials donations, so the cost has been minimal,” said Tower. “Everything, the wood, the hardware, has been donated from businesses such as Home Depot, Lowe's and Tindell’s.”\n\nThen since February, the weather has caused many of the workdays to be canceled.\n\n“Four obstacles are in progress,” said Tower. “Two of them are operational.”\n\nThe current obstacles are the “Belly Robber,” where the goal is to work the logs across the wooden frame; followed by the “Six Vaults,” where team members sprint to the obstacle, place their hands on it and throw the legs over. The other two in progress are the “High Step-Over” and the “Hip-Hip.”\n\n“We can eventually add a tire flip; the options are limitless,” said Tower.\n\nOnce they have made it through the four obstacles in phase one, they will take to the trail loop to conquer obstacles, such as an inclining wall, that will be built at a later date.\n\n“We are working with a school videographer to create a safety briefing,” said Tower. “Our goal is to allow other coaches, school, community and youth groups to use the course after they view the safety procedures.”\n\nCurrently, 79 students are enrolled in the JRTOC program and are in various grades. Some are taking Advanced Placement (AP) classes while others are in the Individualized Educational Program (IEP). “One thing that helps is giving these kids structure, but they often need to do something different every so often or they get bored.”\n\nThroughout it all, Tower said the development of leadership skills has really shone through. “The Eagle Scouts and Cadet leaders have guided the volunteers through the building process,” said Tower. “You can see their minds working.”\n\nTower hopes that by building the obstacle course they can attract more students to join the JROTC. “I was trained to always seek to improve things,” he said. “If adding this obstacle course improves our numbers, I’m all for it.”\n\nA ribbon cutting ceremony will be scheduled in the fall. The addition of signs recognizing the Eagle Scouts' work, the start and finish lines are in the works as well.\n\nUNION COUNTY\n\nBEARDEN\n\nArts and barbecue draw smiles at BMS\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nAs both a teacher and a parent, Mike Weininger has noticed that some special after-school events can be almost as stressful on the parents as on the students in the spotlight.\n\nThat might be due to having to eat supper quickly and rush to get to an event, trying to find a place to sit or park, or having to wait or sit longer than desired.\n\n“I’m restless and I have a hard time going to events after school,” he admitted. “I try to make events I’m involved with as casual and easy as possible. I put the parents first.”\n\nThat was the philosophy he tried to use while helping coordinate Bearden Middle School’s recent “Night of the Arts” event.\n\nAnd by all accounts, it did end up being more fun time than stress time.\n\n“The whole event was good all around,” said Weininger, an art teacher at the school. “People were smiling and were happy.”\n\nFor the first hour during the evening event on May 10, parents and others could casually look at students’ artwork in the Commons area in the middle of the school and enjoy Archer’s catered barbecue, chips and drinks.\n\nThey could also take comfort in the fact that 20 percent of the concession proceeds were going to the Second Harvest food bank, which helps with the backpack program to help feed students in need in Knox County.\n\nAnd while the palates were being satisfied, so were the auditory senses. That was due to some singing, including snippets from the recent musical “Into the Woods Jr.,” and music from some student jazz musicians on the upper mezzanine.\n\nIf the parents and other attendees weren’t relaxed enough by then, the school tried to further help by the second hour with a choral presentation in the auditorium led by musical director Scott Williams.\n\nDespite the casualness of the evening, though, it had been planned with much thought. Weininger said they tried to tie it in with their International Baccalaureate program, including by emphasizing personal and cultural expression.\n\nThis was shown in the use of the song “This Is Me,” from the recent movie “The Greatest Showman,” as well as art displays of face cups from Weininger’s art classes and face jugs from Jessie Winston’s students. Decorative masks were also displayed, and an interactive mural was used.\n\n“We encouraged kids to show us who they are in fun and engaging ways,” Weininger said.\n\nBEARDEN\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nTindal takes on tourism amid fiscal challenges\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\nTourism coordinator Karen Tindal views her job through the lens of a tourist, asking herself, “What would entice me to come to Farragut? Where do I want to shop, dine, play and stay?” Answering those questions is her mission, and also the tag line for the Visit Farragut website she is helping the town develop; it will be launching soon.\n\nBuilding on the program originally envisioned in 2010, Tindal has been on the job since mid-February. Tasked with advancing priorities set by town staff, aldermen and public opinion, she is implementing the messaging and social media programs established prior to her hiring.\n\nA new “Just Visiting” link on the TOF website provides information on town-sponsored events throughout the year: Farragut Book Fest for Children, Bob Watt Fishing Rodeo, Lawn Chair Concert Series, Independence Day Parade, Halloween’s Freaky Friday and Light the Park are all free; bring the family.\n\nThe “New in Town” link is the go-to resource for new residents. A downloadable checklist lists emergency contacts, school information and utility services and more, making it easier to organize relocation details.\n\nOne of Tindal’s main projects now is gathering information promoting local businesses for the Visit Farragut website. Retail, restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues will able to highlight individual aspects of their establishments along with details about town-sponsored events and park activities. Using analytics from the website, she’ll be able to quantify results and determine where traffic comes from.\n\nThe tourism program and Tindal’s position have been a source of heated discussion since last September; Alderman Bob Markli was opposed to both, but was outvoted in prior votes. At issue were the part-time tourism position and the proposed hotel occupancy tax of 2.5 percent, earmarked to fund the program.\n\nThe ordinance to impose the tax failed on May 10 and in all likelihood is tabled until after the Aug. 2 election. The new board could revisit it then. So what does this mean for the tourism program and Tindal’s job?\n\nTown Administrator David Smoak gave this statement: “The tourism program was set to be funded in next year’s budget directly by revenues from the proposed tax.” Now that the money will not be available as expected, funding for the program will be limited and will take more time to implement.\n\nThat doesn’t discourage Tindal; “I’m marketing the town I love,” she said. A longtime resident, Tindal’s three children attended Farragut schools. She’s volunteered and directed many local events, saying, “I wanted to model community involvement for my kids. I didn’t take this commitment lightly. It’s a unique position for a unique town.”\n\nBringing businesses and the town together will mean spearheading a tourism advisory committee involving staff and officials, the Farragut Business Alliance, the Economic Development Committee and a variety of merchants, particularly the hotel owners. “It’s important to look at who the members will be and how we can all contribute,” Tindal said. “I’m looking forward to the challenge.”\n\nGIBBS\n\nTwo Gibbs players sign with colleges\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nGibbs High senior Zach Ellis signed to play baseball at Bluefield College in Bluefield, Va., next season.\n\nHe has been a member of the Eagles baseball team for one season, where he played centerfield and left field. Before coming to Gibbs, he was on the baseball team at Central High.\n\nEllis selected Bluefield College because it was a nice, quiet place where he felt he could get a lot of stuff done. He also liked the coaching staff for the baseball team. While at Bluefield he plans to study education. He wants to become a physical education teacher and a coach in the future.\n\nCoach Geff Davis called Ellis a \"stabilizing force in the outfield\" and commented that he contributed well at the plate for the Eagles. \"Zach does a great job running bases and owns the bat well.\"\n\nAttending the signing with Ellis were his mom, Brandy Ellis, his brothers Nicholas and Austin, his grandparents Ronald and Faye Ellis, friends and teammates.\n\nWill McSwain signed to play baseball at Roane State Community College next season. He liked that RSCC was close to home and feels that it will give him his best opportunity to advance. While in college he plans to study to be a physical therapist.\n\nHe is a utility catcher, infielder and outfielder for the Eagles. Davis said Will \"has had a great run at Gibbs\" and added that he is currently leading the team in hitting and was Offensive Player of the Year in the district this season.\n\nMcSwain said playing for Davis and the Eagles has prepared him to expect to win. He called his teammates a \"good group of guys that are always ready to play\" and said that he loved his time at Gibbs.\n\nAttending the signing with Ellis were his parents, John and Christina McSwain, and his grandfather Samuel Burchfield. His sisters Mary Claire and Morgan Grace were unable to attend, but he was surrounded by his teammates and friends at the event.\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nSOUTH\n\nItch, sting, hurt?

But never fear, a local herbalist has remedies for all that ails you this summer!\n\nStay Away Bug Spray will keep the pests away, and a nice glass of A Midsummer Night’s Tea will keep you hydrated with lemongrass and hibiscus.\n\n“It's tart, tasty, cooling, refreshing and high in electrolytes to keep you hydrated!” explains Big Bright Circle Botanicals owner Kat Itz of her summer tea.\n\nItz became interested in living a more balanced and healthy lifestyle after studying to become a Licensed Massage Therapist and yoga teacher. Those practices empowered her to discover as much as she could about her own health and well-being.\n\n“The more I uncovered about holistic health and well-being, the better I felt and the more I wanted to learn,” says Itz.\n\nIn 2012, Itz took a class at the University of Mexico to continue her education and further her knowledge about herbal medicine.\n\n“It was all about medicine-making methods, how to make tinctures and herbal infusions, salves, etc.” says Itz. “I loved how hands-on it was!”\n\nItz has also studied at a Denver herbalist school named Herbalism Roots, where she found herself delving deeper into physiology and body systems. She studied the healing properties of plants and learned more about how they related to human pathologies. There, she also learned how to be an ethical steward of the land while working with plants as medicine.\n\nAfter gaining so much useful knowledge, she launched her own line of products named Big Bright Circle Botanicals. The items she makes are 100 percent handcrafted herbal medicine and plant-based skin care that contain “no scary ingredients you can't pronounce”.\n\n“The name Big Bright Circle alludes to the many circles around us in nature, like the sun and moon, the center of a flower, the iris of an eye, but also the changing of seasons,” says Itz. “Really I could go on forever about circles!”\n\nIn addition to her teas and sprays mentioned previously, Itz offers items like her Skin Saving Salve, which is great for dry skin and scrapes, and her Oxymel products that include turmeric to combat a variety of issues.\n\n“It is excellent for so many diverse complaints, like a muscular strain or joint pain, lousy digestion, a sore throat, or just a pick me up if you're already feeling groovy and want to keep it that way!” says Itz.\n\nHer business takes the concept of being a steward of the land to heart. She works hard to stay in balance and wanted her business to reflect that commitment to the Earth and the role she plays interacting with it.\n\n“If you peel back a layer, though, Big Bright Circle is more than herbal medicine and holistic healing. It is a way for me to support the kind of community I want to be a part of, to share knowledge, give back, and also listen, learn, grow, to honor the many sources of inspiration,” says Itz.\n\nItz came to Knoxville almost two years ago and has found South Knoxville to be a welcoming community that has helped support her efforts of healing and balance through herbalism.\n\n“South Knox has embraced me,” says Itz. “I'm so happy to call it home! One of the main draws for me has always been the kind, supportive and collaborative folks in my community. I felt that especially at Vestival last weekend!”\n\nFor more information regarding services offered by Itz, visit www.bigbrightcircle.com or find Big Bright Circle on Facebook for regular updates.\n\nMore:Moonshine cookies 'flying out the door' of Knoxville business\n\nKARNS\n\nHALLS\n\nA game-changing fun run at Sterchi Elementary\n\nAli James, Shopper News correspondent\n\nSterchi Elementary school’s PTA decided to put a little twist on the usual fun run last year. When it was the fourth- and fifth-graders’ turn, they added color stations and a dance party at the end. It proved to be so popular that it has become one of the most eagerly anticipated school events for both students and teachers.\n\n“It is our second year,” said principal Lynn White. “The fourth- and fifth-graders really look forward to it. We kick it off with a pep rally on May 2. Then there are daily reminders to make pledges per lap.”\n\nBoosterthon Fun Run takes care of all of the details. The national fundraising program is used at more than 1,600 schools across the country and promotes fitness, leadership and character.\n\n“Every day there’s a character trait,” said Leslie Marmorstein, PTA president. “After the pep rally, they show documentary-style videos teaching students how to develop positive attributes. They talk about character traits, such as, trustworthiness, self-awareness, creativity, focus and it ends with a life learner.” As part of the interactive character program, the traits tie into the \"Castle Quest\" story about a character who will inherit a castle if he or she passes each character test.\n\nThere are three levels of Boosterthon events. Sterchi chose to have the Boosterthon team visit for the pep rally and set up and supervise the entire color run.\n\nAfter just nine days of fundraising, the booster culminated in a day of fun runs on the school field. Classes assembled in their homerooms before running through an inflatable tunnel. Once on the field, the organizers played the national anthem, talked about good character traits and got the crowd excited.\n\nTo start, the organizers led a pacer lap behind a checkered flag. Then as the students completed each lap, they passed through a group of volunteers, who added a check mark to the back of their race T-shirt.\n\nEvery few minutes there was an airhorn sound signaling the time to run past one of the four color stations. That was when teachers and volunteers threw colored powder over their white T-shirts.\n\nEvery student gets to participate in the fun, regardless of financial participation. Throughout the 30-minute run, students can skip, dance, walk and run to upbeat themed music. After the laps were completed, the dance party got started with a big cloud of colored powders covering the kids and adults alike.\n\n“It’s really a positive group of kids,” said Marmorstein. “This is my favorite event. It promotes leadership, fun, fitness and, of course, character.” With parent participation on the decline, contracting a full-service fundraising program made sense for the PTA. Families can gather pledges from people they know, students run the laps around the track that Boosterthon sets up and sponsors can easily pay their pledge online or by check.\n\nThis year’s fun run raised $7,000 for Sterchi Elementary School. Proceeds are earmarked to assist with both technology needs or to purchase items for the playground. If they meet their fundraising goal, the PTA also hopes to contribute to the Accelerated Reader program.\n\nGIBBS\n\nGibbs High Eagles of the Month for April\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nGibbs High School recently announced the students selected as April Eagles of the Month.\n\nSelections are made by staff members and are awarded for good grades, participation in the classroom and positive attitude. On occasion, the honor is given to a student who may have fallen on rough times but chose to work hard and make improvements in grades and attitude.\n\nRepresenting the senior class are Casey Atkins and Mason Robinson. Casey has been called \"a wonderful addition to any classroom\" and recognized for her hard work, helpfulness and sweet personality. Mason is known for being willing to help when needed with a smile on his face and positive attitude, regardless of the difficulty of the task.\n\nJunior class representatives are Zachary Bowlin and Randi Brown. Zachary is recognized for being prepared for class and going above and beyond as a student. Randi has been called a hard worker, always having her work done early and a joy to have in class.\n\nSelected from the sophomore class are Troy Davis and Sara Salmons. One of Troy's teachers said he is \"the kind of person whose positive attitude permeates through everything he does\" and said that Troy is a role model for other students. Sara is known for being prepared for class and having her work complete on time. She asks great questions in class and makes a wonderful addition to the classroom.\n\nNinth-grade students selected are Jaklyn Rutter and Zachary Sprague. Jaklyn is a creative student who always strives to do her best and is very conscious about making sure expectations from her teachers are met. One of Zachary's teachers said it simply, \"Zachary works hard every day in class.\"\n\nMore:From the runway: Spring and summer fashions benefit special needs program\n\nKNOXVILLE\n\nWUOT's Garrett McQueen is tapped by American Public Media\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nWe can say “we knew him when.”\n\nFans of WUOT-FM 91.9 have long known what a gifted announcer Garrett McQueen is. As host of The Afternoon Program, McQueen has shared musical insights from his own world as a professional bassoonist, and has introduced listeners to a variety of music by regional orchestras, people of color, women, and other composers and performers who aren’t heard very often in the classical music realm. And now he’s on his way to Saint Paul, Minn., as a hand-picked member of American Public Media (APM.)\n\nMcQueen didn’t set out to be a radio announcer. The Memphis native came to Knoxville in 2013 when he won the position of second bassoon in the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra. He says he’s loved his time here, and credits Knoxville and Knoxvillians with much of his developmental success as a musician and a person. But early on he was met with a less-than-welcoming sight: scores of Confederate flags at his very first outing with the orchestra, a Veterans Day Concert. “I didn’t even know that was a thing,” he says. That memory, coupled with a few unpleasant incidents in which he was harassed, informed his future programming at WUOT, and his subsequent rise in the public media world.\n\nA year and a half ago, he answered an ad for a sub at WUOT; soon, he was a regular. He says, “I felt it was important to expose my listeners, as much as possible, to ideas that weren’t being explored. One of the big things for me was the relationship between race and classical music.\n\n“You know, I don’t expect people to constantly think about the fact that I’m the only black musician in the KSO, but it’s something I think about. I think it’s important to show equity toward composers and genres of music that aren’t represented. I also love talking about the music of the 17th, 18th, 19th centuries – music that doesn’t necessarily have to do with race. But when I look at myself as a whole person I can’t not acknowledge those issues.”\n\nMcQueen’s programming and presence got him noticed.\n\nTodd Steed of WUOT submitted him for consideration as “a black talent in public media that you may not know, but should” to Current, a public media industry publication, and McQueen’s focus on inclusivity got him invitations to speak at the Sphinx Conference in Detroit and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. When he was invited to play with the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra last November, representatives from APM reached out.\n\nHe’ll be leaving in June to join them as host of the nationally syndicated public radio service “Classical 24.”\n\nHe’s already guest-hosted “Performance Today” for APM. He chose “music from the South” as his focus and featured the KSO in the nationally aired program. “A big thanks to Visit Knoxville for footing the bill to make that happen!” he says.\n\n“You know, when we talk about music, civil rights, women’s rights – anything – we’re so great at lauding long-dead people. And we forget that things are going on right now. Music is being written right now. And we need to pay attention to that. I’m proud to have brought that to WUOT.”\n\nMore:Shopper News photos of the week\n\nMore:See inside: $2.3 million former home of Gov.

The old fort had its historical foundations in the late 1700s as a wooden stockade designed to help repel active pirates in the area. By the beginning of the 1800s, it had been converted to the permanent brick and stone structure that stands today.\n\nAt some level it is like a lot of island forts that dot the old British Empire. For my young son and daughter, it was grand place to play and imagine pirates of another era. Its parade grounds now play home to a huge swing set where my children loved to soar in the wind.\n\nWhat fascinated me was not the structure, but its name.\n\nThe fort was named for Gen. Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis. The name might not strike you at first, but think back on your American history. This fort was named for the same Gen. Cornwallis who surrendered to George Washington at Yorktown.\n\nIt was hard for me to believe that they would name a fort for a failed general, so I did some additional research. I discovered that Gen. Cornwallis had a marvelous military career prior to the American Revolution. That was why he was assigned the task to deal with the uprising. After his surrender to Washington he returned to England, but remained well regarded. In 1786 he was appointed Governor of India. He later served as Viceroy of Ireland. When you look back over the whole of his life, his defeat to the colonist was a small part of a distinguished career. That moment did not define his story.\n\nIn the Gospel, Peter found himself consumed by shame. Jesus had told Peter that he would deny him three times before the cock crowed on that night of pain. Peter protested, but now, as the cock crowed he had done it. He had denied Jesus and it seemed that there was no way to undo it.\n\nJohn 21 invites us to the seaside some days later. The disciples were back in their boats but had caught nothing. In a scene reminiscent of an early encounter with Jesus, the disciples heard a familiar voice telling them to cast their nets off the other side of the boat. When they came to shore, they shared a breakfast with Jesus. Then, Jesus did the unthinkable. In three questions, he restored Peter. Peter had been faithful before the denials and would now again lead the disciples. The denials would not define his story.\n\nSometimes it can seem like pain or sorrow or struggle will overcome us and define us for the rest of our lives. Grace is bigger than a moment, and our God is bigger than our failures. This moment or your current struggles do not have to define you. Through faith and grace, there can be more to your story.\n\nTom Ogburn is senior pastor at First Baptist Church in downtown Knoxville.

Gold Medal math facts.\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nThird-grade students at Mooreland Heights Elementary have spent this school year learning 0-12 multiplication facts (at a rate of 25 per minute) and they gathered May 11 at Charter Doyle Park to show off what they knew and to compete for the gold medal in the Gold Medal Math competition.\n\nThe park was set up to resemble an Olympic-style course, complete with torch and five colored rings hanging behind the winners podium. Students competed in events for which they qualified and had to master the math facts the quickest to win points. Games such as \"Dressed to the Nines\" and \"Doughnut Dash\" made the event a fun competition with students racing to the finish line feeling successful. The end game – where students had to remember random facts – proved to be tough, but each team covered their game board (45 squares) with the team's representative colored squares.\n\nThe results: Gold medal went to Team Resourceful; silver medal was awarded to Team Tenacious; the bronze medal went to Team Amicable and fourth-place honors were given to Team Steadfast.

The walk is at the front of the school and featured personalized bricks from Gibbs alumni and community members.\n\nA classroom set of (30) Chromebooks and a charging station were purchased for use by students in the library or may be checked out as a whole set by a teacher. Several of the feeder schools to Gibbs High (Holston Middle and Corryton Elementary) are technology schools, and the foundation thought it important to have the high school they feed into also have technology available for the classroom.\n\nFairview Baptist Church donated over $26,000 for lighting improvements and other needed items in the school auditorium. Guests visiting the auditorium will notice two recently installed large-screen televisions on the sides of the stage.\n\nBoard member Don Ogle and A.C.E. Electric donated and installed outdoor lighting at the school entrance to enhance safety during evening events. Donations from the community through the foundation's barbecue luncheon, County Commissioner Dave Wright and board member Gary Acuff allow the foundation to give back to the school when needs arise.

Principal Robbie Norman is at the epicenter, and has been for 14 years – greeting students, listening to stories and \"wrapping my arms around my students and staff.\"\n\nNorman pauses to sing “take me out to the ballgame” with a student, fixes a backpack zipper, listens to bug facts from a first-grader and “giggles for no real reason” with a fourth-grader. All while dispensing hugs.\n\n“I came from Mooreland Heights Elementary, where we had 350 students, to Brickey, where there were 900,” said Norman. “I needed to wrap my arms around them still. I can see them every morning, and it is a way to be visible to all my students. I can look at their faces and see if something is not quite right or if they are excited.”\n\nNext up are school announcements, and Norman heads to the media center. A fifth-grade team films and broadcasts the daily updates to every classroom. “This way every student feels like they get to see me every day,” she said.\n\nAfter graduating from Carter High and the University of Tennessee, Norman taught first-grade at Carter Elementary. “I definitely felt drawn to this calling: 'Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart,' said Norman. “I loved being a first-grade teacher and felt it would be all that I would do.”\n\nNorman taught for 20 years and earned her master's in administration and supervision.\n\n“The passion for becoming a principal just grew, but I was not quite ready,” she said. “I applied to be a curriculum coach.” Working at five schools in three years, Norman was able to watch five principals at work and see the things she did and didn’t want to add to her principalship.\n\nNorman decided she was ready to “make a difference in the lives of a whole school full of children.\" She accepted the position of principal at Mooreland Heights. In Norman’s fifth year at the school, she was recognized as Principal of the Year. “It was a highlight; the staff and I had worked so hard to have the highest gains that year in Knox County,” she said.\n\nFifteen years ago, the new Brickey Elementary building was built, with input from former principal Susan Turner. “She made the decisions and enjoyed it for a year before she turned it over to me,” said Norman. “We know what a gift we have with the whole school on one level and the different wings; it’s three acres under one roof.”\n\nNorman is set to officially retire on June 29, after she helps transition the new principal (who has not yet been named).\n\n“It’s a huge decision, this is 42 years and I wasn’t sure how I could stop, because I love what I do,” said Norman. “For the last three years I thought about it, but never felt completely at peace; I still felt so excited about coming to school. Everything came together in my heart and mind when I finally made my decision, I was at peace. Once again I am following my heart and that says it’s time.”\n\nMore:4 West Knoxville parks you can't miss this summer\n\nPOWELL\n\nKARNS\n\nGirl Scouts build robots, go for STEM badges\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nGirl Scouts aren’t just about the cookies. The organization recently rolled out 23 new badges for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) related subjects including Earth science, Leap Bot engineering, and robotics.\n\nThis fall another series, or Journey, will roll out. “It’s Your Planet – Love It!\" The girls will explore the natural world by learning about the water cycle, completing energy audits, assessing air quality, calculating their \"food print,” and figuring out how much trash is created and how to reduce it.\n\nFor now, the girls of Beaver Ridge Troop 22045 are working on their Robotics Journey. They gathered at the Karns Youth Center to build a tin can robot with movable arms and googly eyes Monday, May 14.\n\nThey had to assemble the robot, wire it and insert the motor so that it could move. While the girls had plenty of can do attitude, no one finished the robot in one meeting. It typically takes three to five meetings to complete a badge. A Journey contains several badges.\n\n“We let them take as long as they need and they do everything on their own. We’re here to help, but we don’t take over. It’s trial and error for them. That’s the way they learn and they’ll be happy with themselves in the end,” said troop co-leader Jennifer Contreras.\n\nTo get all the badges in the Robot Journey the girls learn what robots are, how robots move, build a robot, design a robot, and showcase robots where they teach others what they learned in order to instill leadership.\n\nAfter learning what a robot is, the girls visited the Apple store to learn how to make a robot move using a simple program.\n\nEach level of Girl Scouts, from Daisies to Juniors to Ambassadors, takes a Journey working age-appropriate projects.\n\nIn Troop 22045, a multilevel troop, while the Brownies were assembling a tin can robot, the Daisies were learning about circuit boards. The Juniors recently learned how to assemble an EV-2 robot, which is more advanced than the tin can robot.\n\n“The girls really love going after the STEM badges, they learn that they can do anything the boys can do,\" said Contreras. \"They aren’t the easiest badges in the world to earn; there are some struggles. The girl learn that they can do anything they set their minds to, even if it’s a male-dominated field. They can go into the field their Dad is working in.\n\n“I think there are far more males in STEM related fields than females. Earning the STEM badges gives them a leg up and a step forward into gaining an interest in STEM fields and it happens at a very young age. They get exposure to STEM fields they might otherwise never be exposed to, or at least not at this young and impressionable age.\n\n“Girl Scouts are almost twice as likely as non-Girl Scouts to participate in STEM fields.\n\n“We had a Brownie, a second-grader, have an 'aha' moment when she learned that she could be a computer programmer just like her dad. She learned she can do anything a boy can do, and she’s farther ahead on building the tin can robot than anyone else.\n\nTroop 22045 meets every other Monday and every other Thursday at the Karns Youth Center.\n\nInfo: email Jennifer Contreras at abbysmom5@yahoo.com\n\n'Wilder Day' at A.L. Lotts: a unique look back\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nWhen Kathy Alexander was young, she was at her great-grandmother’s Knoxville home and was reading the Laura Ingalls Wilder book “Little House in the Big Woods” with much interest.\n\nBut then her great-grandmother, Merle Lloyd, added a realistic twist to the autobiographical children’s novel – she had also grown up as a pioneer in Wisconsin and had some experiences similar to Wilder's.\n\n“I thought that was the coolest thing,” Alexander recalled. “She took an interest in what I was reading and said, ‘This is real.’ ”\n\nAs a schoolteacher, Alexander has tried to add some real experiences as well to inspire her students and enhance their learning. What has resulted has been a quarter-century of Laura Ingalls Wilder Day programs at A.L. Lotts Elementary.\n\nFor her, this unique tradition for the fourth-graders at the Westland Drive school has never become burdensome, despite all the work involved.\n\n“I live for this day, and the children enjoy it,” she said while taking a brief break during this year’s special day on May 11. “I meet people in the grocery stores who were in this 20 years ago, and they say something like, ‘I was Nellie in the play.’ This is a rite of passage for fourth-graders here.”\n\nDespite all the fun had once again at this year’s special day – complete with dances and games, a play, old-fashioned craft demonstrations, a wagon ride and a family picnic – it was also likely a little melancholy for Alexander.\n\nThe reason is that she is retiring at the end of the school year, and this was her last year to coordinate the day as a full-time faculty member. However, she hopes the school keeps the tradition going and she will be glad to help as a retired volunteer, especially because her granddaughter attends the school.\n\n“Many parents and their children have approached me about the continuation of this special day in years to come,” she said. “It has yet to be decided as to what form that may take. I am certainly willing to help after I retire, as long as the students read the Laura Ingalls Wilder books.”\n\nWhile its future is uncertain, the past was an obvious part of the special day that Friday. Students and teachers were dressed in 19th century pioneer clothing and enthusiastically took part or watched the various activities inspired by Wilder’s books based on her childhood experiences.\n\nA highlight was a somewhat surprise appearance via Skype by Alison Arngrim, who played Laura’s friend, Nellie Oleson, in the 1970s and '80s NBC TV series “Little House on the Prairie.”\n\nAlexander said the youngsters had written out questions, but they did not know until that day that she would appear remotely from Philadelphia, where she was appearing at a comedy show.\n\n“She answered questions, like how it was to play somebody mean when you are not mean, and did she and Laura get along in real life,” Alexander said. They also wanted to know if a needle was really stuck in her foot in the episode titled “Bunny,” when she becomes paralyzed, she added.\n\nGoing that extra step to bring the past even more to life through the special programs is certainly not new to Alexander. In 1986, when she had her first Laura Ingalls Wilder Day while teaching at Sequoyah Elementary, actress Melissa Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the TV series, made a special appearance in person.\n\n“She came that day and answered questions,” Alexander recalled. “She was gracious and wonderful and talked to children on their level.”\n\nAlexander continued to have some sort of special day or event to help the students, including in a modified form at PTA meetings when she was at Sarah Moore Greene Elementary from 1991-93.\n\nWhen A.L. Lotts opened near Pellissippi Parkway in 1993 and she began teaching there, the event really took off.\n\n“It goes with the curriculum,” she added in explaining a big reason why she coordinates the program every year. “We study pioneer life, and I want something real for my children with family values.”\n\nWhile the offerings have changed over the years, including going from having a covered-dish picnic to students bringing their own food or purchasing a pioneer-style meal in the cafeteria, the fun enjoyed by the students has not changed.\n\nFor example, fourth-graders Bryce Coulter, Natalie Newman and Landry McMurray were wearing big smiles along with their 19th century-style clothing.\n\nBryce said he enjoyed the dances, enthusiastically adding, “It was probably the best thing I ever experienced in my life. It was really fun.”\n\nNatalie said she enjoyed the play and portraying Laura Ingalls, while Landry liked the play and finally getting to take part as a fourth-grader. “They only do it in the fourth grade, and it is a really big thing for me,” she said.\n\nIt has been a pretty big event for Alexander, too.\n\n“I love this day because it brings to life what the students have studied about in social studies class,” she said. “The stories are real. Any time you can encourage children to do hands-on activities, sing songs, get up and move, or act something out, it makes what they have read become a part of them.”\n\nMore:Victor Ashe: Madeline Rogero fills airport post; police chief pick likely next\n\nBEARDEN\n\nOPINION\n\nContouring the body, bending the mind\n\nLeslie Snow, Shopper News columnist\n\nOn the day I learned that Jada Pinkett Smith’s 64-year-old mother has chiseled abs and a rockin’ bikini bod, I bought my first pair of Spanx. The irony hit me like a ton of bar-bells. I thought about Jada’s mom while I was driving to West Town Mall to purchase my new undergarment.\n\nI wondered what her life was like. Does she work out six hours a day? Does she live on chia seeds and iceberg lettuce? Does she stare at her naked body in awe or is her inner voice cruel and judgmental despite those impressive abs. Mostly I wondered if she was happy.\n\nStill deep in thought, I browsed the racks of intimate apparel until I found a 20-something saleslady willing to talk me through the endless iterations of Spanx.\n\nIn case you don’t know the term, Spanx is a modern-day girdle designed by a woman for women. (Should we say thank you?) In the continuum of female undergarments, first come corsets, then girdles, and then Spanx. If you Google corsets, and I did, you might be surprised to discover they originated in Italy and were introduced to the French court in the 1500s. They spread in popularity and were a big hit during the Victorian era when a minuscule waist was all the rage.\n\nThat means that for over 500 years, women have been binding themselves to perpetuate a fantasy of what women should look like. And there I was, at the mall, becoming one of those women by squeezing into what is essentially a Spandex sock.\n\nWhen I mentioned the tight fit to the saleslady, she chuckled softly. “If it’s comfortable,” she said, “it’s probably not doing its job.” Well I can tell you, my Spanx was doing a great job. Talk about an overachiever.\n\nClad in my Spanx, I stared at my body in the mirror and thought of Jada Pinkett Smith’s mom and her rockin’ bikini bod. And I realized, it’s either Spanx or sit-ups. So, I grabbed the Spanx and headed for the checkout counter.\n\nThe sales lady and I shared a moment. I mentioned that the Spanx was about the same price as the dress I just bought, and she laughed. Then she said something amusing like “At least it will always be in style.” I chuckled, heartily. But I wanted to have a deep conversation about corsets and body image and the role of women in society. “Can you be a feminist,” I asked her, “and still wear Spanx?” “Get over yourself,” she said with a wry smile. “Everyone you know wears them.”\n\nI wondered about that as I handed her my credit card. And I wondered about it again as I was walking out of the department store. I was so deep in thought that I almost didn’t hear the saleslady call out to me. “Ma'am! Ma'am!” she yelled. “Come back!”\n\nI turned to face her. I thought she wanted to continue our conversation about gender roles and the objectification of women. I thought she might tell me I was right to question my Spanx purchase.\n\nBut what she said was, “Your dress is tucked into your underwear.” I reached back and confirmed her assessment. “Why, yes, it is!” I said in surprise. And I laughed all the way to my car.\n\nSpanx or no Spanx, I am what I am. I am a 54-year-old woman walking through the mall with her dress tucked into her underwear. That’s who I am. I am gloriously imperfect. And I think I’m OK with that.\n\nLeslie Snow may be reached at snowcolumn@aol.com.\n\nMore:Catch up on last week's blog!", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2022/06/15/des-moines-2022-summer-shows-concerts-festivals-central-iowa/9571961002/", "title": "55 of Central Iowa's best summer concerts, shows and festivals", "text": "Summer is nearly here and with the arrival of the season comes a slew of concerts, festivals and other in-person events.\n\nWhile some events that happened last year, like the Riverview Music Festival and Big Country Bash, will be absent from central Iowa this year, here are more than 55 events Iowans can look forward to this summer.\n\nFREE MUSIC EVENTS\n\nWhere: Various\n\nWhen: Throughout the summer\n\nAll through the summer, a variety of central Iowa venues have free concert series available to Iowans.\n\nThese include Hoyt Sherman Place's Jazz in July series, Windsor Heights' Nights in the Heights, Valley Junction's Music in the Junction, Jasper Winery's Summer Concert Series, Summer Sundaze at the Jamie Hurd Amphitheater, Sunday Tunes at Summerset Winery, the Iowa Municipal Band Festival in Boone and Tunes in the Trees in Madrid, among many others.\n\nMore:From Todrick Hall to Drag Queen Story Time, here's a guide to Des Moines' 30 Days of Pride\n\nDes Moines Arts Festival (and concerts, too!)\n\nWhere: Western Gateway Park, 1205 Locust St., Des Moines\n\nWhen: June 24-26\n\nThe first major event of the summer is the Des Moines Arts Festival, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary.\n\nThe annual event gathers thousands of people each year for a weekend of art, entertainment and food.

The numbers were generated by a cryptic two-line software code Tipton had planted in his employer’s computer system at the Multi-State Lottery Association.\n\nThe office building was virtually empty as Tipton ran test after test, zeroing in on the possible winning numbers for an upcoming $4.8 million lottery jackpot drawing in Colorado.\n\nHis code would let him narrow the drawing’s winning odds from 5 million to 1 to 200 to 1.\n\nAnd, over time, it would allow him to hijack at least five winning drawings totaling more than $24 million in prizes in Colorado, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma — the biggest lottery scam in U.S. history.\n\nThe largest jackpot, a $16.5 million Hot Lotto prize in Iowa in 2010, was never paid. And ultimately, it would be the one that would do Tipton in.\n\nThe seed that started it all\n\nTipton, who loved playing the fantasy game “Dungeons and Dragons,” told himself he wasn’t trying to crack the code for the money.\n\nInstead, the Texas native described by his brother as “a very large” and “kind of lonesome” man, was inspired by the challenge.\n\nAn offhand conversation with a co-worker, Gene Schaller, in 2005 set the challenge in motion, Tipton told investigators.\n\n“Hey, did you put your secret numbers in there?” Schaller asked him.\n\n“What do you mean?” Tipton replied.\n\n“Well, you know, you can set numbers on any given day, since you wrote the software.”\n\nSchaller, who remains an accountant for the Multi-State Lottery Association, wouldn't comment for this article.\n\nThat night in 2005, the 41-year-old bachelor began a fraud that even he had no idea would eventually shake the lottery industry to its core.\n\n\"It was never my intent to start a full-out ticket scam,” Eddie told investigators during his June 29 post-conviction confession sessions in the Hoover State Office Building in Des Moines.\n\nA criminal past and a job offer\n\nTo be truthful, Tipton never expected he’d land an interview with the Multi-State Lottery Association, let alone be hired and eventually become one of the most entrusted lottery security officials in the nation.\n\nThe association is owned and operated by 36 member lotteries, mostly state organizations such as the Iowa Lottery. It's responsible for many of the nation's most popular and richest lotteries, including Powerball and Hot Lotto.\n\nTipton had pleaded guilty in 1982 for his part in a warehouse burglary. The then 19-year-old faced up to 20 years in prison for the felony conviction, but instead was given two years of probation and was ordered to pay $1,719 in restitution, court records show.\n\nAnd before his burglary conviction, Tipton had been convicted of stealing computer software from a department store. Tipton told federal investigators more than 20 years later that the software theft was a “Jerry Springer-style” incident that was “more of an argument with a Sears employee.”\n\nIn 2003, as he sat for an interview, Tipton told Ed Stefan, his prospective boss at the Multi-State Lottery Association, about both convictions. So he was surprised when the association paid to fly him from Texas to Des Moines for an in-person job interview.\n\nWhy lottery association executives overlooked Tipton’s criminal convictions isn't entirely clear. MUSL knew about the burglary when Tipton was hired, according to court documents.\n\nState law prohibits felons working for the Iowa Lottery. But that law does not apply to MUSL employees.\n\nBret Tyone, CEO of the Multi-State Lottery Association, said he couldn't comment or provide a copy of the association's employee code of conduct, citing ongoing litigation. Stefan did not return calls for comment.\n\nBut former deputy Iowa Attorney General Thomas H. Miller made it clear in an interview this year that he believes Tipton should never have been given the opportunity to land a job where he would design the software that randomly picked the winning numbers for the Multi-State Lottery Association.\n\n\"A thief is a thief,” Miller told Game Show Network.\n\nA Bigfoot hunt, a lottery win and a duped FBI\n\nTipton’s initial late-night sticky note session resulted in his scam’s first win — a Nov. 23, 2005, drawing in Colorado.\n\nThe stars aligned for that game: It was a major jackpot — $4.8 million — and it landed on one of the three dates during the year that he was able to manipulate with his secret code.\n\nThe opportunity was especially convenient because of his brother’s hunt for Bigfoot.\n\nTommy Tipton’s fascination with folklore surrounding the ape-like creature began as a child, when his grandmother retold stories about a critter that would spook their farm animals in Arkansas.\n\nAnd it just so happened that Tommy’s pursuit of Bigfoot was taking him to Colorado in November 2005.\n\nEddie, who said few people possessed the \"geekiness\" necessary to understand his work, seized the opportunity to try out his rigged coding.\n\n“My brother was going on a trip, and I suggested that I had some numbers that he could play,\" he told investigators. \"And that was pretty much it.\"\n\nBut the story, according to his brother, was far more nuanced.\n\nTommy, who by 2005 was a magistrate in Fayette County, Texas, was skeptical whether it was legal for him to play the hundreds of sets of numbers given him by his brother, an employee of the lottery association.\n\nTommy told investigators he contacted a friend, Texas defense attorney Luis Vallejo, to consult about the matter. Vallejo could find no reason that it would be illegal for him to play, even though Eddie worked for the lottery association, Tommy said.\n\nAfter the winning numbers were drawn Nov. 23, 2005, three people came forward to claim the $4.8 million prize: a Colorado resident not linked to the conspiracy; Alexander Hicks, a friend of Tommy’s whom he had recruited to cash the ticket; and Texas lawyer Thad Whisenant, who had created a Nevada limited liability-corporation called Cuestion de Suerte (Question of Luck).\n\nThe Colorado resident’s claim came from an “easy pick” ticket, meaning the numbers were selected by a machine. Investigators ruled that purchase legitimate.\n\nBut the others drew their suspicion. Whisenant and Vallejo were publicly named by investigators, who in August 2016 asked the public for assistance in the case.\n\nThey were never arrested.\n\nWhom can you trust?\n\nTommy told investigators during his June 29, 2017, deposition that he believed Vallejo somehow stole the numbers he had been given by his brother, although Tommy said he never directly confronted him about it.\n\nHicks — who was never charged with a crime — gave 90% of the nearly $570,000 cash-option prize payout from the jackpot to Tommy. Cuestion de Suerte collected the same amount.\n\nNeither Vallejo nor Whisenant returned calls for this article. Whisenant was never asked to return the money he collected.\n\nTommy remains bitter about the outcome.\n\n“It was a big shock to me to hear that an attorney whom I went to for advice played the lottery,\" he said of Vallejo.\n\nSoon after the 2005 win, Tommy fell from a 31-foot tree stand while Bigfoot hunting and “almost died,” he told investigators. He was in the hospital in 2006 when the FBI questioned him about why he was trying to exchange $450,000 in consecutively marked bills.\n\nTommy truthfully told the agents the money came from the 2005 Colorado lottery win. But he told them he was trying to exchange the bills because he couldn’t tell his wife of the win since gambling was contrary to her Christian faith.\n\nIn neither the first nor a subsequent interview did the FBI ask about the work his brother was doing for the Multi-State Lottery Association — and Tommy never volunteered the information.\n\nEventually, the FBI dropped its inquiry, and the Tiptons resumed their lottery scheme.\n\nFrustrated Eddie warns his bosses\n\nAs the head of the Multi-State Lottery Association's IT security, Eddie Tipton was making almost $100,000 a year. But he felt underappreciated and overworked at the time he wrote the code to hack into the national lottery system.\n\nHe was working 50- to 60-hour weeks and often was in the office until 11 p.m. His managers expected him to take on far more roles than were practical, he complained.\n\n\"I wrote software. I worked on Web pages. I did network security. I did firewalls,\" he said in his confession. \"And then I did my regular auditing job on top of all that. They just found no limits to what they wanted to make me do. It even got to the point where the word ‘slave’ was used.\"\n\nNobody at the Multi-State Lottery Association oversaw his complete body of work, and few people truly cared about security, he said. That lack of oversight allowed Tipton to write, install and use his secret code without discovery.\n\nTipton said he even warned lottery officials about the system's security risks and alerted them in 2006 about an error in the random-drawing software after the same numbers were drawn in the same order in the same year in a Wisconsin game.\n\nSoon after his first successful lottery scam, Eddie said he offered a fix that would have thwarted his ability to predict winning numbers — appointing a second person to oversee some of the most crucial processes of the random-generator software.\n\nHis immediate boss, Stefan, took the concerns seriously, he said, but others in the organization did not. Most of his concerns were dismissed or inadequately addressed, Tipton complained.\n\n“I’d do reviews and I’d find stuff — gaping holes in their procedures — and I would tell them, but if it wasn't in my rules, the MUSL rules, I couldn’t write it down,\" he said. \"I couldn’t document that I saw this gaping hole because they didn’t want to hear it or they didn’t want it written down anywhere.”\n\nAnd so the secret code survived.\n\nThat code was replicated on as many as 17 state lottery systems as MUSL integrated the random-number software Tipton designed. For nearly a decade, it allowed Tipton to rig the drawings for games played on three dates each year: May 27, Nov. 23 and Dec. 29.\n\nTipton's software version is no longer used.\n\nThe big mistake\n\nIt was on Dec. 23, 2010, that Eddie made a miscalculation that ultimately unraveled his scheme: He bought a winning ticket himself.\n\nBefore, he had always funneled winning numbers to others.\n\nVideo captured his ticket purchase at a Des Moines convenience store about 10 miles from the Multi-State Lottery Association offices.\n\nThough he knew the Iowa Lottery had retained a video of the purchase, Eddie told one of his best friends, Robert Rhodes, that he could claim the ticket if he wanted.\n\nBut Eddie gave Rhodes one caveat: Don’t wait until the last minute to claim the ticket.\n\nThat advice was ignored.\n\nRhodes participated in an intricate plan to claim the prize anonymously — less than two hours before the 4 p.m. deadline on Dec. 29, 2011.\n\nThe 11th-hour scheme to claim the ticket captivated the public's attention. The $16.5 million jackpot was the third-largest prize in Hot Lotto's history.\n\nFor weeks, lottery officials had peppered news media across the country to publicize the unclaimed ticket. Then, just as the year-long window was to expire, two attorneys representing a trust showed up at Iowa Lottery headquarters to claim the prize.\n\nBut Iowa law requires Iottery winners' names and addresses to be made public, and the mystery over who was behind the claim dominated newscasts for weeks.\n\nDespite the intense scrutiny, it would take investigators roughly three years to connect Tipton to the Hot Lotto rigging. On Jan. 15, 2015, he was charged with two counts of felony fraud.\n\nHe later faced other charges, mostly related to money laundering and fraudulent wins in other states.\n\nHis brother Tommy and Rhodes also were charged with felonies related to the rigged drawings.\n\nRhodes, of Sugar Land, Texas, pleaded guilty to a felony charge of being party to a computer crime and was sentenced in March 2017 to six months of home confinement in Texas and ordered to pay $409,000 in restitution.\n\nHe agreed to testify against Eddie and Tommy Tipton as part of his plea deal.\n\nTommy and Eddie pleaded guilty to felony crimes related to the rigging scheme in June 2017 and agreed to repay $2.2 million in restitution.\n\nTommy admitted claiming prizes in Colorado and Oklahoma using numbers Eddie provided. He was sentenced to 75 days in jail.\n\nEddie was sentenced in August to up to 25 years in prison.\n\nEddie, 54, did not respond to a request to speak for this article. He is serving his sentence in Iowa's Clarinda Correctional Facility.\n\nIt's uncertain how many years Eddie will spend in prison. He could be paroled within three or four years, his attorneys noted at his sentencing last year.\n\nHe has paid $25,000 of his $16.8 million in restitution, according to the most recent court records filed in January.\n\nMore from the USA TODAY Network on this story:\n\nMore:They cheated the Iowa Lottery but got to keep the money\n\nMore:Some Iowa Lottery retail employees win big, raising suspicions\n\nMore:Iowa Lottery takes a pass on fixes to stop cheaters.

W. Milam and Roy Bryant, the case fell from the news and the players in the saga all fell out of the spotlight. What happened to the key figures in the case in the years after they were momentarily thrust into the spotlight in the summer of 1955?\n\nUpdate:Carolyn Bryant Donham, woman at center Emmett Till lynching, dies\n\nMemorial:Statue honoring Emmett Till's mother, Mamie Till-Mobley to be unveiled in Illinois\n\nThe only one to emerge publicly at the national level was Mamie Bradley, but it did not happen for 30 years. Things began settling down for her a few months after the murder trial when her speaking engagements ended, yet she never returned to the job he held at the Air Force office in Chicago. Instead, she enrolled at Chicago Teachers College in the fall of 1956 and graduated cum laude three and a half years later. She earned her degree in January 1960 and began teaching, first at Carter Elementary and later at Scanlon School. She retired in 1983 after a total of 23 years with Chicago’s public schools.\n\nOn June 24, 1957, after dating three years, 35-year-old Mamie Bradley married Gene Mobley, a union that lasted 43 years, ending only with Gene’s death in 2000. Bradley, who became known as Mamie Till-Mobley, never bore another child but helped nurture Gene’s two daughters after their mother moved from Chicago.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Mobley’s mother, Alma Spearman, formed the Emmett Till Foundation, the goals of which were to build Christian character and a sense of citizenship in young people. It held its first annual banquet in Chicago in July 1966. The nonprofit organization eventually began a long tradition of awarding scholarships to deserving youth annually on July 25 — Emmett’s birthday.\n\nTill-Mobley created an additional way of keeping her son’s memory alive by establishing a performing group in 1973, the Emmett Till Players, made up of children who memorized and recited the speeches of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Over the years they performed at schools and churches, and a decade after its founding, Till-Mobley estimated that over 200 children had been part of the troupe. In 1984, the Emmett Till Players even performed in Mississippi.\n\nIn 1975 Till-Mobley earned a master’s degree in administration and supervision from Loyola University, with an additional 45 credits toward a doctorate.\n\nShe began speaking nationally about her son after 1985. Although widowed in 2000, Mamie’s life remained eventful for the next three years as she continued her activities with the Emmett Till Foundation. She also traveled and spoke, despite the heart and kidney problems she had long battled. In fact, it was on January 6, 2003, the eve of a planned departure for a speaking event in Atlanta, that she suffered a heart attack. She died that afternoon at Jackson Park Hospital. She was 81 years old. Her memoir, Death of Innocence: The Story of the Hate Crime that Changed America, was published posthumously later that year.\n\nMoses Wright, the star witness of the trial, moved to Argo Summit, Illinois, just days after the trial, too afraid to continue life in the Mississippi Delta. For most of the 22 years that followed, he lived quietly, outside of the public eye, although he traveled the West for the NAACP speaking during the month of November 1955. A year after the trial he reported that he was working odd jobs and had even gained 13 pounds since moving to the North. “I used to think I couldn’t live without seeing cotton stalks. Man, I ain’t seen cotton in a year, and I’m still living,” he told a reporter. The former preacher had already come to see the impact of the Till case for the fledgling Civil Rights Movement, and stated, almost prophetically, “What happened down there last year is going to help us all.”\n\nWright eventually found work as a custodian at a nightclub and later as a dishwasher at a local restaurant, working alongside a grandson. Adjusting to the big city after spending a lifetime in the rural Mississippi Delta was not easy. Wright, who left his car behind in Mississippi, never drove again after his move to Argo, but with the proximity of stores and schools, and the availability of public transportation, he didn’t need to. He gave up fishing after leaving the South, but the railroad let him use a little patch of land on which to grow a garden, which he kept up until he was 79. “That was his joy,” recalled his son, Simeon.\n\nIn 1970, Moses’s wife, Elizabeth, died, and over the next seven years, his health declined. He eventually had prostate surgery which affected the strength in his legs. Living alone, he did the best he could but in time his eyesight began to wane, and other health problems made it difficult for him to keep up his one-bedroom apartment. One time while home alone he lost his balance and fell. He remained on the floor for a day until his grandson, who had a key to the door, came to check on him. His family eventually placed him in the White Oak Nursing Home in Indian Head Park. He died on Aug. 3, 1977. The photo of Wright standing and pointing at two accused killers in Sumner remains a testament to bravery in a Mississippi courtroom.\n\nProsecution witness Willie Reed, whose testimony placed the murder in Sunflower County and was the source that other men besides J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant were involved in the murder, knew Emmett Till only in death but remained haunted for decades by the beating sounds he heard emanating from a plantation shed on an August morning. “That’s something you never put out of your mind. I remember it like it happened yesterday,” he said in 2007.\n\nAfter speaking at a few rallies following his late-night move to Chicago on the day the jury issued its verdict, Reed dropped out of sight. He had no contact with any of the other witnesses or Till family members for decades, despite living in Chicago and remaining in close proximity to many of them. He reemerged for interviews in 1999.\n\nIn Chicago, Reed obtained a new identity, or more accurately, reclaimed his old one. From the time he was 7 months old until he left Mississippi, he lived with his grandfather, Add Reed, and assumed Add’s surname. In Chicago, when Willie obtained a copy of his birth certificate in order to secure a Social Security number, he discovered that his last name was actually Louis, after his father, Joseph Louis. He went by his legal name of Willie Louis from then on, further obscuring his association with the Till case. In fact, most of his friends only learned of his role as a witness after seeing him on television in 2003. After the trial he was offered a $1,000 scholarship from the Elks Club should he have chosen to attend college, but he never took advantage of that. “I just didn’t want to do it,” he later said with regret.\n\nAround 1959, he began working as a surgical orderly at Chicago’s Jackson Park Hospital and remained there for 47 years before retiring in 2006. While working in the intensive care unit in 1971, he met Juliet Mendenhall, then a nurse’s aide. They married in 1976 and made their home in the Englewood area. Willie, who suffered from nightmares for several years into their marriage, did not even tell his wife about his role in the Till case until 1983. His 2001 interview for the documentary, The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till, reunited him with Mamie Till-Mobley, whom he had not seen in 46 years. After several years of declining health, Willie Louis died of gastronomical bleeding in July 2013 at age 76.\n\nLevi “Too Tight” Collins, one of the black field hands forced to participate in the kidnapping and murder, never got his life back on track after the case faded from the news. Following the trial, he worked odd jobs in Jackson and Memphis but disappeared again in 1957. Some said he feared revenge from local whites who worried that he might talk or by blacks angry because he hadn’t. “I’m plumb worried about the boy,” his 46-year-old father, Walter Collins, said at the time. “We used to be close. He’d come over to my place almost daily and we’d chat. Now I haven’t seen him but once in three years.”\n\nIn November 1957, Collin’s wife Treola and their four children arrived in Seattle at the invitation of Treola’s sister, who borrowed $246 from her minister and sent train tickets by way of the Memphis railroad station. “We had to slip off the plantation to catch the train, but we didn’t give our right names,” Treola explained. “We only had the clothing on our backs. I used an old bed spread for diapers on my 6-months-old baby. We had one loaf of bread and one can of peaches to eat.”\n\nLevi surfaced long enough for the couple to divorce, because Treola eventually remarried in 1960. Levi never resumed a relationship with his children, all of whom Treola’s second husband adopted. Treola managed to create a new life for herself in Seattle, where she bore five more children. Levi was not so lucky. Family members heard enough to know that the case completely destroyed him. He became an alcoholic and schizophrenic, hearing voices and hallucinating. He died in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1992.\n\nHenry Lee Loggins was another black man whose name has been tied to the case as an unwilling accomplice. After spending six months in jail in 1956 for theft of some iron belonging to J.W. Milam, he left Mississippi. At first, he moved to St. Louis, where he had lived a few years earlier, but then moved to Dayton, Ohio, in 1957. He did not surface publicly until July 2001 when historians David and Linda Beito found him and interviewed him over the telephone. For years he made a living in Dayton as a junkman. He later appeared in Untold Story and on a 60 Minutes segment about the case, where he denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Till murder. In 2005, Loggins became incapacitated after suffering a stroke but spent time in a nursing home and later at his daughter’s home recovering. He died in Dayton in October 2009. Since 1982, his stepson Johnny B. Thomas has been mayor of the village of Glendora, Mississippi, former home to both Loggins and J. W. Milam.\n\nDistrict Attorney Gerald Chatham, whose impassioned closing arguments in the case captivated everyone present, passed away only one year after his attempt to convict the two half-brothers. Because of notoriety in the Till case, the death of this otherwise unknown country lawyer was noted in the New York Times. Ill health had forced his retirement in January 1956. He suffered not only from high blood pressure but from nose bleeds so severe that he was often admitted to the hospital, where doctors had to pack his head in ice to stop them.\n\nChatham returned to private practice in Hernando, Mississippi, but on Oct. 9, 1956, he came home after speaking at an event, took a nap, and later that evening died of a massive heart attack.\n\nHamilton Caldwell, the elected attorney for Tallahatchie County who served on the prosecution team, lived for seven years after the trial. He was out of office and serving as vice president of the Bank of Charleston when he drowned in Enid Lake on Sept. 3, 1962. He had been fishing alone in his boat and for reasons unknown, fell overboard as he headed back to shore. He was 64.\n\nRobert Smith, the special prosecutor sent by the governor’s office to aid Chatham in the state’s case against Milam and Bryant, went back to his law practice in Ripley after the trial. He rarely talked about the case. “I’ve come to understand that not a lot of people in those days would have taken that case,” said son Fred in 2003. “I know now it took a lot of courage.” Bobby Elliot, a former law partner of Smith’s, remembered how surprised people were that Smith agreed to do it. “That wasn’t the popular thing to do back then.”\n\nOn Dec. 4, 1967, he was at work in Chancery Court and appeared fine. Yet privately, he was masking unbearable pain and went home later that morning and shot himself. Although he did not allude to his father’s suicide, Smith’s son, Bruce, explained in 2005 that his father had been battling alcoholism. “He had a sad life in a way, in his later years.” Smith’s obituary noted that he had helped with “important criminal cases” in his career, but it failed to mention the Till trial in particular.\n\nThe five defense attorneys who represented Milam and Bryant remained in Sumner. Sidney Carlton, former president of the Mississippi State Bar Association, died first in 1966 at age 50 after suffering a heart attack. Eighty-year-old Jesse J. Breland, the oldest member of the team, died one year later at Washington County General Hospital in Greenville after a long illness.\n\nJ.W. Kellum was one of three members of the defense team who lived for at least four decades after the trial and witnessed Mississippi’s transformation to an integrated society. In 1979, he sat for an interview, alongside civil rights activist Amzie Moore, for the PBS series, Eyes on the Prize. “As far as a fair trial is concerned,” Kellum said, there was no proof that his clients “were the criminal agent.” Had there been a conviction, he believed the Supreme Court would have overturned it. Kellum said this during a new era, however, and he noted with pride that blacks then served on juries, and that more were practicing law. “I would say that Mississippi now is part of the New South.”\n\nKellum, a self-taught lawyer who never attended college, passed the state bar exam in 1939 and practiced law until his death in July 1996. The year before he died, Kellum insisted that for him, the Till affair was “just another case over the desk.” He said that he asked Milam and Bryant early on if they were guilty of the murder, and both denied that they were. “I believed them,” he insisted, “just like I would if I was interrogating a client now. I would have no reason to think he’s lying to me.” Forty years after representing them, he claimed he still believed in their innocence. “I would have to see something ... But they told me they did not [commit the murder]. They told the other lawyers that they did not.”\n\nAfter his wife Ruth died in 1992, Kellum remarried. He died four years later.\n\nJohn Whitten also practiced law until the end of his life. Betty Pearson, a Sumner resident angered by the acquittal, refused to speak to Whitten for over six months after the trial. Yet in 2006, she remembered him as “a wonderful man,” one whom she remained close to for the rest of his life.\n\nAt Breland’s request, Whitten maintained the firm’s name as Breland and Whitten after his partner’s death. The firm continues to this day, still housed in the same office where Milam and Bryant talked to reporter William Bradford Huie.\n\nToward the end of his life, Whitten worked in his law office occasionally, but by then his son John Whitten III did the bulk of the firm’s legal work. He had been suffering from Parkinson’s disease since the late 1980s and died in February 2003.\n\nThe last surviving member of the defense team was Harvey Henderson, who continued to practice law, albeit part time, up until his death in October 2007. He was active in his local community, was a lifelong member of the Sumner Rotary Club and had also served as its president. The West Tallahatchie School District retained him as its attorney for over 50 years, and he also served as the legal counsel for Mississippi’s first chapter of Habitat for Humanity, which was formed in Tallahatchie County. He refused all requests for interviews about the Till case.\n\nJudge Curtis Swango, who impressed spectators with his fairness during the trial, remained on the bench of Mississippi’s 17th judicial district for the next 13 years. In 1968, a respiratory condition sent him to the hospital, followed by several months of treatment for tuberculosis at the Mississippi State Sanatorium in Simpson County. He died there in December 1968. Divorced and without children, at his death, he was survived only by his mother and a brother. “He was widely praised for his conduct of the Emmett Till murder case in Tallahatchie County,” noted his obituary, “and was recognized as one of the foremost trial judges in the state.”\n\nThe two sheriffs in the case remained active in the years after the kidnapping and murder, although each was completing his term at the time. Former Leflore County Sheriff George Smith, who arrested Milam and Bryant on kidnapping charges, wanted to forget all about his role by the time a reporter asked him about it two years later. “I hate to even mention the case, it was the only thing to mar my four years in office,” he said. “Don’t quote me on anything. I don’t want my name ever printed again in connection with the people involved in this case.”\n\nSmith later served a second term as sheriff from 1964 until 1968. This time, he succeeded his former deputy, John Ed Cothran, who had helped with the kidnapping investigation and served as a witness for the prosecution.\n\nSmith, an avid outdoorsman, was a member of the Parker-Gary Hunting Club and was planning a busy season when he died unexpectedly in 1975 at the age of 72.\n\nFormer Tallahatchie sheriff Henry Clarence Strider, who aided the defense at the trial and claimed the body retrieved from the river was not that of Emmett Till, planned to run for the office again in 1959 after sitting out the required minimum of one term, but he changed his mind at the urging of his wife after he barely escaped an assassination attempt in 1957. While he sat in his car outside of a store in the town of Cowart, someone fired a shot at his head, missing him, but striking the metal piece between the window and windshield. Strider claimed that the shooter had been sent down from Chicago by the NAACP for the express purpose of killing him, and that the would-be assassin was known to black workers living on Strider’s plantation. Strider also maintained that the governor of Illinois refused to extradite the mysterious gunman back to Mississippi for trial, thus the entire matter was dropped. Still fearing for his life in 1963, Strider declined to run for his former job yet again.\n\nBy 1962, Strider was chairman of the State Game and Fish Commission. In February of that year, state officials tried to keep black student James Meredith from registering at Old Miss, and the defiance of the governor, Ross Barnett, made national news. Strider, ever the segregationist, announced during the conflict that 250 supervisors and game wardens were ready to aid Ole Miss in preserving its white-only student body should they be needed.\n\nIn February 1965, Strider won a special election to the state Senate, where he represented Grenada, Yalobusha and Tallahatchie counties for the next five years. In addition to his role with the Game and Fish Commission, he was a member of the Public Property, Transportation, and Water and Irrigation committees, and chairman of the Penitentiaries Committee.\n\nIn July 1968, Strider admitted on the floor of the state Senate that he had paid for votes during his 1951 campaign for Tallahatchie County sheriff. He disclosed this as the Senate debated a bill that provided for absentee voting for teachers and students. “In those days you didn’t win elections, you bought them,” he told his colleagues. He said that he paid out a total of $30,000 for blank absentee ballots reserved for people who had indicated they would not be present on Election Day.\n\nAlthough he is remembered for regularly insulting the black press in the hot, crowded courtroom in Sumner, his election to the Senate after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 forced him to deal with a black constituency who finally had the power of the ballot. Yet Strider would have been happy to rid the Delta of its black citizens. In February 1966, he co-sponsored a bill to relocate Mississippi blacks to other states, as a new farm bill was making it harder for laborers to earn a living. A proposed relocation commission would seek federal funds for the removal of those who wanted to go. “If they (Negro farm workers) feel like they are put upon or have to live in tents and opportunities are brighter somewhere else, we’ll be glad to get them there,” said Strider’s co-sponsor, Sen. Robert Crook of Ruleville. Nothing ever came of the proposal, however.\n\nLike Sheriff Smith, Strider was a hunter. On Dec. 27, 1970, Strider died of a heart attack while on a deer hunt in Issaquena County; his body was shortly discovered by others. Gov. John Bell Williams flew to Clarksdale to attend the funeral. In 1981, a portion of Mississippi 32 was designated as the Henry Clarence Strider Memorial Highway.\n\nA year after the murder trial, co-defendant J.W. Milam was living on a farm between Ruleville and Cleveland. Several months after that, William Bradford Huie interviewed the brothers for a follow-up article to his “confession” piece from a year before. It, too, appeared in Look magazine. In the accompanying photographs, both men appear happy, but it was obvious that the smiles were only a façade. Huie described them as having “been disappointed,” explaining further that, “They have suffered disillusionment, ingratitude, resentment, misfortune,” but as yet, no guilt. Few had pity on them, even those who had earlier been supportive. Milam owned no land and could not get his former backers to rent to him. He was finally able to rent 217 acres in Sunflower County with the help of his brother-in-law and secured a $4,000 furnish (the funds to plant a cotton crop) from a Tallahatchie County bank where one of his defense attorneys, John Whitten, sat on the loan committee. Blacks would no longer work for Milam, and he was forced to pay higher wages to whites for the same work.\n\nFor three years after the trial, Milam held several menial plantation jobs. In 1958 he was living in a tenant house on a plantation owned by a Citizen’s Council member. On Valentine’s Day, the New York Post reported that Milam had been seen standing in a bread line waiting to receive rations from the Welfare Department. The black Pittsburgh Courier picked up on the story, also. The director of the Washington County welfare department would not confirm or deny the Post report, but Milam adamantly declared it false. Despite admitting to hard times a year earlier when talking to Huie, Milam bluntly told an inquiring reporter for Jet magazine, “Quote me as saying the New York Post is a g----d liar. I’m standing here with’a ass-pocket full of money.”\n\nThe Milams later moved to Orange, Texas, but returned to Greenville after only a few years. They would make their home at 615 Purcell St., where J.W. would live out the rest of his life. The house was a converted into African American Methodist Church in Greenville’s black section.\n\nMilam would have a few run-ins with the law while living in Greenville. In 1969 he was convicted in City Court for writing a bad check and fined $55. Three years later the same court fined him $300 and sentenced him to 60 days in jail for using a stolen credit card. Four months after that, he was convicted of assault and battery, fined $30, and sentenced to 10 days in jail.\n\nBy the time the Milams returned to Mississippi a decade after the Till trial, the outrage over the murder had subsided, and they were able to live quietly, for the most part. Milam eventually found work as a heavy equipment operator but that ended due to declining health. After a very long and painful illness, he succumbed to cancer on New Year’s Eve, 1980 at age 61. He and his wife Juanita were rumored to have divorced at some point, but this was not true.\n\nBecause J.W. never held a permanent job, Juanita began working as a hairdresser at the Greenville Beauty Salon in the 1960s, where she remained until owner Thelma Wood retired and closed the shop around 1990.\n\nAlthough she enjoyed a long and steady career, Juanita’s life was never the same after the murder of Emmett Till, and she appeared genuinely sad most of the time. Her depression had not been a part of her life prior to the notorious lynching that thrust her family into the spotlight. Despite her personal suffering, she was generous with her family and friends and managed to maintain many of her life-long interests. She was an avid reader and football fan. An active Methodist, she bought a keyboard and learned to play a few hymns to help her congregation enjoy the benefit of music.\n\nJuanita never remarried after J.W.’s death, nor did she allow herself any further romance. She later sold her home on Purcell Street and eventually moved to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. After J.W.’s death, Juanita became estranged from Roy and Carolyn Bryant, and they never spoke again. Juanita and Carolyn saw each other, but did not speak, at the funeral of Milam and Bryant sibling Dan Milam, who died in 1999. Juanita stormed out of the service after Milam and Bryant family members became involved in a confrontation over blame in Emmett Till’s death.\n\nJuanita, who was politically liberal, maintained interracial friendships, and her best friend for many years was a black neighbor woman. Juanita suffered a stroke in 2008, and in October of that year, her oldest son, Horace “Bill” Milam, died at age 57. After several years of declining health, Juanita died in Ocean Springs on Jan. 14, 2014, at age 86.\n\nRoy Bryant’s life, like that of his brother J.W.’s, was filled with hardship. After a black boycott forced the closure of his store three weeks after his release from jail, the family moved to Indianola, in Sunflower County. There, Roy reportedly found work as a mechanic. After laboring at odd jobs for 75 cents a day, he attended welding school nine miles away in Inverness, at the Bell Machine Shop. In 1985 Bryant reported to the Clarion Ledger that his welding made him legally blind. He suffered from optic nerve degeneration in both eyes, and his left eye was further damaged after a small piece of steel became lodged in it.\n\nBryant had other ambitions before settling on welding school. In May 1956, the Delta Democrat-Times, responding to rumors that Bryant had become an Indianola policeman, learned that he had sought a job with the local force, but was turned away. “He applied with us,” confirmed Indianola police chief, Will Love, “but he does not work here.”\n\nSix months later on Nov. 19, Roy and Carolyn Bryant were riding as passengers in a car driven by Carolyn’s 18-year-old brother, James Holloway, in Greenville, when they were involved in a head-on collision at about 1:45 a.m. The second vehicle was driven by a black airman who was stationed at the Greenville Air Force Base. All three were treated for minor injuries at Greenville’s General Hospital and released. The four-paragraph article in the Delta Democrat–Times reporting the accident mentioned nothing of the Bryants’ notoriety in the Till case, although the Chicago Defender shortly learned of the story and reported that fact. That same day, perhaps for reasons brought on by the accident, Carolyn gave birth to her third son, Frankie Lee.\n\nBy the fall of 1957, Roy was working as a welder in Morgan City, Louisiana. The Bryants shortly moved to Orange, Texas, where a daughter was born two years later. Because Carolyn had been sick with the measles during her pregnancy, her daughter was born deaf. Sometime later, the family relocated to Vinton, Louisiana, just thirteen miles away, where Roy continued to weld for a steel company. They bought a home there and lived in Vinton until returning to Mississippi in 1973.\n\nWhen Roy, Carolyn, and the two youngest children left Louisiana in 1973 and returned to Mississippi, they relocated to Ruleville, in Sunflower County. Roy went back into the grocery business by taking over a small store that had been run by family members.\n\nAt some point, Roy and Carolyn Bryant’s marriage developed serious problems, and it became unbearable for Carolyn. Even her mother-in-law, Eula Bryant, saw it. Eula, whom Carolyn described as tough and outspoken, asked Carolyn in front of Roy many times why she stayed married to him. Eula died in August 1974. A year later on Aug. 15, Carolyn left Roy and two months after that, filed for divorce. Their divorce papers describe Roy as having been guilty of “habitual cruel and inhuman treatment of her and of habitual drunkenness.” Perhaps Roy’s demons had concerned his mother because she had once endured similar abuses from her second husband, Henry Bryant. Carolyn asked for sole custody of their daughter, the complaint read, because “said child needs the care and guidance which only a devoted mother can give.” Roy failed to dispute any of the allegations. When the divorce was finalized two months later on Oct. 28, 1975, sole custody went to Carolyn. Roy was granted visitation and ordered to pay $75 per month in child support beginning Nov. 1. A lump sum of $6,300 for alimony was due by Dec. 1.\n\nAfter their return to Mississippi, the Bryants managed to continue a low-profile existence, despite living in close proximity to the land of the Till murder. In fact, in 1977, both Roy and his brother, James Bryant, were listed as two of five challengers to Ruleville’s incumbent aldermen. In the end, the brothers lost, each receiving the least number of votes of all the candidates. James garnered 53 while Roy received only 45. The winners received between 270 and 530 votes. Roy married Vera Jo Orman, an accountant at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, in May 1980. They remained in Ruleville.\n\nIn 1978, Roy Bryant lost his permit to handle food stamps for one year because he was allowing customers to purchase non-food items with their coupons. In 1982, the Inspector General’s office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture learned that Bryant had been purchasing food stamps at a discount for cash and then selling them back to the government at full value. In October 1983, Bryant was indicted on five counts of food stamp fraud, pleaded not guilty and was scheduled for a December trial. On Dec. 7, however, Bryant changed his plea to guilty on two counts in exchange for the government dropping the rest. Bryant returned to court for sentencing two months later, and through the pleadings of his attorney, he was given only three years probation and ordered to pay a $750 fine. Bryant had retained state senator Robert L. Crook of Ruleville as his counsel. Crook told the court that 53-year-old Bryant “is a good citizen of Ruleville, who is disabled and has been in very poor health a number of years, who has attempted to work despite that circumstance, and to be gainfully employed in the course of running his own store.” He was caring for both his wife and disabled sister and was an honorably discharged veteran of the Army. As to the charges against him, however, “He knows he has made a mistake.”\n\nBryant promised to obey the law respecting food stamp regulations going forward but found himself unable to resist the temptation to repeat the same violations only a few years later. In February 1987, he was again caught purchasing food stamps at a cash discount, and this time, his sister, Mary Louise Campbell, who worked as a cashier at the store, was indicted along with him the following September as a co-conspirator on six counts of food stamp fraud. Bail was set for Bryant at $10,000, and for Campbell at $5,000. Campbell pleaded guilty to count four on Nov. 23, and Bryant pleaded guilty on counts five and six. Campbell did not receive any prison time, but Bryant, having been convicted four years earlier for the same crime, received a two-year prison sentence and was ordered to turn himself in to the attorney general on April 4, 1988. Before leaving office in 2001, President Bill Clinton pardoned Campbell. Bryant served eight months of his term.\n\nBryant attended the first town meeting of the administration of Shirley Edwards, the town’s first black mayor, and complained of burglaries at his fireworks store and poor performance by police in stopping it. Reminiscent of his actions in his most famous dirty deed, Bryant had no trouble taking the law into his own hands and threatened to do so. “If I catch one out there this big [raising his hands two and a half feet off the floor], I’m going to twist his damn head off.” Edwards did not hesitate in telling a reporter that “Bryant is a vicious man … If my people did not deal or trade with him, he couldn’t stay here.”\n\nBryant began battling cancer and diabetes. Beginning around September 1993, he underwent radiation treatments for the next year and lost 35 pounds. Two months before his death, he spoke for two hours to a reporter for the Palm Beach Post but refused to say much about the Till case. He again denied that he had anything to do with the murder and matter-of-factly said, “I have no idea” who killed the Chicago youth when the reporter asked. Bryant believed that his acquittal in the Till case meant that people should leave that past alone. The case that brought him worldwide notoriety in 1955 was to him, “just something in the past. You have to leave it alone, live your life. You can’t just sit around and cry over spilt milk.” His frustration was caused in part by the occasional threats he received by crank callers. “They say: ‘We don’t like what you did a few years ago. We’re comin’ over to get you.’ I say, ‘Well, bring your g----d ass on over—what’s taking you so long?”\n\nBryant died of cancer on Sept. 1, 1994, at the Baptist Hospital in Jackson. When Vera Jo Bryant died in May 2012, her obituary mentioned nothing about her marriage to Roy, and only listed her parents and a brother as family members who had preceded her in death. She was, however, buried next to her infamous husband whom she was married to for 14 years.\n\nWithin a few months of the murder, another brother, Leslie Milam, who ran the plantation on which Emmett Till was murdered, was “requested” to leave because many of the black laborers working there were leaving the farm out of fear. He shortly found a new job on a plantation in the nearby town of Cleveland. Fifteen years later in February 1971, he was arrested, and four months after that, convicted of illegally possessing over 500 methamphetamine pills, popularly known as speed. He was sentenced to one year at Parchman state prison. His defense attorney was J.W. Kellum.\n\nAlthough never charged or tried, the biggest burden he carried throughout his life was his involvement in the Emmett Till murder. On Thursday, Aug.t 29, 1974, local minister Macklyn Hubble received a call from Leslie’s wife, Frances. Hubble, who had been pastor of the First Baptist Church in Cleveland, Mississippi, since 1962, knew the family, and Frances asked him to come to the Milam home at Leslie’s request. When he arrived he was ushered into a room where he saw Leslie laying on a couch, near death. Frances left the room and Hubble pulled up a chair. Leslie, so weak that he could barely whisper, was nevertheless anxious to talk and immediately told Hubble that he wanted to get something off his chest. He proceeded to confess that he had been involved in the murder of Emmett Till, which had occurred 19 years and one day earlier. Leslie provided no details of the crime, but Hubble could see that he was remorseful. Leslie Milam died the following morning. Hubble officiated at the funeral a few days later.\n\nCarolyn Bryant is perhaps frozen in memory as the 21-year-old local beauty working behind a counter in a country store where Emmett Till fatefully crossed her path in 1955. She turned 84 years old in July 2018 and has, for decades, been a devoted mother and grandmother and enjoys a close relationship with her family. Carolyn, for her part, has wanted only to live quietly, out of the spotlight.\n\nShe learned American Sign Language and became very proficient at it so that she could communicate with her daughter. On one occasion, her skills allowed her to come to the rescue of a deaf woman who had been in a car accident, comforting her until paramedics arrived. She also was quite talented at making jewelry, which she sold at arts and craft shows until the early 2000s.\n\nLike Mamie Till-Mobley, Carolyn experienced the pain of losing a child, or in her case, two. In September 1995, her firstborn, Roy Bryant Jr., passed away of cystic fibrosis. In April 2010, Frank, her youngest son, died of heart failure. Her faith in God sustained her through these two losses, and she believes her sons are now together. She says she places God first and her children second in her life.\n\nTwo months after Frank’s death, Carolyn put her home in Greenville up for sale and moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, to live with her surviving son. She brought along her dog, a 16-year-old Shih Tzu, but by July 2012, the dog had died, but her son surprised Carolyn with another of the same breed.\n\nLasting romantic love eluded Carolyn, however. After her divorce from Roy Bryant in 1975, she remarried at least twice. In 1984 she wed Greenville resident Griffin Chandler, an employee at U.S. Gypsum. The marriage ended three and a half years later with Chandler’s death. The widowed Carolyn soon married again, this time to former Leland police officer David Donham. In 1988, Carolyn began attending Mississippi Delta Junior College in Moorhead and took classes as a part-time student until 1990. The Donhams eventually divorced. With the help of her brother, Thomas Holloway, Carolyn moved to Brookhaven into a small home after her divorce, where she lived until Thomas died in 2000. After that, she returned to Greenville to be near Frank.\n\nIn June 2010, Carolyn joined Facebook, establishing a profile with a username that kept her actual identity hidden. Five months later, she both posed and answered the question as to what constitutes the real qualities in a man. Her answer was that they must be ethical and stand up for a good cause. If this seemed to hint of her first husband’s attempt to preserve the sanctity of her white womanhood, which propelled both her and him into the public eye, she was quick to add that a real man will respect others and refrain from bullying.\n\nWith the encouragement of her daughter-in-law, Marsha Bryant, Carolyn agreed to write her memoir. However, Frank Bryant’s death took a toll on her and the project stalled. When the FBI investigated the case from 2004–5, Carolyn became a focus. In February 2007, Joyce Chiles, district attorney for Sunflower County where the murder occurred, called a grand jury to hear evidence against Carolyn for possible manslaughter charges. In the end, the racially mixed jury refused to indict, citing a lack of evidence. “I feel like the district attorney used us as scapegoats,” said black jury member Otis Johnson. “To me, it seems like they just wanted to put on a show and go through the process to make people happy.”\n\nA year later, Marsha Bryant arranged for Carolyn to meet with historian Tim Tyson, and, for the only time besides speaking to the FBI a few years earlier, Carolyn granted two recorded interviews. It was during these sessions that she allegedly recanted her courtroom testimony that Emmett Till grabbed her by the waist and propositioned her. “Honestly, I just don’t remember. It was fifty years ago,” Tyson says she told him before he set up his recorder. “You tell these stories for so long that they seem true, but that part is not true.” Marsha Bryant, however, says she was present for the interviews and that Carolyn never said these words or otherwise recanted. Carolyn suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, is losing her eyesight, and mostly relies on a wheelchair. She has said privately that the Emmett Till case has kept her a prisoner.\n\nDevery S.

But when Maggie began blaming him and threatening to tell her mother, he hit her repeatedly.\n\nHe later admitted to beating the girls with a shovel to make sure they were dead and thought about sexually assaulting Maggie, but changed his mind.\n\n“No, no, that’s too sick,” Sechrest told police, according to a previous report from the Reno Gazette Journal.\n\nAt his sentencing hearing, a prosecutor told the jury that Sechrest had first beaten Maggie to death and then chased Carly and “bashed her head in with rocks.”\n\nA psychiatrist also testified that Sechrest was an “incurable sociopath,” who was “cruel” and would endanger the lives of other girls if released, according to an RGJ report.\n\nIn 2017, Sechrest died in prison at the age of 56. He was serving two death sentences and was being held at the Northern Nevada Correctional Center.\n\nHe was removed from death row in 2008 after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned his death sentence due to “gross misconduct” by the prosecutor.\n\nA three-justice panel found the prosecutor violated Sechrest’s constitutional right to a fair trial by claiming the jurors would be risking the lives of other children if they didn’t sentence him to death.\n\nDavid Middleton\n\nDavid Middleton was a former Miami police officer who was fired for kidnapping and raping a teenage girl while on duty. He pleaded guilty to lesser charges and served two years in prison.\n\nHe later moved to Colorado with his girlfriend, Evonne Haley. They then became the prime suspects for the slaying of 18-year-old Buffy Rice Donahue, who worked with Haley at a Sizzler restaurant there.\n\nIn 1993, the couple moved to Reno, and Middleton found a job working as a television cable installer.\n\nA year later, Circus Circus Reno employee Thelma Davila, 42, disappeared from her apartment in Sparks.\n\nThen in 1995, Sun Valley elementary schoolteacher Katherine Powell, 45, was also reported missing. Her body was found in a trash bin eight days after her disappearance near Virginia Lake.\n\nMeanwhile, Davila’s body was discovered in a meadow near Verdi.\n\nA Secret Witness tip led police to Middleton’s storage unit in Sparks, where they found ropes, a gag, restraining devices, whips and a modified refrigerator with air-holes poked through the sides. They also found the victims’ blood and saliva on sex toys.\n\nThe couple had set up a torture chamber, which Middleton used to abuse the women before dumping their bodies.\n\nMiddleton’s six-week murder trial began on Aug. 15, 1997. He was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and kidnapping and was sentenced to death.\n\nHe was never charged for the murder in Colorado.\n\nMeanwhile, Haley was imprisoned for her role in the murders in both states. She was also convicted of using Powell’s credit card to buy stereo equipment.\n\nPsychiatrists reported that Middleton was hearing voices, hallucinating and was blacking out.\n\nThe case eventually prompted a retired Reno police sergeant to write a book.\n\nTamir Hamilton\n\nTamir Hamilton was sentenced to death for raping and murdering 16-year-old Holly Quick, whose body was found by her mother in her bed.\n\nIn September 2006, Patricia Doss walked into her daughter’s room to wake her up. The first thing she saw was her daughter’s legs stretched out on the floor. Her body was on the bed, according to Doss’ court testimony.\n\nMore:16 last meal requests from Nevada's death-row inmates\n\nRelated:Scott Dozier, the Nevada death row inmate who wanted to be executed, found dead in cell\n\nShe then saw blood on the wall and on the bed sheets. Quick was found staring up at the ceiling. Her throat was slashed.\n\nSix days later, police had their first suspect. Detectives received a tip suggesting that Hamilton was responsible for Holly’s death.\n\nInvestigators found his address and interviewed him. They then took a saliva swab for DNA and obtained a search warrant for his house.\n\nThey found a blood-stained white sweater and blue jeans in a black trash bag.\n\nForensic investigators also found sperm cells on Quick’s body and on a pair of boxer shorts retrieved from Hamilton’s trash.\n\nHamilton, who at the time was a family friend, initially denied visiting Holly and said he knew nothing of the bloody clothes found in his trash. He told police he spent the night arguing with his girlfriend.\n\nBut when he was confronted about contradicting statements from his girlfriend and information from DNA testing, he changed his story. He told police he was drunk and high when he saw Holly that night but remembered nothing else.\n\nHe said he remembered walking up the stairs to Holly’s apartment. She then reportedly let him inside and took him to her bedroom. He then told police he remembered driving home on Pyramid Highway.\n\nHis defense attorneys argued Hamilton came from a family suffering from a history of mental illness.\n\nAccording to court testimony, Hamilton was at high risk for schizophrenia because his mother was institutionalized with the disease. He was also a victim of abuse when he was young.\n\nHamilton claimed he heard voices that told him to do things. He also reported seeing bugs and spiders and tried to cut them out from under his skin, according to an RGJ report.\n\nIn 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court upheld his death sentence.\n\nDaryl Mack\n\nDaryl Mack was the last person to be executed in Nevada in 2006.\n\nHe was serving a no-parole life term in prison for the death of Kim Parks, whose body was found in a Motel 6 in April 1994.\n\nHe was in prison when DNA evidence linked him to another murder.\n\nRecent news:Lawyers: Nevada execution plan worse than pet euthanasia\n\nRead more:State: April 1 expiration date for drug in Nevada execution\n\nOn Oct. 28, 1988, a neighbor found 55-year-old Betty Jane May dead in her room at a boarding house on Forest Street in Reno. The door was left propped open, and her room was near the entrance.\n\nMay’s neighbor had stopped by to borrow money when he found her slumped over her bed. She had bruises on her arms and legs and blood stains on her blue blouse. She had been strangled and brutally raped.\n\nBlood and semen samples were taken from May’s basement apartment. But her murder remained unsolved for 12 years.\n\nMeanwhile, Mack made a living as a pimp. In the early 1990s, Parks worked as a prostitute for Mack in downtown Reno.\n\nMack was reportedly helping Parks move from hotel to hotel and expected compensation. When she refused to hand over her money, he became angry.\n\nHe reportedly told police he backhanded her, took her money and left. But prosecutors argued Mack wrapped her brassiere around her neck and strangled her, then took her money and fled.\n\nMack waived his right to a jury trial, and the judge found him guilty. While Mack was serving his life sentence, May’s unsolved murder case languished in the file cabinets.\n\nThen homicide Det. David Jenkins began reviewing inactive cases. He discovered there was DNA evidence in the May case that was never submitted for testing — a procedure that had not been developed at the time of the murder.\n\nThe samples matched a profile created from blood samples Mack submitted during Parks’ murder investigation.\n\nMack again asked for a bench trial and was convicted in 2002. But this time, the prosecutor sought the death penalty.\n\nMack, then 47, was later executed by lethal injection\n\nSiaosi Vanisi\n\nOn Jan. 13, 1998, a passerby found University of Nevada, Reno police Sgt. George Sullivan in a pool of blood beside his patrol car.\n\nSullivan, a father of five, was beaten to death at a parking lot near an information kiosk between UNR’s Morrill Hall and Manzanita Lake.\n\nHe had 10 blows to his face, seven to his scalp area, two on the upper part of his body and another to the left hand that nearly severed two fingers, according to autopsy results.\n\nSullivan, 43, was last seen making a traffic stop on Ninth and Center streets early that morning. A backup officer talked with Sullivan briefly and then left.\n\nSullivan was sitting in his car doing paperwork when he was attacked. His belt and .45-caliber automatic pistol were missing.\n\nThe next day, Siaosi Vanisi, then 27, was arrested in Salt Lake City after a two-hour standoff with local police. Vanisi’s cousin had turned him in.\n\nVanisi, a native to Tonga, was visiting from Los Angeles. Police found blood-stained clothing and a $7 silver metal hatchet at an apartment in Sparks where he had been staying with friends.\n\nThe also learned Vanisi used the stolen gun to rob two convenience stores in Reno.\n\nAccording to court testimony, Vasini told his friends he wanted to kill a cop and that he didn’t like white people because they took advantage of Polynesians.\n\nThe case sparked outrage in the community, and prosecutors sought the death penalty. He was convicted of murder on Sept. 27, 1999.\n\nA month later, he was sentenced to death.\n\nWayne Burgarello\n\nIn 2015, former schoolteacher Wayne Burgarello, then 74, walked out of the Washoe County District Court a free man.\n\nHe was charged with the fatal shooting of 34-year-old Cody Devine and attempted murder of then 30-year-old Janai Wilson. Both Devine and Wilson were found trespassing in Burgarello’s vacant duplex in Sparks.\n\nAlthough he was acquitted of the charges, his trial unearthed a debate over “stand your ground” self-defense laws in Nevada.\n\nAccording to court testimony, Devine and Wilson met at a casino the night of the shooting.\n\nWilson, who was homeless at the time, testified she was squatting in the vacant duplex and believed the owner was out of the state.\n\nThey covered the windows with bedsheets and cardboard to keep the neighbors from peeking inside.\n\nBoth Devine and Wilson each had syringes filled with methamphetamine. But Devine reportedly left his untouched on a table next to the bedding.\n\nWilson was starting to fall asleep when she heard someone break through the front door, according to court testimony.\n\n“What are you doing in my house?” Wilson said she heard the voice call out.\n\nShe said she then heard Devine reply, “‘We were just sleeping.’”\n\nWilson said the shooter had a gun in each hand. He then raised them and fired. She said she felt herself get shot on her leg, stomach and arm.\n\nDevine was shot five times, forensic specialists testified during the trial.\n\nWilson froze under the blankets. When she heard the shooter leave, she fled the duplex.\n\nBurgarello’s neighbor then called 911.\n\nDuring his interview with police, Burgarello said the shooting was in self-defense. He believed one of the victims had pulled a gun on him.\n\nProsecutors argued at trial that Burgarello was angry about past break-ins at his duplex and acted out of revenge.\n\nNo weapons were found at the scene. But Burgarello’s attorney Theresa Ristenpart said she believed he mistook a flashlight – found underneath Devine’s body — for a firearm.\n\nShe argued the room was dark and two people were inside a place they weren’t supposed to be in.\n\nBurgarello suffered numerous health problems, including strokes that affected his memory.\n\nJames Biela\n\nOne particular case gripped Reno and captured national attention.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2008, 19-year-old Brianna Denison was taken from her friend’s couch at a home near the University of Nevada, Reno.\n\nResidents tied blue ribbons—her favorite color—throughout the city in her honor.\n\nOne month later, her body was discovered in a snow-covered, vacant lot in southeast Reno. She was found wearing only bright orange socks with pink flowers. Her body was haphazardly covered with a dead Christmas tree.\n\nInvestigators learned she had been raped and strangled with her friend’s underwear, which they found at the scene.\n\nDenison, a sophomore at Santa Barbara City College, was visiting friends during winter break when she was killed.\n\nSigns posted throughout the city changed from “Bring Bri Back” to “Bring Bri Justice.”\n\nSoon after, detectives with the Reno Police Department received a tip from Secret Witness. They arrested James Biela nine months later.\n\nHe was charged with the rape and murder of Denison. He was also accused of raping two UNR students.\n\nHis two-week trial began on May 12, 2010. According to court testimony, Biela matched the description of the suspect.\n\nInvestigators also tested his son’s DNA, which matched samples collected from Denison’s body and the home where she was abducted from.\n\nThe case eventually prompted Gov. Brian Sandoval to sign “Brianna’s Law,” which requires DNA testing in felony arrests.\n\nBiela was sentenced to death for Denison’s murder plus four consecutive life terms in prison for the rape of the two other women.\n\nIn 2015, he filed a motion requesting a new trial, but was denied a year later. His defense attorneys said they plan to file an appeal with the Nevada Supreme Court.\n\nThe case captured national attention and was featured on a one-hour episode of “Dateline NBC” in 2010.\n\nZollie Dumas\n\nOn June 15, 2014, Reno police dispatchers received a call from a cellphone and heard a woman yelling in the background. The call then dropped.\n\nA police sergeant called back and spoke to the woman, who was heard yelling at someone in the background to leave her alone. She told the sergeant she needed help and that she was staying at the Lucky Motel on East Fourth Street.\n\nShe eventually fell silent.\n\nWhen officers arrived, they knocked on the motel room door and window and saw a man, later identified as Zollie Dumas, seated inside.\n\nThey also found 59-year-old Carolyn Jo Smith lying in bed. She was stabbed 22 times on her neck, torso and head and was taken to a local hospital, where she died shortly afterward.\n\nWhen Dumas answered the door, he told the officers he killed his girlfriend.\n\n“Just take me to jail,” he reportedly said to police.\n\nTwo years later, Dumas, then 63, was sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years for a deadly weapon enhancement.\n\nHe was on parole for murdering his fiancée when he stabbed Smith. He had been sentenced to life in prison for stabbing Angela Griffin at her Henderson home in 1988.\n\nOfficers were standing outside Griffin’s home when he attacked her. They had inspected the home and declared it vacant so she could safely pack her belongings to move away from the man she feared. But Dumas was hiding behind a bathroom door when he attacked her.\n\nHe stabbed her 24 times before police could hear her muffled cries for help.\n\nJanine Hillman\n\nJanine Hillman was sentenced to two life terms in prison for her role in the electrocution murder of former 71-year-old Sparks City Councilman Valentine Galleron in 1987.\n\nHillman paid a Sun Valley couple – Randy Howard and Valerie Fuentes – $2,000 to murder Galleron. She also promised them the keys to his mobile home.\n\nMore:Mastermind in electrocution murder of former Sparks councilman dies in prison\n\nThey then forced him at gunpoint to write $40,000 in checks. Howard and Fuentes held Galleron at his south Reno home while Hillman cashed the checks. They then forced Galleron into a water-filled tub and dropped a television in the water, electrocuting him to death.\n\nHillman, who was considered the mastermind behind the murder, died in prison in 2017. Fuentes also died in prison in 1994. Meanwhile, Howard remains in prison serving a life with parole sentence.\n\nLuis Alejandro Menendez-Cordero\n\nIn 2010, two men were shot and killed at a party in Sparks. Luis Alejandro Menendez-Cordero, a known MS-13 gang member, was sent to life in prison without parole for both murders.\n\nHis two-week trial began on Oct. 4, 2017. Several witnesses testified they were playing Crazy Eights when they heard gunfire.\n\nMurder trial:'You don't disrespect MS-13 and make it out alive'\n\nMore:MS-13 gang member sentenced to life in prison for 2 Sparks murders\n\nMoises Vasquez, 21, was shot below his right eye. Meanwhile, Kevin Melendez, 19, was found with gunshot wounds to his back, according to court documents.\n\nAt least one of the men was a member of another local gang.\n\nSeveral witnesses said Menendez-Cordero attended the party. He then left with a friend and later returned with a .22-caliber pistol.\n\nWitnesses testified Menendez-Cordero shot the two men as a way to demonstrate loyalty to his gang.\n\nOne witness, then 17, told jurors that Menendez-Cordero had turned to him, pointed the gun, pulled the trigger and heard a clicking sound. The gun failed to fire.\n\nAnother witness said she hid behind a kitchen cabinet when her two friends were shot.\n\nMenendez-Cordero then fled to California and tattooed “MS” on his forehead to memorialize the shooting.\n\nEventually, he made his way to El Salvador where he was later arrested.\n\nProsecutors were forced to take the death penalty off the table before authorities in El Salvador would agree to extradite him to Northern Nevada.\n\nHe was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nDaniel Pancake\n\nOn Nov. 18, 2014, 11-year-old Alex Pancake called 911 saying his father was beating his mother. While on the phone with a dispatcher, he relayed that his father grabbed a knife and stabbed his mother during a fight.\n\nHe then told the dispatcher that his father slit his wrists and walked outside to the yard.\n\nReno police officers arrived at the home and found a man drenched in blood standing outside.\n\nThey arrested Daniel Pancake, then 78, on an open murder charge for the death of his 54-year-old wife, Janice Gannon.\n\nAccording to a police report, the officers found blood in the entryway of the dining room, which trailed upstairs to where Gannon’s body was discovered with a deep cut to the neck.\n\nThey also found a bloody knife on the dining room table.\n\nAuthorities said Pancake “uttered” to an officer that he killed his wife because he was “tired of her drinking.”\n\nWashoe County Child Protective Services took Alex and later released him to a family member. He then moved to Michigan with his family, according to his aunt Cyndy Brower.\n\nAlex underwent psychological therapy, Brower said in a 2015 interview.\n\n“He’s having horrific nightmares,” Brower said. “He’ll start out the day well, and then he’ll have a breakdown.”\n\nPancake was set for a trial but later pleaded guilty. In 2016, he was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after serving a minimum of 28 years for Gannon’s murder. He also received an additional consecutive sentence of up to 20 years in prison for a deadly weapon enhancement.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Pancake claimed Gannon was allegedly having an incestuous relationship with their son.\n\nPancake said he loved his wife and that he was protecting his son, to which Judge Elliott Sattler replied: “What you have done to (Alex) is atrocious.”\n\n“You have done this,” Sattler said.\n\nErnesto Gonzalez\n\nA fatal shooting between rival motorcycle gangs at a Sparks casino captured national attention in 2011.\n\nErnesto Gonzalez, 59, was convicted of seven felony counts, including murder with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit murder and challenging someone to a fight resulting in death.\n\nGonzalez was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting death of 51-year-old Jeffery “Jethro” Pettigrew — the former president of the Hells Angels in San Jose, Calif.\n\nMore:23 arrested in 3 states in Vagos motorcycle gang crime case linked to 2011 Nugget shooting\n\nMore:Witness: I lied about Sparks Nugget gang killing\n\nThe shooting stemmed from a fight between members of the Vagos and Hells Angels at the Nugget Casino Resort, formerly known as the John Ascuaga’s Nugget. Both groups were visiting the area for the annual Street Vibrations motorcycle rally.\n\nDuring Gonzalez’s murder trial, several witnesses testified the two gangs already had tensions building between them before arriving to Reno-Sparks. Both groups where staying in separate hotels to avoid confrontation, according to court testimony.\n\nGonzalez, ex-president of the Vagos chapter in Nicaragua, previously testified he opened fire because Pettigrew and other Hells Angels members were kicking a friend in the head. He said he believed they were going to kill him.\n\nDuring his murder trial, prosecutors argued the shooting was an orchestrated hit that stemmed from a feud between the two gangs.\n\nAccording to witnesses’ testimonies, another Vagos member instigated the fight. Gonzalez’s attorney argued a co-defendant, Gary “Jabbers” Rudnick, came up with the idea for the assassination plot.\n\nRudnick, the former second in command of the Vagos in Los Angeles, was the only one to testify he and Gonzalez met earlier that night with the head of Vagos International, who approved the alleged assassination.\n\nOn the night of the shooting, the Hells Angels arrived at a bar at the Nugget, where they found several members of the Vagos gang inside.\n\nRudnick claimed he had dinner with his wife and then grabbed a beer and tequila with other fellow Vagos members. Then Pettigrew patted Vagos members on the back, and Rudnick took offense. He said it was a sign of disrespect.\n\nThat night, the Hells Angels left for their rooms. The Vagos were told to stop them before they reached the elevator near Trader Dick’s Bar.\n\nRudnick approached Pettigrew and asked if they were “cool.” He claimed Pettigrew then took a swing at him and pulled out a gun.\n\nRudnick said he ran and hid behind slot machines and looked at Gonzalez. He said he knew there would be a shooting. Three others were also shot but survived.\n\nThe next morning, Gonzalez left for San Jose then Los Angeles. Within days, he obtained a flight reservation out of the country and had $1,700 in his pocket.\n\nGonzalez was arrested six days after the shooting. He was found cowering in his car in San Francisco. He told police he was relieved he was caught and that he feared the officers were members of the Hells Angels coming to kill him.\n\nGonzalez claimed he decided not to flee the country because he was worried about his four daughters.\n\nHe initially told police a friend gave him the pistol used in the Sparks shooting. He later changed his statement and said he found the gun on a table. After the shooting, he disposed of the gun.\n\nMeanwhile, Rudnick was arrested two months later.\n\nThe defense argued Rudnick’s testimony was fabricated so he could receive a plea deal and a favorable sentence.\n\nIn 2016, Gonzalez’s conviction was reversed by the Nevada Supreme Court. The justices ordered a new trial based partly on the district judge’s faulty instructions to the jury, which had found him guilty of the murder.\n\nRudnick was sentenced to 10 years. In 2017, he recanted saying he lied when he testified that the shooting was an assassination plot.\n\nIn June 2017, 23 Vagos leaders, members and associates were arrested in three states on charges including racketeering, murder, kidnapping, robbery and assault.\n\nAuthorities identified eight of those people recently charged as being responsible for Pettigrew’s death, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe shooting prompted area hotels and casinos to ban patrons from wearing gang colors.\n\nThe RGJ archives and the Associated Press both contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2017/05/27/man-who-reinvented-meth/330877001/", "title": "The Man Who Reinvented Meth", "text": "Thomas Gounley\n\nNews-Leader\n\nJohn Cornille had been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for seven years. Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2017/10/31/mafia-soldier-turned-phoenix-businessman-frank-capri-gioia/748957001/", "title": "A Mafia soldier turned Phoenix businessman", "text": "Frank Gioia Jr. no longer exists. Anyone meeting him today never would know he once was a soldier in the New York Mafia.\n\nFederal authorities erased Gioia’s criminal history in exchange for his cooperation and testimony against more than 70 mobsters. He walked out of prison in 1999 with a new identity and into a new life as an Arizona businessman.\n\nThat identity, from the Federal Witness Protection Program, helped him morph from a mobster into a real-estate developer and restaurateur, an Arizona Republic investigation shows. He became the head of a chain of restaurants called Toby Keith’s I Love This Bar and Grill.\n\nHis success was short-lived, overshadowed by allegations of fraud and massive losses for his business associates.\n\nDocuments and interviews show Gioia used his government-provided identity to create havoc. He or his companies negotiated deals to build Toby Keith restaurants with mall owners and developers throughout the United States, then took tens of millions of dollars meant to pay for construction and walked away.\n\nGioia’s business associates know him as Frank Capri. No background checks, no amount of vetting, no financial examination and no legal review would have revealed Capri’s record as a confessed murderer, drug dealer, gun runner, arsonist, extortionist, loan shark and leg breaker.\n\nThat’s because the Witness Protection Program isn’t set up to protect the public.\n\nFew controls are in place to ensure criminals who enter the program don’t commit new crimes or create problems for those they encounter in their new lives. There are even fewer controls to prevent them from leaving the program or track them if they do.\n\nAs the name implies, the program’s primary goal is protecting witnesses.\n\nGioia is one of a handful of celebrated mob turncoats who helped break the back of the Mafia in New York City in the 1990s and 2000s, according to those who study the crime syndicate.\n\nGioia’s cooperation with law enforcement led to the conviction of mobsters, from underlings to bosses. He also helped authorities close several unsolved murders, the 20-year-old shooting of a New York City police officer among them.\n\nHis information gave federal prosecutors, including former FBI Director James Comey, the ammunition they needed to make cases — and careers.\n\nIn exchange, authorities gave Gioia a new name, Social Security number and enough backstory for him to hide in plain sight as lawsuits and fraud allegations stacked up against him.\n\nAt least 48 lawsuits have been filed in 31 cities, according to Arizona Republic research. Judges have ordered Capri or his companies to pay plaintiffs $65 million in cases tied to their Toby Keith restaurants, according to the latest material obtained from court documents and media accounts.\n\nMAFIA IN OUR MIDST:\n\nPART 1 - A mob soldier turned Phoenix businessman\n\nPART 2 - Inside the life of a 'made man'\n\nPART 3 - Who protects the public from protected witnesses?\n\nDevelopers claimed Capri deliberately orchestrated the failure of his restaurants as part of a scheme to pocket development money.\n\nHis company, Boomtown Entertainment LLC, closed 19 of its 20 restaurants, sometimes months after opening. It also announced plans to build 20 restaurants that never opened.\n\nCapri is accused in litigation of stealing money meant for tenant improvements, stiffing landlords on rental contracts and pocketing money meant to pay contractors and laborers who worked on his projects.\n\nCapri’s company built four Toby Keith restaurants in Arizona, including one in CityNorth in northeast Phoenix that stayed open only five months.\n\nToby Keith had no ownership interest in the restaurants; the country singer only collected money on naming rights.\n\nOne of Capri’s early business associates said he had warned City North representatives at the time about Capri’s business practices. But he said officials maintained they had done their due diligence before contracts were signed.\n\nCapri’s criminal background was spotless — because the federal government had manufactured it for him.\n\nThe Republic pieced together Capri’s identity through court records, business documents, background searches and interviews with past and current associates. Mafia lawyers, former prosecutors, organized-crime researchers and private investigators spoke about Gioia’s transformation from drug dealer and murderer to government witness and businessman.\n\n‘That’s him, all right’\n\nTestimony in criminal cases and arrest records track Gioia’s upbringing as the son of a gangster in New York’s Little Italy, his induction into the Mafia, his incarceration and his decision to flip to keep his father from being killed.\n\nCapri declined interview requests and did not respond to a detailed list of questions sent to him through his girlfriend and his attorney about his personal history, the Mafia and his businesses.\n\n\"He doesn't have any reply,\" Capri's girlfriend, Tawny Costa, said after attempts to reach him by phone and email.\n\nBut this isn’t the first time he’s had to deal with questions about his identity.\n\nA 2007 report prepared by private investigators in a Maricopa County child-custody case documented Gioia’s entry into the Federal Witness Protection Program along with his father, mother, sister and brother-in-law.\n\nFive years after the custody case was settled, Capri asked a family court judge to seal the records and keep the testimony from public view.\n\nIn a motion, Capri denied involvement in the Witness Protection Program. His lawyer contended that even if Capri had been given a new identity as part of the program, he would have had to lie about it.\n\n“Assuming … the allegations are true, which (Capri) staunchly denies, the disclosure would have the effect of removing the protection afforded by the Federal Witness Protection Program,” his lawyer wrote in the motion.\n\nAt least three people who dealt with Gioia in New York, including two lawyers who cross-examined him in criminal cases, positively identified Gioia from pictures of Frank Capri.\n\n“That’s Gioia,” New York attorney Anthony Lombardino said. “That’s him, all right. That is him. That is him.”\n\nLombardino, who spent two days grilling Gioia on the stand in a 2004 federal racketeering and murder trial, said Gioia was as bad, if not worse, than people he helped put away.\n\n“The government turned Gioia loose on society,” Lombardino said.\n\nThe FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice declined to respond to a detailed list of questions about the Gioia case. But officials with both agencies denied turning a blind eye to potential criminal conduct.\n\n\"The Department of Justice remains committed to holding accountable those who conduct criminal activity and threaten the rule of law,\" Nora Scheland of the FBI National Press Office said in a statement.\n\nScheland said the FBI and the DOJ could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any ongoing investigations.\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Marshals Service, which oversees and manages the Witness Protection Program, said they could not discuss Gioia, his identity and whether he is or was enrolled in the Witness Protection Program.\n\n“We do not divulge any information about any individual,” Arizona U.S. Marshal David Gonzales said.\n\n“I cannot confirm nor deny the identity of anyone.”\n\nNew millennium, new identity\n\nFrank Capri appeared in Phoenix with the new millennium. By 2003, he had established himself as a real-estate developer and soon was brokering deals for some of the Valley’s priciest homes.\n\nHis ride on the real-estate bubble would carry him into new ventures. His business associates said he came up with a strategy for squeezing money out of projects — without finishing them.\n\nA onetime friend and business associate said Capri discovered developers were so desperate to build out malls they were willing to pay millions based on a concept and a promise: long-term rental agreements in exchange for up-front cash.\n\n“He knew he could sign his name and get free money,” said Simon Kreisberger, the owner of the Play Factory in Phoenix. In 2006, Kreisberger wanted to franchise his indoor playground business, and Capri was interested.\n\n“I was thinking biz, biz, biz,\" Kreisberger said, adding that Capri appeared to be focused on \"how much he can put in his pocket.”\n\nWhen he spoke with The Republic, Kreisberger knew nothing about Capri’s real identity or about his background.\n\nKreisberger said he remembered when Capri signed the agreement for his first Toby Keith restaurant in Mesa’s Riverview development. He said Capri talked about taking his plan nationwide. Kreisberger said Capri didn't seem concerned if the restaurants failed, or even if they got built.\n\nCapri talked instead about the number of deals he could sign and how much money he could make before developers got wise and his credit ran out.\n\nKreisberger said he was alarmed and took his concerns to a lawyer.\n\n“It got to where I felt like I was talking to a mobster,” he said. “We were afraid he was Mafia.”\n\nSon of a son of a mobster\n\nGioia is a prominent mob figure, known as much for his audacity as his testimony.\n\nGioia not only survived turning evidence against dozens of mob figures. By his own admission, he remained in the Witness Protection Program after he lied to authorities and withheld information for years about murders and other crimes.\n\nGioia’s notoriety didn’t come from being a high-ranking member of the criminal underworld or a particularly important member of the machine. According to his court testimony, he was a soldier, and, in mob parlance, an “earner.”\n\nHe grew up the son and grandson of mobsters. His father was a “made man,” a fully initiated member of the Mafia. His grandfather ran a bookmaking operation in Little Italy. When Gioia was 8 years old, one of his uncles was shot 11 times and tossed into the trunk of a car.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFrank Gioia Jr.'s Mafia associates and their crimes, fates\n\nThe Five Families of New York: How the Mafia divides the city\n\nFrank Gioia Jr.: Years of crime, a newidentity and allegations of fraud\n\nWhat exactly happened at Toby Keith’s?\n\nGioia had access to the family’s secrets from an early age, and he paid attention. So, when he decided to flip, he was able to give federal authorities a history of Mafia violence, crime and corruption.\n\nGioia’s statements connected murders to killers, put names to unsolved cases and eviscerated the Mafia’s organizational structure.\n\nHe is credited with being a key informer and witness against the Lucchese and Gambino crime families, two of New York’s Five Families. Among those was John A. Gotti, former acting boss of the Gambino crime family and the son of legendary “Teflon Don” John Gotti.\n\nThe Lucchese family operated primarily in the New York boroughs of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan and in New Jersey.\n\nGioia became a “made man” in 1991 at age 24. By his own account, he plotted murders. He was a loan shark and shakedown artist. He ran drugs and guns. He committed assaults.\n\nIn 1992, Gioia said he helped kill a Gambino associate who “disrespectfully” propositioned the girlfriend of a ranking Lucchese boss at a nightclub.\n\nGioia was running a heroin pipeline from Boston to Manhattan when he was arrested in 1993 on federal drug charges. He was facing 30 years to life in prison when he got word the mob was plotting to kill his father. He reached out to the FBI, told agents he was willing to talk and signed a deal to cooperate with the government.\n\n“I thought, I figured I had two choices,” Gioia testified in 2004. “I either sit there, everybody else is flipping, they go in, they find out things I did, didn’t do, I get indicted, I end up doing life, my family gets abused in the street. Or cooperate with the government, put them all in the program, get them away from these people.”\n\nFlipping requires a tell-all, called a proffer. Cooperating witnesses are required to confess every crime in which they have been involved. Federal agents memorialize the admissions in Form 302s. They meet as many times as it takes to get it all on the record, and it doesn’t end there. Anytime law-enforcement officials have questions, they can go back.\n\nGioia testified agents came back to him dozens of times. But he didn’t give up everything, a violation of his agreement that could have gotten him kicked out of the protection program and sent back to prison. Gioia said in court he held back information to protect his child.\n\nIn 1993, Gioia had a son with his fiancee, Kim Smith, whose brother was an associate of another crime family. Gioia said the Smiths threatened to make sure he never would see his son again if he testified about their activities.\n\nHe kept quiet for two years. Then, Gioia testified, he learned that Kim Smith took money from the mob to secretly record their prison conversations.\n\nAccording to court records, Gioia then came clean. He gave the feds information about murders and other crimes he hadn’t talked about in the past. Gioia said Smith’s uncle, Anthony Francesehi, was involved in the slaying of the New York police officer during a botched robbery outside a Brooklyn disco. He gave up Smith’s brother, Frank, in the 1987 murders of two mob associates.\n\nAnd Gioia kept talking.\n\nLawyers, journalist identify mob turncoat\n\nGioia’s information sent mobsters to prison for decades and, in some cases, for life.\n\nNew York defense lawyer Lombardino said Gioia broke all the rules and the government rewarded him for it.\n\nLombardino’s client, former Lucchese acting boss and consigliere Louis “Louie Bagels” Daidone, is serving a life sentence for racketeering and conspiracy to commit two murders.\n\nIn 2004, Gioia testified that Daidone helped set up and kill a Lucchese soldier suspected of cooperating with authorities. According to court records, Daidone lured Bruno Facciolo to a Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, garage under the pretense of a meeting.\n\nGioia told the court that when Facciolo got suspicious and bolted, Daidone tackled him and dragged Facciolo back inside, where he was stabbed and shot. According to court records, Facciolo’s body was found in the trunk of a car with a dead canary stuffed in his mouth.\n\nDaidone also ordered the slaying of another Lucchese soldier suspected of being an informant.\n\nFormer FBI Director Comey, who at the time was U.S. attorney for New York’s southern district, appeared in federal court during Gioia’s testimony.\n\nLombardino said Gioia’s testimony was tainted by his failure to tell the truth about his own criminal conduct. In court, Lombardino painted Gioia as untrustworthy, pointing out that Gioia’s cooperation helped him to avoid life in prison and got him released after only six years.\n\n“You’re right,” Gioia said in court. “But I didn’t create the system.”\n\nNew York defense attorney Ephraim Savitt positively identified Gioia from pictures of Capri, saying emphatically: “That’s the culprit!”\n\nSavitt, a former federal prosecutor and adjunct law professor at Fordham Law School, said he cross-examined Gioia, who testified as a government witness in an attempted-murder trial. Savitt said Gioia’s demeanor on the stand was smart, arrogant and self-serving.\n\nSavitt represented Lucchese soldier Michael “Baldy” Spinelli, who was convicted in 1998 of shooting the sister of a former Lucchese captain to prevent her brother from testifying against the family.\n\nDespite being shot twice, the sister survived.\n\nGioia testified that Spinelli told him details about the attempted murder when they were in prison together in 1994.\n\nTwo years after Spinelli’s conviction, Savitt said he learned Gioia had failed to disclose several crimes involving the Smith family to federal prosecutors.\n\nSavitt appealed for a retrial, arguing that Gioia had violated his agreement with prosecutors. He said Gioia’s failure to disclose crimes amounted to a violation of his cooperation agreement. A judge denied the motion.\n\nSavitt said he doesn’t condone what his client did, but Gioia’s testimony never should have been allowed to stand.\n\n“There’s no black and white here,” he said. “Just too many shades of gray.”\n\nJerry Capeci, a newspaper columnist and author who chronicles organized crime on his Gangland News website, is one of the nation’s foremost Mafia experts.\n\nCapeci described Gioia in a 1998 New York Daily News story as “a behind-the-scenes star mob informer.” Capeci said federal prosecutors praised Gioia as having a better conviction rate than former Gotti underboss Salvatore “Sammy Bull” Gravano.\n\nGravano, whose testimony helped put away 39 mobsters, was enrolled in the Witness Protection Program and also relocated to Phoenix.\n\nIn the 1990s, he was arrested for running an Ecstasy drug ring and in 2002 was sent to prison on federal and state drug charges. Gravano was released Sept. 18.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2003, Capeci wrote dozens of articles about Gioia. He kept a running list of the mobsters he helped to convict.\n\nCapeci, who wrote that Gioia was “a baby-faced 250-pounder” in news articles, also identified him from pictures of Frank Capri, adding that he actually only saw Gioia in person in one court case.\n\n“That looks like him,” Capeci said in a recent interview. “It sure looks like him.”\n\nInvestigative report reveals Mafia past\n\nIt is unclear whether Capri is under the protection of the Witness Protection Program today.\n\nThe Witness Security Program, or WITSEC, as the Federal Witness Protection Program is also known, has stringent rules governing activities, contacts and travel that some government witnesses decide they cannot follow and voluntarily withdraw. Others are expelled from the program for violations.\n\nEven if Capri were expelled from the program or left on his own, no one from the government would be allowed to confirm his new identity.\n\nBackground searches show Capri’s Social Security number was issued in South Dakota between 1998 and 2001, when he was 31 to 34 years old.\n\nRecords indicate he spent time in Tulsa, Oklahoma, before moving to Arizona, but the government could have manufactured that history as part of Gioia’s new background.\n\nCourt and other records suggest he was still enrolled in the program and under the protection of the U.S. Marshals Service in 2007.\n\nIn 2007, Arizona private investigators Rich Robertson and Gary Phelps were hired to investigate Capri as part of a dispute with his girlfriend over the custody of their two children, both born in Arizona.\n\n“We have confirmed that Frank Capri is a federally protected witness whose real identity is Frank Gioia, a third-generation member of the Lucchese crime family,” Robertson and Phelps wrote in an Oct. 23, 2007, report obtained by The Republic.\n\nThe report also identified members of Capri’s family who were enrolled in the Witness Protection Program.\n\nRobertson and Phelps wrote they had spoken to Arizona U.S. Marshal Gonzales and Witness Protection Program Supervisor Rich Kay.\n\n“They, of course, would not confirm or deny our conclusions, but said they have grave concerns if this becomes part of a court record,” Robertson and Phelps wrote in the report. “They ask if the proceedings could be done under seal and offered to speak directly to the judge if needed.”\n\nThe report includes a lengthy description of the Witness Protection Program and the U.S. Marshals Service’s role in overseeing it.\n\nCourt records and media accounts show this wasn’t Gioia’s first child-custody dispute since entering WITSEC.\n\nRobertson and Phelps noted in their report that after testifying against the Smith family in 1997, he fought his ex-fiancee for visitation rights to their son.\n\n“As a result of outing the Smith family, they threatened to never let him see his son again,” Robertson and Phelps wrote. “Gioia wanted so much to have a relationship with his son he went to family court and persuaded a judge to allow visitation even though he was in the Witness Protection Program.”\n\nRobertson, owner of R3 Investigations in Mesa, confirmed the authenticity of the report in a recent interview.\n\n“I wound up testifying about our findings in a sealed court hearing,” he said of the report.\n\nBecause portions of the case are under seal, The Republic was unable to confirm whether the report is in the custody case file.\n\nRobertson said U.S. Marshals Service officials in 2007 “didn’t deny” Capri’s involvement in the Witness Protection Program. But he said they “suggested to me that they would deal with it,” referring to the custody case.\n\nGonzales said he “had no recollection” of the report or of being interviewed by Robertson and Phelps. He said he did not recall being subpoenaed.\n\nThe Republic is not naming Capri’s ex-girlfriend to help safeguard the identity of their children.\n\nIn 2007, the ex-girlfriend accused Capri of lying to the court about his income. Capri first told the court he made $5,000 a month. He later tried to settle the case claiming he made $20,000 a month.\n\nCapri’s ex-girlfriend challenged his claims with a 2005 tax return that reported his income at about $900,000 a year. She also estimated his real-estate assets at more than $15 million.\n\nShe asked the court to require full disclosure and a formal review of Capri's finances.\n\n“(Capri) is now coming up with a variety of excuses not to produce these documents,” she said in court documents. “If Mr. Capri would just be honest with the court and the respondent, this in-depth analysis would not be necessary.”\n\nCourt motion exposes Capri\n\nCapri went back to Maricopa County Family Court in 2012. Once more, the subject of his past was raised. Court documents show Capri was the one who raised it.\n\nCapri’s attorney filed an emergency motion with the Family Court judge accusing his former girlfriend of “recklessly alleging that (Capri) is an organized crime figure or former organized crime figure whose true identity has been masked by his participation in the Federal Witness Protection Program.”\n\nScottsdale attorney Victor Garnice asked for a restraining order to prevent Capri’s ex-girlfriend from speaking or writing about Capri’s past.\n\n“She has repeatedly threatened to make this false allegation to third parties, including (Capri’s) business partners, clients and others in the event (Capri) had the temerity to challenge her inappropriate parenting,” Garnice wrote.\n\nCapri’s attorney implored the judge to seal the case and close the proceedings to the public. He confirmed that federal law-enforcement officers had testified in 2007 about the importance of keeping the program secret.\n\n“Witnesses were produced, including an Assistant United States Attorney General and a U.S. Marshal, who testified without uncertainty that the Federal Witness Protection Program and the public interest were grossly prejudiced and violated by discussion of the topic,” Garnice wrote. “They made plain that persons in the program are prohibited from discussing same and are duty bound to deny the assertion.”\n\nThat’s when Garnice said if Capri was in the program he would be forced to deny it.\n\n“Even if the specious and pernicious allegations concerning (Capri) were true, (Capri) would be required to make denials identical those he would be required to make if the allegations were untrue,” Garnice wrote.\n\nThe judge called the emergency motion inappropriate. He denied the request to close the court proceedings and seal the files. He also denied the restraining order, calling it a prior restraint on the First Amendment.\n\nWhile he was trying to shield his identity in court, Capri was expanding his business empire.\n\nBy 2012, it appeared as if his Toby Keith restaurant chain was thriving, with eight already open and many more on the way.\n\nAt least that’s how it looked.\n\nLaying out the development 'scheme'\n\nCapri’s pitch to developers was brilliantly simple. Capri laid it out so quickly and smoothly in 2007 that Kreisberger said he didn’t immediately recognize it for what he now believes it to be: a scheme.\n\nThey were preparing to sign a development deal for an indoor playground at the Mesa Riverview mall. The developer was willing to pay up front for tenant improvements in exchange for a long-term lease. Capri wanted to know how much money they needed. Kreisberger estimated it would cost $40 per square foot.\n\nAccording to Kreisberger, Capri smiled, leaned back and said, “Then we ask for $70.”\n\nKreisberger said he was not involved in negotiations. He admits to being naive. He said at the time he thought Capri was worried about overruns and build-out costs and assumed the money would go back into the business. He said he figured out way too late that’s not what happened.\n\nCourt and business records and emails show Kreisberger met Capri in late 2006, about a year after Kreisberger opened his first Play Factory at Happy Valley Road and Interstate 17 near Anthem.\n\nBusiness was good and Kreisberger was looking to franchise his concept. He had posted a sign near the register encouraging offers. Capri, who frequently brought his children to the store, struck up a conversation.\n\nCapri said the right things, talking up margins, operating expenses, the potential for expansion. They met several more times, and in December Capri was ready to sign.\n\nKreisberger described Capri as professional, a smooth talker who could sense a deal. He said Capri liked to flash cash rolls and live large, always going on about his latest luxury purchase.\n\nHe didn’t talk about his past. Kreisberger said Capri was guarded about where he’d been and what he’d done. Capri told him he had grown up in Brooklyn and lived in Long Island before moving to Phoenix and getting into the real-estate-flipping game.\n\nThere were red flags, Kreisberger said. Capri touted his real-estate acumen and looked financially great on paper. But an accountant reviewing Capri’s finances warned that the entrepreneur was leveraged to the hilt with almost no liquid assets.\n\nKreisberger was so excited about the partnership, he said he was willing to overlook his accountant’s objections. Capri had great ideas and the two had become fast friends. Capri had not paid any franchise fees, and Kreisberger said he, not Capri, had bankrolled the launch, paying for designs, architects and lawyers. Riverview was supposed to become Play Factory’s flagship.\n\nDays before they were set to open in 2007, Kreisberger said Capri called him to brag he had just signed a deal to build a Toby Keith restaurant next to the Play Factory at Mesa Riverview.\n\n“He said, ‘The landlord just put $250,000 right in my pocket. The landlord wants to write me checks,’ ” Kreisberger said. “It was a scheme, and that’s what he told me. Flat out.”\n\nAssociate: 'The light bulb came on'\n\nThe next day, Kreisberger said he was invited to Capri’s Scottsdale Waterfront residence. Capri wanted to show off his new top-of-the-line BMW.\n\nKreisberger said Capri took him upstairs to talk possibilities, about how they could score more cash by signing leases in exchange for up-front tenant-improvement fees. He said they could line up deals to build Play Factories and Toby Keith restaurants at other malls across the country.\n\n“He just started admitting it to me,” Kreisberger said. “He did not care if he was signing a 10-year lease, as long as he could get money and keep it going.”\n\nKreisberger said at that moment “the light bulb came on” and he realized Capri was using him the same way he was using other developers. But there was little he could do but try to get out, abandon the franchise agreement and sever ties with Capri.\n\nBy the time Play Factory opened its Mesa location, Capri had signed a lease to build a second indoor playground at the Fulton Ranch Towne Center in Chandler. Only he had done this one without Kreisberger, creating a new company doing business as “Jump and Shout.”\n\nKreisberger said Capri took “my concept, my design and even my (franchise) name.”\n\nAt the same time, Capri became more deeply involved in development deals for Toby Keith restaurants.\n\nKreisberger said Capri’s attitude toward him changed.\n\n“Our personal relationship went from laid-back to a little more serious. His tone and body language changed. I wouldn’t call him hostile. I just felt like I was expendable. He didn’t need me anymore.”\n\nCourt and business records show that by 2010 both of Capri’s indoor playgrounds were shut down at the Mesa and Chandler malls amid allegations he failed to pay rent.\n\nRED Development Co. of Phoenix accused Capri and his company of reneging on a 10-year lease. The lawsuit said they stopped paying rent in Chandler within months of opening and owed more than $224,000.\n\nThe case was settled for undisclosed terms, becoming a prototype for dozens of lawsuits that later would be filed against Capri and his companies by developers and mall owners over the Toby Keith restaurants.\n\nKreisberger said he considered suing Capri, but his lawyer told him to sever ties and walk away. He did — and never worked with Capri again.\n\nKreisberger said the sting of his loss never went away completely. Five years later, when he learned Capri was negotiating a lease to open another Toby Keith restaurant at the CityNorth mall in Phoenix, Kreisberger said he called the developers to warn them.\n\nHe said past CityNorth representatives told him they were aware of Boomtown’s reputation and had built protections into the contract.\n\n“I couldn’t believe it,” he said. “I told them not to go through with it. I told them (Capri) will take the tenant-improvement money and walk away.”\n\nRestaurants closed, not completed\n\nLess than five months after it opened in 2015, the Toby Keith restaurant at CityNorth closed without warning. Employees came to work to find the building locked and a notice from the landlord taped to the door.\n\nIt was not the first Toby Keith’s I Love This Bar and Grill to close within months of opening. Venues in Orlando, Houston and Oxnard, California, suffered similar fates.\n\nThe CityNorth developer joined a growing list of property owners and landlords suing Capri and his company.\n\nThe Republic found Capri, Boomtown Entertainment LLC or related entities closed 19 of their 20 Toby Keith restaurants in an 18-month span beginning in 2014.\n\nClosures started in Dallas after a mall owner won a $1.4 million judgment against Boomtown for failure to pay rent, a 2015 Republic investigation found.\n\nMore lawsuits followed. A pattern emerged: construction delays, tenant disputes, missed rental payments, delinquent taxes and evictions, which led to more closures and unfinished projects.\n\nThe company also had announced deals to build 20 more restaurants that it left unfinished or never started.\n\nOnly one of Boomtown’s Toby Keith restaurants, in Foxborough, Massachusetts, remains open. Boomtown in 2015 transferred the restaurant to a holding company at the address of one of Capri’s lawyers.\n\nSinger collected on naming rights\n\nBoomtown took its name from Toby Keith’s second studio album. The restaurants themselves were named after the country singer's 2003 chart topper \"I Love This Bar.\"\n\nBoomtown wasn’t the only company operating Toby Keith-themed restaurants, but it was by far the biggest.\n\nThe concept was part dance hall, part nightclub and part Southern-dining experience. Toby Keith's were built big. The sprawling dining space included a stage for concerts and the centerpiece of each restaurant was an 85-foot-long guitar-shaped bar in star-spangled colors.\n\nKeith's name was on the buildings, but he didn't have an ownership stake in the restaurants. He collected revenue on the naming rights and would make occasional appearances.\n\nKeith has remained silent on Boomtown and Frank Capri. He did not respond to an interview request in 2015 and again this year. It is unknown if Keith knew anything about Capri's background.\n\nKeith licenses his name to other businesses operating Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill locations, including one at Harrah's Las Vegas. The Hal Smith Restaurant Group owns three in Oklahoma. None of those restaurants is connected to Capri.\n\nProperty owners and developers accused Capri and his companies of using money designated for construction of their Toby Keith restaurants at one location as a cash machine to pay for improvements at others.\n\nCapri, Boomtown or related entities also were accused of taking money meant to pay plumbers, electricians, landscapers, painters and other laborers — in other words, the kind of “working man” Keith immortalizes in songs and truck commercials.\n\nIn 2015 interviews, Boomtown officials said the shutdowns were part of an aggressive new business plan. They said each restaurant was unique and legal issues at one location were unrelated to others. They pointed to the closures of four restaurants that they said soon would be offset by the openings of new ones in Ohio, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.\n\nAt the time, The Republic found that Boomtown already had walked away from its lease in Cleveland, delayed construction in Pittsburgh and canceled plans to build in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\nNone of the announced restaurants was built.\n\n$65 million in judgments\n\nBy August 2017, judges had ordered Capri, Boomtown or related entities to pay more than $65 million in judgments, according to court records and media accounts.\n\nDevelopers, landlords and contractors in 18 states, including Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio and New York, have obtained judgments against Capri and his companies ranging from $2,200 to $10.5 million.\n\nOther lawsuits have been filed against them seeking $3 million in damages.\n\nCapri and his companies also have been hit with $3.2 million in government liens for failing to pay liquor, sales and property taxes.\n\nA Savannah, Georgia, mall that won an $8 million lawsuit against Capri and his companies in 2015 later filed a complaint accusing Capri and business associate Debbie Corvo of fraud, conspiracy and racketeering.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in Maricopa County said Capri and Corvo stole tenant-improvement money as part of a “criminal enterprise.”\n\nThe company also accused Boomtown’s former vice president and lawyer, Gregory McClure, of aiding in the fraud, saying he \"embezzled or diverted more than $1 million ... to himself.\"\n\nMcClure said he would not comment and in phone messages asked not to be bothered again.\n\nLawyers for SSF Savannah Properties said in court documents that Capri and Corvo solicited leases for Toby Keith restaurants, taking large payments for tenant improvements they never intended to make.\n\nSavannah said in court documents that Capri and Corvo knew the restaurants were insolvent when they took the money.\n\nWeeks before Savannah obtained its judgment against Boomtown, Capri, Corvo and McClure concocted a scheme to transfer Boomtown’s interest in more than a dozen Toby Keith restaurants to a holding company, according to Savannah's complaints. They used the holding company to sell Boomtown’s interests, leaving Boomtown unable to pay the $8 million, lawyers said in court documents.\n\nPhoenix lawyer John Condrey, who represents Savannah, said he could not comment on the case. He said Savannah stands by the allegations in its complaints.\n\nCapri and Corvo denied any wrongdoing and have sought to throw out the racketeering claims.\n\nThey contended the holding-company transfers were legitimate and asked the court to dismiss all of Savannah’s claims, void the $8 million judgment against Boomtown and award them attorneys’ fees. They also accused McClure of theft.\n\nMcClure did not respond to the allegations in court filings.\n\nKreisberger said he periodically sees Capri shopping and browsing among the northeast Valley’s trendiest malls. Kreisberger said if Capri recognizes him, he doesn’t say anything.\n\nHe said Capri moves on in a typically boisterous fashion, as if he doesn’t have a care in the world.\n\n“He’s going to do this again,” Kresiberger said. “He’s going to take advantage of someone. This is what he does.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2016/03/30/hitman-pleads-guilty-manslaughter-1979-murder/82432434/", "title": "Serial hit man admits to 1979 execution-style slaying", "text": "Miles Jay Oliver\n\nmiles.oliver@shreveporttimes.com\n\nA Caddo District Court judge expressed dissatisfaction Wednesday with a plea agreement for an admitted killer who executed a Shreveport mother on New Year's Day nearly four decades ago.\n\nIn accepting Larry N. Thompson Sr.'s guilty plea, Judge Katherine Dorroh sentenced him to the 21 years mandated by the agreement between Thompson and the Caddo District Attorney's office. But Dorroh didn't let the sentencing go without making her opinion about the agreement known.\n\n“I’m honoring the agreement that the state made, much to my chagrin,” said Dorroh as Thompson pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the 37-year-old homicide that reached a dizzying climax during Wednesday morning's court proceedings. Dorroh also stressed that the agreement \"occurred without the court's involvement.\"\n\nDeanna Elliott Montgomery was killed Jan. 1, 1979 after Thompson shot her in the back of the head with a 16-gauge shotgun as she sat in the passenger seat of a car driven by her husband James Haywood Montgomery. Bald, aged, and wearing dark-rimmed glasses and a less-than-threatening countenance, Thompson admitted Wednesday to killing Deanna Montgomery after being paid to carry out the execution by her husband.\n\nThompson, who did not make a statement during the hearing but did respond yes or no to Dorroh's questions, had faced a second-degree murder charge. His co-defendant, James Montgomery, received a five year sentence last week in the same case. Each pleaded to the lesser charge of manslaughter and will get credit for time served from the date of their indictments.\n\nIn a two paragraph statement released Wednesday afternoon, Caddo District Attorney James E. Stewart Sr. said the plea agreement occurred after Thompson admitted he lied in a previous statement about the case. As a result, prosecutors notified James Montgomery's attorney of Thompson's dishonesty, according to the release.\n\n\"This, among other concerns, necessitated the subsequent plea agreement that the District Attorney's office entered into with James Montgomery,\" Stewart said. \"Fortunately, we were able to avoid dismissing the case in its entirety and get admissions of guilt in a case that for decades had been unresolved.\"\n\nJames Montgomery's arrest for the death of his wife came after an investigation into an alleged sexual assault on a family member. James Montgomery was charged with aggravated rape in May 2013 and a dismissal of the charge was entered the same day he pleaded guilty to manslaughter in his wife's death. As a result of his plea agreement, James Montgomery could be released in as little as 18 months.\n\nThe DA's office wouldn't comment on why the sexual assault charges were dropped when asked Tuesday. Instead, the office's public information officer indicated Stewart would release a statement this week.\n\nThompson, 73, is serving a 50-plus year sentence at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola for his part in a botched armored car heist that took place in March 2003. He will serve that sentence and the 21 years related to the Deanna Montgomery killing simultaneously.\n\nDuring the hearing, Thompson, dressed in Caddo Correctional Center black and white striped pants and top, acknowledged he fully understood all aspects of the plea before Dorroh ordered him to pay court costs and to return to Angola at the earliest possible moment.\n\nDeanna Elliott Montgomery killing timeline\n\nJanuary 1, 1979 — Deanna Elliott Montgomery is killed while traveling on Line Avenue in a car driven by her husband, James Haywood Montgomery III\n\nMay 15, 2014 — Warrant issued for Larry Neal Thompson, Sr., bond set at $750,000\n\nJune 10, 2014 — Montgomery arraigned, pleads not guilty to second-degree murder\n\nJuly 22, 2014 — Kammi Whatley appointed as counsel for Thompson, he pleads not guilty to the charge of second-degree murder\n\nMarch 22, 2016 — Montgomery pleads guilty to amended charge of manslaughter, dismissal entered for charge of aggravated rape, sentenced to five years with time served\n\nMarch 30, 2016 — Thompson pleads guilty to amended charge of manslaughter, sentenced to 21 years to serve concurrently with other sentences", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/us/ryan-last-suicide-sextortion-california/index.html", "title": "A 17-year-old boy died by suicide hours after being scammed.

Immediately after Ryan shared an intimate photo of his own, the cybercriminal demanded $5,000, threatening to make the photo public and send it to Ryan’s family and friends.\n\nRyan Last. Courtesy Pauline Stuart\n\nThe San Jose, California, teen told the cybercriminal he could not pay the full amount, and the demand was ultimately lowered to a fraction of the original figure – $150. But after paying the scammers from his college savings, Stuart said, “They kept demanding more and more and putting lots of continued pressure on him.”\n\nAt the time, Stuart knew none of what her son was experiencing. She learned the details after law enforcement investigators reconstructed the events leading up to his death.\n\nShe had said goodnight to Ryan at 10 p.m., and described him as her usually happy son. By 2 a.m., he had been scammed, and taken his life. Ryan left behind a suicide note describing how embarrassed he was for himself and the family.\n\n“He really, truly thought in that time that there wasn’t a way to get by if those pictures were actually posted online,” Pauline said. “His note showed he was absolutely terrified. No child should have to be that scared.”\n\nLaw enforcement calls the scam “sextortion,” and investigators have seen an explosion in complaints from victims leading the FBI to ramp up a campaign to warn parents from coast to coast.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback An inside look at sextortion (2017) 02:19 - Source: CNN\n\nThe bureau says there were over 18,000 sextortion-related complaints in 2021, with losses in excess of $13 million. The FBI says the use of child pornography by criminals to lure suspects also constitutes a serious crime.\n\nThe investigation into Last’s case is ongoing, Stuart and the FBI tell CNN.\n\n“To be a criminal that specifically targets children – it’s one of the more deeper violations of trust I think in society,” says FBI Supervisory Special Agent Dan Costin, who leads a team of investigators working to counter crimes against children.\n\nAccording to Costin, many of the sextortion scams reported to the FBI are determined to be from criminals on the African continent and in Southeast Asia. Federal investigators are working with their law enforcement counterparts around the world, Costin said, to help identify and arrest perpetrators who are targeting kids online.\n\nRyan Last and his mother, Pauline Stuart. Courtesy Pauline Stuart\n\nOne challenge for the FBI: many victims of sextortion do not report the incidents to law enforcement.\n\n“The embarrassment piece of this is probably one of the bigger hurdles that the victims have to overcome,” said Costin. “It can be a lot, especially in that moment.”\n\nBut investigators urge victims to quickly contact law enforcement, either online or at their local FBI field office.\n\nMedical experts say there’s a key reason why young males are especially vulnerable to sextortion-related scams.\n\n“Teen brains are still developing,” said Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Mass General in Boston. “So when something catastrophic happens, like a personal picture is released to people online, it’s hard for them to look past that moment and understand that in the big scheme of things they’ll be able to get through this.”\n\nHadland said there are steps parents can take to help safeguard their kids from online harm.\n\n“The most important thing that a parent should do with their teen is try to understand what they’re doing online,” she said. “You want to know when they’re going online, who they’re interacting with, what platforms they’re using. Are they being approached by people that they don’t know, are they experiencing pressure to share information or photos?”\n\nHadland said it’s also critical that parents specifically warn teens of scams like sextortion, without shaming them.\n\n“You want to make it clear that they can talk to you if they have done something, or they feel like they’ve made a mistake,” he said.\n\nRyan’s mom agrees.\n\n“You need to talk to your kids because we need to make them aware of it,” Stuart said.\n\nStill grieving the loss of her son, she is channeling her family’s pain into action, and honoring Ryan by speaking out and telling his story. She hopes that doing so will help save lives.\n\n“How could these people look at themselves in the mirror knowing that $150 is more important than a child’s life?” she says. “There’s no other word but ‘evil’ for me that they care much more about money than a child’s life.

And a police cavalcade had brought the detectives to their meeting with the chief.\n\nThen, immediately after the introductions, Durazo leveled an accusation: The American guests were CIA agents posing as cops. Through a translator, Durazo brushed off their denials and began talking about arms shipments and drug smuggling.\n\n“You know what I do for the CIA and the Contras?” he asked.\n\nThat comment, which made no sense at the time, echoes in Rothmiller’s memory. Only years later, would Americans learn about a secret U.S. campaign, then underway, to arm insurgents fighting Nicaragua’s leftist government.\n\nIn that moment, however, it seemed that Mexico’s top cop was trying to sidetrack their negotiations.\n\nRothmiller and Hamilton tried to steer the conversation to counter-terrorism. There were reports that a Colombian organization known as the 19th of April Movement might be plotting an attack on the Olympic games. The detectives wanted help from Mexico to prevent an attack.\n\nAgain, El Negro played tough. He said he might be willing to share information — but only if the detectives would get him access to a U.S. database of stolen vehicles.\n\nRothmiller balked. Before heading south, he’d run a background check and learned that Mexico City’s police chief was dirty. Durazo had been indicted by a Florida grand jury seven years earlier for cocaine trafficking. And, to Rothmiller’s bewilderment, those charges were somehow erased from the U.S. justice system.\n\nKnowing the value of stolen-vehicle data to Mexican crime syndicates, Rothmiller told El Negro that a detective could never make such a deal — then held his breath.\n\nDurazo eventually abandoned his demand. He agreed to share information on terrorist groups. And he gave the two LA cops badges with credentials identifying them as majors on the Mexico City police force.\n\nOn the flight back to LA, Rothmiller's head swirled with questions: What was all the CIA talk? How did someone make a federal drug indictment disappear? And who was this guy?\n\nNow a silver-haired author living in Prescott, Rothmiller never saw Durazo again.\n\nBut he kept watching, and kept wondering.\n\nEl Negro would become the most notorious lawman in Mexican history, a fugitive from his own government. And the target of a frantic, worldwide manhunt by the FBI, trying to stop a presidential assassination.\n\nThat drama, previously hidden in classified U.S. government files, is partially revealed in Rothmiller's recently published book, \"Secrets, Lies and Deception.\"\n\nBut here is the full story, never told before.\n\nWhile each detail of Rothmiller's account could not be independently verified, all key facts were corroborated by FBI reports, news archives, books, interviews and other records. Some FBI documents cited in this story were obtained independently by Virginia Colwell, an architectural historian in Mexico City whose father, Jack Colwell, was among the FBI agents who captured Durazo.\n\nRothmiller worked in LAPD's Organized Crime Intelligence Division.\n\nAfter the Mexico trip, he continued planning Olympic security, aided by a pair of Durazo's police colonels, plus the Colombian operative.\n\nOver time, Rothmiller says, those sources assured him Durazo was, in fact, tied to the CIA, and they alluded to U.S. government involvement not just with Nicaraguan rebels, but with drug smugglers.\n\nAlthough skeptical, Rothmiller developed an appreciation for his informer's savvy and his connections.\n\nThe operative had once served as a police officer in Bogota, and seemed to have tentacles everywhere. But he would only learn years later, while reading FBI files on El Negro, just how far they reached.\n\nThose documents contain dozens of references to an informer known as \"Source Two.\" The person's name is blacked out, but the identity unmistakable: the Colombian.\n\nFBI reports say Source Two was so close to Durazo that he served as a personal aide when El Negro moved to Los Angeles, even registering the former chief's vehicles to his home address in Southern California.\n\nThe FBI records mention that Source Two, as a Bogota police officer, became a confidante to Colombia's most powerful politicians in the late 1960s. After the adult son of a politician was involved in a fatal shooting, FBI records say, Source Two agreed to take the blame. In return, the Colombian government helped him flee to the United States to avoid arrest.\n\nThe Arizona Republic recently tracked down Source Two at his modest California home. Clear-eyed, feisty and articulate, the balding 82-year-old sipped coffee at a kitchen table, confirming the FBI reports and asking not to be identified for security reasons.\n\nHe said he began working for Colombia's secret police as a teenager and advanced in rank, becoming close with President Guillermo Valencia Muñoz.\n\nSource Two said he and the son of an important political figure went out with two women one evening. He fell asleep in the car, and was awakened by gunfire: For reasons that are unclear, his friend had shot one of the women.\n\nTo avert a national scandal, Source Two said, he agreed to become a scapegoat. \"I was so stupid. Unfortunately, I'm a very loyal person,\" he explained. \"I say, 'Well, I was drunk. I did it.'\"\n\nSource Two vanished to Miami, then New York, where he got a job at a customs house. During the early 1970s, he was approached there by a Colombian government official offering $250,000 for help with a cocaine-smuggling operation.\n\nSource Two said he has always hated drugs and terrorists, so he went to federal prosecutors and agreed to be the front man for an undercover sting. When the case broke, he said, Colombian cartels posted the $250,000 bribery sum as a bounty on his head. The Justice Department gave Source Two U.S. citizenship and a new identity, placing his family under witness protection with names they still use today. The government also helped launch his new career as informer.\n\n\"I never worked for the money,\" Source Two said. \"I am a professional law enforcement officer, and I'm doing nothing for money.\"\n\nHe worked primarily on salary as a contract operative for the FBI, with additional jobs for the Customs Service, Drug Enforcement Administration, IRS, U.S. Marshals Service and local law enforcement. His civilian job, distributor for a body-armor company, served as cover while he traveled the world gathering intelligence and setting up criminals.\n\nAs suggested in FBI files, Source Two was mostly a shadow — running stings without being publicly exposed.\n\nThere were exceptions, however: Court records show he led a 1,500-pound cocaine seizure by the Mohave County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. And he put a major narcotics trafficker behind bars in Texas.\n\nSource Two said he has never counted up the investigations or criminal convictions, but there were many brushes with death. \"I've been in the middle of very, very, very bad people. Many times I got set up and everything,\" he said, pointing skyward. \"And I got protection from the Lord.\"\n\nMORE INFAMOUS CRIME: The story of Arizona's Tison Gang prison escape, killing spree in 1978 | Feds move to drop charges against remaining Bundy standoff defendants | Ex-mafia hit man and turncoat Sammy the Bull released from prison\n\nIn the late 1970s, Source Two said, FBI handlers asked him to target Durazo.\n\nAt the time, El Negro had not yet been convicted of orchestrating cocaine shipments from Colombia through Mexico to Miami, but was suspected. Source Two said he came up with a ruse, persuading an international police association to give El Negro an award for law enforcement in Washington, D.C. Source Two arranged to be Durazo's guide on tours of the FBI academy and U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"My expertise was infiltration,\" he explained. \"I was assigned to infiltrate him. So I did … He once lit a cigarette with a $100 bill right in front of me.\"\n\nSoon, Source Two was making trips to Mexico City, visiting his new friend, who not only gave him a badge as police major, but made him a general in Mexico's military — a title he flaunted during sting operations.\n\nSource Two said he had no part in Durazo's Miami indictment, but isn't surprised the criminal charges simply vanished: \"Like Noriega in Panama, he dealt with all the (U.S.) agencies because they needed his cooperation in Mexico.\"\n\nPortions of Source Two's account are substantiated not just by FBI records, but by Albert Zapanta, now president and CEO of the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce. Zapanta, who has held numerous U.S. government positions, became acquainted with Source Two and Durazo during the 1970s in Mexico City, where the chief gave him credentials as a police major. (He also was offered, but refused, a gold- and silver-plated .45 automatic.)\n\nZapanta says he suspected Durazo was a CIA asset, adding, \"I had to believe it had to do with arms and drugs.\"\n\nHe also wondered about Source Two, a \"promoter of relationships\" who seemed to work for U.S. intelligence. \"He was a likable guy,\" Zapanta adds, \"but would I trust him? No.\"\n\nRothmiller's impression of Source Two at the time: \"U.S. agents, spies and cops buzzed around him like gringo bees. And there was no doubt he had access to the deepest secrets within the Mexican intelligence community.\"\n\nIn fact, Source Two became one of Rothmiller's most valuable assets, putting him onto major cases that involved cocaine shipments into California and weapons trafficking out of the country. Those investigations were underway on Aug. 10, 1982, when Rothmiller — driving near his home — was ambushed by a gunman on a motorcycle. Six shots from a machine pistol peppered his unmarked police car. Rothmiller was not hit. But he crashed, injuring his back, and the gunman escaped.\n\nForced to take medical leave, Rothmiller applied for worker's compensation benefits. LAPD administrators denied them, alleging he had fabricated the shooting and injury. Misconduct charges were filed. After hearing evidence, a judge not only ruled in favor of Rothmiller, but ripped the police department, which was headed at the time by Chief Daryl Gates. Rothmiller received compensation for the injury and stress caused by an LAPD campaign of harassment and false charges.\n\nDespite the outcome, Rothmiller's law enforcement future was over, and he resigned from the police department.\n\nBut there would be another chapter in his personal conflict with Chief Gates. And the strange story of El Negro would get more tangled.\n\nMexico elected a new president in 1982, Miguel De La Madrid Hurtado, who vowed to root out corruption.\n\nDurazo lost his job.\n\nWithin months, one of his top aides published a bestselling book, \"Lo Negro del Negro Durazo\" (The Dark Side of Blacky Durazo), which in chilling detail revealed the former chief's role in murders, bribery, drug dealing and other crimes.\n\nBy early 1983, with rumors spreading through Mexican media that Durazo would face criminal charges, he went underground. He began jetting around the world, with a home base in California.\n\nRothmiller knew El Negro had a condo in Marina Del Rey's oceanfront towers, frequented a plush L.A. restaurant, and hung out with American judges and law officers.\n\nOnce again, the reality made no sense. \"Durazo was the El Chapo of his time,\" Rothmiller recalls. \"We knew he was under indictment. Why is he not getting arrested when he comes here?\"\n\nThe questions remained unanswered for years, overshadowed for Rothmiller by career developments. After leaving the police force, he worked in television, eventually hosting a show on ESPN called \"The Gamesman\" where he wrestled alligators, soared with the Blue Angels and took on other challenges.\n\nHe also began writing books.\n\nThe first, \"LA's Secret Police,\" was published amid a furor over the 1992 Los Angeles riots spawned by the beating of motorist Rodney King. Rothmiller described the attempt on his life, suggesting a link with his investigation of drug cartels and arms shipments. He also mentioned his Colombian snitch. But the volume focused on a police spy campaign waged by Chief Gates against California political figures and Hollywood celebrities. Rothmiller's revelations helped force the closure of LAPD's Organized Crime Intelligence Division and, along with the riots, contributed to Gates' departure as chief.\n\nRothmiller wrote more than a dozen books — from a psychological portrait of Hitler to a historical analysis of Roman law to a humor tome about dogs.\n\nHe began paying attention to the Iran-Contra scandal, which included allegations that Reagan administration operatives coordinated with cocaine traffickers to finance military shipments to Nicaraguan insurgents. The Kerry Report of 1988, a U.S. Senate investigation, spelled out the Contra collaborations.\n\nRothmiller also followed investigations into the Mexico City torture and assassination of DEA Agent Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena. Although the 1985 slaying initially was blamed on cartel leaders and corrupt Mexican officials, two former DEA officials in 2013 went public with claims that the CIA played a role.\n\nPhil Jordan of Scottsdale, former head of the DEA's El Paso Intelligence Center, and Hector Berrellez, a retired agent who oversaw the investigation into Camarena's death, contend a CIA operative named Felix Rodriguez was present during Camarena's torture, and the murder was carried out in part because the DEA agent had uncovered connections between cartels and Mexican airstrips used to ferry drugs and weapons for the Contra operation.\n\nThe CIA has denied involvement in Camarena's death. Via email, an agency spokeswoman declined to provide records or answer questions about figures in this story. However, the spokeswoman confirmed Rodriguez was a CIA operative.\n\n(In a recent Mexican television news interview, Rodriguez said the assertion that he played a role in Camarena's demise was \"the most ridiculous accusation I've heard in my life.\" He said he was not even in Mexico at the time, and would take a polygraph test to prove it.)\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Rothmiller finally acted on his curiosity about El Negro, filing public-records requests with the FBI, State Department and other federal agencies. Inquiries were stonewalled or denied, he says. Then, inexplicably, the FBI mailed him a CD full of classified reports.\n\nThe documents read like a spy novel with a stunning twist. The plot, based in Los Angeles rather than Mexico, placed Mike Rothmiller as a minor character. It also revealed his former partner, Hamilton, in a shocking cameo.\n\nEl Negro's legend began in Cumpas, a Sonoran village about 100 miles south of the Arizona border, where Arturo Durazo Moreno grew up. López Portillo, the future Mexican president, was his neighbor and close friend.\n\nBoth entered government service. El Negro became a member of Mexico's right-wing Guardias Blancas (White Guards), a militia notorious for violently quashing reformists during the 1960s. When López Portillo ran for president in 1976, Durazo became his personal security chief.\n\nThat relationship proved troublesome for American authorities.\n\nAccording to records obtained by Rothmiller, just before López Portillo was sworn in, then-U.S. Ambassador Joseph Jova met with the president-elect to warn about Durazo's Florida cocaine indictment. Jova told López Portillo that Durazo could face arrest in the U.S., and urged him not to give El Negro a prominent government job. López Portillo ignored that request, creating a potential diplomatic nightmare.\n\nBut, as Rothmiller puts it, something very odd happened: \"The U.S. agencies then conspire to remove the warrant from the Look-Out system. They keep the indictment secret and allow this cocaine trafficker to travel freely in and out of the U.S. during the next six years ... He (Durazo) held meetings with senior U.S. officials and, during the term of his appointment, continued his cocaine trafficking, engaged in extortion, kickbacks and murder.\"\n\nBy all accounts, Durazo used Mexico City's federal police department as a personal crime syndicate.\n\nHis official salary was reportedly $1,000 per month, yet he amassed a fortune. There were mansions in Mexico and getaways in the U.S., Canada, Spain and elsewhere. One Mexican compound featured a horse-racing track, a man-made lake, a casino and a discotheque. Another, replicating Greece's Parthenon, is now a popular museum of corruption.\n\nWhen López Portillo left office in December 1982, the new president, De La Madrid, fulfilled a reform promise by replacing the capital city's police chief.\n\nEl Negro already was a subject of Mexican movies, books and ballads. Now, a criminal probe was underway. But the target, tipped off by insiders, slipped away — with help from a Colombian pal in Los Angeles.\n\nSource Two confirms FBI reports that describe how he helped Durazo import vehicles to California, cash checks, seek visas and set up business meetings as an aide and confidante. Source Two said he solidified trust by using his influence to get Durazo's wife, Silvia, through U.S. Customs with gold elephant statues and $300,000 cash.\n\nBy late 1983, Durazo still had not been charged with a crime in Mexico, and there was no official U.S. effort to track him down.\n\nBut early the next year an urgent bulletin was sent from the Los Angeles FBI office to then-bureau Director William Webster:\n\n\"THREAT TO KILL MEXICAN PRESIDENT MIGUEL DE LA MADRID ... THIS COMMUNICATION IS CLASSIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY. LEGAT (legal attache for the FBI), MEXICO CITY, HAS DISSEMINATED INFORMATION REGARDING THE ALLEGED THREAT BY DURAZO TO HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO KILLED … MUCH CONCERN HAS BEEN GENERATED OVER THIS THREAT INASMUCH AS THE DEPUTY MEXICO FEDERAL ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS ADVISED THAT DURAZO MAY HAVE AS MUCH AS ONE BILLION DOLLARS AT HIS DISPOSAL.\"\n\nAccording to the FBI, Durazo hoped that by eliminating Mexico’s new leader he could avoid prosecution.\n\nThe alert described how the chief of Mexico's Federal Security Directorate, José Antonio Zorrilla Peréz, had asked U.S. authorities if American agents could secretly capture Durazo in the U.S. — without a warrant or extradition — and haul him back to Mexico as a \"forcible escorted deportation.\"\n\nZorrilla, who claimed his government allowed U.S. agents to take similar actions in Mexico, was informed such a plan would be kidnapping — unacceptable and illegal.\n\nThe Mexican official tried another tack, asking \"WHAT WOULD BE THE RESULT IF SOMEONE WAS MERELY SENT TO KILL DURAZO?\" The American legal attache answered that it would be \"intolerable.\"\n\nFinally, Zorrilla pointed out that Mexican authorities had previously cooperated with U.S. law enforcement by planting drugs on subjects in Mexico so they could be arrested. He asked if the FBI or Los Angeles police might employ a similar tactic on Durazo.\n\nThe attache once again refused, urging Mexican officials to secure a criminal warrant for Durazo that would meet U.S. legal requirements for extradition.\n\nThe attache then suggested an alternate plan: American agents could launch a sting in hopes of drawing Durazo into a murder plot while inside the U.S. — a violation of the Neutrality Act.\n\nHow would such an operation be carried out?\n\nThe attache explained: \"BY HAVING U.S. SPECIAL AGENTS OF THE FBI POSE AS MERCENARIES CONTRACTED BY DURAZO TO ACCOMPLISH THE ASSASSINATION OF THE (Mexican) PRESIDENT, THUS CATCHING DURAZO IN AN OVERT ACT …\"\n\nAccording to the FBI memo, Zorrilla became so excited at this proposal he volunteered to fly the U.S. attache on his private Lear jet, 'El Tigre,' to Washington, D.C., for approvals.\n\nThat same day, the FBI communique says, Mexico's deputy attorney general conferred with U.S. Ambassador John Gavin and asked for a meeting with U.S. Attorney General William French Smith to request an \"urgent, direct investigation by the FBI to resolve this threat.\"\n\nFederal agents learned of the Mexican assassination plot from informers in California.\n\nThe first, identified in records only as “Source One,” was interviewed by FBI agents on Dec. 14, 1983. He claimed to be a close friend of the Durazo family and reported that a relative of El Negro told him, \"They are going to kill the president\" of Mexico.\n\nThen came the February 1984 interview with Source Two, who told U.S. agents he'd known El Negro for years and helped him relocate to Los Angeles. According to Source Two, another of Durazo's relatives was soliciting assistance for a presidential murder.\n\n\"…HE (the relative) STATED, 'DE LA MADRID HAS CAUSED TOO MUCH PROBLEMS ... THAT SON OF A BITCH MUST DIE. CAN YOU HELP US WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, SPECIFICALLY WITH THE CIA, TO GET A NECESSARY FORCE TOGETHER, OF 10 OR 20 MEN, EXPERT ASSASSINS, TO ENTER THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE IN MEXICO AND KILL THE PRESIDENT?'\"\n\nA week later, Source Two had a follow-up conversation with the Durazo relative about who might finance the assassination, the FBI report says. Source Two said he was told El Negro would pay.\n\nIn official reports, some FBI agents questioned Source Two's trustworthiness. They wrote that, several years earlier, he failed a polygraph test and was \"discontinued with prejudice\" as an operative. They said he was suspected of posing as a federal officer and possessing stolen property, though U.S. prosecutors declined to file charges. They described him as a \"wheeler and dealer\" who consorted with \"organized crime figures, thieves, con artists and present and past law enforcement officials of questionable integrity ... (He) will work for both sides as long as he gets what he wants ...\"\n\nAnother FBI report suggested that Source Two was a mole — manipulating agents while gathering information to protect El Negro: \"(Source Two) is known to have numerous contacts within LAPD,\" the memo added, \"and he may use them to help Durazo.\"\n\nNevertheless, a key FBI memo concluded Source Two was \"very reliable,\" and he might be the crucial go-between in an undercover operation.\n\nDuring interviews with The Republic, Source Two denied failing any polygraph test or possessing stolen property. He said he earned a reputation for integrity, but jealous agents concocted allegations because they resented his ability to go over their heads to top FBI administrators.\n\nAccording to FBI records, Durazo lived a \"playboy lifestyle,\" theoretically making him easy to locate.\n\nHe frequented the ritzy Westwood Marquis Hotel in Los Angeles. He bought a condo in nearby tower where the top floor cost $11 million, including helipad. His vehicles included a Rolls Royce, a Ferrari and a Mercedes Benz.\n\nAlthough Durazo wasn't threatening in stature, looks can be deceiving. Most FBI teletypes ended with a warning: \"SUBJECT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS. ... DURAZO'S BODYGUARDS ALLEGEDLY CARRY UZZI (sic) SUBMACHINE GUNS AND DURAZO HIMSELF CARRIES A .45 CALIBER AUTOMATIC.\"\n\nPerhaps more importantly, as a former police chief El Negro had vast resources. Agents believed he was getting intelligence from law enforcement figures in the U.S. and Mexico. Because of that, FBI bulletins were top secret — not even entered into a national crime computer.\n\nDurazo's crony network included prominent American politicians, judges, police chiefs and federal agents, as well as officials overseas.\n\nEven amid the secrecy, federal communiques about El Negro zipped across the nation and around the world. Durazo was said to be in Spain, Cuba, Brazil, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Tahiti, France, Canada and Los Angeles. Dozens of FBI offices were investigating. Information was shared with the CIA, State Department and Secret Service.\n\nIn March 1984, assassination fears peaked as President De La Madrid scheduled a spring visit to Washington, D.C. The U.S. Secret Service was warned with a teletype that stressed, \"THIS MATTER IS BEING GIVEN THE HIGHEST PRIORITY.\"\n\nOn March 6 of that year, the FBI Terrorism Section in Los Angeles asked bureau headquarters for permission to launch a sting.\n\nThe application said an undercover agent would be introduced to a Durazo relative in Canada to \"discuss and plan recruitment of mercenaries\" to carry out the assassination. \"MAIN OBJECTIVE WILL BE TO MEET WITH THE PRINCIPLE SUBJECT, ARTURO DURAZO MORENO, AND OBTAIN DETAILS OF THE ASSASSINATION PLAN... ULTIMATE PLAN WILL BE TO IDENTIFY ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THE CONSPIRACY AND NEUTRALIZE THE PLAN.\"\n\nThe application included projected expenses for costly undercover clothing and meals at the \"most exclusive restaurants and/or nightclubs.\" It also listed airfares to Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico City and Tahiti.\n\nA decision from headquarters arrived March 23: “THE POSSIBLE RESULTS THAT COULD BE OBTAINED BY THIS UCO (undercover operation) WOULD NOT JUSTIFY THE RISKS AND EXPENSES … APPROVAL TO CONDUCT UCO IS NOT BEING GRANTED AT THIS TIME.”\n\nIn early April 1984, U.S. officials became concerned with yet another threat — a stealth mission against Durazo by Mexican authorities. According to FBI records, the bureau discovered high-level federales were in California using intimidation tactics to locate and possibly kidnap or kill El Negro.\n\nAmong those suspected: federal security chief Zorrilla and Miguel Aldana Ibarra, then director of INTERPOL in Mexico. The U.S. legal attache in Mexico City confronted Zorrilla, warning that foreign agents would be arrested if they tried to take out Durazo on U.S. soil. Zorrilla denied running a covert operation and suggested that El Negro had concocted such a rumor so he could challenge extradition if arrested.\n\nBy June 1984, the threat of a De la Madrid assassination was prompting executive-level communications. A teletype to FBI headquarters noted: \"The President of Mexico, MIGUEL DE LA MADRID, has personally conveyed this sense of urgency to the President of the United States, RONALD REAGAN, Attorney General WILLIAM FRENCH SMITH, and FBI Director WILLIAM WEBSTER.\"\n\nThat month, Mexican courts finally charged Durazo with extortion, illegal arms possession and tax violations.\n\nThe search continued for weeks with dead-end leads. Then, in late June 1984, FBI agents got a tip: Durazo would be arriving by plane at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to meet family members.\n\nA federal greeting party was dispatched. Shortly after the flight landed, news shot across the FBI teletype: \"SAN JUAN DIVISION ARRESTED CAPTIONED SUBJECT, ARTURO DURAZO, ON 6-29-84 WITHOUT INCIDENT ... SUICIDAL TENDENCIES.”\n\nMORE ARIZONA REPUBLIC INVESTIGATIONS: Safety group wants records opened on Goodyear tire-linked deaths | Arizona veterans commit suicide at quadruple the rate of civilians | Navajo housing agency plans to build 15 homes, 15 rentals with $80 million grant\n\nThe arrest was a media event. But Rothmiller says initial accounts left out a key detail: When Durazo's family flew to Puerto Rico to meet him, they were accompanied by Los Angeles police detective Kenny Hamilton, Rothmiller's ex-partner.\n\nHamilton, who eventually was disciplined and dismissed by LAPD for consorting with El Negro, declined to comment for this story. At the time, however, he told the Los Angeles Times: \"Durazo's just a nice, very warm guy ... When I went to Puerto Rico, it was as a friend, not as a police officer.\"\n\nFBI records don't explain how Durazo got set up. But Source Two offered this back story: After being assigned to lure Durazo into U.S. territory, Source Two learned that Silvia Durazo was planning a trip to meet her husband. Source Two says he joined Silvia — and Hamilton — on the flight from Los Angeles to Puerto Rico.\n\nStakes were high, Source Two recalls: The FBI operation was being monitored by the White House.\n\nDurazo was not in San Juan. Source Two said he was given money to hire a private plane to retrieve El Negro, but not told the destination. Instead, FBI handlers provided a bureau aircraft, unmarked, with an agent as pilot. As the flight began, Silvia announced they were going to Curacao, an island off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nAfter landing, Source Two says, he and Silvia met Durazo at a hotel and urged him to return with them to Puerto Rico, then fly to Los Angeles and seek asylum. El Negro resisted, fearful of arrest, but finally relented.\n\nWhen the plane came to a stop in San Juan, Durazo stepped onto the tarmac, oblivious to what awaited. An FBI agent stepped forward, shook the fugitive's hand and applied handcuffs, saying, \"General Durazo, welcome to Puerto Rico.\"\n\nEl Negro was flown to Los Angeles.\n\nIn court, a defense attorney told the judge Durazo would not survive extradition because he held too many secrets about powerful people. \"You can't return this man to Mexico,\" the lawyer said. \"He'll be executed somewhere along the line.\"\n\nThe prediction proved wrong. Durazo was convicted in Mexico and sentenced to 25 years. He was paroled after serving just seven, and died of natural causes in 2000.\n\nBut for Rothmiller, a riddle continued to nag — not just about El Negro or the CIA, but about why someone had tried to gun him down more than three decades ago.\n\nIt was not until 2013, when former DEA agents Berrellez and Jordan went public with allegations about a CIA role in Camarena's death, that Rothmiller filed a swarm of records requests under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nSorting through the files, the former detective no longer wonders how Durazo's cocaine indictment vanished, or who protected him: \"I'm convinced it was the CIA because of the Contra thing,\" he says. \"The weapons running.\"\n\nIn his book Rothmiller contends El Negro was \"an integral player in this top-secret operation.\"\n\n\"How many Americans died from a drug overdose or the related violence from Durazo's trafficking?\" he asks. \"How many lives could have been saved if the U.S. government elected to do their job and arrest Durazo while visiting the United States?\"\n\nRothmiller admits there's no smoking-gun proof. But, at least for an ex-cop who worked intelligence, circumstantial evidence fits like pieces cut with a jig saw.\n\n\"If you had a puzzle of Abe Lincoln, and you had everything but his eyes, you'd say, 'Oh, that's Lincoln,'\" he says. \"It kind of completes the circle.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/02/04/birmingham-alabama-drug-kingpin-linked-to-mexican-cartel-feared-kidnapping/11173245002/", "title": "Birmingham drug kingpin thought Mexican cartel might kidnap him", "text": "Beth Warren\n\nLouisville Courier Journal\n\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala. ― Mexican cartel members invited Alabama drug kingpin Rolando Antuain Williamson to cross the border and solidify their business relationship with a 2019 motorcycle trip. But Williamson worried the trip could be a trap.\n\nOne of his Mexican associates cautioned he might be kidnapped, beaten and held for a $100,000 ransom. The drug associate had been kidnapped by the Gulf Cartel, and his father had to sell the family home to secure his release.\n\nWilliamson, then age 33, heeded the warning and declined the invitation, but he continued trafficking kilos of cartel drugs.\n\nHe may have dodged one danger, but he didn't see another one lurking closer to home.\n\nNext steps crucial, experts say: Will El Chapo son's arrest slow export of drugs to US?\n\nBack in Alabama, one of his drug couriers betrayed him, allowing investigators to listen in on their discussions about drug deals. An FBI North Alabama Safe Streets task force gathered evidence against Williamson, putting his freedom at risk.\n\nThis case illustrates how, along with large cities, Mexican cartels also target small towns and mid-size cities far from the border, fueling and capitalizing on the deadliest drug epidemic in American history.\n\nThe Courier Journal reviewed court records and interviewed police, prosecutors and lead FBI Special Agent Wayne Gerhardt, who has since retired, to learn about Williamson's rise to power and the betrayal that imploded his drug ring.\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Williamson planned to drive to Atlanta, a popular cartel transshipment point, to meet with a cartel associate to pick up another load, but FBI agents arrested Williamson, searching his home and two other properties.\n\nInside his home, agents found marijuana, more than 135 grams of heroin and 150 grams of fentanyl, up to 75,000 potentially lethal doses of the top drug killing Americans.\n\nFederal grand jurors in Birmingham returned indictments against Williamson, known as Ball Head or Baldhead despite his thick braids, and 18 of his associates. However, agents have not been able to identify his main link to the cartel, a man known only as \"Meme,\" from Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nA drug courier who was born in Mexico and worked for Williamson told agents that Meme was with the Gulf Cartel, or Cartel del Gulfo, also known as CDG, which has long dominated Monterrey.\n\nProsecutors secured a rare \"kingpin\" designation for Williamson, meaning he directed an expensive drug trafficking network that moved a high volume of drugs throughout Birmingham, especially on the west side. It also meant that if he was convicted, he faced an automatic life sentence in federal prison, where parole isn't an option.\n\n\"They were the power on that side of town, especially Rolando. He directed a lot of people,\" said Gerhardt, who considers this one of the top cases of his career.\n\nMany of Williamson's associates were afraid to testify against him. He kept silent and opted to take his chances at trial. Prosecutors had a powerful case that included evidence from his phone containing messages about drug deals on WhatsApp. They also had a recording of a very revealing chat Williamson had with a Mexican business associate who became an FBI cooperating witness.\n\nYou may want to read: This small-town Oregon bricklayer had a side hustle: Gun supplier for Mexican drug cartel\n\nJurors also got to see photos of Williamson posing with expensive jewelry made for him by jewelers in Atlanta and Philadelphia and large stacks of money on Snapchat. In one photo, he's wearing a large custom-made diamond and gold pendant with his initials RAW above \"AINTNOPLAYN.\"\n\nHis fleet of cars included a Dodge Charger Hellcat and Cadillac Escalades.\n\nIn April 2022, jurors convicted Williamson of running a criminal enterprise that trafficked a variety of drugs.\n\nIn August, the judge sentenced Williamson, 37, to life plus 10 years in prison and added a money judgment against him totaling more than $36 million as a penalty for trafficking the fentanyl found in his home, more than 400 kilos of cocaine, more than 24 kilos of heroin, 10 kilos of methamphetamine and more than 20,000 pounds of marijuana.\n\nWilliamson is now jailed at a high-security prison in Louisiana.\n\nHis attorney, John D. Lloyd, said he is working on Williamson's appeal and can't comment on the case.\n\nWilliamson grew up in Bessemer, a modest suburb southwest of Birmingham with less than 32,000 residents, but had the hustle and savvy to lead the drug network blamed for supplying Birmingham's west side for years.\n\nHis team of dealers and drug couriers included a trusted member of the community ― a popular youth football coach known for urging his players to stay clear of drugs.\n\nWilliamson wanted to be at the top but would discover that running a drug ring had its own problems, including dangerous family squabbles, jealousy and betrayal.\n\nMore: Mexico-US investigation links cartel downing of military helicopter to Oregon gun supplier\n\nIt's raining money: Williamson sees an opportunity to take control\n\nBefore Rolando Williamson evolved into a drug kingpin, he dealt a smaller amount of drugs in the shadow of one of Birmingham's most flashy and notorious drug traffickers, Billy Williams Jr.\n\nLocal police considered Williams, known as Champ, as the main supplier of the city's west side by 2010 and suspect he was involved in several violent crimes, including homicides, said Greg Gauger, a retired FBI agent, who worked as the co-lead on the Williams case.\n\nFBI agents got approval for wire taps, listening for months as Williams discussed drug deals with associates.\n\nIn a coordinated ambush in 2013, a police SWAT team burst into one of Williams' stash houses at the same time seven armed members of an FBI task force rushed toward Williams' luxury downtown condo in a renovated bank building.\n\nFBI Safe Streets task force member Jude Washington slammed the ram, a heavy metal ramming device, into William's front door three times to force it open, splintering the wood door off its metal frame. He and Gerhardt were the first in, hurrying to the back bedroom.\n\nThey found Williams dressed only in his underwear. Gauger and Gerhardt shoved him to the ground and handcuffed him. Washington spun around and saw a $50 bill on a bathroom window ledge. Williams had hurriedly shoved wads of $20s and $100s out of his 12th-floor bathroom window. Bills fluttered toward the ground, scattered by a slight wind.\n\nNone of his partners in crime were waiting on the ground to scoop up the loot, so when a city bus driver beginning his morning shift spotted the cash, he rushed to grab what he could. Within minutes, FBI agents hurried over to get what was left and bag it as evidence.\n\nIt was a theatrical ending to the long criminal career of Williams, known to local law enforcement as one of Birmingham's top drug menaces who saturated the area with drugs for years.\n\nInside the condo, investigators found $167,000 in stacks of cash. They don't know how much fluttered away, but estimate it totaled hundreds or even thousands of dollars. They also found $175,000 worth of jewelry, including gold and diamond watches, two fur coats and a fleet of upscale cars including a Corvette ZR1, Chrylser 300 and Cadillac CTS-V luxury sedan.\n\n\"Billy Williams was a bad egg,\" Gauger said. \"Guys like that are dangerous. They become urban legends\" and few are willing to testify against them out of fear.\n\nWilliams ended up pleading guilty to leading a cocaine and heroin trafficking network. He discussed some of his business dealings, though he never revealed his sources of supply in Mexico. In July 2014, a judge sentenced him to serve nearly 22 years, which was later reduced to 19 years in federal prison.\n\nIn total, Williams and a dozen others were convicted on federal drug charges, including three drug associates who initially pleaded not guilty and wanted to take their chance at trial. A jury was in place in 2014 when everything changed. Jurors were sent to the jury room so the prosecutors could bring Williams before the judge to authenticate the FBI wire tapes, admitting that he was one of the voices on the recordings.\n\nWilliams wore an orange jail jumpsuit and was bound by shackles and handcuffs as he shuffled into the courtroom flanked by deputy U.S. Marshals. As he began to pass by the defense table, he briefly paused and looked each of the three defendants in the eye without saying a word. The attorneys and agents were stunned as all three defendants, before opening statements, stopped their trials and pleaded guilty.\n\nGerhardt, who retired after 23 years with the bureau, said he had never seen anything like it. No one is sure if the defendants were scared of Williams or if they just knew from the look on his face that he was going to spill all their secrets and secure their convictions.\n\nWith Williams in prison, there was an opening for control of the large drug network, and one of his relatives was expected to take over. But the relative sold heroin to undercover agents and ended up in his own prison cell.\n\nThat left the ambitious Rolando Williamson, who decided to grab that top spot for himself. In time, he grew the drug network to an even larger organization and established close ties to Mexican suppliers.\n\nBut while he was building his drug network, FBI agents were building a case against him. An informant told them Williamson was one of Williams' customers, and agents found his number listed on Williams' phone logs.\n\nEventually, some of his trusted associates betrayed him, helping investigators dethrone Williamson and topple the drug ring.\n\nWarnings and betrayal: 'He's just jealous of me'\n\nA secret recording gave investigators a glimpse at the inner workings of Williamson's drug ring, including details about a drug rip off, a warning about a possible kidnapping and a desire to order a revenge killing.\n\nThey were able to listen in on a June 11, 2019, meeting he had with a drug associate from Mexico because the associate became a cooperating witness for the government and agreed to wear a wire.\n\nWilliamson told the drug courier to deal directly with him and to avoid contact with his cousin, who used to be his right-hand man. Williamson said he no longer trusted the relative after learning that his cousin was talking about having him followed. Williamson said he wanted to retaliate, but couldn't because of the family link.\n\n\"He just jealous of me,\" Williamson said. \"I was ready to kill his ass for real.\"\n\n\"If you got folks from 280, that's all they wanna do, buy dope,\" Williamson told the drug courier, referring to customers near the U.S. 280 southeast corridor with affluent subdivisions between Birmingham and Auburn. \"I promise, we can make a lot of money. I'll buy the dope, and we just sell it to 'em.\"\n\nWilliamson told the drug courier about Meme, his supplier in Mexico, and about the invitation to go to Monterrey and ride motorcycles.\n\nThe courier, who is from Reynosa, Mexico, across the border from Hidalgo, Texas, cautioned against it. \"It's a lot of tourist people in Monterrey, but it's still, it's still dangerous.\"\n\n\"Me being your homeboy ... I'll say don't try.\"\n\nThe drug courier, who lived in Birmingham, revealed how he previously had been deported and when he got to Reynosa, a truck pulled up that looked similar to Williamson's. When the door opened, he realized it was cartel members and not Williamson behind the wheel. He was freed after his father sold the family home to pay a $20,000 ransom.\n\nHe also said one of his cousins was robbed of a drug load in Atlanta and owed the cartel money. He said cartel members tried to find a relative of the cousin's in Mexico to murder for revenge. But the last known relative, his grandfather, had died before they could kill him.\n\nThe cartel knows Williamson, as head of a drug network in the U.S., is more powerful and would likely extort him for closer to $100,000 ― or end up killing him, the man warned.\n\nWilliamson avoided the trip but kept trafficking cartel drugs until his arrest two months later.\n\nRelatives and friends submitted letters to the judge describing Williamson as a loving family man who generously gave to others in need.\n\nDuring the sentence hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Annemarie Carney Axon cautioned: \"My concern is that you have left these young women and men with the impression that it's OK to sell drugs, so long as you're generous with your proceeds.\n\n\"Remind them that the money that you spent on them, whilst being a big deal, led to tremendous pain for, I'm sure, many people ― most particularly, those who received your fentanyl.\"\n\nReporter Beth Warren: bwarren@courier-journal.com; 502-582-7164; Twitter @BethWarrenCJ.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/04"}]}

Courtesy Jason M. Allen\n\nAllen’s winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.\n\nThe definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.\n\nMidjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord, while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation, and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.\n\nThe newness of these tools, how they’re used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.\n\nThis came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.\n\n“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics,” one Twitter user wrote.\n\n“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’,” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”\n\nYet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.\n\n“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions,” he said.\n\nYou can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds, but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.\n\nFirst, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said. Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.\n\nAllen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.\n\n“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it,” Allen said.\n\nCal Duran, an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition, said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney, he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still, he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category, he said, calling it a “beautiful piece”.\n\n“I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way,” he said.\n\nAllen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2023/05/30/photoshop-generative-ai-adobe-photo-editing/70260190007/", "title": "Adobe Photoshop gets new generative AI aimed at taking photo ...", "text": "Jennifer Jolly\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nWhen it comes to next-level image editing, wouldn’t it be great if you could take a decent smartphone photo, tell your device to “make this photo look like a pro took it,” and a few seconds later end up with something you can frame, hang on your wall, and make everyone who sees it will think you’re a visual genius?\n\nThat’s where Adobe’s headed with its next new thing, Firefly-infused Photoshop Generative Fill AI.\n\nFirefly, Adobe’s new artificial intelligence factory, rolled out six weeks ago. Now it’s adding new features in Photoshop, one of the most popular graphics and photo editing software on the market.\n\nI took a tour of the new AI tools in Photoshop just prior to its recent launch. The standout feature for me is the ability to highlight or “lasso” an area in a photo, then click on a new “Generate” icon, type a few keywords to describe exactly what you want to see replace your selection, and it appears like magic.\n\nHow to use Adobe Firefly\n\nFor instance, take a look at the photo of the reindeer in a forest below.\n\nWith the new generative fill integration, you can isolate a deer, tap “Generate,” and type in a prompt like “wet alley at night.” You can even layer in a vintage red arrow sign for added drama. This is just one example John Metzger, Adobe’s director of product management for Photoshop demonstrated over the video call.\n\nAI phone scams:The call is coming from inside the internet: AI voice scams on the rise with cloning tech\n\nFind unclaimed money:You may have money coming to you. Where to look for unclaimed accounts that belongs to you.\n\nHackers using AI:Hackers are using AI to crack passwords: How to choose better passwords to keep them out\n\nIts other new AI generative fill trick gives you a way to remove objects without weird glitches in the result. Before, you could erase a person, or in the example below, a surfboard, but you’re left with strange smears that you have to fix where that person or object used to be. In the beach example below, Firefly AI takes the board out and fills in the rail, sky, sand, and even shadow in ways that make it impossible to see your alterations. This is a tool most content creators use daily, and I haven’t worked with one that’s this easy and fast before.\n\nAnother standout feature overall is how this new generative fill matches perspective, lighting, and image style better than we’ve seen with a myriad of other tools. It allows you to make changes in layers, so you’re not messing with your original or married-to change you might want to break up with later.\n\nI’ve been playing around with similar beta AI ideas in Canva and other apps, such as Magic Eraser Background, and as you might expect, they don’t do as well against a heavyweight like Photoshop. You can try these new features free for seven days online, then it’s $21/month for Photoshop or $55/month for Adobe’s entire suite of Creative Cloud apps. You can also try it for free using Firefly beta.\n\nDon’t expect perfection yet with Photoshop, either. As mentioned, this generative fill tool is available in Firefly and Photoshop in beta − still in the testing − phase. It struggles with human hands and facial features, the same as we’ve seen across all AI image makers, including Midjourney, Dall-E2 and others. That’s no surprise since Adobe’s using a similar AI image generation technique called diffusion, which others like Dall-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Google’s Imagen use as well.\n\nWhile it hasn’t said “when” yet, Adobe plans deeper AI integration across its other apps like Illustrator and Premiere too. Yep, that means it’s coming to video editing, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying.\n\nAI-generated fake images make the rounds on social media and so-called “news” sites every day. Remember the Pope in a puffy jacket? Or even in May, when that fake news report on Twitter supposedly showed an explosion near the Pentagon?\n\nHow to detect deep fake images\n\nAshley Still, the senior vice president of Digital Media at Adobe told me that they’ve built in an array of guard rails to make sure people don’t use Firefly AI to create deep fakes. Adobe now embeds metadata into every creation, including attribution, provenance, and what role AI played in making the finished image.\n\n“We think of it like a nutrition label for (content),” Still explained. “This kind of transparent metadata applied to each file is the only way to trust or even understand the superpower of AI generative fill and what it enables,” she added.\n\nAdobe’s Content Authenticity Initiative outlines the transparency tools and has a verification checker you can use to test whether a photo’s fake too.\n\nCan AI steal from artists?\n\nThe other big issue around AI artwork is how often it uses images scraped from the internet without attribution, leaving photographers, designers, and creatives empty-handed when someone else uses their work. Adobe says they thought of that too.\n\n“Our models train only on IP we have the explicit license to use,” Still said. “We use content from Adobe Stock’s hundreds of millions of professional-grade, licensed images. We do not use other peoples’ or brands’ intellectual property. In addition, Adobe is developing a compensation model for Adobe Stock contributors and will share details once (Adobe Firefly) is out of beta.”\n\nHow does AI change photography?\n\nWhen it comes to next-level image editing, I want a tech tool that can take any number of my “almost, but not quite, perfect” iPhone photos and instantly make them look like a pro shot and edited them.\n\nFirefly’s AI is not there yet, nor is that its purpose. It’s a tool to make the process faster, more intuitive, and let more people like me dabble in creativity. The actual secret sauce to the photos I have framed on my walls though − is still the human touch −and that’s not going away anytime soon.\n\nJennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech columnist.

You need a new password strategy immediately.\n\nAI anxietyFear over AI dangers grows as some question if tools like ChatGPT will be used for evil\n\nStart your day with my 5-minute tech know-how newsletter.Try it here.\n\nCommon methods\n\nBelow are the password-hacking tried-and-true tools. Of course, there are others, but these are common because they just work.\n\nBrute-forcing: A special program enters different combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols much faster than a criminal could do by hand. A hacker can try up to 100 billion possible passwords per second. If your password is basic, you’re hacked.\n\nDictionary attack: Think brute-forcing but smarter. Words from the dictionary, company names, sports teams and other common terms are checked. This lets someone crack your password even faster.\n\nCredential stuffing: Someone takes the login to one of your breached accounts and tries that email and password combo across other accounts and websites. This is particularly effective since many of us have had at least one password leaked in a data breach. It’s also why you should always go with a new password. (I know it’s a pain, and I have tricks to help below.)\n\nSomeone takes the login to one of your breached accounts and tries that email and password combo across other accounts and websites. This is particularly effective since many of us have had at least one password leaked in a data breach. It’s also why you should always go with a new password. (I know it’s a pain, and I have tricks to help below.) Phishing: Through a convincing text, email, or another communication, a scammer gets you to type in or click a link to a bogus site. A good example is a fake notification to change your password. You’re instructed to enter your login details (including your existing password). Yikes, you just handed everything over to the person controlling the site.\n\nMaybe you’re always on your cybersecurity Ps and Qs. There’s still a lot working against you – like the idea that cybercriminals love to share what works among their circles.\n\nThey create free software that anyone can download and improve. A few standard options for cracking passwords have names like John the Ripper, Hashcat and Ophcrack.\n\nSpeaking of free, I have my own list. There's no fishy stuff here, just free alternatives to expensive paid software that’s equally good.\n\nWhat can you do about it?\n\nNow that you know what they’re doing to break in, take steps to protect yourself against hackers. Here are new rules to keep your accounts safe:\n\nLonger is better: Don’t use the minimum characters a site will accept. An eight-character password comprising only uppercase and lowercase letters takes 22 minutes to crack. A 12-character password that includes symbols too? About 34,000 years.\n\nA passphrase is your friend: Instead of one or two words, try a longer “passphrase” that you can remember and then add the finishing touches. Perhaps you choose “I love to visit Hawaii,” which becomes “iluv2v!s!tHawaii.”\n\nGet weird: Use fake words, extra characters and oddball phrases that won’t be slam dunks for those brute-force attacks.\n\nMix it up: Skip the random number or punctuation mark at the end of your password; instead, work it into the password itself. For example, you can replace an O (the letter) with a zero, like this: k0mand0_scholar. Or sub in a character for a letter it resembles, like this: f@nt@syFormer.\n\nMake them fresh: Never reuse a password, even if it’s been out of circulation for a while. No, adding a new number to the end of an old password is not good enough.\n\nBe diligent: Check you’re on the actual site before entering your password. Going to a site directly rather than clicking on a link in an email or text is always safer.\n\nDon’t put yourself at risk: If a site lets you get away with “password” or “123456,” step away. If they’re that lax, you should worry about how they secure your information.\n\nKeep your tech-know going\n\nMy popular podcast is called “Kim Komando Today.” It’s a solid 30 minutes of tech news, tips, and callers with tech questions like you from all over the country.

Here's why experts are worried ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA million bears walking on the streets of Hong Kong. A strawberry frog. A cat made out of spaghetti and meatballs.\n\nThese are just a few of the text descriptions that people have fed to cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems in recent weeks, which these systems — notably OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 and Google Research’s Imagen — can use to produce incredibly detailed, realistic-looking images.\n\nThe resulting pictures can be silly, strange, or even reminiscent of classic art, and they’re being shared widely (and sometimes breathlessly) on social media, including by influential figures in the tech community. DALL-E 2 (which is a newer version of a similar, less capable AI system OpenAI rolled out last year) can also edit existing images by adding or taking out objects\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine such on-demand image generation eventually serving as a powerful tool for making all kinds of creative content, whether it be art or ads; DALL-E 2 and a similar such system, Midjourney, have already been used to help create magazine covers. OpenAI and Google have pointed to a few ways the technology might be commercialized, such as for editing images or creating stock images.\n\nNeither DALL-E 2 nor Imagen is currently available to the public. Yet they share an issue with many others that already are: they can also produce disturbing results that reflect the gender and cultural biases of the data on which they were trained — data that includes millions of images pulled from the internet.\n\nAn image created by an AI system called Imagen, built by Google Research. Google\n\nThe bias in these AI systems presents a serious issue, experts told CNN Business. The technology can perpetuate hurtful biases and stereotypes. They’re concerned that the open-ended nature of these systems — which makes them adept at generating all kinds of images from words — and their ability to automate image-making means they could automate bias on a massive scale. They also have the potential to be used for nefarious purposes, such as spreading disinformation.\n\n“Until those harms can be prevented, we’re not really talking about systems that can be used out in the open, in the real world,” said Arthur Holland Michel, a senior fellow at Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs who researches AI and surveillance technologies.\n\nDocumenting bias\n\nAI has become common in everyday life in the past few years but it’s only recently that the public has taken notice — both of how common it is, and how gender, racial, and other types of biases can creep into the technology. Facial-recognition systems in particular have been increasingly scrutinized for concerns about their accuracy and racial bias.\n\nOpenAI and Google Research have acknowledged many of the issues and risks related to their AI systems in documentation and research, with both saying that the systems are prone to gender and racial bias and to depicting Western cultural stereotypes and gender stereotypes.\n\nOpenAI, whose mission is to build so-called artificial general intelligence that benefits all people, included in an online document titled “Risks and limitations” pictures illustrating how text prompts can bring up these issues: A prompt for “nurse”, for instance, resulted in images that all appeared to show stethoscope-wearing females, while one for “CEO” showed images that all appeared to be men and nearly all of them were white.\n\nLama Ahmad, policy research program manager at OpenAI, said researchers are still learning how to even measure bias in AI, and that OpenAI can use what it learns to tweak its AI over time. Ahmad led OpenAI’s efforts to work with a group of outside experts earlier this year to better understand issues within DALL-E 2 and offer feedback so it can be improved.\n\nGoogle declined a request for an interview from CNN Business. In its research paper introducing Imagen, the Google Brain team members behind it wrote that Imagen appears to encode “several social biases and stereotypes, including an overall bias towards generating images of people with lighter skin tones and a tendency for images portraying different professions to align with Western gender stereotypes.”\n\nThe contrast between the images these systems create and the thorny ethical issues is stark for Julie Carpenter, a research scientist and fellow in the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.\n\n“One of the things we have to do is we have to understand AI is very cool and it can do some things very well. And we should work with it as a partner,” Carpenter said. “But it’s an imperfect thing. It has its limitations. We have to adjust our expectations. It’s not what we see in the movies.”\n\nAn image created by an AI system called DALL-E 2, built by OpenAI. OpenAI\n\nHolland Michel is also concerned that no amount of safeguards can prevent such systems from being used maliciously, noting that deepfakes — a cutting-edge application of AI to create videos that purport to show someone doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say — were initially harnessed to create faux pornography.\n\n“It kind of follows that a system that is orders of magnitude more powerful than those early systems could be orders of magnitude more dangerous,” he said.\n\nHint of bias\n\nBecause Imagen and DALL-E 2 take in words and spit out images, they had to be trained with both types of data: pairs of images and related text captions. Google Research and OpenAI filtered harmful images such as pornography from their datasets before training their AI models, but given the large size of their datasets such efforts are unlikely catch all such content, nor render the AI systems unable to produce harmful results. In its Imagen paper, Google researchers pointed out that, despite filtering some data, they also used a massive dataset that is known to include porn, racist slurs, and “harmful social stereotypes.”\n\nFiltering can also lead to other issues: Women tend to be represented more than men in sexual content, for instance, so filtering out sexual content also reduces the number of women in the dataset, said Ahmad.\n\nAnd truly filtering these datasets for bad content is impossible, Carpenter said, since people are involved in decisions about how to label and delete content — and different people have different cultural beliefs.\n\n“AI doesn’t understand that,” she said.\n\nSome researchers are thinking about how it might be possible to reduce bias in these types of AI systems, but still use them to create impressive images. One possibility is using less, rather than more, data.\n\nAlex Dimakis, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said one method involves starting with a small amount of data — for example, a photo of a cat — and cropping it, rotating it, creating a mirror image of it, and so on, to effectively turn one picture into many different images. (A graduate student Dimakis advises was a contributor to the Imagen research, but Dimakis himself was not involved in the system’s development, he said.)\n\n“This solves some of the problems, but it doesn’t solve other problems,” Dimakis said. The trick on its own won’t make a dataset more diverse, but the smaller scale could let people working with it be more intentional about the images they’re including.\n\nRoyal raccoons\n\nFor now, OpenAI and Google Research are trying to keep the focus on cute pictures and away from images that may be disturbing or show humans.\n\nThere are no realistic-looking images of people in the vibrant sample images on either Imagen’s nor DALL-E 2’s online project page, and OpenAI says on its page that it used “advanced techniques to prevent photorealistic generations of real individuals’ faces, including those of public figures.” This safeguard could prevent users from getting image results for, say, a prompt that attempts to show a specific politician performing some kind of illicit activity.\n\nOpenAI has provided access to DALL-E 2 to thousands of people who signed up to a waitlist since April. Participants must agree to an extensive content policy, which tells users to not try to make, upload, or share pictures “that are not G-rated or that could cause harm.” DALL-E 2 also uses filters to prevent it from generating a picture if a prompt or image upload violates OpenAI’s policies, and users can flag problematic results. In late June, OpenAI started allowing users to post photorealistic human faces created with DALL-E 2 to social media, but only after adding some safety features, such as preventing users from generating images containing public figures.\n\n“Researchers, specifically, I think it’s really important to give them access,” Ahmad said. This is, in part, because OpenAI wants their help to study areas such as disinformation and bias.\n\nGoogle Research, meanwhile, is not currently letting researchers outside the company access Imagen. It has taken requests on social media for prompts that people would like to see Imagen interpret, but as Mohammad Norouzi, a co-author on the Imagen paper, tweeted in May, it won’t show images “including people, graphic content, and sensitive material.”\n\nStill, as Google Research noted in its Imagen paper, “Even when we focus generations away from people, our preliminary analysis indicates Imagen encodes a range of social and cultural biases when generating images of activities, events, and objects.”\n\nA hint of this bias is evident in one of the images Google posted to its Imagen webpage, created from a prompt that reads: “A wall in a royal castle. There are two paintings on the wall. The one on the left a detailed oil painting of the royal raccoon king. The one on the right a detailed oil painting of the royal raccoon queen.”\n\nAn image of \"royal\" raccoons created by an AI system called Imagen, built by Google Research. Google\n\nThe image is just that, with paintings of two crowned raccoons — one wearing what looks like a yellow dress, the other in a blue-and-gold jacket — in ornate gold frames. But as Holland Michel noted, the raccoons are sporting Western-style royal outfits, even though the prompt didn’t specify anything about how they should appear beyond looking “royal.”\n\nEven such “subtle” manifestations of bias are dangerous, Holland Michel said.\n\n“In not being flagrant, they’re really hard to catch,” he said.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/09/18/cybercrime-cost-american-seniors-3-billion-last-year-62-jump/10420029002/", "title": "Elder fraud is real.

This is supported by figures from the FTC, which show that while 44% of younger people in their 20's reported losing money to fraud, only 20% of those in their 70's did the same.\n\nThe risks are wide-ranging, from fraudulent phone calls to phishing attempts via email, texts to social media messages, or shopping scams designed to dupe seniors out of their savings.\n\nRise in attacks, plus seniors pay out more\n\nThe pandemic played a role here, too, believes Michael Jabbara, Visa’s vice president and global head of fraud services.\n\n“It’s no surprise we’ve seen a massive shift over the years towards digital transactions, but with this shift there’s also an increase focus from fraudsters,” says Jabbara. “This is especially true for elder individuals who may be a target because of a lack of technical sophistication and because they don’t always report these crimes to authorities.”\n\nJabbara says “grandparent scams” are still a popular attack method.\n\n“This is where a fraudster spoofs a relative’s phone number and sends a message asking for money due to a medical emergency or text books, or whatever the case may be,” he said\n\nJabbara says Visa has invested more than $9 billion in anti-fraud measures over the over the last five years, including the use of artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics, “to ensure we’re keeping our network safe and secure across the globe.”\n\n“Fraudsters are able to glean those personal details the grandparent posted pictures on Facebook or Instagram, allowing them to craft a very believable message,” Jabbara said. “Or in other cases, a family member’s account is hacked and a fraudster gets access to their email, they’ll target an elder family member with a similar plea for money or help. They play on their emotions.”\n\nSeniors are a lucrative target\n\nSeniors also pay out more. Disturbing data published by cybersecurity company Comparitech shows that while the average loss from those in their 'was $324, it jumps to $426 for victims in their 60's, $635 among 70-somethings, and a staggering median loss of $1,300 among those in their 80's.\n\nDaniel Markuson, digital privacy expert with NordVPN, a leading Virtual Private Network (VPN) provider, see below, says its recent survey found that 84% of Americans have experienced a form of “social engineering,” where fraudsters attempt to fool you into divulging confidential or personal information.\n\n“Phishing scams are one of the most common tactics among cybercriminals, designed to trick people into clicking on links that download malicious files often containing a virus,” explains Markuson. “So, one of the main tips we have for seniors is to be cautious and question everything they receive from unknown senders.”\n\nMarkus says often there are grammar mistakes in the email you received, a sense of urgency to confirm your details, or a strange-looking email domain.\n\nWhat should we do about senior fraud?\n\nWhen it comes to protecting our loved ones, letting them know about these risk plays a big role.\n\nJabbara says one of the best practices to fight back is to have a “tech check-in” with aging relatives, to go over these assorted tips.\n\nShare with care: Limit how much personal information you share online. Set your social media profiles to private. If someone asks to connect with you on social media, only accept their request if you know them.\n\nBe wary of “emergencies”: Your family or friends can easily be hacked to send out emails or text messages claiming to be urgently in need of cash or gift cards, scamming you out of money or gift cards.\n\nWhen in doubt, just ask: If you really think it could be your daughter or grandson reaching out, don’t confirm by replying to the message you received. Instead, reach out in another fashion, such as calling them. Chances are, it’s fake. Block and report the fraudulent message.\n\nLock your devices: Use a passcode or fingerprint to lock your phone or tablet. If you have a computer, use a strong password that’s at least 12 characters long.\n\nShop safer: Always use a secure Internet connection when making a purchase. Reputable websites use technologies such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer) that encrypt data during transmission. You will see a little padlock icon in your browser(and usually “https” at the front of your address bar to confirm it’s a secure connection. Only shop on sites that take secure payment methods, such as credit cards.\n\nEnable multifactor authentication: When it comes to logging into your online accounts, add a second layer of defense by enabling multifactor authentication, sometimes referred to as “two-factor authentication.” This means you not only need a password or passcode (or biometrics logon, like a fingerprint of facial scan) to confirm it’s you, but also a one-time code you’ll receive on your mobile phone to type in.\n\nInstall good cybersecurity software: Just as you wouldn't leave the front door to your home unlocked, you shouldn't let your tech be vulnerable to attacks, whether it’s a virus or other malicious software, called “malware,” that sneaks onto your device or caused by being tricked into giving out sensitive information.\n\nMake sure you have the right cybersecurity tools to prevent fraud\n\nGood antimalware that’s updated often can identify, quarantine, delete and report any suspicious activity coming into your computer or flag sensitive info going out.\n\n“Seniors have more important things to do than worry about than being protected online,” says Gagan Singh, executive vice president and chief product an revenue officer for cybersecurity company McAfee.\n\nA just-announced tool called McAfee+, from $49.99/first year, then $139.99/year after that, was created to make it easy for everyone to confidently live life online no matter how much or little they know about technology and online threats including identity theft.\n\n“Our new product lineup includes tools that help people prevent identity theft and credit fraud, including credit monitoring, credit lock, removing their personal data online, identity monitoring, and website safety notifications,” says Singh.\n\nAvoid Wi-Fi hotspots\n\nResist free wireless Internet at, say, a coffee shop or in an airport. It’s best to wait until you’re on a secured Internet connection at home, or use your smartphone as a personal hotspot, which is safer than public Wi-Fi. If you must use a hotspot, never conduct any financial transactions – like online banking, trading or shopping – as you never know if your information is being tracked and logged.\n\nUse a VPN\n\nA VPN conceals your online identity by using encryption technology, therefore what you do and where you go online cannot be seen by your service provider, the government, search engine, browser company, social media sites, advertisers and malicious types.\n\n“VPN is an easy-to-use tool that helps users to make sure their network is secure at all times,” confirms Markuson. “For seniors, who sometimes find it hard to keep up with latest technology and cybersecurity trends, it is a perfect solution [as] VPN not only helps to stay safe while using public Wi-Fi, it also make sure user’s private data is safe from snooping.”\n\nNordVPN can be purchased starting at $3.69/month with a two-year subscription that includes three months for free.\n\nFollow Marc on Twitter for his “Tech Tip of the Day” posts: @marc_saltzman.

You’ll probably waste 15 minutes putting in codes that don’t work. At worst, you’ll end up on a malware-infected site.\n\nUse these proven tricks to save money instead.\n\nStreaming is expensive, so you might be tempted to look up free TV shows or movies. Don’t do it. There are seriously sketchy sites out there.\n\nI put together a list of ways to get free movies and shows you can trust.\n\nIt doesn’t end there — not even close. How can a simple Google search be dangerous? Keep reading.\n\nSEO poisoning and scammy ads\n\nGoogle anything and you get pages of search results. At the very top are the “Sponsored Results.” These are paid ads businesses use to drive traffic to their websites.\n\nGoogle doesn’t vet everyone who buys an ad. Cybercrooks can buy ads just like trustworthy companies – except they hide nasty malware on their sites. Scammers are getting good at search engine optimization, so their malicious search results are at the top of the organic results.\n\nSo, what terms should you avoid? Sadly, there’s a whole lot. Let’s focus on five that could do some real damage.\n\n1. Free credit report\n\nThere are legitimate ways to get a free credit report. But cybercriminals go after the juiciest search terms and think about all they can get their hands on if you think it’s a site you can trust.\n\nThe federal Fair Credit Reporting Act requires the three credit reporting agencies (Transunion, Experian, and Equifax) to provide U.S. consumers with a free annual credit report. There are a variety of ways you can request a copy of your annual report from each agency:\n\nOnline: www.AnnualCreditReport.com\n\nPhone: 1-877-FACTACT (1-877-322-8882)\n\nIf you want to send by mail, download and complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form, then send it to:\n\nAnnual Credit Report Request Service\n\nP.O.

Tech support phone numbers\n\nFake numbers are a classic. If scammers can figure out how to get your bank’s name to appear when they call, you can bet they can get their numbers high in searches.\n\nHere are a few of the most searched:\n\nAmazon: 888-280-4331\n\nMicrosoft: 800-642-7676\n\nApple: 800-275-2273\n\nGoogle: 650-253-0000\n\nMeta (Facebook and Instagram): 650-543-4800\n\nFor more tech company numbers and support sites if you prefer to contact online, go here.\n\n3. How to make money online\n\nOn my national radio show, I get so many questions about whether an amazing money-making opportunity is real. Almost always, my answer is no.\n\nThere is certainly money to be made at home, but if an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nSome companies offer awesome employee perks or high pay – but good jobs are hard to find. If one falls out of the virtual sky with more pay or perks than you'd get with a similar position with another company, be skeptical.\n\nAlso, be wary of contract or part-time jobs that come with many unusual perks. This could be a part-time office support job you're doing remotely with a surprisingly generous bonus compensation plan or a job offering you a much more flexible schedule than expected.\n\nHere are nine more signs a job offer is bogus so you don’t get scammed.\n\n4. Free people search\n\nPeople finder, people search, people lookup – no matter what you call these sites, they are notorious for ripping people off.\n\nYou’re curious about a new love interest, business contact, or old friend. There are (free) ways to dig up dirt, but these sites are simply trying to reel you into an expensive subscription.\n\nWhat to do instead?\n\nCheck out publicly-available info like government documents, arrest records and property information.\n\nDo a thorough Google search. There’s an art to this.\n\nTry these steps.\n\nPro tip: Your info is likely on many scummy people search sites. You can wipe it out. I have a series of how-to articles, Opt-out Tuesday, to help you wipe your personal details.\n\n5. Crypto wallet\n\nHave some money in crypto or trying to get in while prices are low? That search is not the way to find a wallet to store your digital currency. It’s a road to disaster.\n\nWhen you buy cryptocurrency on an exchange like Coinbase, a wallet is created for you – one that the exchange controls. This is called a custodial wallet. To move your crypto, buy things with it or stake it to earn money, you need to move to a self-custody wallet. That means you have complete control over the wallet and everything inside it. It also means people are more at risk of being scammed out of their funds.\n\nPro tip: Every wallet has a “seed phrase” made up of typically 12 to 24 random-seeming words. Never, ever give this out. It is the key to open your wallet from any device.\n\nHere on my site, we list a few of the most popular wallets and the correct links to download them.\n\nKeep your tech-know going\n\nMy popular podcast is called “Kim Komando Today.” It’s a solid 30 minutes of tech news, tips, and callers with tech questions like you from all over the country.

AI taking Hollywood's jobs.", "text": "Haley Joel Osment as an eerie android child in a futuristic world. Will Smith battling a flood of murderous robots. Data (Brent Spiner) on the deck of the U.S.S. Enterprise.\n\nHollywood has furnished the world with an abundance of stories about artificial intelligence, utopian and dystopian alike. But it's unlikely that the writers who penned those sci-fi scripts, or the actors giving soul to a machine, ever thought that AI might represent a serious threat to their livelihoods.\n\nYet that's exactly the fear of SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America, unions representing American actors and screenwriters. Both guilds are on strike (the first time both have done so at once since 1960), and a key issue holding up negotiations with the major Hollywood studios is the use and regulation of AI. The unions worry that text generators like ChatGPT could write screenplays and actors’ images could be used to create characters without any humans involved.\n\n\"We will not be having our jobs taken away and given to robots,” \"Breaking Bad\" actor Bryan Cranston said at a recent rally in support of the SAG-AFTRA strike. “We will not allow you to take away our dignity.\" Meanwhile, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major Hollywood studios, says it has offered “groundbreaking protections” to prevent that.\n\nBut could generative artificial intelligence really replace writers and actors on movie sets? Could we one day see a TV show written by a computer and \"acted\" by images of humans created by a machine, as a recent episode of Netflix sci-fi drama \"Black Mirror\" depicted? Is AI really the major threat to artists that many are saying?\n\n“Totally,” says Haibing Lu, associate professor of Information Systems & Analytics at Santa Clara University. “I don't think that there's a way to totally ban the technology. We have to adapt to it. All parties need to sit down and figure out what’s the proper way to channel the profits.”\n\nAt the moment, the parties aren’t sitting down. No negotiations have been scheduled between the AMPTP and the striking unions. When they finally meet again, they will have to put rules about the use of AI into new contracts. And the stakes are high, not only for the writers, actors and studios but for the rest of us. Would we want to watch movies and TV shows made by machines? Would they be original at all? Could they make us laugh and cry? Would artificially intelligent art have a soul?\n\nAnd − crucially − is AI coming for our jobs too?\n\nGenerative AI makes new things, but it starts by learning about old things\n\nAI applications like ChatGPT and Midjourney create new text or images, but first, they must be trained on material that is similar to the content they are trying to generate.\n\nText generators, also called Large Language Models, offer plenty of material for training. “There's a huge amount of text available on the internet, so it is very easy for them to collect and train,” Lu says. There are fewer photos and videos online than text, but AI models are still training on images they can find. “Your photos and my photos have probably already been collected and used. It's happening with more and more powerful technologies.”\n\nJustine Bateman, the actor, writer and director who has been vocally opposed to the use of AI in filmmaking, describes it as “like a box. Say you want it to write books. You feed it a bunch of books, and then you give it a task: 'Write me a book about pandas and outer space,' and it'll spit out that book.” For her and others in the entertainment industry, it’s not just that AI could replace their work; it’s that any ChatGPT script or Midjourney movie would be partly based on the existing work of filmmakers. “Imagine something coming in and not only displacing you but displacing you with your own work,” she says.\n\nWho is in SAG-AFTRA, anyway? The union has more working class actors than movie stars\n\nHollywood is already chock full of AI − how much more can machines do?\n\nThe guilds and the AMPTP may be arguing about the use of AI in films, but part of the future is already here. Actor Peter Cushing died in 1994, but he was digitally resurrected for the 2016 film “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” Stars like Robert De Niro, Harrison Ford and Samuel L. Jackson have been digitally de-aged for films. The late Anthony Bourdain’s voice was recreated for a recent documentary about the celebrity chef. A slew of profanities was removed and replaced with new words and facial movements created by a computer from the 2022 film “Fall,” so it could earn a PG-13 rating instead of the more restrictive R. AI is part of what made all these digital effects possible.\n\nThe use of generative AI is limited by three things: Computing power, training material and time.\n\n“Image processing takes more computational power than the textual information,” Lu says. “It's still slow. If you want to generate a video, which contains many images, it's going to be very slow.” More computing power and time cost more money, meaning it is cheaper and easier right now to generate text using AI than images and video. But that could change.\n\n“The power of computers doubles every one to two years,” Lu says, meaning AI technology is advancing at an exponential rate. “Over the next 10 years, it is going to be amazing.”\n\nAI applications are also limited by what they can train on, which is a big part of the fight between the AMPTP and the two guilds. Should the people who created the materials that train AI be paid when their work is used? Are they legally and ethically required to be?\n\n“'Generative AI’ cannot generate anything at all without first being trained on massive troves of data it then recombines. Who produces that training data? People do. And those people deserve residuals,” actor and director Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote in a recent op-ed in The Washington Post. Residuals are royalty payments many in the entertainment industry receive when their work is reused, and are a central aspect of the current labor battle.\n\n“Computers can reproduce the image of a dead or living person and make this person a character in a movie,” says Daniel Gervais, a law professor at Vanderbilt University who specializes in intellectual property law. “In the case of a living actor, the question is whether this person will have rights when his or her image is used in a movie. Normally the answer is yes, but there are novel questions that emerge. Would an actor receive residuals if her image was used in the movie, but she, in fact, did not act in that movie?”\n\nThe guilds say the studios want to replace them with AI, but the studios say otherwise\n\nAt SAG-AFTRA's press conference announcing the strike, the union’s chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said the AMPTP wanted the right to scan the images of background actors (also called extras) and use their likenesses in perpetuity in any project they want, for one day’s pay. The AMPTP vehemently disputes that claim, saying its most recent proposal only “permits a company to use the digital replica of a background actor in the motion picture for which the background actor is employed.”\n\nSAG-AFTRA claims the AMPTP’s plans leave “principal performers and background actors vulnerable to having most of their work replaced by digital replicas,” while the AMPTP says it wants to establish provisions that “require informed consent and fair compensation.” The WGA, meanwhile, wants a new contract to say that “AI can’t write or rewrite literary material (and) can’t be used as source material,” nor can the writers' work be used to train AI. The AMPTP response to the WGA says the topic of AI needs “a lot more discussion.”\n\nThese proposals could change Hollywood, depending on how the strikes are resolved. While the AMPTP’s background actor proposal is not as drastic as Crabtree-Ireland suggests, any move to limit the work of background actors, who are often paid minimum wage, could remove a road to success for aspiring actors. Many actors get their start (and their SAG-AFTRA membership cards) by working as extras. “There was a time where we all had to do background work,” says Michael James Lazar, a SAG-AFTRA member who has had roles on shows like “How to Get Away With Murder.” “This phases them out.”\n\nThe use of AI material for scriptwriting also could remove career paths for new writers, even if it’s just used to assist or supplement.\n\n“Most writers in the guild don't make their living by writing scripts from scratch,” says Jason Vredenburg, a professor of film and TV studies at Stevens Institute of Technology. “A lot of times they piece together a living by working on other people's scripts. That is where artificial intelligence is a more immediate threat.”\n\nMany people in Hollywood see this as an existential threat. “If big corporations think that they can put human beings out of work and replace them with artificial intelligence, it's dangerous,” Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, told USA TODAY. “And it's without thinking or conscience. Or caring. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.”\n\nJoe Russo, co-director of “Avengers: Endgame,” recently predicted a more frightening future for AI in entertainment. “You could walk into your house and say to the AI on your streaming platform, ‘Hey, I want a movie starring my photoreal avatar and Marilyn Monroe's photoreal avatar,” he said on a panel at the Sands International Film Festival in Scotland last April. “And suddenly, now you have a rom-com starring you that's 90 minutes long.”\n\nAI could affect workers far beyond Hollywood\n\nThere are several lawsuits pending in the U.S. about AI, and their outcomes will be consequential for everyone, not just those working in Hollywood.\n\n“The United States copyright office, and most scholars, consider that a machine cannot be an author,” says Gervais. “Should a court decide otherwise, there will be an enormous push to replace human authors with machines in all industries that use copyright as the basis for their business, including music, film, book publishing (and) journalism.”\n\nIt's not just jobs in the arts and publishing that Gervais sees being threatened by AI. \"Machines will be able to replace humans at many jobs considered 'cognitive,' which includes many white-collar jobs,\" he says. \"Ironically, it will be harder to replace manual labor.\"\n\nLu doesn’t think the situation is quite as dire. “AI can help us to do a lot of things, but it still requires experts to verify the accuracy of the information,” he says, noting that some lawyers recently tried to write a brief using ChatGPT, which spat out inaccurate information. “I don't think that AI will completely replace human beings. But AI has become like a digital calculator. It's going to help us to do the basic mathematics, but we still need to learn. It just helps us to improve our productivity.”\n\nEven if AI could one day script and create a movie without any writers, actors, directors, set designers, makeup artists, or cinematographers, would people want to see it?\n\n\"Machines can beat any human on the planet at many games, including chess,\" Gervais points out, \"yet people still pay to watch the best human chess players play one another.\"\n\n\"Will it be the same with movies?\"\n\nContributing: Charles Trepany, Dana Taylor", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/tech/period-tracking-apps-data-privacy/index.html", "title": "Period-tracking apps are trying to make women feel safer about their ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, women living in states that criminalize abortion are grappling with the possibility that their phones could now hold incriminating information about their travel, search history and menstrual cycles.\n\nWith that in mind, some popular services are rethinking the data they collect from users and also stressing the privacy protections they already have in place — but it remains to be seen how much those efforts will protect women, or ease their minds in this new era.\n\nFlo, the leading menstrual cycle tracking app with 240 million users, announced an “anonymous mode” option last week. This lets users enter data into the app without adding their name, email or technical identifier. If the company, which is based in London, receives an official request to identify a user by name or email, it will be unable to connect that information with their health data, Flo said.\n\n“Flo will never share or sell user data, and only collects data when we have a legal basis to do so and when our users have given their informed consent,” Susanne Schumacher, Flo’s data protection officer, said in a company statement last week. “Any data we do collect is fully encrypted, and this will never change.”\n\nBut some privacy experts are skeptical about how much a feature like anonymous mode can separate the user from their personal health data.\n\n“If they want to be serious about privacy commitments, they should say, ‘Within a month we delete all the data. We can give you a sort of guidance and help in predicting your periods, but we don’t have to do it by storing it,’” said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Virginia and author of the forthcoming book “The Fight for Privacy.” “Unless they’re doing that, I’m not feeling so secure for women and girls.”\n\nAlbert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project and a fellow at the NYU School of Law, echoed the point. “It’s not enough just to see that they’re saying they have an anonymous mode,” said Fox Cahn. “It’s really going to come down to seeing what data do they collect, what data do they keep, how is that data stored, how is that data potentially shared — really drilling into the technical details of each of these apps, and the changes they make.”\n\nAccording to Flo, its new anonymous mode removes all personally identifiable information, making it impossible to connect data to someone once the mode is activated.\n\nOther menstrual apps have touted their existing protections. Clue, based in Berlin and serving 12 million users globally according to its site, claims its European location makes it a more secure home for data. “Given the increasing criminalization of abortion in the US, we understand that many of our American users are worried that their tracked data could be used against them by US prosecutors,” the company said in a statement. “It is important to understand that European law protects our community’s sensitive health data.”\n\nFlo and Clue are part of a much larger market. The “FemTech” industry, as Clue founder Ida Tin has coined it, groups together tech used to support and further female healthcare, and is projected to grow to $60 billion globally by 2027. according to Emergen Research, a market research and strategy consulting company. While these services help women manage premenstrual symptoms and track fertility, the risks of using FemTech could outweigh the benefits in a post-Roe world, privacy experts say.\n\nIn a state with criminalized abortion, Fox Cahn said third parties and law enforcement could use such data for two types of surveillance: as a dragnet to figure out generally which users are pregnant and possibly seeking abortion care, and as targeted surveillance of specific individuals. Some new privacy offerings could, if nothing else, help these apps from serving as digital dragnets, according to Fox Cahn. But once an individual is identified and their data specifically sought out, there is little these apps — or any apps on a phone — can do to protect a user, he said.\n\n“Once police have probable cause, and issue a specific individual a warrant, then that person is at risk from nearly all the apps on their phone that collect location and health data,” said Fox Cahn. “At that point, there’s a much broader list of concerns: Google location data, their search histories, their Apple health data, their device backups in iCloud if they use an iPhone or their Android device backup.”\n\nSince the ruling, Apple, for one, has told CNN it takes numerous steps to protect health data on its devices and in the cloud, including by encrypting health information in iCloud when a user enables two-factor authentication.\n\nBut tech companies have also broadly said they would comply with government data requests so long as they are consistent with existing laws. The rollback of federal abortion protections, combined with the passage of new legislation in numerous states restricting abortion, could make it difficult for platforms to fight certain data demands related to abortion investigations.\n\nGoogle last week said it will soon automatically delete location history records that show whether a person has visited an abortion clinic or fertility center. In a blog post, Google said the move is intended to help users protect their privacy when they visit locations that could shed light on their personal medical situation or health care decisions.\n\nHow all these offerings work in the real world has yet to be tested, of course.\n\n“I think some of these protections could be really helpful, but it depends,” said Fox Cahn. “It won’t be something that can be fully evaluated until after the the software is available to the public.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/18/entertainment/wednesday-dance-tiktok-popularity-cec/index.html", "title": "'Wednesday' dance takes on a life of its own | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWednesday Addams doesn’t do anything by accident. The most stoic and deliberate member of the Addams Family, she rarely makes unnecessary movements, smiles and blinks included.\n\nSo when the spirit of dance possessed the typically morose teen at her school dance in the new Netflix series bearing her name, it caused an immediate stir, onscreen and off.\n\nThe brief scene makes up less than three minutes of the entire series, but it’s quickly become “Wednesday’s” most iconic moment for how free our kooky protagonist appears to feel. Her eyes betray a rare, ghoulish passion. Her limbs, typically glued to her side, are flung about freely. The dance is her, to be sure – lots of severe, stilted movements and cues from decades past. Certainly no one could mistake Wednesday’s dance for the latest TikTok trend, right?\n\nSomething about that peculiar dance unlocked something weird within all of us, and it’s taken off quicker than a fire at Camp Chippewa. Clips of the choreography inspired viewers to check out the series, making it one of the streamer’s most-watched shows ever (“Stranger Things,” who?). Its online popularity rocketed Lady Gaga’s “Bloody Mary” back onto charts more than a decade after the song’s release, and it was only featured in fan-made TikToks, not the show itself! “Wednesday” star Jenna Ortega’s admission that she choreographed the routine herself invited new fans – celebrities included – to give it a whirl and even infuse the routine with moves from their own cultures.\n\nWednesday Addams would likely be mortified if she knew her moves had become, shudder, mainstream, but her dance just won’t die – and that, she just might enjoy. Here’s what lends the “Wednesday” dance its supernatural staying power.\n\nThe scene has its own mythos\n\nThe “Wednesday” dance scene only debuted a month ago, but it has a certain “mythology” to it already, said Jenna Drenten, associate professor of marketing at Loyola University Chicago who studies how users of TikTok and other digital platforms express their identities.\n\nMost of the scene’s lore was developed offscreen. Ortega, playing a teenaged Wednesday with her pitch-black humor in tact, has said she choreographed the routine herself. She counted among her influences Bob Fosse, Siouxsie Sioux and ’80s goth dance clubs (she also likely sneaked in some references to “The Addams Family” TV series from the ’60s).\n\nThe Cramps soundtracked Wednesday's dance in her titular Netflix series. Peter Noble/Redferns/Getty Images\n\nWhat’s more, Ortega has admitted that she’s not a trained dancer, making her routine perhaps even more inviting to non-dancers who found the routine on TikTok, Drenten said.\n\n“I’m not a dancer and I’m sure that’s obvious,” Ortega told NME.\n\nBut Ortega’s dedication has inspired outrage, too – she told NME she filmed some of the dance while waiting on Covid-19 test results, which later came back positive. This prompted some to condemn the production for failing to follow proper Covid-19 prevention protocols on set – but still, “Wednesday” continued to make waves.\n\nThe viral trends that remain in the cultural conversation the longest typically don’t remain only on their platform of origin, Drenten said. Look at the Corn Kid: He appeared in a YouTube series singing the praises of the cob, then clips of his appearance went viral on TikTok and he’s since gone on to work with Chipotle, Green Giant and the state of South Dakota, promoting corn offline.\n\n“To have a longer shelf life, TikTok trends have to make that leap to a cultural trend, beyond the borders of TikTok,” she said. “The ‘Wednesday’ dance had an advantage in this sense because the dance and ‘The Addams Family’ legacy originated outside of TikTok from the start.”\n\nThe ‘Wednesday’ dance has become a shared ritual\n\nAnother thing the “Wednesday” dance has on its side – the human tendency to learn a dance for social currency.\n\nThink of the “Electric Slide,” “Macarena,” “Cupid Shuffle” – standards at bat mitzvahs and weddings, moves many of us know so well we can perform them without thinking. Performing them en masse at an event like that might feel like a Pavlovian response to a DJ’s song choice, but it’s also a shared ritual that fosters “a sense of solidarity and belonging,” Drenten said.\n\n“Every gesture and movement enables the person performing it to inherently say, ‘I get it, I’m in the know, we have this shared experience,’” Drenten said.\n\nThat’s part of the reason why dance routines, from “Renegade” to Lizzo’s “About Damn Time,” so often dominate TikTok. But unlike those trends, the “Wednesday” dance wasn’t set to a popular song, although The Cramps’ punk anthem “Goo Goo Muck” has since earned some new fans. The moves were easy enough to pick up, Drenten said, “straightforward but unique.”\n\nLady Gaga put her own spin on the now-iconic \"Wednesday\" dance, braids and all. From @ladygaga/TikTok\n\nBut it took Lady Gaga to take the “Wednesday” dance stratospheric. The version that’s gone über-viral on TikTok is a “fancam” of sorts, or a mashup of clips, set fittingly to Gaga’s “Bloody Mary,” a Biblical ode to dancing uninhibitedly. Even Mother Monster herself performed a version of the “Wednesday” dance, wearing two long braids.\n\nMillions of users have since put their own spin on Wednesday’s school dance solo, with some users incorporating Polynesian or Indian dance styles in their versions or making their own Wednesday looks (Thing, the disembodied hand, included!).\n\nWednesday gives us permission to be weirdos\n\nBelonging, of course, is antithetical to the ethos of Wednesday, who’s never cared for fitting in. She’s perfectly content on an island of her own, where the sun never shines and old-timey torture tools are abundant. That Wednesday’s idiosyncratic moves have been copied so widely could threaten to diminish her status as a patron saint of weirdos – except that Wednesday’s style and attitude have been copied for decades.\n\nWednesday Addams has existed in some form since the late 1930s – first as an unnamed comic character, then as a diminutive child on a TV sitcom, then, in her most famous iteration before “Wednesday” premiered, as a dead-eyed Christina Ricci. And fans of Wednesday have been dressing up like her for decades, Drenten said, often inspired by Ricci’s portrayal. The eldest Addams child is no longer a secret her biggest fans can keep from mainstream pop culture.\n\nSince Wednesday’s debut, she’s been an idiosyncratic icon to loners and goth-adjacents for her unapologetic commitment to the macabre. Yet she’s still an “outlier” among the women and girls of fiction, wrote Emily Alford for Longreads, because she’s never softened or bent to certain story tropes. She is who she is, and she isn’t changing.\n\n“She brought to the screen a morbid self-acceptance that set her apart, and became a crucial blueprint for a generation of girls developing their own gallows humor,” Alford wrote.\n\nAnd now, many of those girls and other users are finding each other on TikTok, where niche communities can blossom (or reach mainstream users). The app is a “space for people to discover who they are, and more importantly, to find other people who share their same interests,” Drenten said, even if those interests involve cosplaying as a certain dispassionate teenager.\n\n“TikTok arguably fosters a lot of reproduction and users can feel pressure to act, perform, and look a certain way,” Drenten said. “But Wednesday reminds people that being themselves in that sea of sameness is freeing.”", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/12/18"}]}

Hess and Thomas C. Frohlich\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nIn recent years, Americans have increasingly moved away from beer consumption in favor of wines and spirits. U.S. beer consumption fell slightly from 28.3 gallons per drinking-aged adult in 2012 to 27.6 gallons last year.\n\nDespite declining across the United States overall, beer consumption remains quite high in some states. According to a recent study from Beer Marketer's Insights, a brewing industry trade publisher, North Dakota residents consumed 43.3 gallons of beer per drinking-age adult in 2013, the most of any state. This was more than double the 19.6 gallons per legal age adult consumed in Utah, which drank the least beer. Based on figures from Beer Marketer's Insights, these are the states that drink the most beer.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2012, the share of Americans' total alcohol intake coming from beer has declined. The average drinking age adult drank the equivalent of 1.39 gallons of pure ethanol alcohol from beer in 2002, with a total intake of 2.39 gallons from all drinks consumed. In 2012, Americans pure alcohol intake was 2.46 gallons per person. Americans' alcohol intake from wine and spirits rose by 15.2% and 20.9%, respectively, between 2002 and 2012. Meanwhile, intake from beer dropped by 8.6%.\n\nWhile some of the states that drink the most beer generally followed this national trend, other states did not. Between 2002 and 2012, alcohol intake from beer consumption declined by 17.4% in Nevada, one of the top beer drinking states. In that time, alcohol intake from wine rose by more than 30%. On the other hand, alcohol intake from beer rose by more than 10% in both Vermont and Maine, also among the top beer drinking states.\n\nConsuming excessive amounts of alcohol is associated with a range of health problems. One in 10 deaths among working age adults in the United States is due to excessive drinking, according to figures recently released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAccording to the study, \"Excessive alcohol use is responsible for 2.5 million years of potential life lost annually, or an average of about 30 years of potential life lost for each death.\" Leading the nation in beer consumption, however, did not necessarily increase years lost per legal-age adult. Only three of the top beer drinking states exceeded the national average for years of potential life lost per 100,000 residents between 2006 and 2010.\n\nAccording to Mandy Stahre, a co-author on the CDC's study and an epidemiologist with the Washington State Department of Health, health outcomes such as alcohol attributable death rates are influenced by a number of factors, not only drinking patterns. \"The number and the enforcement of alcohol control policies … sociodemographics, religious affiliation, race and ethnicity\" all can play a role in determining the health consequences of drinking.\n\nIn an email to 24/7 Wall St., Eric Shepard, vice president and executive editor at Beer Marketer's Insights, highlighted a study from the U.K.-based Institute of Economic Affairs, a free market think tank. The study explores the relationship between problematic drinking and consumption levels.\n\nPolicy makers often believe that high per capita consumption leads to excessive drinking, which includes heavy and binge drinking. However, the study's authors contend that \"per capita alcohol consumption largely depends on the amount of heavy drinking in the population, not vice versa.\" Stahre added the she, too, was aware of studies that showed \"a good proportion of the alcohol that was consumed was being consumed in a manner [associated with] binge drinking.\"\n\nThe states with the highest beer consumption rates also had high rates of heavy drinking — defined as more than two drinks per day for men and more than one drink per day for women. In Montana and Wisconsin, 8.5% of adults were heavy drinkers as of 2012, tied for the most in the United States and well above the national rate of 6.1%. Additionally, seven of the states that drink the most beer had among the 10 highest rates of binge drinking — defined by the CDC for women as consuming four or more drinks, and five or more drinks in the case of men, during a single sitting.\n\nInterestingly, while excessive alcohol use is hardly a healthy behavior, many of the states with the highest beer consumption rates were also likely to practice a range of healthy behaviors such as exercising regularly and eating well. People in Maine, New Hampshire, South Dakota and Vermont, for example, were all among the most likely Americans to eat healthy all day last year. Residents of Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota and Vermont were among the most likely to exercise regularly.\n\nStahre noted, however, that people are often better at keeping track of other behaviors than they are about drinking. \"Because if you aren't paying the bill or not paying attention to the number of drinks you have, you could really be underestimating what your consumption is.\"\n\nTo identify the states with the highest beer consumption rates, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed Beer Marketer's Insights' recent report on alcohol consumption. Drinking habits were measured in gallons shipped to distributors annually per 100,000 drinking-age adults. Adult heavy and binge drinking statistics are from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and are for 2012. We also utilized figures from a recent CDC study, titled \"Contribution of Excessive Alcohol Consumption to Deaths and Years of Potential Life Lost in the United States.\" This study examined data from 2006 through 2010 for Americans of all ages. We also reviewed healthy behaviors and health outcomes from Gallup's 2013 HealthWays Well-Being Index. Economic data came from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2012 American Community Survey. Brewery totals are from the Beer Institute's 2013 Brewer's Almanac and are for 2012. Tax data are from the Federation of Tax Administrators and are current as of January 2014.\n\nThese are the states that drink the most beer.\n\n1. North Dakota\n\n> Per capita consumption: 43.3 gallons\n\n> Alcohol intake per capita (2012): 3.69 gallons (2nd highest)\n\n> Pct. binge drinkers: 24.1% (2nd highest)\n\n> Total brewers (2012): 4\n\nNorth Dakota residents are the nation's largest beer drinkers, consuming an average of 43.3 gallons per drinking age adult in 2013. One reason for this may be binge drinking. In 2012, more than 24% of the adult population reported binge drinking, more than in any state except for Wisconsin. Between 2002 and 2012, North Dakota led the nation with a 24% increase in pure alcohol consumption per capita. By comparison, consumption nationwide rose by slightly less than 3% in that time. Most of the increase in alcohol intake between 2002 and 2012 came from higher spirits consumption. High levels of beer consumption, binge drinking and alcohol intake may be related to the state's attractiveness to younger Americans looking for work. North Dakota had the nation's lowest unemployment rate in 2013 and has had the nation's fastest growing state economy in each of the past four years.\n\n2. New Hampshire\n\n> Per capita consumption: 42.2 gallons\n\n> Alcohol intake per capita (2012): 4.74 gallons (the highest)\n\n> Pct. binge drinkers: 17.0% (22nd highest)\n\n> Total brewers (2012): 21\n\nNew Hampshire trailed only one other state in total per capita beer consumption in 2013, and it was the nation's leading state for beer drinking as recently as 2011. Additionally, New Hampshire led the nation in per capita intake of alcohol in 2012, with residents drinking the equivalent of 4.7 gallons of pure alcohol that year on average, versus 2.5 gallons per legal adult nationwide. However, these figures may be somewhat distorted by sales to non-residents by liquor stores located near state borders. Visitors often buy liquor and wine in the state because of the lack of tax at state-run liquor stores.\n\n3. Montana\n\n> Per capita consumption: 40.5 gallons\n\n> Alcohol intake per capita (2012): 3.13 gallons (6th highest)\n\n> Pct. binge drinkers: 21.8% (5th highest)\n\n> Total brewers (2012): 31\n\nA legal age Montana resident consumed an average of 40.5 gallons of beer in 2013, down from more than 43 gallons in 2009. Montana residents were largely beer drinkers, even though the state ranked 12th in total alcohol intake from spirits in 2012, per capita intake from wine was roughly in line with the nation as a whole. Dangerous drinking was also quite common in the state, where 8.5% of adults were heavy drinkers in 2012, tied with Wisconsin for highest rate in the nation. Additionally, almost 22% of the adult population engaged in binge drinking, more than in all but a few states. High levels of drinking had notable health implications for residents as well. There were 37.7 alcohol-attributable deaths per 100,000 residents in Montana between 2006 and 2010, more than in all but two other states.\n\n4. South Dakota\n\n> Per capita consumption: 38.1 gallons\n\n> Alcohol intake per capita (2012): 2.94 gallons (8th highest)\n\n> Pct. binge drinkers: 20.6% (8th highest)\n\n> Total brewers (2012): 10\n\nSouth Dakota adults consumed 11.4% more pure alcohol in 2012 than they did in 2002, a larger increase than in all but a handful of states. Most of this increase came from spikes in wine and spirits consumption. While alcohol intake from beer grew by less than 1% — still one of the larger increases nationwide — legal-age adults in South Dakota increased both their wine and spirits intake by more than 30% over that time. Binge drinking may have contributed substantially to the state's consumption totals. More than 20% of legal-age adults in South Dakota reported consuming at least four drinks in a sitting in 2012, among the highest binge drinking rates nationwide.\n\n5. Vermont\n\n> Per capita consumption: 35.9 gallons\n\n> Alcohol intake per capita (2012): 3.02 gallons (7th highest)\n\n> Pct. binge drinkers: 19.3% (10th highest)\n\n> Total brewers (2012): 25\n\nWhile Americans nationwide drank less beer in 2012 than they did in 2002, Vermonters consumed 11.2% more alcohol from beer. This was the largest increase in the country. The dramatic spike may be due in part to growing enthusiasm for craft beers, for which Vermont has become famous. Several local Vermont beers have been rated among the world's best, and in some cases black markets have emerged in the wake of excess demand. Like several other states with the highest beer consumption rates, wine has also become considerably more popular in recent years. Drinking-age Vermonters consumed nearly one-fifth of a gallon more alcohol from wine in 2012 than they did in 2002, the largest increase in gallons nationwide, and roughly four times the increase across the country.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary. Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/07/02/24-7-wall-st-states-drinking-most-beer/29574619/", "title": "States drinking the most beer", "text": "Thomas C. Frohlich\n\n24/7 Wall St.\n\nAbout 213,029 barrels of beer, or 6.6 billion gallons, were shipped into the United States in 2013, down slightly from the year before. U.S. beer shipments, used to capture consumption levels, fell slightly from 28.3 gallons per drinking-age adult in 2012 to 27.6 gallons in 2013.\n\nDespite declining across the United States, beer consumption remains quite high in some states. According to a recent study from Beer Marketer's Insights, a brewing industry trade publisher, North Dakota residents consumed 43.6 gallons of beer per drinking-age adult in 2013, more than any other state. This was also more than double the 19.6 gallons per adult consumed in Utah, where residents drank the least beer. Based on figures from Beer Marketer's Insights, these are the states where residents drink the most beer.\n\nThe share of Americans' total alcohol intake from beer declined close to 10% from 2003 through 2013. Alcohol consumption from other beverages such as wine and spirits rose over that period, however, contributing to an overall increase in alcohol consumption among Americans 21 years and over. The average drinking age adult consumed the equivalent of 2.46 gallons of pure ethanol alcohol from all types of beers in 2013, 1.25 gallons of which came from beer.\n\nHigh per capita beer consumption in a state does not necessarily mean residents drink excessively. However, the proportion of people binge drinking — the most common form of excessive drinking — tends to be higher in these states. Binge drinking is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as consuming four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men during a single sitting. Compared to the 16.8% of legal-age adults reporting binge drinking nationally, a higher percentage of adults reported the habit in seven of the states. These were also among the highest rates of binge drinking.\n\nThe states with the highest beer consumption rates also had high rates of heavy drinking — consuming more than two drinks per day for men and more than one drink per day for women. In Montana and Wisconsin, 7.7% and 7.8% of adults were heavy drinkers as of 2013, the third and fourth most in the United States, respectively, and well above the national rate of 6.1%.\n\nAccording to Eric Shepherd, executive editor at Beer Marketer's Insights, it can be problematic to associate high beer consumption with high binge drinking rates primarily because binge drinkers may be consuming other forms of alcohol. Also, while the beer consumption data are based on shipments, the binge drinking data are based on self-reports, and people frequently under-report their drinking habits.\n\nConsuming excessive amounts of alcohol is associated with a range of health problems. One in 10 deaths among adults in the United States is due to excessive drinking, according to a 2014 study recently released by the CDC.\n\nAccording to the study, \"Excessive alcohol use is responsible for 2.5 million years of potential life lost annually, or an average of about 30 years of potential life lost for each death.\" Especially high beer consumption, however, did not necessarily increase years lost per legal-age adult. Only three of the top beer drinking states exceeded the national average for years of potential life lost per 100,000 residents between 2006 and 2010.\n\nYet, high beer consumption levels were also associated with a higher incidence of drunk driving. Six of the 11 states drinking the most beer reported above average percentages of adults driving after having too much to drink in the past 30 days. Only about 2% of adults nationwide reported doing so.\n\nPopulation density was also a factor in beer consumption rates. The average population density nationwide was 90 people per square mile. All but three of the 11 states with the highest beer consumption were less densely populated. Shepherd suggested there may be fewer entertainment options in rural areas. Not only that, but beer may also be among a shorter list of available beverage options in rural states compared to more urban states.\n\nTo identify the states drinking the most beer, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed 2013 per capita beer consumption in gallons among people 21 and over in each state provided by Beer Marketer's Insights. Hard cider was included for the first time this year. Pure alcohol intake levels from spirits, wine, and beer also came from Beer Marketer's Insights. The percentage of beer consumed in cans, bottles, and draft also came from Beer Marketer's Insights. Consumption is based on shipment volumes to each state. Total deaths, alcohol-related fatalities, and estimated years of potential life lost are for the period 2006-2010 and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The percentages of adults reporting driving after excessive drinking, and drunk driving fatality statistics also came from the CDC and are for 2013. The percentages of adults reporting excellent health in 2013 also came from the CDC. We also reviewed household median income, poverty rates, and educational attainment rates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. Annual unemployment rates are for 2013 and from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Cost of living, or regional price parity (RPP), is as of 2012 and came from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).\n\nThese are the states drinking the most beer.\n\n1. North Dakota\n\n> Annual per capita consumption: 43.6\n\n> Pct. chg. in alcohol consumption 2003-2013: 16.3% (2nd largest increase)\n\n> Pct. binge drinkers:23.8% (the highest)\n\n> Median household income: $55,759 (19th highest)\n\nNorth Dakota led the nation for beer drinking, with each drinking-age resident consuming 43.6 gallons in 2013 on average, an increase of 1.6 gallons from 2009, the second largest such increase. The state's beer consumption was the highest in the West North Central region of the country, which at 33.5 gallons was itself the highest average consumption level compared to the nine other regions reviewed. North Dakota also led the nation in binge drinking, with nearly 24% of adults reporting such excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nWhile the number of jobs in North Dakota dropped by 5,300 from April through May this year, economic factors can partly account for the state's high beer consumption level. Not only was the cost of living nearly 10% lower than the national average, but also incomes in the state have risen dramatically in recent years as a result of the regional oil boom. In addition, the energy sector has attracted especially men, who are far more likely than women to binge drink. There were more than 11 persons per 100,000 people killed in an alcohol-related car crash, the highest rate in the country.\n\n2. New Hampshire\n\n> Annual per capita consumption: 42.2\n\n> Pct. chg. in alcohol consumption 2003-2013: 7.3% (12th largest increase)\n\n> Pct. binge drinkers:16.8% (24th highest)\n\n> Median household income: $64,230 (7th highest)\n\nNew Hampshire's beer consumption was the highest in the nation in 2009, 2010, and 2011. While consumption has fallen slightly from those years, residents drank an average of 42.2 gallons of beer in 2013, second only to North Dakota. In contrast, New England residents consumed an average of 31 gallons of beer that year. The state had the highest alcohol intake from wine, and by far the highest intake from spirits. This may not accurately reflect drinking habits among long-term residents, as New Hampshire's low taxes and cheap alcohol attract many Americans from other states. Binge drinking was roughly in line with the national average, unlike most other states drinking the most beer. Binge drinking is strongly associated with negative health outcomes, and the low prevalence in New Hampshire compared to other states where people drink the most beer may partly explain the relatively good health among residents. Nearly 22% of residents reported excellent health, the fifth highest percentage nationwide. The state also had the lowest poverty rate in the country at 8.7%.\n\n3. Montana\n\n> Annual per capita consumption: 40.5\n\n> Pct. chg. in alcohol consumption 2003-2013: 4.0% (21st largest increase)\n\n> Pct. binge drinkers:20.8% (6th highest)\n\n> Median household income: $46,972 (15th lowest)\n\nResidents in the Mountain region of the United States drank an average of 30.6 gallons of beer per capita, higher than the national average of 27.7 gallons. Montana's drinking-age residents drank even more, consuming an average of 40.5 gallons of beer per person annually. The high prevalence of beer consumption in Montana likely contributed to higher rates of drunk driving. While less than 2% of American adults said they had driven after drinking excessively in the past 30 days, 3.4% of Montana residents reported doing so, the highest percentage nationwide. Perhaps as a result, there were 9.4 deaths per 100,000 people from alcohol-related car crashes, second only to North Dakota.\n\n4. South Dakota\n\n> Annual per capita consumption: 38.2\n\n> Pct. chg. in alcohol consumption 2003-2013: 12.0% (3rd largest increase)\n\n> Pct. binge drinkers:19.2% (10th highest)\n\n> Median household income: $48,947 (22nd lowest)\n\nEach South Dakotan consumed more than 38 gallons of beer on average in 2013, well above the national and regional per capita averages of 27.7 gallons and 33.5 gallons, respectively. As was the case nationwide, alcohol intake from beer declined in South Dakota, although by only 0.6%. With shares of total consumption from spirits and wine increasing 36.8% and 29.4% respectively — the seventh and fourth highest figures — overall consumption increased by 12% from 2003. This was the third largest overall increase. Living in sparsely populated areas seems to increase the likelihood of beer consumption, as most states drinking the most beer had below average population densities. There were just over 11 people per square mile in South Dakota, nearly the lowest population density nationwide.\n\n5. Vermont\n\n> Annual per capita consumption: 35.9\n\n> Pct. chg. in alcohol consumption 2003-2013: 16.4% (the largest increase)\n\n> Pct. binge drinkers:17.1% (21st highest)\n\n> Median household income: $52,578 (20th highest)\n\nVermonters 21 and over consumed 35.9 gallons of beer in 2013 on average, 1.2 gallons more than they did in 2009, the third largest increase — and Vermont was one of only six states where beer consumption did not decline over that period. Looking at a longer time span: from 2003 to 2013, only Vermont and one other state — Maine — saw an increase in alcohol consumption from beer. From all beverages, alcohol intake in Vermont increased the most over that period. Like most states drinking the most beer, Vermont is relatively rural — low population density has been associated with high propensities to drink more alcohol. Despite the high per capita beer consumption, nearly 22% of residents reported excellent health, the fourth highest such figure in the country.\n\n24/7 Wall St. is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Beer, seltzer tequila", "text": "Memorial Day weekend signals the start of the summer gathering season. Hosts and attendees alike will be wondering what folks will want to drink.\n\nHere's some of the trendiest choices to stock:\n\nAmericans continue to spend more on spirits such as whiskey, vodka and tequila as they perfect their own cocktail mixing techniques. Spending on spirits at retail rose 1.2% in 2022, according to data from Bump Williams Consulting, a Shelton, Connecticut firm, which services the alcoholic beverage industry and uses NielsenIQ data. Consumer spending on beer rose 2.2%, while sales of wine at retail declined 2.4% in 2022, according to NielsenIQ.\n\nEntertaining at home remains popular as spending at restaurants and bars fell 3.7% in 2022 and has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, according to research from Circana, formerly IRI and The NPD Group. “Mentally everyone still has in the back of their mind, 'Oh, should I be out there?',” said Scott Scanlon, executive vice president of beverage alcohol for Circana.\n\nAlso, many establishments have lower staffing, so the experience isn’t as good as before the pandemic, Scanlon said. “And even though, on premise inflation is not as much as off premise, it's still a more expensive way to drink. So there is just less of an appetite to go back to them on-premise venues than prior to the pandemic.”\n\nSome of the signs that Americans are drinking less\n\nInflation. Consumer prices were up 4.9% in April 2023, compared to a year earlier, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. Alcoholic beverages prices were slightly better, up 4.6% in April 2023. But beer was up 5.9%, likely cutting into some spending; wine was up 2.5%, and spirits, 1.5%.\n\nConsumer prices were up 4.9% in April 2023, compared to a year earlier, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index.

It may seem counter to trends, but some customers are willing to pay more for a pricier product such as a canned cocktail or imported beer rather than a typical domestic premium beer. For instance: A four-pack of Dogfish Head Vodka Lemonade canned cocktails costs about $13, while a six-pack of Budweiser is $11 or $12.\n\nIt may seem counter to trends, but some customers are willing to pay more for a pricier product such as a canned cocktail or imported beer rather than a typical domestic premium beer. For instance: A four-pack of Dogfish Head Vodka Lemonade canned cocktails costs about $13, while a six-pack of Budweiser is $11 or $12. Non-alcoholic options. Sales of non-alcoholic beverages – non-alcoholic beer, flavored waters, juices, teas and more – grew 3% in 2022, according to Circana. Generation Z consumers were most likely to opt for non-alcoholic drinks, with about 11.3% choosing them in 2022, Circana says.\n\nBringing Bud Light to the Memorial Day gathering? Some may not\n\nMost recently, \"the biggest change may be seeing the continued declines of the domestic premium light segment with the massive declines in Bud Light sales at retail,\" said industry consultant Bump Williams.\n\nThe boycott against Bud Light after its marketing partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney has led to a 23.3% decline in revenue for the previous four weeks ending May 13, according to data from Bump Williams Consulting/NielsenIQ. Other Bud brands are seeing declines, too: Budweiser (9.7%), Michelob Ultra (3%), and Busch Light (2.6%), for the four weeks ending May 13.\n\nMeanwhile, Coors Light, Miller Lite Beer and Pabst Blue Ribbon each are seeing upticks of 21% in sales in dollars, figures show.\n\nTennessee whiskey:The industry is old and giant — but also new and fledgling\n\nHere's how the consumer spending on alcohol at retail breaks down:\n\nBreaking down the alcoholic beverage market share\n\nTequila and prepared cocktails give a shot to spirits sales\n\nTequila sales, which rose 7.3% in 2022, are up nearly 6% so far this year, according to NielsenIQ. Whiskey and vodka remain the most purchased spirits at retail, but are down slightly.\n\nNearly all of the growth in spirits can be attributed to the tequila and prepared cocktail segments, Williams said, \"but there are obviously great growth brands within each segment of spirits like Tito’s Fireball, Woodford Reserve, Wild Turkey, Bumbu Rum, New Amsterdam, and a multitude of local Craft Distillery brands.\"\n\nHigh-end and premium tequila and American whiskey helped push total spending on spirits, including bars and restaurants, to a record $37.6 billion, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Also driving growth: premixed cocktails, which rose nearly 36% in 2022, the council said.\n\n“While many consumers are feeling the pinch from inflation and reduced disposable income, they are still willing to purchase that special bottle of spirits choosing to sip a little luxury and drink better, not more,\" said Christine LoCascio, the council's chief of public policy & strategy.\n\nTequila has been the latest spirit to see plenty of celebrities get involved. Thomas Rhett and his cousin Jeff Worn launched Dos Primos Tequila in 2021 and just expanded the lineup with Dos Primos Añejo ($56-$59) in March. Coming in mid-June: Santo Tequila Añejo ($74.98), the latest tequila from Santo spirits founder Hagar and partner and celebrity chef Guy Fieri. Hagar has also expanded his Beach Bar Rum line with additional flavors and launched Beach Bar Cocktail Co. canned cocktails.\n\nDos Primos TequilaCountry star Thomas Rhett, cousin Jeff Worn have several hits with tequila brand\n\nShoppers have been willing to trade up for more expensive spirits and canned cocktail variety packs. Among brands looking to capitalize on the trend is Jack Daniel’s, which released 10-year and 12-year-old Tennessee Whiskeys in March, priced at $70 and $80, respectively.\n\nTequila, flavored vodkas and ready-to-drink cocktails will remain hot in 2023, Scanlon said. And consumers who want to “drink better” will spend more on premium beer and wine. \"As long as people have jobs, they want to treat themselves,\" he said. \"And the best way to treat themselves is that premium product.\"\n\nBeer sales not quite flat. Modelo is a top performer\n\nModelo has been the top selling beer brand at retail so far this year, up 8.1%, leading the way in an imported beer category that rose 9% in 2022, according to NielsenIQ data.\n\nWhen craft beer is factored in, consumer spending on beer in the U.S. rose about 15% to $115.4 billion in 2022, up from $100 billion in 2021, according to the Brewers Association. But total beer volume fell 3.1% in 2022, the trade group says, which also suggests beer prices have risen.\n\nImports grew to 22.2% of beer market, with domestic beer accounting for 64.5% and craft beer 13.2%, the association said.\n\nBut consumers continue to visit local and regional breweries and purchase craft beer at retail as craft beer sales rose 6% over 2021, to $28.4 billion in 2022, and there's a record 9,552 breweries in the U.S., the group says.\n\nWine spending is down, but some brands including 19 Crimes Snoop Dogg fare well\n\nWine's share of all drinks – alcoholic and non-alcoholic – has fallen from 13.5% in 2020 to 10.8% this year, according to Circana research.\n\nThe wine category \"has been in trouble for a little while and I thought as many also did that the pandemic would really help wine out.,\" Scanlon said. But instead, spirits and other alcoholic beverages – and non-alcoholic drinks, as well – cut into its market share.\n\nBut some specific brands have done well including Josh Cellars, Decoy, Meiomi, and La Marca Prosecco. Another winner: 19 Crimes Snoop Dogg wines, including Cali Red, Cali Rose and Cali Blanc, which has caught the attention of Black consumers who might not have considered wine previously, Scanlon said. \"When a celebrity can pull in either a younger consumer or expand the demographic, that’s where the benefit of the celebrity really comes in,\" he said.\n\nCanned beverages from High Noon to hard seltzers continue to quench thirsts\n\nHard seltzers, led by brands such as White Claw, High Noon, Truly and Topo Chico, as well as beer makers including Corona, Bud Light, Michelob Ultra Organic Seltzer, and Vizzy Hard Seltzer from Blue Moon, grew from $1.6 billion in 2019 to nearly $4.7 billion in 2021.\n\nBut the category dipped in 2022 to $4.2 billion, according to NielsenIQ, and is down about 15% this year.\n\nOther flavored malt beverages have been picking up the pace, including Smirnoff Ice and Boston Beer-owned Twisted Tea, which just released a new Rocket Pop flavor within a summer limited-edition Twisted Tea Party Pack. Sales of flavored malt beverages grew from $2.8 billion to nearly $4 billion in 2022 – and are up 20.6% so fare this year.\n\nPrepared cocktails such as Two Chicks and Anheuser-Busch-owned Cutwater Spirits, also grew from $704 million in 2020 to nearly $1 billion in 2022. Prepared cocktails are up 42.5% so far this year.\n\n\"It's really gotten into what's the newest flavor out there,\" Scanlon said. \"The new ones grab the attention.\"\n\nTwisted teas:Could low-cal, low-sugar hard teas become the new IT drink? Some say they're ‘better than White Claw’\n\nNon-alcoholic trending up\n\nNon-alcoholic options may make up just a fraction of sales, but that fraction is growing. Non-alcoholic wine, such as Noughty's Sparkling Chardonnay and Proxies' non-alcoholic wines, have risen 16.5% this year and non- alcoholic spirits made by companies such Ritual Zero Proof, CleanCo. and Ish are up 84.5%, according to NielsenIQ data..\n\nNon-alcoholic beers such as Bud Zero, Athletic Brewing Co. and Brooklyn Brewing's non-alcoholic variety pack increased sales by 21.6% in 2022 and are up 34.2% so far this year, according to NielsenIQ data.\n\nYounger consumers have developed a taste for non-alcoholic beers as the percentage of adults who drink them has grown from 0.6% in April 2020 to 5.2% in April 2023, according to a new YouGov survey. Those aged 30-44 make up more than half of non-alcoholic beer drinkers with those aged 21-29 making up 29%, the survey found. Favorite brands: Heinekin, Corona, Samuel Adams, Guinness and Budweiser.Consumers' focus on flavor has led soft drink makers such as Dr. Pepper to release new concoctions such as Dr. Pepper Strawberries & Cream. Even breweries have gotten into the act with non-alcoholic, hop-flavored water: among them Sierra Nevada Hop Splash and Lagunitas Hoppy Refresher.\n\n\"As consumers adopt healthier habits, better-for-you beverage alcohol options, including low- and no-alcohol options are gaining traction,\" Scanlon said.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?:Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/11/21/alcohol-abuse-drunkest-city-every-state/885747001/", "title": "Alcohol abuse: The drunkest city in every state", "text": "Samuel Stebbins and Evan Comen\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nExcessive drinking claims the lives of tens of thousands of Americans each year and is responsible for about 1 in every 10 deaths among working-age adults. Alcohol abuse also takes a heavy economic toll.\n\nA recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that excessive alcohol consumption cost the U.S. economy an estimated $250 billion in 2010 — primarily in lost productivity, medical bills, and motor vehicle accidents.\n\nExcessive alcohol consumption, according to the CDC, includes binge drinking — defined as four or more drinks in a single occasion for women and five or more for men — and heavy drinking, which is defined as at least eight drinks per week for women and 15 for men.\n\nAn estimated 18% of American adults drink excessively. However, binge and heavy drinking rates are not uniform across the country and can vary greatly from state to state and city to city. Across U.S. metro areas, excessive drinking rates range from fewer than 1 in every 10 adults to more than 1 in every 4 adults.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the CDC to identify the metropolitan areas reporting the highest levels of binge and heavy drinking in each state.\n\nAlabama\n\nDrunkest city: Auburn-Opelika\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.9%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 13.0% (4th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.5%\n\nExcessive drinking is more common in the Auburn-Opelika area than in any other metro area in Alabama. An estimated 15.9% of area adults are either heavy or binge drinkers, a larger share than the 13.0% of adults across the state.\n\nDespite ranking as the heaviest drinking metro area in the state, adults in Auburn-Opelika are less likely to drink excessively than the typical American adult. Nationwide, an estimated 18.0% of adults drink excessively.\n\nAlaska\n\nDrunkest city: Fairbanks\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.7% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.1% (3rd highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 37.8% (top 25%)\n\nOf the two metropolitan areas in Alaska — Fairbanks and Anchorage — Fairbanks has the largest share of adults who report excessive drinking. Some 22.7% of Fairbanks adults binge or drink heavily, the largest share in Alaska and one of the largest shares of any U.S. metro area.\n\nWhile a smaller share of Anchorage adults drink to excess, the metro area’s drinking rate is still relatively high. Some 22.2% of Anchorage adults drink heavily or binge drink, a larger share than the drunkest city in 39 states. Across the state, 22.1% of Alaskans drink heavily or binge drink, the third largest excessive drinking rate among states.\n\nArizona\n\nDrunkest city: Flagstaff\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.4%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.0% (13th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 24.1% (bottom 25%)\n\nOf the seven metro areas in Arizona, Flagstaff is home to the largest share of adults who drink to excess. Some 19.4% of adults in the Flagstaff metro area are either heavy or binge drinkers. In comparison, only 16.0% of adults statewide and 18.0% of American adults over-consume alcohol.\n\nHeavier drinking areas tend to be better educated, and Flagstaff is no exception. Some 35.4% of adults in the metro area have earned a bachelor’s degree. Across Arizona, only 28.9% of adults have a four-year college education.\n\nArkansas\n\nDrunkest city: Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.6% (bottom 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.3% (9th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 31.6%\n\nExcessive drinking includes binge and heavy drinking. In Arkansas, 15.3% of adults report excessive drinking, less than the 18.0% share of adults nationwide and the ninth smallest share of any state. In the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers metro area, located in the northwest part of the state, some 15.6% of adults report excessive drinking, the highest share in Arkansas yet less than in most U.S. metro areas.\n\nWealthier individuals are more likely to drink excessively, and the typical household in Fayetteville earns $51,848 a year, the highest median household income of any Arkansas metro area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDrunkest city: Chico\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.9% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.0% (22nd highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 34.7%\n\nNearly 21% of adults in Chico regularly drink alcohol to excess, a larger share than in any of California’s 25 other metro areas and far more than the statewide excessive drinking rate of 18.0%.\n\nDrinking too much can have serious health consequences, and by some measures, Chico’s population is less healthy than the state as a whole. Across California, adults report an average of 3.6 mentally unhealthy days and 3.6 physically unhealthy days per month. In Chico, adults report an average of 4.1 mentally unhealthy days and 4.3 physically unhealthy days each month.\n\nColorado\n\nDrunkest city: Fort Collins\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.0% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.1% (15th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 30.6%\n\nHome to Colorado State University, Fort Collins is a midsize college city located along the Cache La Poudre River in Colorado’s Front Range. College students drink more than nearly any other group. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, nearly 3 in 5 U.S. college students aged 18 to 22 drink alcohol. In the Fort Collins metro area, some 11.6% of the population are enrolled in college or graduate school — nearly the largest share in Colorado — and 21.0% of adults drink to excess or binge drink, the largest share in the state.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDrunkest city: Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.6% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.6% (18th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 34.6%\n\nBridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk is the only metro area in Connecticut in which more than 1 in every 5 adults drinks excessively. Excessive drinking in a community does not necessarily increase the likelihood of drunk driving, but high alcohol consumption may partially explain such risky behavior in the Bridgeport area. Some 34.6% of roadway fatalities in the metro area involve alcohol, higher than both the state and national rates.\n\nDelaware\n\nDrunkest city: Dover\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.4% (bottom 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.6% (16th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 38.6% (top 25%)\n\nWhile Dover is the only metro area in Delaware and by default has the largest share of adults who drink excessively, the city actually has one of the lowest excessive drinking rates in the country. Just 15.4% of adults in Dover binge or drink heavily, lower than both the national rate of 18.0% and even the state rate of 16.6%.\n\nBetter educated populations also often also have higher excessive drinking rates. In Dover, just 22.6% of adults have a bachelor’s degree, less than the 31.0% state and 31.3% national rates.\n\nFlorida\n\nDrunkest city: Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.8% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.4% (22nd lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 39.4% (top 10%)\n\nAcross Florida, only 17.4% of adults drink excessively, a smaller share than the 18.0% of adults nationwide. However, not all parts of the state report lower than typical excessive drinking rates. In Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin, some 20.8% of adult residents drink excessively, the largest such share of any metro area in the Sunshine State.\n\nIn addition to having the state’s highest excessive drinking rate, the Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin metro area also has the state’s highest alcohol-related roadway fatalities rate. Some 39.4% of driving deaths in the metro area involve alcohol. To compare, 28.2% of roadway fatalities statewide and 30.0% nationwide are alcohol-related.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDrunkest city: Athens-Clarke County\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.5%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.8% (18th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 22.4% (bottom 25%)\n\nThe Athens-Clarke County metro area is home to the University of Georgia, the largest college or university in the state. College students are much more likely to participate in activities involving alcohol. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, close to 3 in 5 college students between the ages of 18 and 22 drink alcohol on at least one occasion per month. In the Athens metro area, 16.3% of residents are enrolled in college or graduate school — the largest share in the state — and 17.5% of adults binge or drink heavily, also the largest share in the state.\n\nHawaii\n\nDrunkest city: Kahului-Wailuku-Lahaina\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.8% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.5% (8th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 50.5% (top 10%)\n\nNearly 22% of adults in Kahului-Wailuku-Lahaina either binge or heavily drink, a larger share than both the statewide and nationwide excessive drinking rates. Driving deaths that involve alcohol are often more common in areas with heavy drinking populations, and the Kahului-Wailuku-Lahaina is no exception. The metro area is one of only five nationwide in which over half of all roadway fatalities involve alcohol.\n\nIdaho\n\nDrunkest city: Coeur d’Alene\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.9%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.4% (10th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 38.3% (top 25%)\n\nAn estimated, 15.4% of Idahoans drink excessively, the 10th smallest share of any state. While in the wettest metro area in the state — Coeur d’Alene — the excessive drinking rate is 17.9%, it is still lower than the national rate of 18.0% and less than close to half that of all U.S. cities.\n\nWhile the typical Coeur d’Alene adult is less likely to binge or heavily drink than the typical American adult, motorists in the metro area may be more likely to be involved in a fatal alcohol-related accident. Alcohol is involved in an estimated 38.3% of all fatal car crashes in Coeur d’Alene, far more than the 30.0% national figure.\n\nIllinois\n\nDrunkest city: Bloomington\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.5% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.2% (5th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 35.1%\n\nWith a 21.5% excessive drinking rate, Bloomington is the heaviest drinking metro area in Illinois. Unhealthy alcohol consumption is more common among better-educated populations, and Bloomington is home to a relatively large share of adults with a bachelor’s degree. Some 42.4% of adults in Bloomington have a four-year college degree, compared to the statewide college attainment rate of 34.0% and the nationwide rate of 31.3%.\n\nIndiana\n\nDrunkest city: Bloomington\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.7% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.8% (17th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 26.2% (bottom 25%)\n\nColleges students are more likely to drink heavily than nearly any other group. The Bloomington metro area is the home of Indiana University, one of the largest universities in the United States. Nearly 1-in-4 metro area residents are enrolled in college or graduate school, the third-highest share in the country, and 19.7% of residents over the age of 18 drink excessively, the largest share of any Indiana metro.\n\nCollege graduates are also more likely to drink than the average American. Some 38.9% of Bloomington adults have a bachelor’s degree, also the largest share in the state.\n\nIowa\n\nDrunkest city: Iowa City\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 23.1% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.0% (7th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 17.7% (bottom 10%)\n\nIowa City is the heaviest drinking metro area in a relatively heavy drinking state. Across Iowa, 21.0% of adults drink excessively, a larger share than in all but six other states and well above the U.S. excessive drinking rate of 18.0%. Meanwhile, Iowa City is one of only 13 metro areas nationwide in which more than 23% of adults either binge drink or drink excessively. Like many of the heaviest drinking metro areas, Iowa City is in the Midwest.\n\nKansas\n\nDrunkest city: Lawrence\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.2% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.9% (19th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 24.4% (bottom 25%)\n\nCollege students are more likely to drink, and to drink heavily, than the average American. According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, Inc., about half of all college students who consume alcohol do so through binge drinking. In Lawrence, home to the University of Kansas — the largest university in the state — an estimated 21.7% of the population is enrolled in college or graduate school, the largest such share in Kansas. Meanwhile, 22.2% of adults drink excessively, also the largest share in the state. College graduates are also more likely to drink heavily than most Americans. An estimated 52.0% of adults in Lawrence have a bachelor’s degree, the largest share in Kansas and the fifth largest share nationwide.\n\nKentucky\n\nDrunkest city: Louisville/Jefferson County\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.6%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.3% (14th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 27.0%\n\nOnly about 16.3% of adults in Kentucky drink excessively, a smaller share than the 18.0% of American adults. Even in Louisville, the heaviest drinking metro area in the state, adults are less likely than the typical American adult to consume unhealthy amounts of alcohol.\n\nAlcohol consumption is only one behavioral factor that can affect health, and Louisville residents are more likely to smoke and less likely to be physically active than the typical American. Partially as a result, and despite a lower excessive drinking rate, adults in Louisville are less likely to report being in good or excellent health than the typical American adult.\n\nLouisiana\n\nDrunkest city: Houma-Thibodaux\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.7% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.8% (17th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 40.4% (top 10%)\n\nSome 20.7% of adults in the Houma-Thibodaux metro area drinks excessively, the largest share in Louisiana and one of the largest shares of any U.S. metro. While college graduates are more likely to drink heavily than those without a degree, just 16.1% of Houma-Thibodaux adults have a bachelor’s degree, close to half the 31.3% national rate and nearly the smallest share of any city.\n\nMaine\n\nDrunkest city: Portland-South Portland\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.6% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.6% (11th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 43.1% (top 10%)\n\nOf the three metropolitan areas in Maine, Portland-South Portland has the highest excessive drinking rate at 20.6%. Excessive drinking tends to be more common in more affluent areas, and Portland is also the highest earning metro area in the state. The typical Portland household earns $63,422 a year, over $14,000 more than the next highest earning metro area in the state.\n\nAs is often the case in heavy drinking areas, a large share of roadway fatalities involves alcohol in Portland. Alcohol is involved in 43.1% of driving deaths in the metro area compared to 39.8% of driving deaths statewide and 30.0% nationwide.\n\nMaryland\n\nDrunkest city: California-Lexington Park\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.8%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.5% (11th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 35.7% (top 25%)\n\nAlcohol is expensive and wealthy individuals are more likely to be able to afford alcohol on a regular basis and are also more likely to participate in activities where alcohol is present. The California-Lexington Park metro area, where the typical household earns approximately $21,000 more than the U.S. median household income, is the wealthiest in Maryland and one of the wealthiest in the country. Some 18.8% of adults in the city drink heavily or binge drink, more than in any other metro area in Maryland.\n\nExcessive drinking habits may have adverse health outcomes for residents of California-Lexington Park. An estimated 10 out of every 100,000 metro area residents die from alcohol-induced causes annually, double the state alcohol-related mortality rate.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDrunkest city: Barnstable Town\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.0% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.5% (13th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 23.1% (bottom 25%)\n\nBinge and heavy drinking are never healthy behaviors. Still, 21.0% of adults in the Barnstable Town metro area drink excessively, a larger share than in any other metro area in Massachusetts.\n\nIn other key measures, however, adults in Barnstable Town are relatively healthy. Of the five metro areas in Massachusetts, Barnstable Town has the lowest smoking rate, the lowest obesity rate, and the largest share of adults who are regularly physically active.\n\nMichigan\n\nDrunkest city: Lansing-East Lansing\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.9% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.0% (10th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 27.8%\n\nAccording to a nationwide survey by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse, nearly 3-in-5 college students aged 18 to 22 drink alcohol on a monthly basis. In the Lansing-East Lansing metro area — home to Michigan State University, the largest school in Michigan and the ninth largest in the country — some 14.2% of residents are enrolled in college, more than double the 7.0% share nationwide. An estimated 21.9% of adults in the Lansing-East Lansing metro area drink excessively, more than the comparable 20.0% statewide share and more than any other metro in Michigan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDrunkest city: Mankato-North Mankato\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 23.6% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.1% (6th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 18.0% (bottom 10%)\n\nNearly 24% of adults in the Mankato-North Mankato drink excessively, the largest share of any of any of Minnesota’s five metro areas. Despite ranking as the state’s heaviest drinking metro area, driving deaths attributable to alcohol are relatively uncommon. Only 18% of all roadway fatalities in the metro area involve alcohol, the smallest share of any metro area in Minnesota and well below the comparable 30.9% statewide share.\n\nMississippi\n\nDrunkest city: Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 14.0% (bottom 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 13.3% (5th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 26.4%\n\nSome 13.3% of Mississippi adults drink excessively, the fifth smallest share of any state. While the 14.0% excessive drinking rate in the Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula metro area is the highest of any metro in the state, it is far below the 18.0% national excessive drinking rate and among the lowest of any city nationwide.\n\nAlcohol is expensive — prohibitively so for many lower-income individuals. In Gulfport, the typical household earns just $46,434 a year, far below the national median household income of $57,617.\n\nMissouri\n\nDrunkest city: Columbia\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.9% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.7% (25th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 44.4% (top 10%)\n\nColumbia is the only metro area in Missouri in which more than 1 in every 5 adults drink excessively. Alcohol consumption is only one lifestyle factor that can impact health, however, and by other measures, Columbia residents are relatively healthy. For example, adults in Columbia are more likely to lead physically active lives than those in any other metro area in the state. Additionally, only 28.4% of metro area adults are obese, the smallest share in Missouri and well below the 30.8% statewide obesity rate.\n\nMontana\n\nDrunkest city: Missoula\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 24.3% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.8% (4th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 44.4% (top 10%)\n\nSome 21.8% of adults in Montana drink excessively, the fourth largest share of any state. Even more adults drink heavily or binge drink in Missoula, where the excessive drinking rate is 24.3%.\n\nExcessive drinking is never healthy, and Missoula residents are more likely to die from alcohol-related causes than the average American. Approximately 14 in every 100,000 residents in Missoula die from alcohol-induced causes annually, compared to 10 in every 100,000 Americans nationwide.\n\nNebraska\n\nDrunkest city: Lincoln\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.7% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.4% (9th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 25.5% (bottom 25%)\n\nLincoln’s excessive drinking rate of 22.7% is the highest among Nebraska’s three metro areas and higher than the vast majority of metro areas nationwide. Binge drinking is relatively commonplace on college campuses, and a large college population may partially explain Lincoln’s high excessive drinking rate, which includes binge drinking. Home to the University of Nebraska, Lincoln’s population is 12.0% college and graduate students, by far the largest such share of any metro area in the state.\n\nNevada\n\nDrunkest city: Reno\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.3% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.8% (12th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 33.3%\n\nWhile as a state Nevada is fairly dry — just 15.8% of adults drink excessively, compared to 18.0% of adults nationwide — Reno is one of the heaviest drinking cities in the country. Some 21.3% of adults in Reno binge or drink heavily, a larger share than in nearly 90% of all U.S. metropolitan areas.\n\nIncreased alcohol consumption may have adverse health outcomes for many Reno residents. In 2015, approximately 18 in every 100,000 Reno residents died from causes related to alcohol, far more than the national rate of 10 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 Americans.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDrunkest city: Manchester-Nashua\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.7% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.4% (19th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 30.3%\n\nThe only metro area in New Hampshire, Manchester-Nashua, is the heaviest drinking area by default. Still, the metro area’s excessive drinking rate of 19.7% tops both the statewide excessive drinking rate of 18.4% and the U.S. rate of 18.0%.\n\nExcessive drinking is more common among well-educated, affluent populations. In Manchester-Nashua, the typical household earns $76,254 a year, nearly $19,000 more than the typical American household. Additionally, 37.3% of area adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher, well above the comparable share of American adults of 31.3%.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDrunkest city: Ocean City\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.3%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.6% (24th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.7%\n\nIn the Ocean City metro area, some 18.3% of adults drink heavily, a larger share than the 17.6% of adults across New Jersey as a whole and a slightly larger than the 18.0% national rate. While the populations in cities that report the largest shares of adults who drink to excess tend to be wealthy and well educated, the typical household in Ocean City earns $62,548 a year and 31.5% of adults have a bachelor’s degree, each lower than the corresponding state figures.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDrunkest city: Santa Fe\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 14.9% (bottom 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 13.8% (6th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol related driving deaths: 22.5% (bottom 25%)\n\nDespite ranking as the heaviest drinking metro area in New Mexico, unhealthy drinking habits are relatively uncommon in Santa Fe. Only 14.9% of adults New Mexico’s capital city drink excessively compared to 18.0% of adults nationwide. In addition to a relatively low excessive drinking rate, adults in Santa Fe are less likely to be obese, less likely to smoke, and more likely to be physically active than the typical American adult. Due in part to their healthy lifestyles, adults in Santa Fe are less likely to die prematurely of preventable causes than the typical American.\n\nNew York\n\nDrunkest city: Watertown-Fort Drum\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.9% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.2% (20th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.8%\n\nSome 22.9% of adults in the Watertown-Fort Drum metro area drink binge drink or drink heavily, the largest share of any metro area in New York state. While wealthy individuals are more likely to drink excessively than the average American overall, the typical household in the Watertown-Fort Drum metro area earns just $45,624 a year, the least of any city in New York.\n\nOne factor likely contributing to the metro’s high excessive drinking rate may be the presence of Fort Drum, a U.S. Army military base comprising approximately 10% of the metro area’s population. According to a study by the Military Suicide Research Consortium, more than 50% of Army personnel binge drink — four drinks in a single sitting for women and five for men — on a monthly basis.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDrunkest city: Jacksonville\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.7% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 14.9% (8th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 35.1% (top 25%)\n\nOf the 15 metro areas in North Carolina, Jacksonville is the only one where more than 1 in every 5 adults drink excessively. While a high binge and heavy drinking rate does not necessarily mean residents are more likely to drive under the influence, alcohol is a relatively common factor in roadway fatalities in Jacksonville. Some 35.1% of driving deaths in the metro area involve alcohol, more than both the comparable 32.3% statewide and the 30.0% U.S. shares.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDrunkest city: Fargo\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 25.2% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 24.7% (the highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 38.0% (top 25%)\n\nNorth Dakota has the highest excessive drinking rate of any state. Some 24.7% of adults in the state drink excessively, far more than the 18.0% national rate. In the Fargo metro area, an even higher 25.2% of adults drink excessively, the most of any metro area in North Dakota and the fifth most of any city nationwide.\n\nOne factor contributing to the city’s high excessive drinking rate may be the presence of several colleges and universities, where, according to a national survey by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, nearly 3 in 5 students drink alcohol. Fargo is home to North Dakota State University, the second largest university in North Dakota, as well as a number of private colleges. An estimated 12.0% of Fargo residents are enrolled in college, compared to only 7.4% of the state population.\n\nOhio\n\nDrunkest city: Columbus\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.6% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.2% (14th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 30.5%\n\nAn estimated 19.6% of adults in the Columbus metro area drink excessively, the largest share of any of the state’s 11 metro areas. Excessive drinking rates tend to be higher among better-educated, wealthier populations, and Columbus has both the highest median income and bachelor’s degree attainment rate of any metro area in Ohio.\n\nDespite being home to the largest share of adults who either binge drink or drink heavily in the state, Columbus residents appear to be relatively healthy. Only 14.5% of area adults are in fair or poor health, below the corresponding 15.0% of adults nationwide and the smallest such share in the state.\n\nOklahoma\n\nDrunkest city: Lawton\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 14.5% (bottom 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 13.9% (7th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 41.5% (top 10%)\n\nJust 13.9% of adults in Oklahoma drink excessively, the seventh smallest share of any state. While Lawton’s excessive drinking rate of 14.5% is the highest in Oklahoma, it is still far below the 18.0% national rate and below that of nearly 90% of all U.S. metropolitan areas.\n\nThe relatively uncommon heavy drinking habits among Lawton residents may contribute to some positive health outcomes. While nationwide 10.3 in every 100,000 Americans die from alcohol-induced causes annually, in Lawton the alcohol-related mortality rate is 8.9 deaths per 100,000 residents.\n\nOregon\n\nDrunkest city: Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.1% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.8% (16th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 34.7%\n\nAt 21.1%, the excessive drinking rate in the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metro area is the highest of any of Oregon’s eight metro areas. Binge and heavy drinking tend to be more common in wealthier populations, and relatively many Portland-area residents are high earners. Some 7.4% of area households earn more than $200,000 a year, the largest share of any metro area in the state and well above the corresponding share of households statewide of 5.3%.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDrunkest city: State College\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.3% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.1% (21st highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 29.6%\n\nFew groups are more likely to drink excessively than college students. In the State College metro area — home to Pennsylvania State University, the largest school in the state — 24.1% of residents are enrolled in college or graduate school, the fourth largest share of any city nationwide. Some 22.3% of State College adults report drinking excessively, much larger than both the state share of 18.1% and 18.0% national share. College graduates are also more likely to drink than the average American. Nearly 50% of State College adults have graduated from a four-year college, one of the largest shares of any U.S. metro.\n\nRhode Island\n\nDrunkest city: Providence-Warwick\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.9%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.9% (23rd highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 35.1% (top 25%)\n\nAs the only metro area in Rhode Island, Providence-Warwick is the heaviest drinking by default. The 17.9% of area adults who either binge drink or drink heavily is roughly in line with both state and nationwide rates.\n\nWhile unhealthy drinking habits are not more common than usual in Rhode Island or Providence, driving deaths attributable to drinking are. Some 35.1% of roadway fatalities in Providence and 40.4% of driving deaths in Rhode Island involve alcohol. In comparison, alcohol is involved in only 30.0% of driving deaths nationwide.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nDrunkest city: Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.3%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.6% (15th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 28.7%\n\nSome 19.3% of adults in the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort metro area report drinking excessively, more than the 16.6% excessive drinking rate for South Carolina as a whole and the largest share of any metro area in the state. Wealthy individuals are more likely to participate in activities related to drinking, such as going out to eat, going on vacation, and socializing with coworkers, and are more likely to drink heavily than the average American. In the HIlton Head metro area, the typical household earns $63,756 a year, far more than the state median household income of $49,501.\n\nUS Soldiers in Japan have been banned from drinking, with their movements restricted after a Marine was arrested over a car crash which killed a local. Buzz60\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nDrunkest city: Sioux Falls\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.2%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.7% (25th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 26.7%\n\nIn Sioux Falls, 18.2% of adults drink excessively, a larger share than the 16.7% of adults who drink excessively in Rapid City, the only other metro area in South Dakota, and larger than the 17.7% statewide excessive drinking rate.\n\nBinge and heavy drinking rates tend to be higher in wealthier, better-educated populations. In Sioux Falls, 34.1% of adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher, and the typical household earns $63,931 a year. Statewide, only 28.9% of adults have a bachelor’s degree, and the typical household earns only $54,467 annually.\n\nTennessee\n\nDrunkest city: Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 13.7% (bottom 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 11.2% (the lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 26.6%\n\nJust 11.2% of adults in Tennessee report excessive drinking, the smallest share of any state. While the Nashville metropolitan area’s excessive drinking rate of 13.7% is the highest of any city in Tennessee, it is still far below the national rate of 18.0% and one of the smallest shares of any U.S. city.\n\nThe relatively uncommon excessive drinking habits in the Nashville metro area may partially contribute to positive health outcomes. While nationwide 10.3 in every 100,000 Americans die from causes related to alcohol, the alcohol-induced mortality rate in Nashville is just 7.4 deaths per 100,000 residents.\n\nTexas\n\nDrunkest city: Austin-Round Rock\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.3% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.3% (20th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.1%\n\nWith a 22.3% excessive drinking rate, Austin-Round Rock is the heaviest drinking metro area in Texas and among the heaviest drinking nationwide. As is often the case in areas with high excessive drinking rates, the Austin population is also a relatively high earning and well educated. Some 42.8% of area adults have a bachelor’s degree, the largest share of any of the state’s 25 metro areas. Similarly, Austin’s $71,000 median annual household income is the highest of any metro area in Texas and about $14,400 more than what the typical household in the state earns.\n\nUtah\n\nDrunkest city: Salt Lake City\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.2% (bottom 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 12.4% (3rd lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 20.6% (bottom 10%)\n\nAccording to a study by Utah state government and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, some 62.8% of Utah residents are Mormons, by far the largest share of any state. Alcohol is largely forbidden in the Mormon faith, which may be one reason why just 12.4% of adults in Utah binge drink or drink heavily, the third smallest share of any state. In the Salt Lake City metro area, some 15.2% of adults report excessive drinking, the largest share in Utah yet below the 18.0% national excessive drinking rate.\n\nThe relatively low of binge and heavy drinking in the state helps reduce the rate of alcohol-related fatalities. While nationwide 10.3 in every 100,000 Americans die from causes related to alcohol annually, in Utah the alcohol-induced mortality rate is 6.2 deaths per 100,000 residents.\n\nVermont\n\nDrunkest city: Burlington-South Burlington\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.9% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.6% (12th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 31.0%\n\nBurlington-South Burlington is the only metro area in Vermont and therefore the heaviest drinking by default. Still, 21.9% share of area adults drink excessively, a higher share than both the statewide and national excessive drinking rates of 19.6% and 18.0%, respectively.\n\nWhile excessive drinking is relatively common in the Burlington metro area, other unhealthy habits are not. Adults in Burlington are less likely to smoke, less likely to be obese, and more likely to exercise regularly than the typical American. The healthier lifestyles contribute to favorable health outcomes. Only 9.1% of Burlington adults are in fair or poor health, well below the 15.0% share of adults nationwide.\n\nVirginia\n\nDrunkest city: Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.0%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.4% (21st lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 25.8% (bottom 25%)\n\nAccording to a nationwide survey by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse, close to 3 in 5 college students aged 18 to 22 drink alcohol on a monthly basis. The Blacksburg metro area is the home of Virginia Tech, one of the largest universities in Virginia. Some 20.5% of residents in Blacksburg are enrolled in college or graduate school, the largest share in the state and the 10th largest share of any U.S. metro. Many college students are likely among the 18.0% of adults in Blacksburg who report drinking excessively, a larger share than the 17.4% rate for Virginia as a whole.\n\nWashington\n\nDrunkest city: Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.5% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.8% (24th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 34.0%\n\nOf the 11 metro areas in Washington, Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue is the only one in which more than 1 in every 5 adults drink excessively. Wealthier, better-educated Americans are more likely to drink excessively — and Seattle has the highest median income and bachelor’s degree attainment rate of any metro area in the state. The typical Seattle household earns $78,612 a year, about $11,500 more than median income statewide. Similarly, 42.0% of metro area adults have a four-year college degree compared to 35.1% of adults across Washington.\n\nWhile excessive drinking is never healthy, higher educational attainment and incomes appear to affect health outcomes across broad populations more than excessive drinking rates. Despite ranking as the heaviest drinking metro area in Washington, Seattle is also the healthiest. Only 11.4% of adults in Seattle report being in fair or poor health, well below the 14.3% share of adults statewide.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nDrunkest city: Morgantown\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.1%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 11.4% (2nd lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 28.0%\n\nAlcohol is expensive — prohibitively so for many lower-income Americans. In West Virginia, the typical household earns just $43,385 a year, far less than the national median household income of $57,617. The state’s low incomes may be one reason why just 11.4% of adults in West Virginia report excessive drinking, the second smallest share of any state.\n\nIn the Morgantown metro area, the typical household earns $50,120 a year, the most of any metro area in West Virginia. Additionally, a greater than typical 16.5% share of residents are enrolled in college or graduate school, where heavy alcohol use is far more common. An estimated 16.1% of Morgantown adults drink heavily or binge drink, the largest share of any metro area in the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nDrunkest city: Green Bay\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 26.5% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 24.5% (2nd highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 50.5% (top 10%)\n\nGreen Bay is the heaviest drinking metro area in both Wisconsin and the United States. Some 26.5% of area adults drink excessively compared to 24.5% of adults in Wisconsin and 18.0% of adults nationwide. Despite widespread alcohol abuse in the metro area, adults in Green Bay report fewer mentally or physically unhealthy days per month on average than is typical nationwide\n\nAs is often the case in heavy drinking areas, alcohol-impaired driving appears to be a considerable problem in Green Bay. The metro area is one of only five nationwide where more than half of all driving deaths involve alcohol.\n\nWyoming\n\nDrunkest city: Casper\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.2%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.5% (23rd lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 40.0% (top 10%)\n\nIn the Casper metro area, 18.2% of adults drink excessively, the largest share of any city in Wyoming and slightly above the 18.0% national rate.\n\nThe high prevalence of heavy and binge drinking habits in Casper may contribute to adverse health outcomes. Alcohol is involved, for example, in 40% of all driving deaths in Casper, far more than the 30% national rate. Overall, 21 in every 100,000 Casper residents die from causes related to alcohol annually, more than double the national rate of 10 deaths per 100,000 Americans.\n\nDrinking heavily and smoking for years are well-known features of an unhealthy lifestyle. They can also make you look older, according to a new study Time\n\nTo identify the drunkest city in each state, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the percentage of men and women over 18 who report binge or heavy drinking in each state’s metro areas.

Ministers ‘were warned on schools’\n\nHeadteachers in England are scrambling to find ways to reopen their schools after being told to shut buildings made with unsafe concrete. Many staff from the 104 affected schools are “busy rejigging timetables, seeking alternative classrooms and trying to rent temporary toilets”, said the BBC. Meanwhile, a senior civil servant told The Observer that “many alerts” on the issue crossed the education secretary’s desk, but the “dangerously complacent” government was more concerned with saving money.\n\n2. ‘Blitzes’ fail to improve PM’s ratings\n\nWeeks of “Tory policy blitzes” have failed to boost Rishi Sunak’s approval ratings, said The Observer. The latest Opinium survey showed the Tories have “failed to shift the dial in Sunak’s favour”, with the PM dropping two points in the past fortnight to a net score of -25% (24% approve, 49% disapprove). The Conservatives spent the summer focusing on specific policy areas they believed would “expose Labour’s weaknesses” – such as crime, immigration, health and schools.\n\n3. Body cameras for Tesco staff\n\nTesco workers are to be offered body cameras due to a rise in violent attacks, said the supermarket’s chief executive. After the company saw physical assaults increase by a third since last year, Tesco boss Ken Murphy said the abuse his workers suffered was “heartbreaking”. The British Retail Consortium found abuse against retail staff had almost doubled compared to pre-Covid levels. “The pandemic has normalised appalling levels of violent and abusive behaviour against retail workers,” said a spokeswoman.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Ukraine ‘breaches key line’\n\nThe Ukrainian military has claimed that its forces have decisively breached Russia’s first defensive line near Zaporizhzhia. After weeks of “painstaking mine clearance”, the troops “expect faster gains as they press the weaker second line”, said a general. He believes that Moscow had devoted 60% of its time and resources into building the first defensive line and only 20% into the second line because it had not expected Ukrainian forces to get through. The US has acknowledged the “notable progress” of the counteroffensive over the past few days.\n\n5. Biden’s Florida trip overshadowed\n\nJoe Biden has vowed to give Florida any support it needs to rebuild in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Idalia. The US president’s visit to the state was overshadowed by politics, because governor Ron DeSantis chose not to meet Biden on his trip after suggesting the president’s presence could hinder disaster response efforts. The governor’s decision not to meet Biden “caught the White House off guard”, said Reuters.\n\n6. Hackers breach UK security\n\nHackers linked to Moscow have leaked top-secret security information on British military and intelligence sites, said The Mirror. The thousands of pages of data could “help criminals get into the HMNB Clyde nuclear submarine base, the Porton Down chemical weapon lab and a GCHQ listening post”, said the paper. The secret information has been placed on to the dark web, which can be accessed using special software. The government must explain why the information was “so vulnerable”, said Labour.\n\n7. Tory donor switches to Labour\n\nA major Tory donor will “open his wallet to Labour” in the run-up to the next election, said The Independent. In the “latest sign that support is ebbing away from Rishi Sunak”, Mohamed Amersi, who with his partner has donated £750,000 to the Conservatives, said he would donate to Labour because large parts of the UK were suffering from “huge problems”, including crime and unemployment. New analysis reveals the prime minister is being forced to rely on a “dwindling pool of donors”, said the paper.\n\n8. BBC delayed Brexit vote news\n\nThe BBC held David Dimbleby back from announcing the result of the Brexit referendum, even after the outcome was clear. The former broadcaster said he had not prepared how he would reveal the momentous news, despite knowing which way the referendum had gone for most of the night. “The BBC, very fastidious about any results of a democratic vote, they wait until it’s absolutely impossible for it to be wrong”, he told the News Agents podcast. “And when it came I didn’t know what I was going to say really. I hadn’t thought about it.\n\n9. North/South divide on beer prices\n\nDrinkers face a deepening north-south divide on beer prices — with the cost of a pint in the centre of London three times higher than the cheapest towns. The average pint in Consett near Newcastle, is just £2.65 — a fraction of central London average of £6.63, said data group CGA. Experts said that varying business rates, rents, and wages are responsible for the vast price differences, with customers’ “willingness to pay” also playing a part.\n\n10. Charles ‘disappointed Harry was a boy’\n\nCharles was disappointed at having another boy when Harry was born, according to a new audio of Princess Diana. The late princess recorded a series of tapes and had them secretly delivered to author Andrew Morton. In one, she claimed that at Harry’s christening, Charles told her stepmother: “You know we were so disappointed, we thought it would be a girl.” She says her stepmother, Raine Spencer, replied: “You should realise how lucky you are to have a child that’s normal.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/09/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/08/20/pregnant-panda-rim-pacific-virtual-colleges-news-around-states/113374340/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey said the state is seeking to provide out-of-work people with an additional $300 per week in unemployment assistance for a short time through a plan announced by President Donald Trump. The Alabama Department of Labor said in a news release that the state is applying for the Lost Wages Assistance Program created by Trump. It is unknown how long the extra payments would last, and it might be only for a short time. The state Labor Department said federal guidance indicated states would get three weeks’ worth of funding. Additional weeks would be granted on a weekly basis if funds are available. To be eligible for the benefit, the Alabama Department of Labor said recipients must receive at least $100 in unemployment and must certify that they remain unemployed or partially unemployed because of the disruptions caused by COVID-19. The Labor Department said unemployed workers will be automatically notified if they are eligible. No additional application is required. Payments would be retroactive to Aug. 1. The state will begin issuing the payments following approval and receipt of funds.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Municipality of Anchorage has reached a settlement with the owners of a restaurant that remained open for dine-in service in defiance of an emergency coronavirus order. Kriner’s Diner agreed to abide by a temporary injunction issued by Superior Court Judge Eric Aarseth last week and to obey the city's emergency order stopping indoor service at all restaurants and breweries, The Anchorage Daily News reported. In return, the municipality agreed to suspend fines incurred when the diner defied the court injunction. Aarseth issued the injunction when Kriner’s Diner continued dine-in service after the city's order went into effect Aug. 3 and the business failed to comply with a stop-work order. Andy Kriner, who owns Kriner’s Diner with his wife, said in a social media video post that the restaurant cannot afford to pay daily fines that could grow in size. Anchorage previously requested a contempt of court hearing after the restaurant defied the judge’s order. Under the agreement the diner will pay $3,300 in fines, but can pay the funds to the Food Bank of Alaska or a similar entity, Kriner’s attorney Blake Quackenbush said. Kriner’s Diner is required to follow the city’s emergency order until Sept. 1 and will be subject to fines of $5,000 per defendant per day if the business provides indoor service.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has refused a Phoenix-area health club chain’s request to hold Gov. Doug Ducey in contempt after it challenged his order closing gyms to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Timothy Thomason ruled late Monday there was no indication that Ducey’s reopening plan for gyms violated due process standards. The judge wrote that Mountain Fitness “has not even given the process a chance to work.” Mountainside Fitness said in a court filing Aug. 12 that Ducey’s reopening plan lacked firm deadlines and clear standards. Mountainside also said gyms that assure the state they are operating safely should be allowed to open once they turn in key paperwork. Thomason previously ordered Ducey to create an application process for reopening gyms and the plan unveiled Aug. 10 allows gyms to reopen at a limited capacity and with health precautions once the spread of the virus within their county is downgraded to moderate or minimal.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A Republican congressman in central Arkansas whom Democrats hope to unseat this fall launched a campaign ad Tuesday in which he touts the federal coronavirus relief the state has received, as negotiations over further assistance remain deadlocked in Washington. U.S. Rep. French Hill, who has represented Arkansas’ 2nd Congressional District since 2015, launched the ad a week after Democratic rival Joyce Elliott began airing a spot. Hill’s campaign wouldn’t say how much it’s spending to air the spot, but reports filed with the Federal Communications Commission show it has spent at least $32,000 to run on Little Rock television stations through the end of August. Efforts for new emergency relief have stalled in Washington, and hopes for a swift compromise have dwindled. Elliott said Hill’s vote for the virus aid shouldn’t be viewed in isolation and said more work needs to be done.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Health officials in California are concerned about the confluence of the coronavirus and flu in the upcoming months, noting a substantial decline in child vaccination rates since the pandemic. Dr. Mark Ghaly, California’s health and human services secretary, said the number of children vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella as they prepare to enter elementary school plummeted when schools and businesses closed in the spring, and childhood vaccinations have generally fallen from a year ago. The flu usually stresses hospitals, which are also now grappling with coronavirus cases, especially in children, he said. “This year together flu and COVID make us particularly worried and have caused us to jump start some of that flu planning,” Ghaly told reporters during a briefing. Dr. Nael Mhaissen, medical director of pediatric infectious diseases at Valley Children’s in Madera, in the Central Valley, said he has similar concerns about how hospitals will handle the confluence of these illnesses in children. The Central Valley has seen some of the largest spikes in coronavirus infection rates in recent weeks. “That could potentially be disastrous as to how things would be for children in general, and for pediatric health care centers, because that will exhaust our resources significantly,” he said. California is dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases but has recently seen signs the spread could be slowing. The state reported 4,636 new cases and 100 deaths on Tuesday and saw an uptick in hospitalizations following two weeks of declines, Ghaly said. More than 11,300 people have died in California.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: More than 150 students at Colorado College were quarantined after a student tested positive for the coronavirus over the weekend, officials said. Positive cases were also reported at the Air Force Academy. The colleges near Colorado Springs have recently reopened in-person classes for fall instruction. Students at Colorado College were tested as they arrived to campus on Friday. A student living in Loomis Hall received positive test results Saturday. The student did not follow the school’s social distancing protocols between when he was tested and received his results, Colorado College spokeswoman Leslie Weddell said. Several people in the hall were exposed to the student, The Gazette reported. As a result, 155 people will be quarantined for 14 days to prevent further spread of the virus on campus. Students will only be permitted to leave their rooms to use the restroom. Any movement in or out of the dorm will be prohibited. The Air Force Academy had a number of cadets test positive for the coronavirus as well, but officials said they were not able to provide details, citing Department of Defense guidance. “Currently positive COVID-19 cases remain considerably less than 1% of our Air Force Academy Cadets and Preparatory School Cadet Candidates,” Lt. Col. Mike Andrews said in an email to the Gazette. Nearly 750 students are tested per week, Andrews said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths were more prevalent in Connecticut’s for-profit nursing homes, as well in larger facilities and homes that are part of chains and located in communities with high infection rates, according to a preliminary, third-party review released Tuesday. The report from the Princeton, New Jersey, research firm Mathematica, and ordered by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, reviewed how the state, nursing homes and assisted living centers prepared for and responded to the coronavirus pandemic. It found that early responses to the coronavirus outbreak were “undermined” by gaps in scientific knowledge about the how the virus spreads, the factors that put people at risk and the range and severity of symptoms – especially among older people. More than 3,000 residents of nursing homes and assisting living have died of COVID-associated causes during the pandemic in Connecticut. That represents about 74% of state’s total deaths from COVID-19. Adults over age 85 were the most severely impacted. Some state legislators criticized the report for not offering much new information. The state spent about $450,000 in federal coronavirus funding on the review.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Attorneys for Democratic Gov. John Carney are resisting attempts to have him questioned under oath in a federal lawsuit over limitations on worship services he imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to attorneys for a Delaware cleric challenging Carney’s actions. Attorneys for the Rev. Dr. Christopher Allan Bullock said in a letter to the court Tuesday that they have been trying for several weeks to accommodate and cooperatively schedule Carney’s deposition, but Carney refuses to be deposed. “Given that he is the sole defendant and key fact witness, he denies everything in his answer, and this is the only deposition plaintiff intends to take, his refusal presents a problem,” wrote Tom Neuberger, whose firm is representing Bullock. Bullock’s attorneys said they have been told by Deputy Attorney General Allison McCowan that Delaware Department of Justice officials “do not see or understand the necessity” of scheduling Carney’s deposition. “Frankly, they’re just being obstructive,” Neuberger said. A spokesman for Carney did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The judge plans to discuss a schedule for the case with attorneys Thursday. Bullock, a well-known New Castle County pastor and community activist, filed a lawsuit in May claiming Carney’s restrictions on worship services were unconstitutional and discriminatory. Carney then rescinded many of the restrictions, and his attorneys argued Bullock’s claims were now moot. But Bullock’s attorneys are asking for an injunction to prohibit the governor from imposing similar limitations on religious practices in the future.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Zookeepers at Washington’s National Zoo are on furry black-and-white baby watch after concluding that venerable giant panda matriarch Mei Xiang is pregnant and could give birth this week. It’s a welcome bit of good news amid a coronavirus pandemic that kept the zoo shuttered for months. “We need this! We totally need this joy,” said zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson. “We are all in desperate need of these feel-goods.” Although “phantom pregnancies” are common with pandas and other large bears, Baker-Masson said an ultrasound scan revealed a “really strong-looking, fantastic fetus” that could be delivered this week. The announcement of the pregnancy has already touched off a fresh round of panda-mania for one of the zoo’s feature attractions. Viewership on the zoo’s panda-cam has increased 800%. The zoo reopened on a limited basis July 24, with restrictions in place to keep the crowds down. However, all indoor exhibits, including the extremely popular panda house, have remained closed. Visitors can still view the outdoor panda enclosure, but Mei has mostly been staying indoors, creating a nest out of branches. She can still be viewed on the panda cam. Panda births are inherently tricky, with stillbirths and miscarriages happening frequently. There is also a phenomenon called “resorption” whereby the fetus is unexpectedly absorbed back into the mother’s body. Baker-Masson said that is rare with a fetus this well-developed. Another potential complication is the age of the mother. Mei, at 22, would be the oldest giant panda to successfully give birth in the United States. The oldest in the world gave birth in China at age 23. Mei Xiang has successfully given birth to three cubs: Tai Shan, Bao Bao and Bei Bei. All were transported to China at age 4, under terms of the zoo’s agreement with the Chinese government. Mei was impregnated via artificial insemination, a process which was heavily affected by precautions over the COVID-19 pandemic. The procedure was conducted shortly after the entire zoo shut down on March 14.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville:Students at two Jacksonville private schools were asked to quarantine following a gathering that resulted in multiple COVID-19 exposures, school officials said. On Monday, an email to parents from Episcopal School of Jacksonville Associate Head of School Keesy Goebertus said \"a social gathering\" with a \"large group of Episcopal and Bolles students\" took place last week, days before the first day of school on Aug. 13. The email said \"several\" students who attended the gathering tested positive for COVID-19. No social distancing was observed and no masks were worn, according to Goebertus' note – in direct conflict with federal and county recommendations. Jacksonville is in Phase 2 of its reopening plan along with most of Florida, which includes limiting social gatherings. According to Episcopal School of Jacksonville spokeswoman Meg Sacks, contact tracing led to \"a number of students\" being sent home to quarantine, including the students who were at the gathering and their siblings, who in some cases also attend the school and are in different classes.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp announced new spending plans for federal COVID-19 aid to schools Tuesday as the state’s newly confirmed infection numbers continue to fall but remain the highest per capita in the nation. Kemp, a Republican, said he would allocate more than $65 million of the remaining $105 million in discretionary money he has to aid schools, pending expected approval by the U.S. Department of Education. Of that money, at least $17 million will go to the state’s Department of Early Care and Learning to subsidize programs to help private child care centers provide daytime supervision for students whose school systems are providing all-virtual instruction. “One of the biggest problems that we’re having right now is schools that are going virtual,” Kemp said. “The parents can’t go back to work because they’re stuck home with the kids. So we’re trying to get some more child care.” Families with incomes of 85% or below of the statewide median would be eligible for subsidized slots if parents are working, or attending college or job training. Students whose school systems are offering any in-person classes would not eligible for the program, which could start as early as next month.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The world’s largest maritime military exercise is scheduled to be held this week in Hawaii, but the event has been scaled back significantly, mainly because of the coronavirus pandemic. The 27th Rim of the Pacific international military exercise will be considerably smaller than usual primarily, Hawaii Public Radio reported. The exercise will be limited to sea training activity with minimal personnel on land to prevent potential spread of the coronavirus. The exercise is held every two years on land, in the air and on the seas around the Hawaiian Islands. The shift is a significant change from past exercises – which included large, land-based training events, shore leave for sailors and numerous social gatherings. This year’s event will feature 10 participating countries including Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. There were 26 participating nations involved in 2018. The U.S. Navy declined to provide reasons former partners declined to participate this year, although the pandemic is a likely cause because some some governments have suspend overseas military training. Thailand announced in July it would indefinitely suspend overseas exercises after a dozen Thai soldiers tested positive for COVID-19 following exercises with the U.S. Army in Hawaii. The U.S. Navy delayed and reconfigured the exercise following a request by Democratic Hawaii Gov. David Ige, but resisted pressure to cancel it. Navy Capt. Jay Steingold, exercise director for the event that goes by its acronym RIMPAC, said the U.S. and partners enacted health precautions including placing 14-day movement restrictions on participants, who will be monitored for symptoms.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An Idaho hospital on Tuesday reported the state’s first case of a pediatric inflammatory illness associated with the new coronavirus. A 7-year-old with no known previous health conditions was diagnosed with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, a potentially serious disease sometimes called MIS-C, said St. Luke’s Regional Health System spokeswoman Anita Kissée. The child was treated in the pediatric intensive care unit but released on Sunday, Kissée said. The illness is newly recognized and is believed to be a delayed complication of coronavirus infection, often causing a fever, evidence of inflammation and severe illness involving more than two organs. Symptoms can vary, but sometimes resemble toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease, another rare illness that can cause fever, inflammation of the blood vessels, lymph nodes and mucous membranes in children. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children can cause coronary arteries and other blood vessels to enlarge or form aneurysms, Kissée said in a social media post, emphasizing that it is a very rare complication of COVID-19. Dr. Kenny Bramwell, the system medical director for St. Luke’s Children’s Hospital, said the girl was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit from another hospital last week. She was well enough to go home on Sunday. Bramwell said he didn’t want to alarm families, but said parents should be aware of the illness. He said more cases are likely coming to Idaho – nationally, there has been about one MIS-C case for every 1,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools on Tuesday released a “final reopening framework” that gives specifics on how much time each grade will spend daily learning remotely as the coronavirus pandemic continues. The Chicago Teachers Union immediately criticized school officials, saying they created a plan without imagination and without consulting union officials. “As we prepare for an unprecedented start to the upcoming school year, we’ve set clear expectations for students and staff to improve remote instruction and ensure that our students are supported and their unique needs are met,” schools CEO Dr. Janice K. Jackson said in a statement. The district’s plan establishes expectations for remote learning, instruction time by grade, emotional and social supports for its approximately 350,000 students, plans to assist non-English-speaking students and the distribution of devices to students who need them. Teachers union President Jesse Sharkey said the union has filed a grievance about the district’s remote learning guidance. He contended it fails to provide teachers with the instructional tools necessary to deliver proper instruction in a remote context as required by the labor contract. Officials said schools will be fully remote through early November, when they will decide if the district will move to a hybrid model.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend:The University of Notre Dame on Tuesday canceled in-person undergraduate classes for two weeks after a spike of coronavirus cases that occurred since the semester began Aug. 10. University President the Rev. John Jenkins said there have been 147 confirmed cases of coronavirus on campus since the start of classes for the university’s approximately 12,000 students. Jenkins said he decided against sending students home after consulting with the St. Joseph County Health Department. Instead, university officials decided steps could be taken short of closing the campus while still protecting students’ health and safety. The university is advising off-campus students not to visit the campus and on-campus students not to venture off-campus and is restricting student gatherings to 10 people or less. The university is allowing graduate student access to research laboratories and libraries. Athletic teams subject to surveillance testing can continue to gather for sanctioned activities, but will be closely monitored. According to Jenkins, the university has traced the spike in COVID-19 cases to off-campus gatherings where neither masks were worn nor physical distancing observed. He said students infected at those gatherings passed it on to others, who in turn passed the virus on to others, resulting in the positive cases, with all but one student.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Webster County said Tuesday that a clinic failed to report up to 3,000 negative coronavirus test results, as concerns about inaccuracies in the state’s official pandemic data continued to mount even as schools use it to determine their fall plans. County Public Health department spokeswoman Kelli Bloomquist said her agency uncovered the clinic’s failure to report negative tests last week, and the clinic belatedly submitted the 3,000 results. The county didn’t say why the clinic was not reporting the negative results. The state system rejected the submissions, but a subsequent review confirmed that many tests had not been entered, Bloomquist said. The new information dramatically reduced the county’s 14-day positivity rate, which the state is using to determine whether school districts must return for at least 50% in-person instruction. The Fort Dodge Community School District announced late Monday that the lower positivity rate would allow school to start on Tuesday as initially envisioned. Last week, the district announced a plan to delay the start date given the seemingly high level of community spread following a major outbreak at a prison. Separately, Humboldt Community School District Superintendent Jim Murray said he learned Tuesday that the county positivity rate of 22.6% – highest in the state – will be lower once unspecified data errors are corrected. He said the district would not seek a waiver to start online.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Fans can attend Kansas State University football games this fall, but no tailgating will be allowed. The Riley County Commission approved on Monday the university’s plan to open the Bill Snyder Family Stadium at about 25% capacity, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. The university has developed new ticket options that will be unveiled to season ticket holders later this week. Face coverings will be required upon entering the stadium and while inside when 6 feet of social distancing cannot be maintained. Kansas State Athletic Director Gene Taylor said in a statement they are implementing several new policies that will be strictly enforced. Fans will not be permitted to re-enter the stadium to help eliminate congestion at gates and they will be encouraged to enter the stadium immediately after parking. For the first time, fans will be allowed to buy beer and wine in general seating sections. Hand sanitizing stations will be available throughout the stadium and signs will encourage social distancing. Stadium employees will wear protective gear and face coverings. Also on Tuesday, local health officials said in a news release that a Kansas State University fraternity has been associated with a coronavirus outbreak. The Riley County Health Department said 13 fraternity members tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by seven medically vulnerable state inmates who sought release from the Kentucky Correctional Institution for Women because of the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove said in his ruling Monday that the inmates showed evidence of being incarcerated under conditions that pose a risk of serious harm, but failed to show that Kentucky officials are ignoring risks posed by COVID-19, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. “Based on the evidence presented, it is evident that respondents are aware of and understand the potential risk of serious harm to petitioners through exposure to the COVID-19 virus. It is also evident that respondents have taken numerous precautions to address the particular risks faced by individuals detained at KCIW,” he wrote. As of Monday, 243 inmates and 32 employees have been infected with the coronavirus at the prison in Shelby County, the newspaper reported. The ACLU of Kentucky filed the suit in June on behalf of inmates who had preexisting health conditions that would make them more vulnerable to COVID-19. ACLU staff attorney Heather Gatnarek said she was “deeply disappointed” by the ruling. The Department of Corrections said the ruling recognized the agency’s continuing efforts to minimize health risks for inmates.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards said Tuesday he will reject an emergency plan for the fall elections because it doesn’t expand mail-in balloting options for people quarantined because of the coronavirus pandemic or those at greater risk of serious harm from COVID-19. The decision by the Democratic governor will block the plan offered by Republican Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin for the Nov. 3 presidential election and a Dec. 5 state election. The proposal needs backing from the majority-GOP Legislature and Edwards to take effect. “I do not support his plan. I don’t believe that it accommodates all the voters that should be accommodated in this public health emergency,” Edwards said. He added: “That plan will not be carried out for these elections.” Unless Ardoin revises the plan and can win approval from lawmakers and Edwards, it appears a federal lawsuit filed by voting rights advocates that seeks to widen mail-in voting options will decide what elections in Louisiana look like this fall. Ardoin said he won’t alter the plan he submitted, which was scheduled for its first legislative hearing Wednesday. Louisiana’s absentee balloting procedure is limited to people 65 or older, members of the military, overseas voters, people who are hospitalized and people who won’t be in their parish for the election.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Tests for the coronavirus in wastewater from the Greater Augusta Utility District confirmed a small presence of the virus that coincided with two people testing positive in Kennebec County, officials said. Two tests of wastewater samples showed no detectable levels of the virus but a third test yielded a small concentration of the virus, officials said. “We want to be mindful that COVID-19 is a part of our daily lives. Wastewater testing and monitoring of the results will continue to guide our efforts to return to the new normal,” said Augusta City Manager William Bridgeo. The tests were conducted by Massachusetts-based Biobot, which tests sewage for genetic fragments of the virus in human waste. The water district serves thousands of home and businesses in Augusta, Hallowell, Manchester, Monmouth and Winthrop.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Salisbury University has tested more than 1,000 students and employees for COVID-19 – with 0.4% of them positive – as it prepares for the start of the fall semester. To meet the University System of Maryland's requirement that students, faculty and staff test negative for COVID-19 before moving into campus housing or entering campus buildings, SU has been making testing free for the campus community this month. A news release showed that as of Friday, results for four of the more than 1,000 people tested have come back positive. This free testing opportunity is expected to provide a baseline for SU. Approximately 15% of the university community will be able to access free testing each week throughout the semester as a way to keep SU and local health officials updated on COVID-19 trends on campus. Anyone who tests positive will be asked to remain home for at least two weeks, according to the release, or test negative before returning to campus. The Dogwood Village student housing complex will serve as isolation space for students who test positive, but are unable to leave because of special circumstances. SU has also expanded its one-day move-in to a full week starting Monday so that physical distancing policies can be followed. Classes begin Aug. 31.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: About 70% of Massachusetts public school districts plan to bring children back to the classroom at least part-time this fall, Gov. Charlie Baker said Tuesday. Those districts plan either a hybrid model or full in-person instruction, he said at a news conference to discuss the state’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. More than 370 districts have reported their fall plans to state education officials, he said. “We’re encouraged that nearly three quarters of the school districts are planning for at least a partial in-person learning experience for kids,” the Republican said. “Students have been away from their classrooms and their teachers and peers since March. Since then we have learned a tremendous amount about COVID and have put together guidelines to allow for a productive and safe learning environment that adapts to the challenges that come with COVID-19.” The governor has long made clear his desire for in-person learning, despite pushback from the state’s largest teachers’ unions that are encouraging remote-only learning for at least the start of the school year until school buildings can be made safe. The administration’s guidelines include a statewide map that groups communities into four coronavirus risk categories. The two lowest risk categories have been encouraged to bring students back to the classroom.\n\nMichigan\n\nEast Lansing:Michigan State University is going online for the fall and is encouraging students to stay home, the school’s president announced Tuesday, as schools across the nation struggled to control coronavirus outbreaks. Remote learning for undergraduates is scheduled to begin Sept. 2. The move to online learning is just for undergraduate students at the moment. The colleges of Law, Human Medicine, Nursing, Osteopathic Medicine, Veterinary Medicine and all graduate programs will receive details at a later time, according to the university. Last September, Michigan State’s total enrollment was 49,809 students, with 39,176 undergraduates. Over the next two weeks, in-person and hybrid classes will be transitioned to remote formats, Michigan State said. Refunds or credits will be issued to students who paid for the fall semester. The University of Michigan said it plans to offer a mixture of in-person and remote classes. Not all courses will be available in every format, the school said on its website. Most students will be able to choose whether to return to Ann Arbor for a hybrid learning experience or study from home in a fully remote mode. As of Tuesday, about 70% of undergraduate classes at the University of Michigan were being taken online, according to a school spokesman. The university’s Ann Arbor campus will open its residence halls for housing and dining.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSartell:Sartell-St. Stephen students from early childhood to fifth grade will return to school in-person, almost six months after schools closed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a school board decision. Students in grades 6-12 will attend school in-person and online to limit the number of people in facilities to 50% capacity, according to the district's safe learning plan. That decision was made based on state rules to determine who can return to school, using COVID-19 cases in Stearns County per 10,000 residents over a period of 14 days. In the two-week period from mid-July to Aug. 1, Stearns County had just over 11 cases per 10,000 people, according to health department numbers, which requires the district to use a hybrid plan for its 6-12 grade students. On Aug. 27, updated 14-day case rates will be given to schools, Superintendent Jeff Schweibert said at the board meeting. With Stearns County case rates declining, he said, it's possible the district could start entirely in-person. When the COVID-19 situation in the region changes, districts will have to adjust their models throughout the year. Unless there's a drastic increase in cases, Schweibert said, the district will try to remain in the same model for two weeks, and communicate any changes with families a week before.\n\nMississippi\n\nTutwiler: An outbreak of the coronavirus at a private prison in Mississippi has infected 80% of the Vermont inmates housed there and more test results are pending, the head of the Vermont Corrections Department said. A total of 176 Vermont inmates at the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Tutwiler tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, and 33 have tested negative, Interim Vermont Corrections Commissioner Jim Baker said. One inmate is hospitalized. More test results are pending, he said. Vermont houses 219 inmates in Mississippi because of a lack of capacity in its prisons. In late July, six inmates who were returned to Vermont from Mississippi prison tested positive when they arrived at the Marble Valley Correctional Facility in Rutland. That prompted Vermont’s Corrections Department on July 30 to order that the remaining Vermont inmates in Mississippi be tested. Most of the Vermont inmates who have tested positive are asymptomatic and 119 are in medical recovery, he said. About 20 are considered to be vulnerable based on their health conditions, he said. The Corrections Department is watching four inmates very closely, Baker said. CoreCivic, the operator of the prison, is now in the process of testing the remaining inmates from other states, Baker said.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Dr. Deborah Birx, President Donald Trump’s top coronavirus adviser, called on everyone in Missouri to wear masks and refrain from attending parties. Birx met with Republican Gov. Mike Parson in his Capitol office. Afterward, she said political affiliations are irrelevant in the ongoing fight to slow the spread of COVID-19. “It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or a Republican,” Birx said. “You need to wear a mask and socially distance. You need to not have parties in your backyard and your living room.” Birx also talked to Parson about enacting a statewide mask mandate similar to one in Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in July required masks in counties with 20 or more positive coronavirus cases. Parson called that a “great model” but didn’t directly answer a reporter’s question on whether he would enact such a policy. He said local officials already require masks in Missouri’s hot spots. “I support those local leaders in that decision and have since Day One,” Parson said. “I also want to add that just because masks aren’t mandated everywhere does not mean you shouldn’t wear one, especially if you can’t social distance.”\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: An assisted living facility has been ordered to comply with state and local requirements for employees to wear masks while at work to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Missoula City-County Health Department issued the order Friday to Ty Harding, owner of the Beehive Homes franchise in Missoula. Harding told the Missoulian newspaper that Beehive was not aware that the county’s mask rules were more strict than the statewide mask mandate. The governor’s mandate allows an exception for face coverings when speaking to hearing-impaired persons. The county’s mandate does not include that exception. Six complaints were made against the facility from July 16 to Aug. 11, the order stated. Staff were notified that the stricter mask mandate applied in Missoula County on July 16. However, other complaints followed about staff and contractors. Beehive has ordered transparent face masks so staff can communicate with residents who are hearing impaired, Harding said. Facility manager Erin Heitzmann said she disagrees with the county’s order. “We’re taking away the last little shred of humanity,” she said, arguing the residents might fare better with traditional person-to-person contact. “We love them. They know us, and they are important to us.” Montana has had two large outbreaks of COVID-19 at assisted living facilities. One in Toole County resulted in six deaths and one in Billings led to 16 deaths.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A busy coronavirus testing site in Omaha is closing this week, so local health care providers are seeking another way to provide more testing in the area, which is home to several meatpacking plants and a large Hispanic community. More than 1,900 of Douglas County’s more than 12,000 coronavirus cases have come from just one ZIP code in the area near the southeastern Omaha testing site, officials said. The state’s main testing service, TestNebraska, operates three drive-through testing locations elsewhere in Omaha, but none of them are close to southeastern Omaha. “We do need another option in our community,” said Andrea Skolkin, the CEO of OneWorld, a health center based in that part of the city. “Particularly east Omaha, it doesn’t seem like anyone is paying attention. … South Omaha is the hot zone. I don’t understand it.” Matt Miltenberger, Gov. Pete Ricketts’ chief of staff, said the state is looking for locations to set up a TestNebraska site in southeastern Omaha. “We want to be up ASAP,” he said. The current drive-through testing site in southeastern Omaha that can test up to 300 people a day has been a joint effort of OneWorld, the Douglas County Health Department and other groups. The site has been staffed primarily by Nebraska Medicine employees for the past eight weeks. But a hospital spokesman said those employees are needed back at their regular jobs now that Nebraska Medicine has resumed most of its normal operations, including elective surgeries that were put on hold during the spring. Skolkin said her health center is testing about 50 people per day at its locations and that it might be able to increase that to 100, but the private lab it uses has longer waiting times for test results.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Labor unions in Las Vegas began a campaign Tuesday to get area lawmakers to require employers to return furloughed casino, tourism, hospitality, airport, entertainment and hospital employees to their jobs when the coronavirus pandemic ebbs and business resumes. Several hundred idled workers demonstrated at the Clark County Government Center before representatives asked the all-Democratic county commission to consider a law Sept. 1 giving workers a “Right to Return” to former positions. “I’m here because they should respect my seniority,” said Moises Cuellar, an out-of-work casino employee with nearly 10 years’ experience at the New York-New York resort on the Las Vegas Strip. Like many in the crowd, he wore a red Culinary Union T-shirt. The 52-year-old married father of two said he has a home and a mortgage, and he was worried that co-workers with less time on the job have already been called back to work. The Nevada State AFL-CIO said the fledgling “Save Our Jobs” drive represents some 87,000 Nevada nurses, bartenders, operating engineers, service employees, teamsters, auto industry and stage and theatrical workers. “We want people to have peace of mind, to get through the pandemic and still have jobs,” said Geoconda Argüello-Kline, a top official with the powerful local Culinary Workers Union.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Billboards and banners are part of the plan to ensure the annual Motorcycle Week gathering in Laconia stays safe, Gov. Chris Sununu said Tuesday. The event is scheduled to begin Saturday and run through Aug. 30. for Aug. 22-30. Liquor enforcement officials have been reaching out to restaurants and bars to remind them of rules to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and city and state officials also are working with campground owners and lodging properties to spread the word, Sununu said. The state also plans to put up billboards and fly planes carrying banners reminding attendees that masks are required for large events with more than 100 people. “We’ve made it clear that any intentional disregard of safety guidance is unacceptable,” Sununu said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBellmawr: A judge has imposed nearly $130,000 in fines against the owners of a gym that has repeatedly defied Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order to remain closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Atilis gym in Bellmawr opened its doors in May, starting a legal battle over whether Murphy’s order for nonessential businesses to remain closed was constitutional. The owners, Ian Smith and Frank Trumbetti, have said they have taken steps to ensure social distancing and taken other safety precautions. In issuing his order Tuesday, state Superior Court Judge Robert Lougy said the gym could not “ignore orders with which it does not agree.” The decision requires the gym and its owners to pay almost $125,000 overall for violating a court order on eight days between Aug. 1-14. and about $10,500 to the state for the legal costs of its contempt of court action. The gym owners and their attorney could not be reached for comment Wednesday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBelen: A central New Mexico family that has three medical practices has closed its offices because of coronavirus exposure, and two members of the family are recovering from symptoms of the virus. The Albuquerque Journal reported Dr. Roland Sanchez, who has a family practice in Belen, and his wife, Elia, have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. A statement from the family didn’t provide details of their conditions. Family spokesman Tom Garrity said with two exceptions, the family members who have tested positive are asymptomatic. Along with Sanchez’s medical practice, those of his sons, Dr. Roland Sanchez II, who owns Conquistador Dental, and Dr. Florian Sanchez, owner of Yucca Veterinary Medical Center, closed their offices on Aug. 10. According to voice recordings at each office, all three planned on reopening this week.\n\nNew York\n\nPoughkeepsie:The Poughkeepsie City School District will only offer remote learning when school resumes Sept. 10. Superintendent Eric Rosser confirmed the decision in a letter to district parents Wednesday morning. “After careful and deliberate consideration and planning it has been determined that the most appropriate instructional delivery model to begin our school year will be distance learning (remote instruction),” the letter read. “This was not an easy decision to make, but please know that it was made with the best interest of all of our students, teachers, staff and parents in mind.” Poughkeepsie joins several Dutchess County school districts that have committed to remote learning for the start of the academic year. Arlington Central School District, Wappingers Central School District and Red Hook School District made similar decisions in response to the ongoing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rosser attributed the decision to the parent response in the district’s reopening survey, as well as the need for additional time to meet health and safety requirements to bring students back to school. Of the parents to respond to the survey, 57.8% said they preferred a remote learning model. In preparation for the shift to remote learning, the district will be distributing Chromebooks, musical instruments and other supplies to students and families, as well as instructions and guidance on how the plan will be implemented. The district will also establish 13 locations for students to pick up free breakfast and lunch that would be offered under normal circumstances.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s public schools returned to class on Monday, with most students still learning from home through computers to start the year because of continued worries about COVID-19. The first day was marked by technical challenges beyond those that video conferencing and virtual learning bring. Districts reported trouble for children and instructors logging on to the North Carolina Education Cloud. The portal provides access to several digital applications, including tools for grading and attendance, instructional materials and lesson plans. “The product experienced a degradation in service this morning,” the Department of Public Instruction said in a news release. The service was working as of midday Monday, the agency said, and the vendor that provides the service will explain what went wrong. In a Facebook post, the Craven County Public Schools said the system experienced an “overload due to so many students across the state trying to log in at the same time.” Under Gov. Roy Cooper’s plan, school boards could start the year by offering full remote learning, in-person instruction with strict social distancing or a mix. School buildings were shuttered in March amid the pandemic and never reopened this past year. School districts are expanding their online instruction. More than half of Wake County’s school enrollment signed up for the district’s “virtual academy.” However, the State Board of Education declined last week to increase enrollment for two virtual charter schools.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State health officials said Wednesday the number of COVID-19 deaths in the state has hit 130. The North Dakota Department of Health reported two new deaths, including a woman in her 70s from McLean County and a woman in her 90s from Grand Forks County. Health officials said both women had underlying health conditions. North Dakota confirmed 188 new coronavirus infections, raising the state’s total to 8,968 since the pandemic began. Of the new cases, 42 are in Burleigh County and 11 are in neighboring Morton County. The counties that include the Bismarck metropolitan area have taken over as the state’s hot spot for the virus in recent weeks. Cass County, which includes Fargo, reported 36 new cases, a total that includes two from out of state. The number of active cases in North Dakota on Wednesday was 1,209, an increase of 40 from Tuesday. On Wednesday, 49 patients were hospitalized, up two from the previous day.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: All Ohio high school sports can go forward this fall, with an option for sports like football or soccer to be delayed until the spring if schools wish, Gov. Mike DeWine said in one of his most anticipated coronavirus-related announcements that came just days before the start of the school year. The governor’s order – which takes effect Friday – prohibits spectators at events other than family members or individuals close to athletes, with final decisions on those people left up to schools. Similar limits are in place for family members of marching bands and drill teams. “Our order provides the best guidance to play sports as safely as can be played in the era of COVID-19,” DeWine said. DeWine said a decision on performing arts events, such as school plays, was coming this week, and hinted they would be allowed with precautions such as moving audiences farther back. It will be up to schools to police the limits on attendance at sporting events, but the Ohio High School Athletic Association will send site monitors to games, and schools found in violation of the governor’s orders could forfeit games and face disqualification from further competition, said Lt. Gov. Jon Husted.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma’s application for $300 per week federal unemployment benefits to people left jobless because of the coronavirus has been approved, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Oklahoma becomes the ninth state to be approved for the program announced earlier this month by President Donald Trump, according to a Tuesday night statement from FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor. Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Monday that he had applied for inclusion into the program for the unemployed who are receiving at least $100 in state unemployment benefits. “As we are months ahead of other states in our recovery and Oklahoma is open for business, many Oklahomans have returned to work or are in training to take on a new career,” Stitt said Monday. “However, we also want to continue to help those who are still working to secure employment.” The Oklahoma Employment Security Commission reported a 6.6% statewide unemployment rate for June, the most recent report. July’s jobless numbers are to be released Friday. Unemployed Oklahomans have faced numerous challenges in receiving unemployment benefits, often lining up for blocks outside the commission.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Oregonians still waiting for their unemployment benefits can apply for a one-time payment of $500 beginning Wednesday. The $35 million relief check program, that was approved by lawmakers in mid-July, could help up to 70,000 Oregon residents facing financial hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus, which has infecting thousands of Oregonians and killed nearly 400, has also caused a surge in unemployment. More than 500,000 people have filed unemployment claims since the start of the pandemic, causing major delays in people receiving funds. The purpose of the new relief program, which would use funds from the CARES Act, is to provide support to Oregonians while the agency continues to work through its backlog. “After months of hearing from increasingly desperate Oregonians who were doing everything right and still not getting the unemployment they were owed, we hope this effort offers a streamlined way for some financial relief,” House Speaker Tina Kotek said Wednesday. “The state is stepping up, and I hope Congress will act soon to provide more support that is desperately needed.” People eligible for a relief check must have made less than $4,000 before taxes per month before losing a job, be an Oregon resident, be 18 or older and the employer must have closed or the person’s income “decreased significantly because of executive actions by Gov. Kate Brown to slow the spread of COVID-19.” People are not eligible for the program if their unemployment benefits are up to date. For more information on how to apply for the one-time payment visit emergencychecks.oregon.gov.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The annual Pennsylvania Farm Show was canceled as an in-person event on Wednesday because of the coronavirus pandemic, ending the prospect of hundreds of thousands of people converging on the Harrisburg complex in January. Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding said the Jan. 9-15 event will be conducted virtually instead, with a theme of “cultivating tomorrow.” “While this field may lie fallow in January, we are cultivating tomorrow,” Redding said. Farm Show organizers expect to release more details about the virtual event, which will aim to educate people about the state’s agricultural industry. Competitive events held virtually will not require the purchase of an animal. “How we keep the threads of the competitiveness there, particularly in our youth programming, is one of the issues we’re working on real-time,” Redding said. He said there will be no livestock shows at the Farm Show Complex, but perhaps events can be held in local communities. The Farm Show bills itself as the country’s largest agricultural exposition under a single roof, featuring about 6,000 animals and 10,000 competitive exhibits. Like an enormous state fair without the rides and carnival barkers, the Farm Show is part professional development for farm families, along with a range of entertainment, from horse shows and tractor pulls to an annual butter sculpture.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence:Almost 9% of people who tested positive for the coronavirus over a week in early August reported having recently visited a bar or a restaurant, according to a Rhode Island Department of Health analysis. Because people are getting more mobile as the state’s economy reopens, it’s getting harder to identify exactly how people got sick, Joseph Wendelken, a spokesman for the Department of Health, said in an email. But according to a recent story in The New York Times, restaurants and bars have been a “focal point” for recent outbreaks. The national restaurant industry pushed back forcefully against that report, saying it mischaracterized the safety of restaurants. And locally, people involved in the business said they’re taking their responsibilities seriously – making it safe to go out to eat, indoors or outdoors. “It’s safe, because the rules make it safe,” said Dale Venturini, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Hospitality Association, whose members include hundreds of bars and restaurants in Providence. Venturini said there have been a few cases among workers in the industry, one or two each, and no outbreaks. But that’s at least in part a result of aggressive testing among workers in the industry, she said: Businesses want to know if their employees have gotten sick, and have tried their best to find out. As to the state’s recent analysis showing almost 9% of cases over a week in August had visited a restaurant recently, Venturini noted that it’s easier to do that sort of study on the industry – because under the state’s rules, restaurants have to keep people’s information. Other industries or settings don’t have to keep such meticulous records.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMoore: Construction on a coffee roasting and packaging facility that has been in the works for more than two years has been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, according to officials. The Keurig Dr. Pepper plant being built in Spartanburg County is now set to be completed in early 2021, The Spartanburg Herald-Journal quoted site leadership team member Chuck Hollingsworth as saying. Coffee and Keurig single-serve K-Cup pods will be manufactured at the $350 million facility in Moore, which was first announced in May 2018, according to the news outlet. Keurig Dr. Pepper said it planned to create 500 jobs in connection with the site. It was not immediately clear when the plant was originally set to be completed. Officials did not comment further on the delay.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:South Dakota State University is canceling one of its longest-standing Homecoming traditions this fall. Hobo Day, a celebration meant to focus on the traditions and honors of of students, alumni and others, won't happen like usual because of the coronavirus pandemic, the university stated in a press release Wednesday. College officials and the 2020 Hobo Day committee met over the summer to explore how to hold the event with health and safety at the forefront, the release stated. But after many conversations and planning meetings with school officials made the choice not to move forward with the annual Hobo Day parade this fall, with the understanding that not having a fall football season at SDSU was a distinct possibility, the release stated. The Hobo Day Committee understood hosting the annual Hobo Day parade would create logistical challenges and significant health and safety concerns for attendees in the midst of a global pandemic, the release states. \"These are challenging times, and the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the lives of everyone,\" the release stated. \"The spirit of Hobo Day, however, is one thing that will remain intact.\" Instead, the committee will focus on finding ways to celebrate the tradition and still honor the homecoming event through new avenues, the release stated.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Students at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville could face punishments as stiff as expulsion if they are “irresponsible” in hosting big parties, if they won’t cooperate with COVID-19 contact tracing or if they don’t complete forms documenting their self-isolation, the chancellor said Tuesday. The news comes as Tennessee school officials grapple with identifying and publicizing virus-related data in schools across the state. “It’s possible that you could be expelled from school and I will not hesitate to do that if people, our students, are irresponsible,” Chancellor Donde Plowman said in a video conference. Plowman also noted five cases linked to an off-campus party last week. Wednesday was the first day of classes at the flagship campus. School officials have confirmed 75 active COVID-19 cases there, involving 66 students and nine employees. About 6,500 students have moved in on campus, and 30,000-plus live off-campus. The campus has 270 people in isolation because of contacts, symptoms or positive tests, including 51 students living on campus, Plowman said. Plowman also said students won’t be punished for telling contact tracers they attended a party with underage drinking.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: The Alice ISD board of trustees voted Tuesday to postpone the district’s 2020-21 start date to Sept. 8 – thus pushing back the reopening of its campuses until October. The original start date was Monday. The later date was needed because the delivery of 500 digital devices for students was delayed, and internet repairs at William Adams Middle School are ongoing, Superintendent Carl Scarbrough said. The district distributed about 2,200 devices for students to be taught remotely, and another 500 students need devices. After they’re delivered, schools will need to install remote learning programs on the devices and give students time to practice using them, Scarbrough said. The district previously planned to give only remote instruction for the first four weeks of the school year, meaning in-person instruction would have begun in mid-September. With the new start date, schools will reopen in early October, district spokeswoman Ofelia Hunter said. Teachers can use the extra time to reach students and prepare remote lessons, Scarbrough said. The district will hold more training sessions on remote instruction for parents. And officials are keeping an eye on COVID-19 cases, he said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Hispanic and nonwhite people in Utah were disproportionately hit by workplace COVID-19 outbreaks, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Monday. From March to early June, 12% of the state’s coronavirus cases were tied to workplace outbreaks, mostly in manufacturing, construction and wholesale trade. The report found that 73% of the cases in these outbreaks were Hispanic or other nonwhite people, even though they only make up 24% of the workers in those industries. The report noted that nonwhite workers typically have less flexible work schedules and fewer telework opportunities compared to white employees. That lack of flexibility along with unpaid sick leave policies might prevent workers from staying home when they’re ill, resulting in more workplace exposures and increased virus spread. These racial disparities in work-related outbreaks in Utah are similar to those seen in meat processing facility outbreaks in other states, according to the report. The CDC report recommended that employers ensure that opportunities for paid sick leave and remote work are offered equitably to non-white workers to avoid potential outbreaks.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Mayor Miro Weinberger has proposed new rules for the city’s bars and for gatherings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus as college students return. Weinberger proposed that bars stop selling alcohol at 10 p.m. and that outside gatherings on residential properties be limited to 25 people. Indoor gatherings would be restricted to 10 people, with families excluded. Weinberger called for a special City Council meeting on Thursday to approve the emergency resolution. Police plan to inform residents in neighborhoods across the University of Vermont of the changes, if approved. Violators could be ticketed or bars could be fined. Weinberger said Tuesday that he hopes the regulations are only needed for a short time. “If virus transmission levels in Burlington remain very low after both the public schools have opened and we’ve gotten through this transition of the colleges reopening and getting into the rhythm of their new testing rhythm, we will happily reevaluate the necessity of their regulations and consider lifting them,” he said. Nearly 12,000 UVM students have decided to return to campus, said UVM President Suresh Garimella. They are being tested before they arrive and upon arrival. He said 8,700 pre-arrival tests were ordered and of the 1,150 results that have come back, two were positive. Since Aug. 7, 955 students have been tested on campus and two of those tested positive.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: More than 80% of coronavirus cases in Virginia’s capital city are among its Black and Latino populations. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Tuesday that the virus runs rampant in close quarters and heavily impacts low-wage workers who lack paid sick leave and adequate workplace protections. Latinos in Richmond have been hit particularly hard. They have nearly three times the number of virus cases than white residents. Latinos make up 7% of the city’s population. Dr. Danny Avula, director of the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts, said a lack of workplace protections fueled the impact. People in the Black and Latino communities were forced to make a choice: stay home and risk being fired, or go to work and potentially get sick.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: State health officials said mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus are being reported in eastern Washington’s Benton and Yakima counties. The Washington Department of Health said seven positive samples have been reported in Washington so far this year. No human cases have yet been reported. In Washington, the West Nile virus season starts as early as July and can last until early October. Officials said it can be a serious, even fatal, illness that can affect people, horses, birds, and other animals. The virus is almost always spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito, which becomes infected after feeding on birds that carry the virus. Health officials urge people to avoid mosquito bites. The majority of people infected with the virus do not get sick. About one in five will develop symptoms that go away without medical treatment. Even fewer, about one in 150 people infected, will have more severe symptoms, officials said. Severe symptoms might include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, paralysis, and coma. People with any of those symptoms should contact their healthcare provider right away.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: About 540 furloughed workers at Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races have been permanently laid off because of the coronavirus pandemic. The employees’ final day was Sunday at the casino, news outlets reported. Casino owner Penn National Gaming of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, said in a statement that although it was hopeful to have employees return, normal operations won’t happen at its properties “for the foreseeable future.” Penn National announced the furloughs of about 26,000 workers nationwide in April. Casino sports bar server Wayne Thomas of Martinsburg said the workers are especially upset that they will not be paid for unused and accrued personal time off. “We can understand all the layoffs,” Thomas said Monday. “We get it. But we earned that PTO.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: With more positive coronavirus cases in Wisconsin linked to parties and other gatherings, state health officials on Wednesday released a new tool that people can use to measure risk levels of different activities. Positive COVID-19 cases tied to mass gatherings grew from 7% of cases in May to 21% in June and 20% in July, the state Department of Health Services said. Overall, nearly 67,500 people have tested positive in Wisconsin, with 1,060 deaths. That death count is the 28th-highest in the country overall and the 37th-highest per capita at 18 deaths per 100,000 people. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has decreased by 209, a decrease of 25%. There were 174 new cases per 100,000 people in Wisconsin over the past two weeks, which ranks 24th in the country for new cases per capita. The tool unveiled Wednesday allows people to answer a series of questions to determine the risk of certain behaviors, like who will be gathering, where will people be getting together and how widespread is COVID-19 in the area. The state health department also released guidelines for school districts to follow in preventing, investigation and controlling COVID-19 outbreaks. The guidelines include instructions for school staff in identifying cases and close contacts among students as well as best practices for isolation and quarantine of infected students and staff.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The University of Wyoming has 42 active cases of coronavirus, as of Tuesday, after the school identified 30 new staff and students with the disease over the weekend. Two of the new cases are students who live in residence halls. University spokesman Chad Baldwin declined to say if the students were athletes, but he said it’s believed that they contracted the virus from within the community or from visitors. Forty-seven members of the UW community have been directed to quarantine because of exposure to a person who tested positive.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/04/26/josh-joust-wing-shortage-helping-canada-news-around-states/115745122/", "title": "Josh joust, wing shortage: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Tourist spending in the state dropped 20% last year at the height of pandemic lockdowns and business closings, but Alabama fared better than most during the coronavirus crisis, state tourism officials said. A statement from the Alabama Tourism Department said a travel consulting firm found a nationwide decline of 42% in travel expenditures, but the state’s decrease wasn’t as bad because spending was robust in Baldwin County, where the beach towns of Gulf Shores and Orange Beach are located. State beaches, historically Alabama’s top tourist draw, were shut down early in the pandemic but reopened as the summer travel season was beginning. “Baldwin County’s success is all the more remarkable when you factor in that the beaches were closed for six weeks in the spring and one week due to a hurricane in the fall,” said Judy Ryals, chair of the board that oversees the agency. Visitors spent more than $13 billion on accommodations, travel, food, shopping and other items in the state in 2020, the department said. Tourism generated more than $18 billion in 2019 before the pandemic affected the state economy.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: The number of coronavirus cases in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta is the lowest it has been since September. In the 14 days through Friday, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation announced 47 new cases, KYUK-AM reports. The number of new cases in the area in the past two weeks is almost 20 times lower than it was during a two-week span between Nov. 22 and Dec. 4, the peak of coronavirus cases in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.Coronavirus cases across the state have decreased since the new year. Vaccines were made available to all residents 16 or older in early March. Last week, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation reported that more than 60% of the region’s eligible population had been vaccinated against COVID-19. As of Friday, about 49% of state residents 16 or older had received at least one dose of vaccine. About 74% of those 65 or older had received at least one dose as of Friday. Roughly 42% of those 16 or older were fully vaccinated as of Friday.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Hundreds of people were expected to receive COVID-19 vaccines at an event geared toward the Asian American community at AZ International Marketplace throughout the weekend. The vaccination clinic was organized by the Arizona Korean Nurses Association and the Arizona Korean Association, in partnership with the Maricopa County Department of Public Health. Sun Jones, who spearheaded the effort by writing letters to Gov. Doug Ducey and Maricopa County to increase vaccine accessibility for the Asian American community, said she’s “so happy” to help serve those who may have struggled with technology or language barriers at other vaccination sites. About 70 volunteers were expected over the two-day period, most at least bilingual, Jones said. There were about 10 different languages represented by the volunteers present Saturday morning, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Laos and Filipino. Location was also a major factor when figuring out how to best reach the Asian American community. “Asian people are more familiar with Asian markets,” Jones said. “It’s easier to come and convenient for them. It’s a more comfortable setting than going to a sterile hall somewhere.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences said it’s holding a mass vaccination clinic at Simmons Bank Arena in North Little Rock next weekend. UAMS said the clinic will be held Saturday, May 1, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. People can make appointments by calling 501-526-2211 or going to vaccinesignup.uams.edu/mobileclinic, but walk-ins are welcome. UAMS will administer one dose of the two-dose Pfizer vaccine at the clinic. Arkansas on Thursday passed the 1 million mark of residents being partially or fully immunized. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 35% percent of the state’s population has received at least one dose of a vaccine. Nearly 699,000 people, or about 23% of the state’s population, have been fully immunized, the CDC said. The state’s coronavirus cases on Friday rose by 236 to 334,458 total since the pandemic began. The state’s COVID-19 deaths increased by five to 5,716, and its hospitalizations decreased by 18 to 153.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCamarillo: A freedom of information organization has sued Ventura County to obtain public records on COVID-19-related deaths and coronavirus outbreaks at workplaces. In a 10-page lawsuit filed Thursday in Ventura County Superior Court, the First Amendment Coalition asked for a court order compelling the county government to release records requested in January and March. The coalition says the records must be disclosed under the California Public Records Act, a long-standing law governing records of public agencies. The San Rafael-based coalition sought data for all nonresidential settings with three or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the request made in January, according to the lawsuit. Included were food and retail stores, gyms, restaurants, bars, government offices, places of worship, health care providers, residential care facilities, education settings and residential care facilities. The request was limited to the 10-month time period from March 1, 2020, through Jan. 5. County officials took almost a month to respond despite a 10-day requirement cited in the law and then said they were refusing to process the request, the coalition said in a news release.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state can resume using the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine now that federal regulators have lifted an 11-day pause on the shot, public health leaders said. “We are happy to have this highly effective, one-dose vaccine back as an option for Coloradans,” Dr. Eric France with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said in a statement, the Denver Post reports. “We appreciate the caution the CDC and FDA took to evaluate the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and are ready to ramp back up distribution as quickly as possible.” The federal government paused use of the J&J shot – also called the Janssen vaccine – after 15 of the nearly 8 million people to receive vaccine developed a highly unusual kind of blood clot. All were women, and most were under age 50. Three died, and seven remain hospitalized. Ultimately, federal health officials decided that the one-dose vaccine is critical to fight the pandemic and that warnings about the small risk of clots could be issued to help younger women weigh which brand of vaccine they should use. The shot will be resumed in Colorado with an updated warning from the Food and Drug Administration. France said vaccine providers and recipients should review the updated vaccine fact sheets.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDanbury: Just under 40% of the inmates inside the federal prison complex in the city have refused the COVID-19 vaccine, according to federal officials. The Connecticut U.S. Attorney’s Office disclosed the latest vaccination numbers in a court filing Friday as part of a class-action lawsuit over an alleged failure to protect prisoners from the coronavirus inside the institution. There are currently 756 inmates at the Federal Correctional Institution Danbury, according to federal Bureau of Prisons website. Since the prison first began offering the vaccine to inmates in January, 296 have refused to take it, according to the filing from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. There are 327 inmates in the prison who have been fully inoculated and another 177 who have received their first dose, according to the filing. The new numbers come as prisoner advocates call on the government to do a better job educating inmates in the federal system about the benefits of vaccination. The U.S. Attorney’s Office points out in its filing that there have been no positive tests for the coronavirus in the general population at FCI Danbury since February. U.S. District Judge Michael Shea last year ordered the prison’s administration to identify those with high-risk health conditions for possible transfer to home confinement or compassionate release.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state Division of Public Health offered drive-up vaccinations with no appointment or preregistration necessary at the Dover International Speedway on Saturday. The event marked the first time residents did not need an appointment to receive a COVID-19 inoculation in the state. The demand to receive a vaccine in Delaware has slightly decreased, and about half of the state’s eligible population has received at least one dose. Eligibility was open to any resident 18 or older who lives, works, receives health care or goes to college in Delaware. The vaccination effort ran from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and offered the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. It was the second to last weekend that the speedway vaccination event will run before NASCAR returns on May 14.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Smithsonian announced Friday that it will be reopening seven of its museums and the National Zoo on a rolling basis throughout the month of May, WUSA-TV reports. Several of the museums had attempted to reopen last fall after shuttering in March, only to shut down again Nov. 23 due to the increase of COVID-19 cases nationwide. While the museums and zoo remain free, all Smithsonian institutions reopening will require timed-entry passes to monitor capacity limits and to help with social distancing. Viewing of the zoo’s newest panda cub, Xiao Qi Ji, will be limited for social distancing purposes and will require a separate, free timed-entry pass. Face coverings will be required for all visitors 2 and older at the Smithsonian facilities. Museum cafes will not be open, though restaurants and food trucks at the National Zoo will be available.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A family accused of selling a toxic industrial bleach as a coronavirus cure through their church has been indicted on federal charges. A federal grand jury in Miami returned an indictment Thursday charging Mark Grenon, 62, and his sons, Jonathan, 34, Jordan, 26, and Joseph, 32, with one count each of conspiracy to commit fraud and two counts each of criminal contempt, according to court records. They face possible life sentences if convicted. Mark Grenon is the archbishop of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing, based in Bradenton, Florida. The church sells chlorine dioxide as a “Miracle Mineral Solution,” officials said. The Grenons claim the solution can cure a vast variety of illnesses, including cancer, autism, malaria and COVID-19. A Miami federal judge last April ordered the church to stop selling the substance, but the order was ignored. When ingested, the solution sold by the Grenons becomes a bleach that is typically used for such things as treating textiles, industrial water, pulp and paper, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Authorities said ingesting these products is the same as drinking bleach and can be fatal.\n\nGeorgia\n\nVidalia: The Vidalia Onion Festival made a comeback over the weekend after the coronavirus forced its cancellation in 2020. Thousands typically attend the southeast Georgia celebration honoring the state’s famous sweet onion crop. “We’re just excited that we’re doing something,” Alexa Britton, one of the festival organizers, told WTOC-TV. “The community’s excited that we’re doing something.” The 2021 festival schedule included a concert by country singer Rodney Atkins, a fireworks display, a Vidalia onion recipe competition and the festival’s storied Vidalia onion eating contest. Organizers said attendees were encouraged, but not required, to wear masks. Extra handwashing and hand-sanitizing stations were set up throughout the festival.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The city has committed to a new climate change plan to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2025 compared to levels present in 2015. Matthew Gonser, the executive director of the Honolulu Office of Climate Change, Sustainability and Resiliency, said Thursday that the city’s carbon pollution had increased every year since 2017. “That’s why we need to really look at this plan of action, find the ways that we can immediately take action and drive those emissions down over time,” Gonser said. The Climate Action Plan is one tool the city is using to achieve its commitment to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2045. As part of the plan, the city will fully transition its vehicle fleet to electric or clean energy by 2035, including its 550 buses. Honolulu has three electric buses and expects to add about 14 more by the end of the year. The city also committed to exploring whether to install more protected bicycle lanes and electric vehicle charging stations. Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi supported the plan and emphasized the need for action, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. “Plans are one thing; it’s how you react and what you do in the days and weeks ahead,” he said. “None of us have an ability to predict the future. We just know the inevitability of the impact on climate change.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers on a state House panel introduced legislation Friday to allow the Legislature to go into recess without fully shutting down so that it can come back into session to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and other issues. The measure would allow Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke and Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder to reconvene the Legislature no later than Sept. 1. If the Legislature officially adjourned, only Republican Gov. Brad Little could call them back. Lawmakers are reluctant to put themselves in that position, arguing much of their role in government was usurped by Little last year during the early stages of the pandemic, when he declared an emergency and issued executive and health orders. The legislation came on day 103 of the legislative session, the third-longest in the state’s history, as lawmakers struggle in the endgame to wrap up the session but avoid being left on the sideline the rest of the year. “This is potentially a ticket out of here,” Republican House Majority Caucus Chair Megan Blanksma told the committee in introducing the measure. The legislation allows the recess without paying lawmakers up to $139 in daily expenses even though the Legislature would technically remain in session, saving the state money.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state House passed a bill Friday that would make COVID-19-related expansions to telehealth services permanent through state statute. The legislation introduced by Rep. Deb Conroy, D-Villa Park, aims to reduce barriers in access to virtual and telehealth services and would bring standards for virtual care in line with physical health services. Conroy said access to telehealth, which became a necessity for many Illinoisans at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, would bring lasting benefits in managing chronic health conditions. “Over the last year, we’ve seen firsthand evidence that telehealth preserves quality and safety, meets individual patient needs, decreases health care disparities, and protects public health,” Conroy said Friday. Additionally, Conroy said telehealth legislation passed by the state and federal government last year has allowed health care providers to “make significant, rapid investment in telehealth technology.” The bill – supported by a coalition of more than 35 health care providers, institutions and advocacy groups from around the state – prohibits geographic or facility restrictions on telehealth services and allows patients to be treated via telehealth in their home. It also protects patients from being charged additional fees by insurance providers for accessing telehealth services.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The number of counties seeing medium to high community spread of COVID-19 has risen from one to seven in a single week, and several of those are adjacent to Michigan, which has been experiencing the nation’s highest coronavirus case rate. Elkhart, LaPorte and Steuben counties, which share a border with Michigan, and Porter County, which sits across Lake Michigan from southwestern Michigan, are now in Indiana’s orange category, the state’s COVID-19 dashboard showed as of Wednesday. Benton, Jasper and Whitley counties are also in the orange category, which is Indiana’s second-riskiest rating for community spread, after the red category, in its color-coded count map. All seven of the orange category counties are in northern Indiana. Those seven are up from a single Indiana county, LaPorte County, rated in the category indicating medium to high community spread of COVID-19 during the week of April 12. Under Indiana’s COVID-19 risk criteria, when counties enter the orange category, the state health commissioner will work with local health and elected officials and take other steps intended to curtail the coronavirus spread, such as adding restrictions on social gatherings.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state has asked the federal government to withhold more than one-quarter of its allotment of COVID-19 vaccines this week because demand has waned. The Iowa Department of Public Health said Saturday that the state declined to accept 18,300 of 34,300 doses of Moderna vaccine it was slated to receive this week and 3,510 of 46,800 doses of Pfizer vaccine. “Along with several other states, we are seeing a slowdown of vaccine administration, but we are working with our local partners and community leaders to determine where additional education is needed and to gain an understanding of the needs of each county’s unique population,” said Sarah Ekstrand, a spokeswoman for the state health department. Gov. Kim Reynolds said Wednesday that 43 of the state’s 99 counties had declined all or part of their weekly vaccine allocations for the week of April 26. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said nearly 55% of Iowa adults have received at least one dose of a vaccine, and more than 40% have been fully vaccinated against the disease. The state allotment of vaccines doesn’t include thousands of doses that are being distributed directly through a number of pharmacies and clinics in Iowa as part of a federal program.\n\nKansas\n\nOlathe: Elected officials in the state’s largest county are considering whether to get rid of a mask mandate, as a growing number of communities have done in recent weeks, and health officials aren’t opposing the move. The issue goes before the Johnson County commission Thursday, one day before the current mask order is set to expire, WDAF-TV reports. “As long as it is very clear to everyone that we have not achieved herd immunity and that we have a lot of work to do and that wearing masks continue to be important, we’ll be supportive of moving to strongly recommend masks,” said Dr. Sanmi Areola, the Director of the Johnson County Health Department. “There’s a lot of variables here that we can’t fully predict. And I think the prudent thing to do is for the board to be ready to take actions if and when they become necessary.” The county’s current order includes a goal of vaccinating about 50% of its residents who are 16 and older with at least one dose before lifting the mask mandate. That number stood at 45%, Areola said. Other counties that have ditched or weakened mask orders in recent weeks include Sedgwick County in the Wichita area and Shawnee County in the Topeka area.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky State Fair will be open to the public this year, officials have decided. The Kentucky State Fair Board voted Thursday to hold the event Aug. 19-29, according to a statement from Kentucky Venues. Tickets will go on sale in July. Last year, the event was closed to the public due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some events were held, but only participants were allowed to attend. “The Kentucky State Fair is an important event for thousands of people around the Commonwealth and the economic activity created by the Fair will help Kentucky’s recovery,” Kentucky Venues President and CEO David S. Beck said in a statement. “While we will need to make adjustments to respond to COVID-19, we plan to produce as much of the Fair as safely possible.” Officials were beginning to plan and said specific information would be announced later. The annual event at the fairgrounds in Louisville features shows, exhibits and other entertainment.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Next month the city’s bus system will begin collecting fares for the first time in more than a year. The Capital Area Transit System said Thursday that drivers will resume requiring fares May 16. The system began waiving fares in April 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fare to ride a CATS bus is $1.75 per trip for most customers. CATS said it will continue using barriers, among other precautions, in its buses to protect drivers and riders from the coronavirus, news outlets report. “We take the health and safety of both our operators and the community seriously,” CATS CEO Bill Deville said. “We have waited to resume fare collection until we felt we could safely do so.” Officials say many other municipal transportation systems around the country waived fares to help passengers at the onset of the pandemic. Most agencies have been able to implement safeguards to resume collection, officials say. “While passenger fares do not comprise a large portion of our operating budget, we are also obligated to be fiscally responsible while we continue to connect customers to jobs and their community,” Deville said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials are urging more precaution in schools due to rising numbers of coronavirus cases in some parts of the state. The administration of Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has been using a color-coded system to identify the level of risk of transmission of the virus at schools. Every county had been listed as “green,” the lowest-risk category, but the administration said Friday that it is adding Androscoggin, Kennebec, Oxford and Somerset counties to the moderate “yellow” category. The governor’s office also said Franklin and York counties are being monitored closely because of rising positivity rates. “Androscoggin has experienced a sharp rise in cases over the last two weeks, with a new case rate more than double the statewide average. Kennebec, Oxford and Somerset counties all have new case rates that exceed the state average, and both Oxford and Somerset counties have two-week positivity rates that exceed the state average,” the Maine Department of Education said in a statement. School districts in the “yellow” counties are advised to consider additional coronavirus precautions and hybrid instruction modes to reduce the number of people in classrooms at once, the education department has said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s public higher education system will require that students, faculty and staff returning to campuses in the fall be vaccinated against COVID-19. University System of Maryland Chancellor Jay Perman announced the decision in a statement Friday. The system will allow appropriate exemptions for medical or religious reasons, the statement said. “If we examine the data – and there is an extraordinary accumulation of data – we see that the risk of vaccines is very low, whereas the risk of COVID is very high. And that risk is increasingly falling on young people,” Perman said. Across the country, colleges have been divided on the issue. Some private universities have recently told students they must get vaccinated, but other schools are leaving the decision to students. The Maryland system said it would also continue with other mitigation strategies like pre-arrival coronavirus testing, surveillance testing and public health interventions like masking. The system includes 12 universities and three regional higher education centers serving about 135,000 undergraduate and about 41,000 graduate students, according to its website.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state was one of several to receive a shout-out from the White House for its efforts to vaccinate as much of the adult population as possible. White House coronavirus adviser Andy Slavitt tweeted Friday that eight states have now vaccinated more than 60% of adults with a first shot, with neighboring Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont also making the list, along with Maine. “All of them have turned the corner on the number of cases & hospitalizations. Well done. Let’s all get there,” Slavitt tweeted. More than 3.2 million Massachusetts residents have received first doses, and about 2.2 million people have been fully immunized. Meanwhile, Lt. Gov. Karyn Spilka has received her first COVID-19 shot. The Republican got inoculated Friday at Worcester State University. Spilka, 54, became eligible after the state opened up vaccine eligibility last Monday to anyone 16 or over. Gov. Charlie Baker, 64, received his first dose earlier this month after the state opened eligibility to residents 55 and older. Baker has set a target of immunizing 4.1 million residents by the Fourth of July. He has also hinted that changes could be coming later this month to some of the state’s mandates, although he said now isn’t the time for people to let their guard down.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The University of Michigan will require COVID-19 shots for students who live on its Ann Arbor campus this fall, school officials announced Friday. President Mark Schlissel said vaccinations will not be mandated for faculty, staff and other students “at this time,” but he strongly encouraged everyone to get inoculated. The requirement will allow residence halls to operate safely at nearly normal capacity, he said, after there were more than 600 infections in dorms last fall despite a mask requirement and other restrictions. In the weeks ahead, the university will start to excuse vaccinated students from mandatory coronavirus testing. Those who are fully vaccinated will not have to self-quarantine after being exposed to someone with the virus, as long as those vaccinated students don’t have symptoms. About 9,700, or 31%, of undergraduate students typically live on campus, as do 2,400 graduate students. “In order for a campus to fully recover from the effects of the pandemic, we need everyone who can be to be vaccinated,” Schlissel said in a Zoom update to the campus community, adding that officials were considering several unspecified vaccination incentives. Students must provide proof of their vaccination or an approved exemption by mid-July.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Coronavirus case rates are rising across the state, affecting younger people, especially middle and high school students. State health officials said Thursday that the number of school-related COVID-19 cases reported last week among students had exceeded the peak seen during a surge of cases in November. “The last month-plus has been very worrisome – especially among younger Minnesotans,” Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm said Thursday. Still, Minnesota Public Radio reports, officials are not planning to issue sweeping recommendations or orders for schools to switch students to distance learning. Instead, they’re ramping up testing opportunities to make it easier for students to get weekly or biweekly coronavirus tests. Changes to Minnesota’s Safe Learning Plan – which governs how schools operate throughout the pandemic – mean that, despite record COVID-19 spread among students, more than 90% of schools are still offering some form of in-person learning. The majority of Minnesota school staff have now had the opportunity to be vaccinated, but the teachers union Education Minnesota reported Thursday that six school staffers have now died of COVID-19 infections linked to schools, including three since February.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: As vaccine demand declines, state officials have asked the federal government to ship vials in smaller packages so they don’t go to waste. Small-town pharmacist Robin Jackson has been practically begging anyone in the community of Verona to show up and get shots after she received her first shipment of vaccine earlier this month and demand was weak, despite placing yard signs outside her storefront celebrating the shipment’s arrival. She was wasting more vaccine than she was giving out and started coaxing family members into the pharmacy for shots. “Nobody was coming,” she said. “And I mean no one.” Barbara Gennaro, a stay-at-home mother of two small children in Yazoo City, said everybody in her homeschooling community is against getting the vaccine. Gennaro said she generally avoids vaccinations for her family in general, and the COVID-19 vaccine is no different. “All of the strong Christians that I associate with are against it,” she said. “Fear is what drives people to get the vaccine – plain and simple. The stronger someone’s trust is in the Lord, the least likely they are to want the vaccine or feel that it’s necessary.”\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: About 1,500 University of Missouri graduates who didn’t get the chance to walk across the stage last year because of the pandemic were expected to return to campus over the weekend for a long-delayed celebration. The Columbia Missourian reports Annie Adrian was bringing her 7-week-old son, Nico, with her, along with her parents and two sisters, to mark the milestone. “I took the idea of walking for granted once the pandemic began,” said Adrian, who majored in hospitality management. “It will be even more special now because my son will get to see me graduate. It was a huge motivation for coming back.” Graduates were able to get up to six tickets for family and friends to gather in “pods” at a social distance from each other, with mandatory masks, in Mizzou Arena and the Hearnes Center. Mawa Iqbal, a December graduate, returned from Dayton, Ohio. Iqbal, who majored in convergence journalism, is a first-generation college graduate and the daughter of immigrants from Pakistan. “I think my parents are more excited than I am,” she said. “This is a huge deal for my family.” Commencement ceremonies for 2021 graduates are planned for the first two weekends in May.\n\nMontana\n\nBrowning: With a surplus of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the Blackfeet Nation last week began offering COVID-19 shots to members of the Blackfoot Confederacy in Canada and residents of Cardston, Alberta. James McNeely, the tribe’s public information officer, estimated it has vaccinated about 98% of adult reservation residents. He said the tribe’s ability to offer the vaccine to fellow members of the confederacy made him emotional. “Many of the folks cried today when they were able to get vaccinated,” he said in a statement. “We see it as an opportunity to help those in need, and that’s how First Nations people are on both sides of the border: generous and kind.” The Blackfeet Nation on Tuesday and Wednesday set up a mobile vaccination site at the Peigan-Carway Medicine Line crossing for people ages 16 and older. They administered 400 vaccine doses over the course of two days, according to a news release. The Blackfeet Nation will hold another mobile vaccination clinic Wednesday and Thursday at the Peigan-Carway Border Crossing.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A fight over the name Josh drew a crowd from around the country to a local park Saturday for a heated pool-noodle brawl. It all started a year ago when pandemic boredom set in, and Josh Swain, a 22-year-old college student from Tucson, Arizona, messaged others who shared his name on social media and challenged them to a duel. Hundreds showed up at Air Park in Lincoln – a location chosen at random – to participate in the silliness. The festivities started with a “grueling and righteous battle of Rock, Paper, Scissors” between the Josh Swain from Arizona and another Josh Swain from Omaha. KLKN-TV reports the Arizona student won that competition, allowing him to claim the title of “the true Josh Swain.” The pool-noodle competition that followed was open to anyone with the first name Josh. The victor of that competition was a 5-year-old, who was coronated with a Burger King crown. Swain, the organizer, said he is a little surprised about how the whole thing blew up. “I did not expect people to be as adamant about this as they are right now,” he said.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The number of fentanyl-related deaths more than doubled in Washoe County in 2020, in part due to pandemic-related stress. Washoe County Chief Medical Examiner Laura Knight said stress and easier access to the opioid contributed to the spike, from 25 deaths in 2019 to 56 in 2020. So far this year, nine fentanyl-related deaths, all in January, have been confirmed. Knight said pending cases are awaiting toxicology reports. “It doesn’t appear to me that the trend is slowing down, unfortunately,” she said. Clark County has also seen an increase in fentanyl-related deaths, according to a press statement released last summer. The home of Las Vegas reported 63 fentanyl-related deaths from January to July of 2020, a 125% increase from the fentanyl-related deaths in the same time period in 2019, according to the press statement. Knight said people used the drug as a coping mechanism for stressors such as changes in employment and income, housing and health concerns stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Fentanyl also contributed to relapses for those recovering from drug and alcohol addiction, she said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Courts will be gradually expanding in-person operations to the public, starting with the state Supreme Court, which is allowing the public to its clerk’s office and law library as of Tuesday. In-person oral arguments at the court will resume May 5. At the superior court, in-person hearings will be expanded to include suppression; contested pleas, sentencings and violations of probation; drug court termination hearings; contested civil hearings; and bench trials. The circuit court will resume in-person final hearings in domestic violence or stalking cases and in adjudicatory hearings in abuse and neglect cases. The superior and circuit courts will stay open for parties of scheduled hearings, those reporting for jury service, emergency relief, landlord and tenant cases. Court officials said by developing a COVID-19 jury trial protocol, switching to video and telephonic hearings, and equipping staff for remote operations, the superior court was able to avoid a case processing backlog. More than 44,170 hearings were conducted in 11 superior courts during the pandemic, and 24 jury trials have been held since August 2020. All superior courts are now conducting jury trials.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Demand for COVID-19 vaccines appears to be waning, prompting Gov. Phil Murphy to shift the state’s focus to outreach so that enough residents are inoculated to ensure a return to near-normalcy by early summer. The number of vaccinations began to drop last week for the first time since the rollout began in December – a development Murphy said was “the beginning of a phase where we need to be proactive” to get people protected. Almost 2.6 million New Jerseyans are fully vaccinated, about halfway toward the goal of 4.7 million, or 70% of the state’s adult population. That goal is considered key to controlling the coronavirus by reducing the number of people susceptible to it so that it gradually fades away. The decline in daily vaccinations administered is a reversal after months of demand outstripping supply. For the first few months of the year, New Jerseyans spent days on websites trying to book appointments, while some traveled across the state to get a coveted shot. But last week saw thousands of appointments available across the state that likely went unfilled, especially in South Jersey. Same-day appointments were easy to get even in busy North Jersey. “We’re going to need to be much more offensive to get the rest of the 4.7 million across the goal line,” Murphy said Wednesday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: At least half of the state’s K-12 students ventured into a classroom for at least one day last week, as COVID-19 shots become easier to get for people 16 and older, state officials said. About 160,500 students were recorded as attending school in person, or about half of New Mexico’s total K-12 enrollment, according to state data made public Wednesday. With only 80% of districts and charters reporting, the true number was likely higher. State education officials asked school districts and charters to reopen to full-time, in-person learning April 5. A small number have not reopened due to tribal health orders. “As expected, New Mexico is now offering in-person instruction to every student who wants it in all but a handful of cases,” Education Secretary Ryan Stewart said Thursday. “New Mexico has 840 individual schools, and only 17 have had to return temporarily to remote instruction.” Stewart called it a good sign that safety protocols are working as intended and that in-person learning can proceed with only minimal and temporary disruptions. In addition, New Mexico has lifted pandemic-based restrictions on attendance at houses of worship in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision that prevents states from enforcing capacity limits on churches that are more restrictive than those on other entities.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Appointments are no longer mandatory at any of the COVID-19 vaccination sites run by the city, including its newest and maybe coolest location: beneath the giant blue whale at the Museum of Natural History. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday that the city will now accept walk-ins at all its clinics. “You can just walk up and get vaccinated,” he said. That includes at the museum’s Milstein Hall of Ocean Life, dominated by a 94-foot-long model of a blue whale that appears to float through the air. Inoculations in the hall began Friday. The whale now sports a bandage on one of its fins, like the ones health care workers are sticking on people’s arms after they get a shot. The expansion of walk-in service comes as supplies of the vaccine have increased. Just weeks ago, most people trying to get an appointment for a vaccination in the nation’s biggest city had to game online appointment systems in which scarce slots would be snapped up in moments. But in recent days, tens of thousands of appointments have been available at any given moment, though arranging them still requires planning and a degree of computer savvy. A week ago the city began offering walk-up vaccinations to everyone age 50 and over. De Blasio said it went well enough that the city is now doing the same for people of all ages.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A shortage of chicken wings is proving a strange new pandemic complication. If things get worse, Rich Cundiff joked, he’ll have to start listing wings on the menu at his Rocky’s Hot Chicken Shack restaurants at “market price.” The price of chicken in general has been unstable, but cost on wings spiked 56% last quarter, he said. Chicken wing prices often rise and fall with the rhythm of sports events, reaching their zenith around the Super Bowl. This year, however, wing costs did not recede. “It’s not just chicken wings – it’s a lot of things, to be honest,” said Cody Stokes, a sales consultant with Sysco, a major food service distribution company. Demand is putting pressure on beef, with meat plants still struggling to catch up, he said. Processing plants have labor issues like seemingly everyone else, putting a strain on everything from ribs to bacon. “So much comes down to labor issues in the supply chain,” Stokes said. The current – and very likely temporary – wing shortage is also based in part on pent-up demand, with people going back to bars and staying out later. Wings, like pizza, also travel well for takeout, Stokes said. And backyard barbecues are back in full force. All that has driven up demand for chicken wings by 20%-30%, even as production dropped 20%-30%, Stokes estimated.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s universities have required students to get certain vaccines, but the COVID-19 shot will not be one of them. Jerry Rostad, vice chancellor for the North Dakota University System, said officials are doing everything they can to encourage students and staff to get inoculated but won’t mandate it. He said any change to that plan would be based on action by the state Health Department or the Legislature, not from the university system. The currently available vaccines are only approved for emergency use, Rostad noted. Cara Helgren, vice president of student affairs at University of North Dakota, said UND has been following the same path. “While we have not required the COVID vaccine at this point, we are certainly making COVID-19 testing available and educating on what we know works,” she said. But the school has begun providing the vaccine for students who want it. Dickinson State University has taken a different approach, allowing students to be exempt from the school’s mask mandate two weeks after their final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Debra Haman, director of health and counselling for Minot State University, said the campus has held vaccination clinics on campus but does not plan to require the shots for students or staff.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine variant is underway at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical, and researchers are seeking adult participants. The trial is for a Moderna booster that is expected to guard against the B.1.135 coronavirus variant, which was originally identified in South Africa. The B.1.351 strain and others can spread more easily, dodge some treatments and immunities, or both, leaving them a threat even as more Americans get vaccinated. “While it appears the variant is more easily passed from one person to another, and the variant has a higher rate of infection, currently there is no evidence that this variant has any impact on disease severity,” said Dr. Robert Frenck, director of the Cincinnati Children’s Gamble Vaccine Research Center. “So, while more people may get mild illness, the variant does not seem to cause a higher percentage of infected people to be hospitalized or die from the virus.” The trial needs 30 to 50 adult participants who have not been infected with the virus or received any COVID-19 vaccine. An online screening form is available on the Cincinnati Children’s site. Volunteers will be compensated up to $950 for their time.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: At least one person in the state has died due to COVID-19 after receiving a vaccine, deputy state epidemiologist Jolianne Stone said Friday. “We are still doing an investigation on that particular case,” and no other information was immediately available, Stone said. More than 2.5 million vaccinations have been administered in Oklahoma, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Stone said 137 Oklahomans have contracted the coronavirus after being vaccinated, and nine have been hospitalized. The rolling average of new coronavirus cases in Oklahoma each day has declined by 59.3% during the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University on Saturday. The data showed the daily average decreased by 351.3, from 592.3 on April 8 to 241 on Thursday. There have been 95 new cases per 100,000 people during the past two weeks in Oklahoma, which ranks 48th in the nation for new cases per capita. The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported 202 people hospitalized with the virus Friday. The health department, which no longer provides daily case counts and death tolls, on Friday reported 446,550 total cases since the pandemic began and 8,206 deaths based on data provided to the CDC.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: As coronavirus cases continue to surge, officials warned Friday that one-third of the state’s counties are at risk of increased restrictions – again – including limiting restaurants to outdoor dining and closing gyms. “A few weeks ago, I came before you to say we are concerned that we would have a fourth surge of COVID-19 in Oregon. Unfortunately today that surge is here,” Gov. Kate Brown said at a news conference. “Right now, in the race between vaccines and variants, the variants are gaining ground and have the upper hand.” Brown, who anticipates being able to lift most pandemic restrictions and reopen the economy by the end of June if people continue to follow safety measures and get vaccinated, said Oregon is critically close to being overwhelmed. Dean Sidelinger, the state health officer, said new modeling shows that “the rate of transmission surpassed the most pessimistic scenario of three weeks ago.” He said that “if that spread continues unabated, our hospitals risk being swamped.” In early March, the state’s coronavirus positivity rate was 3.9%. It was 5.7% Thursday. In addition, COVID-19 hospitalizations have increased by 39% over the past week and 109% since the beginning of March. As a result, a couple of hospitals are already starting to scale back on elective surgeries.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Republican lawmakers must do more to encourage conservative voters in the state to get vaccinated, according to members of the Committee to Protect Medicare, a national political action group formed in 2016 by health care workers. “On every shift, I meet patients who think the pandemic is a hoax,” said Dr. Max Cooper, an emergency room physician and co-leader of the Committee to Protect Medicare Pennsylvania. “Patients say that the vaccine could give them COVID-19, and they say that they got this information from people who they trust.” Pennsylvania is already showing signs of slowing demand for the COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Tom Wolf said Wednesday at a community pharmacy in Dauphin County. “People must recognize this is not just about them,” Wolf said. “You’re doing this as an act of compassion. You’re doing something that’s going to help people around you.” Dr. Meaghan Reid, also co-leader of the state committee, pointed to specific remarks by some conservative leaders on vaccines. “State Rep. Russ Diamond has stated that he won’t get vaccinated, even going so far on social media as to falsely refer to vaccines as poison,” Reid said. Diamond has posted that people aren’t getting vaccinated because they have no faith in state government “fear porn.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nNorth Smithfield: A man has been accused of assaulting a worker at a Walmart store in the town over an apparent dispute about a mask. WJAR-TV reports North Smithfield police said the man got into a confrontation with the worker, who is under 18, on Tuesday. Police said the worker asked the man to put a mask on his toddler, then walked away saying he was going to get a manager. The man grabbed the employee, put him in a chokehold and punched him, according to police. The worker had a bruise but didn’t seek medical treatment. Police said they contacted Michael Caro, 34, of Woonsocket after receiving a tip. Caro turned himself in, was charged with simple assault and battery and disorderly conduct, and was released with a court summons.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: State public health officials are reiterating their commitment to getting to herd immunity, or about 70% to 80% of the population vaccinated. The state is lagging national vaccination rates, with about 40% of South Carolina residents 16 and up partly vaccinated and about 28% fully vaccinated, according to data from the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. More than 52% of the nation’s residents over age 18 have started the vaccine process, and 35% have finished, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Getting vaccinated carries a lot of benefits, said Dr. Brannon Traxler, South Carolina’s director of public health. “If you want to go to a friend’s place, and both of you are vaccinated, you don’t need to worry as much about masking and distance,” she said. In a moderate shift, Traxler said wastage of doses has become less concerning than getting more people to get doses. During the early days of vaccinations, state officials urged a zero-waste policy, which meant that the vials, once opened, needed to be given out completely even if it required significant steps to find willing recipients on short notice. Traxler said wastage is still a concern, but the state has likely crossed the threshold from supply to demand being the biggest problem.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A local man has undergone a double lung transplant after suffering complications from COVID-19. Nathan Foote, 42, suffered severe pneumonia after contracting the disease in October and underwent severe scarring in his lungs. Doctors said he needed to get a double transplant, or he would likely die in hospice care. He was placed on the transplant list in February at the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis. He was offered two potential matches, but both fell through because of changes in the donors’ health. He finally underwent the procedure April 10 – a surgery that lasted eight hours. A few days later, he took his first breath on his own in six months. Foote said he’s still in pain, and he’s still eating through a feeding tube. He’s also trying to teach himself how to walk again. “I didn’t think I’d ever make it this far,” he said. “I did my part even when they told me I was going to die because I didn’t believe that.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The concert industry has weathered a variety of storms in the past, but all bets were off when the pandemic brought in-person gatherings to a halt, seemingly overnight. More than a year later, as a return to normalcy looms on the horizon, the city – country music, in particular – is leading the way. The floodgates began to open earlier this month when Eric Church, Kane Brown, Thomas Rhett, Brothers Osborne, Chris Stapleton and others out of Nashville confirmed tour dates for late summer and fall 2021. “Everybody’s working so hard to get the right plan together,” Rhett said. A return to touring signals confidence in artists, promoters and venue owners to host mass gatherings as soon as July. Likewise, city leaders announced last week that Brad Paisley will headline a downtown Fourth of July concert – a night described by officials as the city’s “first major post-pandemic event.” The reasons Music City is in the driver’s seat for the return of major concerts and tours have been baked into the country music market for decades. As rules for in-person gatherings continue to vary state-by-state, it remains difficult for pop artists to plan, for example, a six-week tour across the U.S. with the occasional day off. In the country world, however, it’s long been common practice for tours to be a long series of weekend runs.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: More than 1.7 million COVID-19 vaccine doses are headed the state’s way this week, health officials said Friday. The Texas Department of State Health Services said 708,460 first doses of the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been allocated to 928 providers in 129 counties, while 570,520 second doses also have been ordered. An estimated 470,000 first and second doses were allocated to pharmacies, federally qualified health centers and dialysis centers. Also, with the federal pause on the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine now lifted, the state has told providers they can resume giving that vaccine. So far, more than 23.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been distributed to Texas, and more than 36% of the state’s population has received at least one dose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 24% of the population has been fully immunized. New Texas COVID-19 cases were reported at below-average levels Friday, but new deaths were above the seven-day rolling average computed by Johns Hopkins University researchers. State health officials reported 3,306 new cases and 69 deaths, compared with averages of 3,403 new cases and 54 deaths per day.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is encouraging missionaries across the globe to be vaccinated against COVID-19 but is not requiring it. The faith’s Missionary Department made the latest appeal Friday, asking full-time proselytizers to “safeguard themselves and others,” the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The release reaffirmed the faith’s policy that people can make their own decisions on vaccinations but said those who choose not to be immunized will be assigned to a mission in their home country. Young U.S. missionaries planning to travel outside the country on or after Aug. 1 should be vaccinated before they leave, the release said. Older senior missionaries may go after they have been vaccinated. In January, the faith released a statement encouraging members, employees and missionaries to be “good global citizens” by getting inoculated. Latter-day Saint Charities, the faith’s humanitarian arm, also donated $20 million to UNICEF this year for a worldwide COVID-19 vaccination push.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont Brewers Festival has been sidelined for second year in a row because of COVID-19 restrictions. “Our brewers have been working hard to keep their businesses going through this pandemic and we want to give them the time and space to focus on their brewery this summer,” the Vermont Brewers Association announced this month on social media. “Based on a myriad of factors, we have decided it is best not to host our festival in July 2021.” Planning for the festival that draws a sold-out crowd to the Burlington waterfront traditionally starts in early January. Since the state only recently outlined a phased reopening plan with a goal of being largely back to normal by July 4, organizers did not have enough time to plan the event. The Vermont Brewers Association recommends that beer fans visit taprooms to have a beer or take it home, calling that “the best way you can support the brewing industry right now.” Vermont reported 96 new confirmed COVID-19 cases Sunday for a statewide total since the pandemic began of more than 22,500. A total of 23 people were hospitalized with five in intensive care. With no new deaths reported Sunday, the state’s total stands at 244.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: Longtime residents of the Southern Towers apartment complex – many of whom have had to rely on a federal moratorium on evictions during the pandemic – fear they will be squeezed out when the government mandate ends, in large part to make room for high-earning tenants who will be working at Amazon’s second headquarters in nearby Crystal City. Southern Towers tenants, composed mostly of African immigrants, see warning signs all around: Los Angeles-based CIM Group bought the complex of five 16-story buildings last year for half a billion dollars, at a time when investors and speculators are clamoring to get in on the region’s housing market as construction on the headquarters gets underway. A study by management consulting firm Radish LLC on behalf of African Communities Together, a community activist group that is lending support to Southern Towers tenants, found that CIM initiated 262 eviction cases – about 10% of all units at Southern Towers – since it took over the property. In a statement, CIM said it has no plans to turn the towers into luxury housing for Amazon employees and has worked hard to accommodate tenants facing eviction, including helping them obtain more than $1 million in rental assistance. The company said it currently has only 35 unresolved eviction cases.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan’s office says the city and its partners will have more than 52,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine to administer this week in the largest single-week allocation received to date. The city expects this level of supply to continue or increase, and if public demand continues, Seattle could vaccinate 70% of its residents and workers by the end of May, the mayor’s office said in a news release Friday. “After constant advocacy, I’m thrilled that Seattle is starting to receive an allocation to actually vaccinate our communities at scale,” Durkan said. Everyone age 16 or older in King County who hasn’t received a COVID-19 shot should sign up for the city’s vaccination appointment notification list, the news release said. People can call 206-684-2489 for help joining the list. Once signed up, people will receive an email when vaccination appointments become available at four city-affiliated sites in North Seattle, Rainier Beach, West Seattle and the Lumen Field Event Center. People 60 and older can be vaccinated without an appointment at the Rainier Beach and West Seattle locations.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said Friday that the state is planning a “real aggressive program” to revive its sluggish vaccination campaign. “We have hit a wall,” the Republican governor said. Federal data shows about 39% of the population has received at least one dose, and just over 31% is fully vaccinated. Officials said they will target people who either are reluctant to get a shot or haven’t found a convenient enough chance yet. In Charleston, the state will partner with local businesses downtown to make vaccines available to all employees and customers, said James Hoyer, a retired major general leading the state’s coronavirus task force. Justice said more steps would be announced in the coming days to try to turn around a vaccination drive that briefly led the nation early in the year. He said that will include outreach to people who are “stubborn or fearful” about being vaccinated. Justice also said the state has asked the federal government to deliver future vaccine doses in smaller vials, in reaction to demand slipping and an attempt to avoid wasted doses once the vials are opened. Last week, he said the statewide mask mandate may stay in place until 70% of eligible residents are vaccinated. Among residents 65 and over, more than 77% have received at least one dose, Justice said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers on Friday vetoed Republican-backed bills that would have prevented health officials from mandating COVID-19 vaccines and allowed churches to be closed during the pandemic. Evers said in his veto messages that he objected to the bills because they limited his ability to respond to the pandemic. The action has little immediate effect. There is no state order limiting how many people can gather in churches or any indoor venue, and there are no mandates in place from state or local health officials requiring vaccines for the general population. The vetoes come after Evers on Thursday vetoed a package of Republican bills seeking to spend $3.2 billion in federal coronavirus relief aid. The law gives the governor the power to distribute that money. Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson questioned the need for widespread COVID-19 vaccinations, saying in a radio interview, “What do you care if your neighbor has one or not?” Johnson, who has no medical expertise or background, made the comments Thursday during an interview with conservative talk radio host Vicki McKenna. Health experts say reaching herd immunity by getting a large majority of people vaccinated is the best shot at stopping the uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon has allowed a bill that slightly changes the state’s public health order process to become law without his signature despite calling it “premature.” The legislation would limit local public health orders that restrict the movements of non-quarantined people to no more than 10 days unless extensions are approved by a corresponding elected body, such as a county commission, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The bill applies to orders that mandate business closures or gathering restrictions. The bill was advanced after lawmakers decided on a compromise not to include state lawmakers in the public health order process. Some lawmakers raised concerns about how the changes could affect different areas of public health, such as in water supply emergencies. Another portion of the bill, sponsored by Republican House Speaker Eric Barlow, addresses who appoints the state’s public health officer. Currently, the director of the Wyoming Department of Health is tasked with selecting the state health officer. The bill reassigns that task to the governor. Gordon said that portion of the bill “solves a problem the governor never had” because he already had the ability to remove the state health officer and the health department director.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/26"}]}

But the dark side hasn't been dealt with,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said. “It's now time to deal with the dark side because people have taken your idea, and they've turned it into a nightmare for the American people.”\n\nConcerns about the harmful effects of social media use on America's youth have reached a crescendo in recent months. A public health advisory from the surgeon general last year noted social media use presents “a profound risk of harm” for kids' and teens' mental health and called for \"immediate action\" from tech companies.\n\n“We want action and legal accountability, not platitudes, from these CEOs,” said Brandy and Toney Roberts in a statement from the American Association for Justice. The couple filed a lawsuit against Meta after their 14-year-old daughter, Englyn, died by suicide. They say she was copying a hanging video sent to her on Instagram.\n\n\"An empty apology is cold comfort when we go home every night to Englyn’s empty bedroom,\" the Roberts said.\n\nLawmakers used the hearing to push for a package of bills meant “to help stop the exploitation of kids online,” including the STOP CSAM Act, which would allow victims of child exploitation to sue tech platforms.\n\nZuckerberg and other tech leaders argued that they have stepped up with protective measures that insulate children and teens on their platforms. Critics sharply disagreed.\n\n“I think Congress is going to have to help you,” Sen. John Kennedy, R-LA, said. “I think the reforms you're talking about, to some extent, are going to be like putting paint on rotten wood.\"\n\nAnd, even as they condemned social media companies, lawmakers acknowledged that they, too, have been part of the problem. Congress has passed just one kids' safety law in the past decade.\n\nWho are the witnesses?\n\nWitnesses include:\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nX CEO Linda Yaccarino\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew\n\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel\n\nDiscord CEO Jason Citron\n\nThis was Zuckerberg’s eighth time testifying before Congress. It was a first for Yaccarino, Spiegel and Citron, who were subpoenaed to appear. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-IL, said Citron \"only accepted services of this subpoena after U.S. Marshals were sent to Discord's headquarters at taxpayer expense.\"\n\nThe tech company leaders said they were open to working with lawmakers to address their concerns.\n\n\"I sincerely hope today is the beginning of an ongoing dialogue that results in real improvements in online safety,\" Citron said.\n\nMark Zuckerberg to victims' families:'I'm sorry for everything you've been through'\n\nHighlights from the hearing\n\nZuckerberg turned down requests to expand child safety team: Lawmakers on Wednesday released internal documents from Meta that showed Zuckerberg rejected 2021 requests to add dozens of employees to focus on children’s well-being and safety.\n\n“(This) is the reason why we can no longer trust Meta, and, frankly, any of the other social media to in fact grade their own homework,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-CT.\n\nZuckerberg addressed the families of victims: Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, urged Zuckerberg to apologize directly to the families of victims and suggested the billionaire establish a victim compensation fund. Zuckerberg would not commit to the idea during the hearing.\n\nTikTok grilled for ties to China: Lawmakers raised concerns that TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, is sharing user data with the Chinese government. CEO Chew argued that the company has spent billions on a project aimed at protecting American user data, and said the company has \"not been asked for any data by the Chinese government and we have never provided it.\"\n\nLawmakers highlight unity across party lines: The welfare of children on social media is the rare issue that transcends partisan politics. Sen. Graham highlighted how both Democrats and Republicans agreed that tech companies need more regulatory oversight.\n\n“We've found common ground here that just is astonishing,” he said.\n\nBoeing comparisons: Both Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-MN, and Sen. Chris Coons, D-DE, contrasted regulations in the tech and airline industries, highlighting the quick response after a Boeing plane lost a panel midair earlier this month.\n\n\"Nobody questioned the decision to ground a fleet of over 700 planes. So why aren't we taking the same type of decisive action on the danger of these platforms when we know these kids are dying?\" Klobuchar asked.\n\nWhat do the platforms say?\n\nThe social media platform heads balked when asked if they support the five bills the committee is pushing as written, but say they have already taken steps to protect young users.\n\nYaccarino, head of X, said the company is building a content moderation center in Austin, Texas. She also noted that the company supports the STOP CSAM Act. TikTok CEO Chew highlighted safety measures, like disabling direct messaging for accounts owned by people under 16 and automatically making their accounts private.\n\nZuckerberg’s written testimony notes that Meta has introduced various features to help parents and teens, including controls that let parents set limits on when and how long their children can use Meta’s services − settings that hide potentially sensitive content and a nudge tool that reminds teens when they’ve been using Instagram for too long or too late into the night.\n\n\"We’re committed to protecting young people from abuse on our services, but this is an ongoing challenge,\" Zuckerberg says in his written testimony.\n\nSnap, the company behind instant messaging app Snapchat, and X also came out in support of the Kids Online Safety Act, which could lead to more lawsuits against tech companies that recommend harmful material to young users. (Some critics are concerned that it could also lead to the censorship of transgender content online.)\n\n“Just like with all technology and tools, there are people who exploit and abuse our platforms for immoral and illegal purposes,” Discord CEO Citron said. “All of us here on the panel today and throughout the tech industry, have a solemn and urgent responsibility to ensure that everyone who uses our platforms is protected from these criminals, both online and off.”\n\nLawmakers noted that a number of these safety measures – including X’s new content moderation center and additional protections for teens on Meta’s platforms – were added in the weeks leading up to the senate hearing.\n\nWhat do the lawmakers say?\n\nCritics say social media platforms' tools don’t go far enough, and hope the hearing will push lawmakers to take action. Politico reports that Congress has passed just one kids' safety law in the past decade.\n\n“I’m tired of talking. I’m tired of having discussions,” Graham said. “Open up the courthouse door. Until you do that, nothing will change.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/07/29/ceos-amazon-apple-facebook-google-grilled-lawmakers/5538410002/", "title": "Tech CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook grilled by ...", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Four Big Tech CEOs — Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple — are answering for their companies’ practices before Congress as a House panel caps its yearlong investigation of market dominance in the industry.\n\nThe powerful executives are defending their companies as buttressing competition and offering essential services to consumers. The four CEOs are testifying remotely for a hearing Wednesday by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, meanwhile, continued to denounce the big tech companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general. In a tweet, he challenged Congress to crack down on the companies.\n\n“If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted before the start of the hearing. “In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\"\n\nInterest rates:With coronavirus surging, Fed keeps key interest rate near zero\n\nExecutive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.\n\nTrump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.\n\nThe four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world’s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.\n\nCritics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.\n\nIn its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding is needed.\n\nSubcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.\n\n“Simply put, they have too much power,” Cicilline said in opening remarks Wednesday, as he laid out data pointing up the power of the four tech companies as essential cogs of commerce and communications.\n\nHe also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, “these giants stand to profit” and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.\n\nThe companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies’ practices.\n\nVeering from the issue of market competition, a leading conservative Republican on the panel aired longstanding grievances against the big tech companies of censoring conservative viewpoints. “Big Tech is out to get conservatives,” said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.\n\nEach company has a distinct profile and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.\n\nFor Bezos, who presides over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal “smart” tech and beyond, it will be his first-ever appearance before Congress.\n\nBezos is introducing himself, in a way, in his hearing testimony, unusual for the occasion. He lays out his challenging life story growing up in New Mexico as the son of a single mother in high school, and later with an adoptive father who emigrated from Cuba at 16. Previewing his written testimony in a blog post Tuesday, Bezos traces his origins as a “garage inventor” who came up with the concept of an online bookstore in 1994.\n\nHe addresses the issue of Amazon’s power in what he describes as a huge and competitive global retail market. The company accounts for less than 4% of retail in the U.S., Bezos maintains. He affirms his rebuff to critics who call for the company to be broken up: Walmart is more than twice Amazon’s size, he says.\n\nBezos initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He’ll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd’s death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook’s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook’s refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters.\n\nZuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage. “We believe in values — democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression — that the American economy was built on,” he says in his testimony prepared for the hearing.\n\n“I understand that people have concerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have,” Zuckerberg's statement says. “Ultimately, I believe companies shouldn’t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy and election integrity on their own. That’s why I’ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators, and updated rules for the internet.”\n\nEuropean regulators have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.\n\nAttorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.\n\n“Google operates in highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling, and products are constantly improving,\" Pichai says in his written testimony. “Competition in ads — from Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Comcast and others — has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these savings passed down to consumers through lower prices.\"\n\nApple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay.\n\n“Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business,\" Cook says.\n\nHe is making the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect. In over a decade since the App Store launched, “we have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\" Cook says in his testimony.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/07/29/amazon-apple-facebook-google-ceos-washington-congressional-hearing/5536572002/", "title": "Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google CEOs grilled on antitrust ...", "text": "The big four tech CEOs whose companies dominate our daily lives came to Washington via teleconference Tuesday to testify before a House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust concerns to make their cases for why Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google shouldn't be broken up.\n\nTheir formal statements stressed their humble beginnings, devotion from consumers and how they help entrepreneurs run their small and medium-size businesses.\n\nBut when it came time for questions, representatives from both political parties greeted Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai and Amazon's Jeff Bezos with hostile questions and a format that begged for yes or no answers.\n\nIn addition to examining how the companies approached competitors, many of the questions fell along party lines, often focusing primarily on a couple of themes: poor treatment of third-party sellers on Amazon from Democrats, and the silencing of conservative voices on Google and Facebook from Republicans.\n\n\"Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.\n\nLawmakers had several five-minute slots to ask heated questions to the CEOs, often with yes or no answers, to transactions going back several years, and when the execs punted and said they needed more information, they told the officials they'd get back to them, which became a meme of its own on Twitter.\n\nOfficials also accused Google of stealing restaurant reviews from Yelp and turning its back on the United States when it dropped out of the bidding for a government contract. They accused Facebook of censoring conservative thought; Google of putting profitable search results in place of more relevant ones; and Apple of not playing straight with app developers.\n\n\"We treat every developer the same, with open and transparent rules,\" Cook said.\n\nPichai demurred on the accusation from Yelp, whose CEO, Jeremy Stoppleman, has been arguing for years that Google is a monopoly.\n\nZuckerberg defended his often-stated view that Facebook takes a free-market approach to political thought on the social network.\n\nRival Twitter has gotten more involved, and this week, gave President Donald Trump's son – Donald Trump Jr. – a 12-hour timeout for promoting an unproven cure for COVID-19.\n\n\"We have distinguished ourselves as one of the companies that defends free expression the most,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We don't want to be arbiters of truth.\"\n\nHe added that Facebook prohibits content that leads to the risk of harm.\n\n\"Someone stating there is a proven cure for COVID would get taken down,\" versus someone talking trials of drugs or personal experiences., he said.\n\nZuckerberg defended the social network's zeal to take down fake accounts, saying they remove \"billions\" of fake accounts every year. Having them up \"hurts our business,\" he said.\n\n\"People spend less time on the service when they are there,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nOn the big question of monopolistic power, and whether the big 4 tech companies should be broken up, Zuckerberg disagreed with a representative's contention that Facebook was a monopoly.\n\n\"We face a lot of competitors in every part of what we do,\" he said.\n\nJordan, an outspoken conservative, asked Pichai to guarantee that Google won't use its technology to work on behalf of presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n\n\"Can you assure you will not tailor your features to help a candidate win?\" Jordan asked.\n\nSaid Pichai: \"We won’t do any work one way versus the other.

But a change in power in the House would likely mean renewed focus on some political priorities — primarily allegations of anti-conservative social media bias — and perhaps an increased emphasis on China and related national security risks, too.\n\nHere’s what the results of the midterm elections could mean for Big Tech and the push to regulate it.\n\nThe return of heated tech CEO hearings\n\nIn general, tech companies may face more political noise with a Republican House but potentially less policy risk.\n\n“Republican gains would be good for megacap tech like Google and Apple,” said Paul Gallant, an industry analyst at Cowen Inc. “Republicans will hold hearings about content bias, but they’re not likely to pass antitrust legislation, which is the biggest threat the companies have faced in years.”\n\nExpect more of the uncomfortable ritual grillings that have made tech CEOs and their lieutenants a frequent sight in Washington, said one industry official who requested anonymity in order to speak more freely.\n\nWith Republicans likely to take control of the House, tech companies could face more hearings, but not necessarily more legislation. J. Scott Applewhite/AP/File\n\n“I think the content moderation debate will not just look at how companies make decisions on their platforms, but also how they’ve interacted with the Biden administration,” the official predicted. “The focus will be, ‘Are you too cozy with, and is your content moderation policy led by, feedback you get from the Biden administration?’”\n\nOne company that may see a reprieve is Twitter, whose new owner, Elon Musk, has won plaudits from conservatives for suggesting he could restore former President Donald Trump’s banned Twitter account, among others, and has used his account to endorse voting for Republicans in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nRe-thinking Section 230\n\nThe hearings could culminate in more sweeping proposals to roll back Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the federal law that grants tech platforms broad latitude to moderate online content as they see fit.\n\nIn the past, Democrats have called for narrowing Section 230, thus exposing tech platforms to more lawsuits, for not removing hate speech and extremist content more aggressively. Republicans have called for expanding platform liability over allegations that social media companies unfairly remove conservative speech.\n\nPrevious legislative proposals to scale back Section 230 have tended to run into constitutionality questions or failed to attract bipartisan support, and those hurdles still remain. But some digital rights advocates who have defended Section 230 aren’t taking anything for granted, saying that if they squint, they can still see a path forward for legislation that might curtail the law.\n\n“The thing I’m most worried about in the next Congress is a bad Section 230 bill that’s framed as being about ‘protecting kids’ or ‘stopping opioid sales’ or something that sounds non-controversial, but could have far-reaching negative effects” that may unintentionally result in more conservative speech being removed, not less, said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, a digital privacy group.\n\nGiven President Joe Biden’s criticism of Section 230 — a position the White House reiterated as recently as September — he might even be willing to sign such a hypothetical bill. But that scenario is far too premature to consider right now, according to other analysts who point to the Supreme Court, not Congress, as the center of gravity on Section 230.\n\nThere are two high-profile cases pending before the Court that could powerfully affect the law’s scope. The cases have to do with whether tech platforms can be sued in connection with federal anti-terrorism laws; if the Court finds that they can, it would effectively mean a significant narrowing of Section 230’s protections. And it could create openings for others to continue chipping away at the law.\n\n“Republicans in Congress certainly have their views on content moderation, but the big thing to look for is what the Supreme Court does,” said Andy Halataei, executive vice president of government affairs for the Information Technology Industry Council, a tech-backed advocacy group. “That will drive either the opportunity or the consensus for Congress to move forward.”\n\nTougher on China, and TikTok\n\nBoth parties have been hawkish on China, but expect Republicans to make it a pillar of their agenda. Within the first few days, Republicans could seek to establish a new select committee devoted to China and its impact on US supply chains, according to the industry official.\n\nThe new committee would likely look at the economic leverage China may have over the United States and the national security risks that could pose, ranging from China’s dominance in the rare earth minerals market to agricultural products, the official said.\n\nAnd while Republicans would likely bring even greater scrutiny to businesses with links to China, including TikTok, they also would have a substantial impact on the semiconductor industry by exploring further ways to restrict Chinese access to US technology.\n\n“Republican gains wouldn’t be great for the chips and tools companies because the China hawks will gain power,” said Gallant.\n\nIn a subsequent research note for investors, Gallant added: “For some China hawks — including likely House Foreign Affairs Chair Mike McCaul — Biden can’t go far enough,” suggesting Republicans could try to introduce even more restrictions on China exports through legislation.\n\nPrivacy legislation\n\nMultiple Congress-watchers told CNN that support for federal privacy legislation is still bipartisan and the area remains one of a handful where lawmakers could make progress in the next Congress.\n\nOne proposal, known as the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, would enshrine the nation’s first-ever consumer data privacy right into US law. It was approved by a key House committee this year and policy analysts say it could see more opportunities to advance next year.\n\nThe privacy issue is becoming more salient to consumers by the day, said Greer, as the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has made the security of location data, search histories and other personal information a critical safety matter.\n\n“Hot button tech policy fights like data privacy, antitrust, and content moderation have massive implications for core issues like abortion access, voting rights, racial justice, and LGBTQ+ protections,” Greer said.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/08/02/google-facebook-and-amazon-too-technical-congress-regulate/5547091002/", "title": "Congress and technology: Do lawmakers understand Google and ...", "text": "Many of us have had the feeling that technology, which continues to change at an ever-dizzying pace, may be leaving us behind. That was embodied this past week during a Congressional hearing, nominally convened to investigate antitrust concerns of four big tech titans: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\n\nWhile the five-and-a-half-hour inquiry touched on a range topics from pesky spam filters and search results to how companies approached acquisitions, the House Judiciary subcommittee hearing laid one thing bare: A sizable disconnect appears to exist between the technology Americans are using and depending on in their daily lives and the knowledge base of people with the power and responsibility to decide its future and regulation.\n\n\"Consumers and investors walk away feeling like a lot of these lawmakers don’t really understand the business models to an extent that they could then navigate them and put laws in place that will dictate the future of where they go,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.\n\nThe antitrust subcommittee hearing had been convened to look into the tech giants' market dominance. While some questions asked and issues raised were pointed, others may have left constituents and the tech CEOs themselves scratching their heads.\n\nInstead, the hearing primarily became a forum for Republicans to lament what is seen as a bias against conservatives on digital platforms and for Democrats to ask about issues such as the poor treatment of small businesses and third-party sellers online.\n\nRep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg why the social network recently took down Donald Trump Jr.'s post about hydroxychloroquine. \"Why did that happen?\" he asked.\n\nWhoops, the platform that took that action was Twitter, Zuckerberg noted.\n\nTwitter temporarily suspended the account for posting \"misleading and potentially harmful information\" related to COVID-19. Earlier in the week, tech platforms removed the video, which featured some doctors touting the malaria drug as a treatment for COVID-19 – it has not been found helpful and can be harmful – and suggesting masks aren't needed in preventing the spread of the virus.\n\nZuckerberg said the video was removed on Facebook because the platform prohibits content \"that would lead to imminent risk of harm. Stating that there is a proven cure for COVID when there is in fact none might encourage somebody to go take something that might have some adverse effects.\"\n\nRep. Pramilla Jayapal, D-Wash., questioned Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about whether the online retailer uses any data from its third-party sellers when making business decisions, especially for its private-branded products. Bezos responded that Amazon has a policy against that, but added \"I can’t guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.”\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet, was asked by Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., why his father was finding Steube's campaign emails in his spam folder.\n\nAnd House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y, took Facebook and Google to task for setting off the decline of journalism, primarily because the tech behemoths dominate digital advertising revenue, siphoning spending on print ads.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, simply attacked all the companies for an anti-conservative bias. \"I'll just cut to the chase. Big tech is out to get conservatives,\" he said.\n\nBut for observers of the hearing, \"there is definitely the feeling of two ships passing in the night,\" said Ives.\n\nDespite some smart questions on acquisitions, privacy and spread of misinformation, \"the technological ignorance demonstrated by our elected officials in (the) hearing was truly stunning,\" said Shelly Palmer, CEO at The Palmer Group, a tech strategy advisory group.\n\n\"People who are this clueless about the economic forces shaping our world should not be tasked with leading us into the age of AI (artificial intelligence),\" he said. \"The data elite are playing a different game with a different set of rules. Apparently, Congress can't even find the ballpark.\"\n\nTech CEO hearing:10 questions Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook could have been asked\n\nPrivacy and data:Amazon shares your private info unless you do these steps\n\nSigns that Congress may not get tech\n\nCriticism of the questioning went beyond the conference room on Capitol Hill. On Twitter – a tech giant not invited – discussion about the issues extended beyond the hearing.\n\n\"Net approval of the tech industry has increased 28% since the start of the coronavirus pandemic,\" tweeted Alex Stapp, director of technology policy at the Progressive Policy Institute. \"Weird time for Congress to hold an antitrust hearing about breaking up Big Tech.\"\n\nAnd the discussion continued into the next day. On Thursday, the House voted on an amendment to the Pentagon budget, proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., prohibiting the military from using the Twitch online video service, esports and video games as ways to gain recruits. The measure failed, but Ocasio-Cortez wondered whether her fellow Congressional members knew what they were voting on.\n\n\"Imagine trying to explain to your colleagues who are members of Congress what Twitch is,\" she tweeted Thursday.\n\nShe continued in another Tweet, calling tech literacy a \"growing need in Congress so we can legislate to protect people’s privacy, etc.\"\n\nThe Wednesday hearing was confrontational and revealed that members of Congress are not necessarily \"tech experts. That reality is clear,\" said Gene Munster, an investor and analyst with Loup Ventures.\n\nMuch of the give-and-take focused on the negative aspects of the platforms, he says, which might be used as a reason to trumpet regulation – that could harm the very small businesses some lawmakers professed to champion. \"What was clearly missed in Wednesday's conversation is the positive impact that these platforms have had on small businesses that far outweigh the negative impacts,\" Munster said.\n\nEnergizing the hearing was \"the elephant in the room,\" which is the handling of content on social networks, especially manipulation of political speech and medical disinformation, says Laura DeNardis, author of The Internet in Everything: Freedom and Security in a World with No Off Switch, and a professor and interim dean of the school of communications at American University.\n\n\"Everyone understands that our democracy now is on the line when it comes to disinformation, censorship, who gets to speak in the public sphere and what to do about all these content questions,\" she said.\n\nWhile it is important to raise questions about the market power and anti-competitive concerns around the tech giants, DeNardis said, \"missing from all of it was an acknowledgment of how important these companies are to our economy and also to our ability to thrive, and for people who are totally isolated to be able to connect in an age of COVID-19.”\n\nTech companies and trade groups such as the Consumer Technology Association must make it their job to educate legislators and their staff as technology evolves, says Michael Petricone, the CTA's senior vice president of government affairs.\n\nEven though there were signs that all members of Congress may not be keeping up with technology, historically, legislators have done a good job, Petricone says. Comparatively other countries, especially those in Europe, \"are more apt to crack down on large companies because big is bad,\" he said. \"But in terms of promoting innovation that has not been an effective strategy.\"\n\nThe U.S. is \"the globe’s innovation leader, and we also have the world’s most dynamic startup scene. It’s not a coincidence. It’s not because of what we eat for breakfast,\" he said. \"We have made consistently good policy choices.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/tech/meta-facebook-regulation/index.html", "title": "Here's how US lawmakers could finally rein in Facebook | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\n“Change is going to come. No question.”\n\n“We are serious about taking action.”\n\n“Here’s my message for Mark Zuckerberg: Your time of invading our privacy, promoting toxic content, and preying on children and teens is over. Congress will be taking action.”\n\nFacebook, now known as Meta (FB), has faced scrutiny on Capitol Hill for years, with executives — including Zuckerberg — repeatedly grilled in Congressional hearings. But if these and other comments from lawmakers during hearings in recent months are any indication, 2022 could shape up to be a make-or-break year in the long-running effort to regulate Facebook.\n\nCongress is currently considering around a dozen proposed bills targeting Big Tech, some of which could force Meta to change how it handles algorithmic recommendations and collecting user data, as well as its ability to make acquisitions. A bipartisan group of 10 state attorneys general launched an investigation late last year into Meta, focused on the potential harms of its Instagram platform on young users.\n\nAnd last week, a federal judge said the Federal Trade Commission could move forward with a lawsuit seeking to break up Meta, after the company had argued the complaint should be dismissed. (The case could drag on for years.) The FTC and several state attorneys general are also reportedly investigating Meta’s Oculus virtual reality unit over antitrust concerns, according to a Bloomberg report Friday citing people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nSome industry watchers have pointed to recently appointed federal officials such as FTC Chair Lina Khan, a vocal tech industry critic, and the sharper focus of lawmakers as cause for optimism that something may happen on the regulatory front.\n\n“You’re seeing a lot less of the politicized commentary and a lot more focus and coordination on these issues, the underlying technology behind them and the business model,” said Katie Paul, director at the tech advocacy group Tech Transparency Project. “It’s clear that a lot of these members of Congress have done their homework and they understand what they’re looking at.”\n\nStill, after years of talk and glimmers of progress, it remains unclear if or when US lawmakers and regulators might take successful action — as their EU and UK counterparts have — that would limit Meta’s power, as well as that of Big Tech more broadly. And the window of opportunity may be limited as preparations for the US midterm elections could divert attention from advancing new legislation.\n\nRecent revelations from former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen and the hundreds of internal documents she leaked have galvanized bipartisan support for new legislation related to protecting children online. But the likelihood of success for the many other Meta-related proposals is murkier, and not just because of the company’s immense lobbying power.\n\nDespite their agreement that something should be done to address Big Tech’s dominance -— and to crack down on Meta in particular — Democrats and Republicans are divided on what the core problem really is. Republicans accuse Facebook of anti-conservative bias, despite a lack of evidence, while Democrats are concerned that the company doesn’t do enough to protect against hate speech, misinformation and other problematic content.\n\nThe stakes for action, or inaction, are only growing. The “Facebook Papers” revealed a wide range of potential real-world harms and consequences from Meta’s platforms. Yet, lawmakers are largely still playing catch up in understanding and regulating the company’s older platforms, even as Meta pushes to transition into a “metaverse company” and perhaps shape a whole new generation of user experiences.\n\n“Congress must seize this historic moment — a pivotal turning point for reining in Big Tech,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, told CNN Business. “Having seen Big Tech’s harms and abuses, in our hearings and their own lives, Americans are ready for action — and results.”\n\nHere are a few of the approaches lawmakers could take.\n\nSection 230\n\nOne of the first places lawmakers and experts often look when considering new rules for tech companies like Meta is a piece of federal legislation called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\nThe 25-year-old law prevents tech companies from being held liable for the content that users post on their platforms. For years, big tech companies have leaned on the law to avoid being held responsible for some of the most controversial content on their platforms, using it to dismiss lawsuits over messages, videos and other content created by users.\n\nMomentum has grown on Capitol Hill around the idea of scrapping or updating Section 230, which could expose tech platforms to more lawsuits over hate speech and misinformation. Proposed changes include making platforms liable for hosting child abuse content. President Biden has also suggested platforms should be held responsible for hosting misinformation related to vaccines. (Social media companies and industry organizations have lobbied hard against changes to Section 230.)\n\nBut there’s one big hurdle to this approach, experts say: the First Amendment. Even if lawmakers got rid of Section 230 and, for example, Meta faced lawsuits over misinformation on its platforms, that speech is protected by the First Amendment. That means the company would probably still win out in the end, according to Jeff Kosseff, cybersecurity law professor at the US Naval Academy and author of a book about Section 230 called “The Twenty-Six Words that Created the Internet.”\n\n“Where Section 230 really makes a difference is in things like defamation lawsuits,” Kosseff said. “But that’s not really what’s driving the debate around Facebook and other social media sites — it’s more of this lawful but awful types of content.”\n\nKosseff also raised the concern that trying to hold tech platforms responsible for certain types of speech — such as health misinformation — could give the government significant leeway in determining what content falls into those categories.\n\n“There have been some countries that have passed fake news laws, and they’ve misused them just as you would expect that you would,” he said.\n\nAlgorithms\n\nHaugen, meanwhile, has encouraged reforming Section 230 to hold platforms accountable for how their algorithms promote content. In that scenario, Meta and other tech companies still would not be responsible for user-generated content, but could be held liable for the way their algorithms promote and cause that content to go viral.\n\nBipartisan legislation introduced in the House in November would take a slightly different tack by forcing large tech companies to allow users to access a version of their platforms where what they see isn’t shaped by algorithms at all.\n\nPerhaps anticipating such a law, Meta-owned Instagram has said it will bring back the option for users to access a reverse chronological version of their feed (one not manipulated by its algorithm) later this year. Facebook already offers this option but it can be frustrating to use — rather than being an option in settings, where users might expect, it’s toggled using a button in a long menu on the left side of the NewsFeed screen, and it resets every time you close the site.\n\nPrivacy\n\nLawmakers have also used recent hearings about Meta to rail for updated privacy laws.\n\n“We have not done anything to update our privacy laws in this country, our federal privacy laws. Nothing. Zilch,” Minnesota Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar said during Haugen’s hearing.\n\nCurrently, progress on this front is coming more at the state level than the federal level.\n\nCalifornia’s Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect last year, gives consumers the right to demand that large companies disclose what data they have collected on them. Under the law, consumers can also ask companies to delete their data and, in some cases, sue companies for data breaches. Meanwhile, Virginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act (set to take effect in 2023) also gives consumers more control of their online data, but it includes more exceptions than the California law and doesn’t give consumers the option to sue companies. A federal bill could help provide consistent, nationwide standards for how data can be collected and sold online.\n\nCongress is considering the KIDS Act, which aims to protect internet users under 16 in various ways, including by prohibiting the use of age verification data for commercial purposes, as well as the SAFE DATA Act, which would give consumers more choice in how their data is collected and used.\n\nA new tech regulatory body\n\nIn his testimony before a Senate subcommittee earlier this month, Instagram head Adam Mosseri proposed the creation of an industry body that would set standards for “how to verify age, how to build age-appropriate experiences, how to build parental controls,” and other social media best practices.\n\nBut lawmakers didn’t seem enthusiastic about the idea of leaving standards-setting and oversight to industry players. “Self-policing depends on trust and the trust is gone,” Blumenthal said during Mosseri’s hearing.\n\nInstead, lawmakers and advocates are pushing for the creation of a new federal regulatory body responsible for overseeing Big Tech. The group could be tasked with developing the framework and structures needed to regulate the tech industry, similar to the mechanisms within the government that help oversee the banking industry, TTP’s Paul said. It could also, as Haugen testified, serve as “a regulatory home where someone like me could do a tour of duty.”\n\nSuch a group would help supplement the limited existing accountability structures surrounding Meta. The Facebook Oversight Board — which says it acts independently, although its members are appointed and paid by the company — is only responsible for weighing in on content moderation decisions. Even then, the group has recently focused on smaller, one-off flubs, rather than the many broader, structural problems the company faces (although it has made larger calls for transparency).\n\nThe role of the FTC\n\nIf Congress does pass any Big Tech laws, the FTC will play a key role in enforcing them. And even if we don’t see new legislation in the next year, Meta won’t necessarily be off the hook.\n\nThe judge’s Tuesday ruling in the FTC case opens the door to perhaps the most existential threat yet to Meta: the FTC is looking to unwind Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. (Meta previously said it was confident “the evidence will reveal the fundamental weakness of the [FTC’s] claims.”)\n\nThe case will give Khan, the FTC chair, a chance to make her mark in her first turn as a federal regulator — and there is some reason to believe Meta is nervous. Last July, company officials wrote to the FTC asking Khan to recuse herself from all matters related to the social media giant (she has not done so). Meta also argued that the FTC’s suit should be dismissed on the grounds that Khan should not have been able to vote to approve the updated complaint; however, the judge sided with the FTC.\n\nIn addition to the agency’s lawsuit, Khan said last month that the FTC is considering drafting new rules that would more strongly regulate how US businesses can use data and algorithms. The effort could lead to “market-wide requirements” targeting “harms that can result from commercial surveillance and other data practices,” Khan said in a letter to Blumenthal. That could deal another potential blow to Meta’s business model.\n\nAnd Friday’s report that the FTC is also working with state attorneys general to investigate potential anticompetitive practices by Meta’s Oculus — a key unit in its plans for the metaverse — indicate that its future ambitions are risk of regulatory crackdown, too.\n\n–CNN’s Brian Fung contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/media/ticketmaster-taylor-swift-congress/index.html", "title": "Taylor Swift Ticketmaster: Congress wants to grill Live Nation's CEO ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nCongress wants answers from the CEO of Ticketmaster’s parent company after a ticketing snafu ahead of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour left millions of unhappy Swifties without the ability to see the singer-songwriter perform.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino Tuesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee demanded a briefing on what went wrong and what steps the company is taking to fix the problems. The committee members want to meet with Rapino by December 15.\n\n“The recent pre-sales ticketing process for Taylor Swift’s upcoming Eras tour – in which millions of fans endured delays, lockouts, and competition with aggressive scammers, scalpers and bots – raises concerns over the potential unfair and deceptive practices that face consumers and eventgoers,” the committee wrote in its letter.\n\nThe committee noted it had previously raised concerns about the industry’s business practices and said it wants to meet with Rapino to discuss how the company processes tickets for concerts and major tours. It also wants answers about how Ticketmaster plans to improve in the future.\n\nSwift’s Eras tour kicks off March 17 and will have 52 concerts in multiple stadiums across the United States over five months. Overwhelming demand snarled the ticketing site last month, infuriating countless fans. Customers complained on social media about Ticketmaster not loading, saying the platform didn’t allow them to access tickets, even if they had a pre-sale code for verified fans. Ticketmaster ultimately canceled ticket sales to the general public.\n\nTicketmaster apologized to Swift and her fans who were unable to secure tickets and blamed the debacle on its “Verified Fans” system, a mechanism aimed at eliminating bots that gives presale codes to individuals. The system couldn’t keep up with the intense demand, Ticketmaster said last month. Roughly 3.5 million people signed up for the program to buy Swift tickets, its “largest registration in history.” That unprecedented demand, combined with a “staggering number of bot attacks as well as fans who didn’t have invite codes” drove “unprecedented traffic” to its site, Ticketmaster said, and, essentially, broke it.\n\nBut the House committee said the company’s explanation wasn’t sufficient.\n\n“This statement raises questions over your bot management solution and its ability to adequately protect consumers,” the committee wrote.\n\nThe committee pointed out that the BOTS Act of 2016 allows the Federal Trade Commission to fine Ticketmaster with “steep” penalties if it “knowingly sold tickets that were improperly purchased” by bots.\n\nIn its letter to Rapino, the committee also said it wants information about the fees Ticketmaster charges customers. It also asked to learn more about dynamic pricing. ticket availability limits, restrictions on transferabiity and the company’s efforts to thwart bots and scammers.\n\nTicketmaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation into Live Nation, the owner of Ticketmaster, to look at whether the company has a monopoly in the market for concerts, including ticket purchasing, a source familiar with the matter told CNN last month. Last week, more than two dozen Taylor Swift fans sued Live Nation for “unlawful conduct” in the pop star’s chaotic tour sale, claiming the ticketing giant violated antitrust laws, among others.\n\nRapino and Live Nation have caught the ire of Congress before. Senator Amy Klobuchar criticized Ticketmaster in an open letter Rapino in the days following the ticket snafu, saying she has “serious concerns” about the company’s operations. The chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, wrote that complaints from Swift fans unable to buy tickets for her upcoming tour, in addition to criticism about high fees, suggests that the company “continues to abuse its market positions.”", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/business/sam-bankman-fried-testifies-before-congress/index.html", "title": "US lawmakers set to grill Sam Bankman-Fried on the collapse of ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nWith his vast crypto empire in ruins, Sam Bankman-Fried is preparing to be grilled by US lawmakers who are demanding answers about how his digital asset exchange, FTX, came unraveled, leaving at least a million customers unable to access their funds.\n\nBankman-Fried tweeted Friday that he was willing to appear Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, which is investigating the crypto-industry titan’s spectacular collapse last month.\n\nThe 30-year-old entrepreneur, who resigned as CEO at the same time FTX and dozens of affiliated companies filed for bankruptcy, said there would be a “limit to what I will be able to say, and I won’t be as helpful as I’d like,” in response to Rep. Maxine Waters, the Democratic chairwoman of the committee. “But as the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th.”\n\nAlso testifying Tuesday will be John Ray, a veteran restructuring expert who’s been tasked with shepherding FTX through bankruptcy as its new chief executive.\n\n“The scope of the investigation underway is enormous,” Ray said in prepared remarks released Monday.\n\nWhile the probe isn’t completed, Ray said, FTX’s collapse appears to stem from the concentration of power “in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals” who failed to implement virtually any corporate controls.\n\nRay also states as fact that “customer assets from FTX.com were commingled with assets from the Alameda trading platform.” That’s a key issue for investigators, as FTX and Alameda were, on paper, separate entities.\n\nBankman-Fried has publicly stated that he never “knowingly” commingled funds.\n\nA representative for Bankman-Fried’s lawyer said the FTX founder would testify remotely from the Bahamas, where the company was based. Tuesday’s hearing is set to begin at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nBankman-Fried, however, has refused to testify before the Senate Banking Committee.\n\n“We have offered Sam Bankman-Fried two different dates for providing testimony… and are willing to accommodate virtual testimony. He has declined in an unprecedented abdication of accountability,” said Senators Sherrod Brown and Pat Toomey, chairman and ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, in a statement. “Given that Bankman-Fried’s counsel has stated they are unwilling to accept service of a subpoena, we will continue to work to have him appear before the Committee. He owes the American people an explanation.”\n\nFamiliar faces in Congress\n\nSpeaking to Congress is familiar terrain for the crypto celebrity-turned-pariah, who had cultivated a reputation as the industry Good Guy in Washington. He and other FTX executives made lavish political and charitable donations while advocating for legislation that would clarify the regulatory bounds of the digital asset space.\n\nIn FTX’s heyday, Bankman-Fried regularly appeared on congressional panels, charming lawmakers and pushing for light-touch regulation of the nascent industry. Bankman-Fried himself gave roughly $40 million to campaigns and political action committees, largely backing Democrats, during the 2022 midterm election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records.\n\nThis time around, though, he’s unlikely to get the same warm welcome, as lawmakers and lobbying groups who’d aligned with FTX are scrambling to distance themselves from one of the most shocking corporate implosions in history.\n\nRaising the stakes\n\nIn the weeks since his companies collapsed, multiple investigations, including a criminal probe into FTX and its sister hedge fund, Alameda, have begun that could lead to charges against Bankman-Fried, legal experts say. At the same time, SBF has been regularly tweeting and granting interviews with the media, casting himself as a somewhat bumbling but ultimately well-meaning chief executive who got out over his skis.\n\n“I didn’t knowingly commit fraud,” he told the BBC over the weekend. “I didn’t want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.”\n\nThat sentiment echoes statements he previously made at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit and in an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America.”\n\nHis testimony to Congress, however, carries additional legal weight.\n\n“SBF is putting himself at significant risk by testifying before Congress,” said Howard Fischer, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer. “”Anything SBF says that is contradicted by either documentary evidence or the statements of other people will be grounds to cast doubt on his credibility.\n\nFurther, Fischer says, if his testimony before Congress is “substantially impugned” by other evidence, Bankman-Fried “might also face charges relating to that.”\n\nWhat lawmakers want to know\n\nDespite SBF’s media tour, he’s largely evaded specifics around how the wheels came off FTX, once privately valued at more than $30 billion. In early November, when a prominent investor publicly announced he would be liquidating his holdings of FTX, it sparked a panic that amounted to a run on the bank. FTX faced a liquidity crunch so severe it was forced to file for bankruptcy less than a week later.\n\nIn a tweet last week, Bankman-Fried said he would “shed what light I can,” including on what he thinks led to the crash and his own failings as CEO.\n\nKey questions that lawmakers and prosecutors are expected to focus on relate to the potential misuse of customer funds.\n\n“The questions are all going to be about co-mingling of assets,” said David Maria, head of litigation and regulatory affairs at the crypto exchange Bittrex … “I think there’s gonna be a lot of, ‘I don’t remember, I don’t know, I don’t have access to those files.’ “\n\nRay, the new CEO who is scheduled to testify ahead of Bankman-Fried, may be able to offer more substantive insights into lawmakers’ questions given his access to the company’s financial records and unique insight into how it the business was run, Maria said.\n\nOne of the key questions about FTX stems from a Reuters report last month that says Bankman-Fried built a “backdoor” into FTX’s accounting system, allowing him to alter the company’s financial records without tripping accounting red flags, as That Reuters report said Bankman-Fried used this “backdoor” to transfer $10 billion in FTX customer funds to Alameda, the hedge fund, and at least $1 billion is now missing.\n\nBankman-Fried has denied knowledge of any such backdoor. “I don’t even know how to code,” he told cryptocurrency vlogger Tiffany Fong in an interview last month.", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/04/14/facebooks-zuckerberg-got-grilled-but-nothings-really-changed/516312002/", "title": "Facebook's Zuckerberg got grilled, but nothing's really changed", "text": "Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg made a big splash testifying to Congress this week about the social network privacy scandal, but in the aftermath, not much changed.\n\nThe big takeaway: Zuckerberg is still sorry, but no radical shift in business strategy was announced. Some senators are woefully ignorant about how the Internet works. The only real news was a hint of a possible paid version of Facebook. This would hypothetically reduce the privacy issues some critics have brought up.\n\nLet's recap:\n\nFacebook has admitted that some 87 million of its 2.2 billion users had their e-mail addresses, phone numbers and/or other personal information hijacked by a rogue app developer that passed on the information to a research firm aligned with the Donald Trump presidential campaign.\n\nThe social network apologized for the action, and said it would be stricter in how it allows data to be shared, and have clearer disclosures to the public about how Facebook uses our data, including by selling advertisers access to groups of people with certain profiles.\n\nTuesday and Wednesday, the 33-year-old Facebook CEO appeared before Congress and repeated these points, as well as tried to educate some senators on how the Internet works.\n\nOne of the more memorable exchanges featured 84-year-old retiring senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) ask, \"How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?\"\n\n\"Senator,\" Zuckerberg said, \"We run ads.’\n\nThe CEO dropped hints that perhaps Facebook could one day offer a paid, more private version of Facebook, and admitted that regulation of his service was \"inevitable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook is still sending us reminders of where we went in March (I just got mine this morning), who we ate with, what businesses we like and suggesting new friends to spend time with.\n\nNot much has changed, nor is it likely to — even after many of us went in and downloaded our data, to see just what Facebook had on us.\n\nAnalyst Jeremiah Owyang of Kaleido Insights says the event was \"political theater,\" aimed at allowing Zuckerberg to make amends with the public and the media.\n\n\"There is now greater awareness to the incredible influence Facebook has across the globe,\" he says. \"And now that the Congress has put forth their grievances, this will set them up to do regulation.\"\n\nHe expects to see some some sort of new laws that call for Facebook to be more public about it how is uses our data, and require the network to ask our permission to do so and often. This is as opposed to having a terms of service that nobody reads and simply clicks OK on.\n\nMy own takeaway is a contrarian view. The average person doesn't care about the privacy brouhaha and despite high profile celebrities like Cher and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak calling to delete Facebook, most won't. They love it and have continued to use it everyday. As I asked on a Talking Tech podcast earlier this week: \"Can we go back to loving Facebook again now?\"\n\nMeanwhile, in other tech news this week:\n\nGmail will be getting a new look. The desktop version of the world's most popular e-mail program will add several new features, including the ability to put a time limit on the sent e-mail, like disappearing photos from Snapchat. The new features are expected to be unveiled in May at the Google I/O developer conference.\n\nApple introduced new Red versions of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus: The Red editions donate a portion of the proceeds to help combat AIDS. The phones are priced similarly to the standard models, starting at $699 and $799.\n\nUber risks penalties: The Federal Trade Commission is strengthening its settlement with Uber over a 2016 breach in which tens of millions of Uber riders and drivers' data was accessed. This new agreement adds tougher requirements to a settlement the agency and ride-hailing company reached in August 2017 over a 2014 breach involving bank information and Social Security numbers for more than 100,000 Uber drivers.\n\nHulu and Spotify team up for a joint subscription: The TV and unlimited music subscription services can be picked up together now for $12.99 monthly, versus $7.99 for Hulu (with ads) and $9.99 for Spotify, a savings of $4.99 monthly.\n\nThis week's Talking Tech podcasts\n\nBest apps for making international calls: My friend Beth just visited Asia, and asked about how to make calls overseas.

This time though, the result might be different. The 49ers still boast a tremendous defense, with cornerstones Nick Bosa and Fred Warner leading the charge. However, their offense has taken a tremendous step forward since 2020. Gone is Jimmy Garoppolo, replaced by Brock Purdy, arguably the most divisive quarterback in the NFL. Gone is Emmanuel Sanders, replaced by second-team All-Pro Brandon Aiyuk. Gone is Joe Staley, replaced by future Hall of Famer Trent Williams. And of course, you can't overlook Christian McCaffrey.\n\nThe Chiefs, meanwhile, may have lost Tyreek Hill, but upgraded several spots on their offensive line. Their defense is also much better than what it was four years ago. Chris Jones, L'Jarius Sneed, and Nick Bolton headline one of the best units in the NFL, the first time the Chiefs have had a top-ten defense since 2015, before Mahomes was drafted.\n\nAlthough most NFL fans would have preferred the Baltimore Ravens against the Detroit Lions, this matchup should provide another classic that will either confirm the Chiefs' dynasty or have a Mr. Irrelevant hoist the Lombardi Trophy. Here are our favorite player prop bets with less than two weeks to go until the game. Odds via BetMGM.\n\nBest Super Bowl LVIII player prop bets\n\nRashee Rice OVER 6.5 receptions (-105)\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs only really have two solid options in their passing attack: Travis Kelce and Rashee Rice. While Travis Kelce may have been the star in the AFC Championship against Baltimore, Rice still quietly put up eight receptions. Whether it's quick screens to the outside, slants, or just someone that Mahomes can trust to come down with the ball, Rice is the man for the job.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nRice has recorded seven or more receptions in six of the Chiefs' last nine games. Even better, the Chiefs game plan against San Francisco will likely be very similar to their plan against Baltimore -- control time of possession, take short yardage gains, keep Lamar Jackson and the Ravens' offense off the field. With that strategy, Mahomes looked often to his guys in short yardage situations. Rice had eight receptions, but only for 46 yards.\n\nIn any situation – either the Chiefs are winning and trying to hold on, or the 49ers are winning and the Chiefs need to come back – Rice should be the recipient of several targets from Mahomes.\n\nBrock Purdy OVER 12.5 rushing yards (-115)\n\nBrock Prudy is fresh off a 48-yard rushing performance in the NFC championship game against Detroit. Some of the most pivotal plays in the game were made with his legs, but Purdy is not a mobile quarterback. He is not someone who can consistently make big plays with his legs. That's why this line feels like a trap. Given everything we just saw, all signs point to Purdy being able to get at least 13 yards on the ground, right? Actually, yeah.\n\nWhile a normal person might look at Purdy's game-changing rushing plays and think the Chiefs will try to limit his impact on the ground, the Chiefs likely realize that Purdy averages over 21 rushing yards per game when the 49ers lose. Purdy only ever really takes off when his team is down, and that's what the Chiefs want. With more than a week to prepare for the Super Bowl, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid should put together a master class coming out the gate. Reid is notoriously one of the best head coaches ever when coming off a bye.\n\nIf the Chiefs get the lead early, then Purdy will be in a position to run the ball more often, and that's good for anyone looking for the over on Purdy rushing yards.\n\nChristian McCaffrey Super Bowl MVP (+450)\n\nAs talented as Brock Purdy is, Christian McCaffrey is more likely to have a big day on the ground than Purdy is to dominate through the air. If the 49ers win the game, McCaffrey will likely have at least one touchdown on the day, potentially two or three, and more than 100 total yards.\n\nThe Chiefs have been a great rushing defense all season, but McCaffrey can do damage through the air as well. Given that the odds for Purdy (+220) and Mahomes (+125) are so high, McCaffrey seems like a steal as the obvious third option.\n\nSure, a running back hasn't won Super Bowl MVP since 1998, but McCaffrey is more than a running back. He's arguably the most talented running back to play in the Super Bowl since Marshawn Lynch, and you can bet Kyle Shanahan will hand McCaffrey the ball in crunch time should the game come down to it.\n\nGannett may earn revenue from sports betting operators for audience referrals to betting services.

On February 11, Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers will play against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in Las Vegas at Allegiant Stadium.\n\nThe Chiefs aim to win back-to-back titles for the first time since the 2003-04 New England Patriots. They are heading into their sixth Super Bowl and marking their fourth appearance in the past five seasons. Despite not having his best season in 2023, Mahomes has been performing well in the postseason. Mahomes has completed 70% of his passes and thrown 11 touchdowns with no interceptions.\n\nOn the other hand, it is no surprise that the 49ers made it to the Super Bowl after the impressive season they had with a 12-5 record and will make their eighth overall appearance in the title game. Not only do the 49ers have a strong player in the highly efficient quarterback Purdy, but also have playmakers in Brandon Aiyuk, Deebo Samuel, George Kittle and Christian McCaffrey.\n\nHere are the Super Bowl LVIII early predictions as of Tuesday.\n\nNFL:Travis Kelce gets the party going for Chiefs with a game for the ages\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\n2024 Super Bowl predictions for 49ers vs. Chiefs\n\nESPN: 49ers have a 59% chance to win\n\nAccording to the ESPN Matchup Predictor, the San Francisco 49ers have a 50.6% chance of beating the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nSporting News: Chiefs 30, 49ers 24\n\nBill Bender writes: \"Kansas City has allowed more than 24 points in one game this season, and that defense might make the difference in the fourth quarter one more time. If the Chiefs need a score with the game on the line late, then can you trust Mahomes? San Francisco allowed 26 points per game in the playoffs. This will be a 27-24 game either way, and our guess is Mahomes finds a way to win a third Super Bowl.\"\n\nNew York Post: 49ers\n\nSean Treppedi writes: \"Brock Purdy continues to be unvalidated for irrelevant reasons, such as his draft position, yet he continues to extract the best from the talent around him while taking plays into his own hands when needed. Isn’t that the textbook description of a successful quarterback? Either that or a league-leading 72.7 QBR and a 113.3 passer rating. We love to get caught up in narratives, and there is certainly plenty to discuss with two perennial contenders for the better part of a decade. But when it comes down to what’s on the field, let’s call it square on two top-three defenses in points allowed. I see this as the unrelenting chemistry between Mahomes and Travis Kelce — who connected on all 11 attempts against Baltimore — against an overwhelming cast of star power. Mahomes’ connection with Kelce has accounted for more than 36 percent of his air yardage in the playoffs. Calling him a one-trick pony would be ignorant, but the 49ers are deploying four players with 100-plus total yards in the playoffs. They more than doubled the Chiefs in average scoring margin. Whether Vegas perceives Mahomes as an underdog or not, the public will always favor him at this point. Ignore the storylines and take the early edge with San Francisco.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Chiefs 27, 49ers 21\n\nStaff writes: \"The game between the Chiefs and 49ers will be a rematch of Super Bowl LIV, when Kansas City won 31-20. Kansas City came into Sunday's AFC Championship Game as an underdog, but Mahomes said the Chiefs \"never feel like underdogs.\" As far as the odds are concerned, though, they will be underdogs once again against the 49ers in the Super Bowl. Compared to the last three Chiefs teams that reached the Super Bowl, this one didn't dominate throughout the regular season and faced plenty of doubt heading into the postseason. Kansas City proved this year, however, that any team coached by Andy Reid and led by Mahomes has a fighting chance. San Francisco came into the season hungry for a Super Bowl, and the 49ers have looked like one of the top teams in football all year. Led by star running back Christian McCaffrey and promising quarterback Brock Purdy, the 49ers certainly have what it takes to keep up with Kansas City's electric offense. With a powerful offense and a more than capable defense, the 49ers will look to avenge the Super Bowl loss from 2019. However, with the way Mahomes has played this postseason, the Chiefs will be tough to beat.\"\n\nSan Francisco 49ers vs. Kansas City Chiefs Chiefs odds, spread and lines for Super Bowl LVIII\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are favorites to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII according to the BetMGM NFL odds.

What to know about Chiefs-49ers matchup\n\nSan Francisco 49ers Hall of Famers\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers franchise boasts 29 members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers franchise history\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers were formed in 1946 as a member of the All-America Football Conference. Following the collapse of the AAFC, they moved to the NFL in 1950.\n\nIn the 70s, the 49ers won three consecutive NFC Western division titles from 1970 to 1972. Later, in 1982, they won their first-ever league championship by defeating Cincinnati 26-21 in Super Bowl XVI. The 49ers went on to win four more Super Bowl titles.\n\nFinally, in 2014, the team moved from Candlestick Park to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nShowtime:Usher is the latest to headline a star-studded list of Super Bowl halftime shows\n\nHow did the San Francisco 49ers get the name?\n\nThe history of the San Francisco 49ers explains that Allen E. Sorrell, who was Tony Morabito's partner and a part owner of the newly formed All-America Football Conference franchise in 1946, proposed the name \"49ers\" for the team.\n\nSorrell suggested this name after the influx of people who rushed to the west for gold. It is believed that this was the only name that the team has been associated with in San Francisco.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers logo history\n\nThe original team logo depicted the city's roots and showed a gold miner wearing boots and a lumberjack shirt, wielding a pair of pistols. The design was adopted from the side of railway freight cars.\n\nSince then, the team has used some variation of the logo, but the current version consists of the letters \"SF\" in white against a red oval. This logo was first introduced in 1962 and has remained in use ever since in some form.\n\nWho is Sourdough Sam, the 49ers mascot?\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers had their first mascot in the 1950s, which was a mule named Clementine. Clementine wore a red saddle blanket.\n\nLater, the team changed to a gold rush prospector-themed mascot, which appeared in the 1970's.\n\nIn 1994, the San Francisco 49ers adopted Sourdough Sam as their official mascot. It is claimed that Sourdough Sam is the hardest working mascot in the NFL. Sam is a gold miner and loves sourdough. He takes the bread with him for lunch on his long days of digging in the gold mines. This is how he got his nickname, Sourdough Sam.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers all-time statistical information\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers franchise has been in existence since 1946 and have played 78 seasons.

If the 49ers win, they will host the next round's game against the winner of the Lions-Buccaneers game because they are the top seed remaining in the playoff field.

It would be the country’s first significant update to furnace standards since the 1990s.\n\nIn the proposed rule, the details of which were shared first with CNN, non-weatherized gas furnaces and furnaces used in mobile homes would be required to be much more energy-efficient, achieving a 95% annual fuel utilization efficiency standard. Just over 40% of furnaces shipped today are at or above 95% fuel utilization.\n\nAnd unlike previous administrations’ proposed standards for furnaces, the Biden administration will propose a new national energy efficiency standard that applies to all sizes of home heating furnaces.\n\nThe proposed rule would effectively phase out less-efficient “non-condensing” furnaces, which waste excess gas, and make newer, more energy-efficient furnaces mandatory.\n\n“By updating energy standards for many carbon-emitting appliances, such as home furnaces, the Biden Administration is working to save consumers money,” Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.\n\nThe proposed rule would go into effect by 2029 at the earliest, according to the Energy Department. At its start date, it would require furnace manufacturers to stop producing the old inefficient furnaces and ban new imports of those furnaces.\n\nThe rule would give retailers a period of transition, and it wouldn’t penalize homeowners who have an old furnace in their home.\n\n“Americans have been forced to rely on antiquated and wasteful furnaces for long enough,” Joe Vukovich, an energy efficiency advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “Since about half of the homes in the U.S. depend on fossil fuels for space heating, this standard will significantly lower energy bills each year and slash dangerous climate-warming emissions across the nation.”\n\nThe newly proposed DOE rule comes after the agency scrapped a Trump rule that would have weakened the standards for furnaces and water heaters. The Biden administration rule exceeds the Obama-era rule, which set the efficiency standard at 92%.\n\nIf it takes effect, the department estimates it would reduce carbon emissions by 373 million metric tons and methane emissions by 5.1 million tons, over the course of 30 years. The department also estimates significant cost-savings for US consumers: $60 a year on their utility bills, totaling an estimated $30.3 billion over three decades.\n\n“AGA will thoroughly examine every aspect of this proposed rule and if it is another attempt to put the natural gas industry out of business we will vigorously object,” said Karen Harbert, the president and CEO of the American Gas Association. “At this moment when natural gas is imperative for our country’s and the world’s stability, placing enormous costs on everyday Americans is wrong-headed at best.”\n\nThe new rule comes as the Biden administration is focusing more on energy-efficient heating. Last week, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to speed up domestic manufacturing of heat pumps, among other things, an action that will still require funding from Congress. Senior White House officials will meet with lawmakers this week to talk about two bills that would help fund heat pump manufacturing in the United States.\n\nIn addition to reducing planet-warming emissions, Granholm said in a statement that the new furnace measures would “provide huge material benefits to American households in the form of cleaner air, modernized technology, and cheaper energy.”\n\nResidential furnaces make up about 15% of annual at-home energy use in the US.\n\nWhile the new rule would be a big update to the current standards, the US is lagging behind some European countries which are taking bigger steps to phase out fossil-fuel powered furnaces in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n\nFor instance, the Austrian government recently agreed to phase out gas heaters in new building starting next year, according to its climate minister Leonore Gewessler. Austria is calling for all oil and coal heaters to be replaced with renewable-powered heating by 2035, and all gas heaters to be replaced by 2040 – with government subsidies to help residents transition their home heating systems.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information and reaction.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/politics/led-cfl-light-bulb-rule-biden-climate/index.html", "title": "Compact fluorescent light bulbs to be phased out under new Biden ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration is unveiling a new proposed rule that, if enacted, would effectively phase out compact fluorescent light bulbs and move the US light bulb markets decisively to more energy-efficient LEDs.\n\nThe Department of Energy is proposing the rule on Monday with the aim to finalize it by the end of President Joe Biden’s first term. The rule would more than double the current minimum light bulb efficiency level, from its current standard of 45 lumens per watt to over 120 lumens per watt for the most common bulbs. The details of the proposed rule were shared first with CNN.\n\nThis change will accelerate what White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi said is an “increasing shift in the marketplace toward LED lighting” over the last decade. Zaidi said moving away from compact fluorescents and even less efficient incandescent bulbs will ultimately lead to savings for consumers.\n\n“The mandate to the Department of Energy from Congress is to find ways to save money for American consumers,” Zaidi told CNN in an interview. “LEDs are now an order of magnitude cheaper than just a decade ago.”\n\nThe proposed rule comes on top of the Biden administration’s move to get inefficient incandescent bulbs off the shelves by the summer of 2023. The Department of Energy finalized a rule to phase out the old-fashioned bulbs in the spring, capping off a decades-long bipartisan effort started in the Bush administration to get them off the shelves.\n\nThat was complicated by former President Donald Trump in 2019, whose administration undid a previous Obama-era light bulb rule. Trump once famously complained about the quality of the light coming from LED bulbs, telling House Republicans “I always look orange” in the energy-efficient lighting.\n\nZaidi said that LED lighting technology has improved tremendously since the early days of LEDs, providing better light for a fraction of the cost.\n\nLED bulbs can last three to five times longer than a compact fluorescent bulb, and up to 30 times longer than an incandescent bulb, according to the Department of Energy. Unlike both incandescent and compact fluorescent bulbs, LEDs release very little heat, and thus waste less energy.\n\n“If a particular light fixture was costing someone $10 in a year, then it’s going to be costing much, much less,” Zaidi said.\n\nEven before the latest proposed rule, LED use in the US has grown significantly in recent years. Nearly 50% of US households said they used LED bulbs for most or all their indoor lighting, according to the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey. It was a huge increase from the 2015 survey, where just 4% of households reported using LEDs for most or all indoor light use.\n\nThat same survey showed just 12% of US households said they used compact fluorescents as their predominant source of lighting, down from 32% in 2015.\n\nDOE also estimates the proposed changes will help put a dent in planet-warming emissions, cutting 131 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and 903 thousand tons of methane over the next 30 years – roughly equal to the electricity that 29 million homes use in one year.\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement the changes would “help lower energy costs and keep money in the pockets of American families while reducing our nation’s carbon footprint.”\n\nThe rulemaking is also part of an administration goal to take 100 actions in the past year to make energy efficiency standards stronger. The White House announced Monday it had surpassed its goal with stronger standards on gas furnaces, air conditioners and clothes dryers.\n\nZaidi told CNN it is part of a broader effort by the Biden administration to move Americans’ appliances to more energy efficient and cost-effective ones that also release far less heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions into the air. For instance, Zaidi said DOE is also at work on a rule to make residential cooking products like stoves and ovens more efficient.\n\nZaidi added the administration is trying to use a combination of federal standards and incentives to push consumers toward energy-efficient and cleaner products for their homes, whether it be a light bulb, an HVAC unit or a stove.\n\n“We’re laying the foundation for people in every year of this administration being able to lock in more ways to save money on energy bills,” Zaidi said. “One of the things we’ve heard loud and clear is how focused consumers are on not only recognizing that energy costs are front of mind now, but that there are these products that help them avoid impacts to their bottom line as energy costs fluctuate in the future.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/08/02/incandescent-light-bulb-ban-why/70508950007/", "title": "Incandescent light bulb ban: Reasons why you can't buy them ...", "text": "You can't buy incandescent light bulbs anymore.\n\nWith a few exceptions, the bulbs – patented by Thomas Edison in 1880 and a common fixture in American homes for more than a century – have officially passed into history. Since Aug. 1, commonly used incandescents can't be manufactured or sold, though you can still use the bulbs you've already purchased.\n\nBut when your supply of incandescents is gone, you'll probably be buying more energy-efficient and longer-lasting LEDs, or light-emitting diodes. LED prices have declined, a trend that's expected to continue.\n\nWe've known for years that incandescents were on the way out. Manufacturers and the government have sought new types of fixtures that would use less energy than Edison's pear-shaped glass bulb with a heated tungsten filament glowing inside.\n\nWhy are incandescents and CFLs being phased out?\n\nThe Energy Department, which set stricter energy standards for bulb makers, says the change will cut utility costs for Americans. Halogen bulbs, a type of incandescent, will also be phased out.\n\nCFLs, compact fluorescent bulbs, would also be phased out under new standards proposed by the Biden administration in December. The regulation could take effect in 2025.\n\nLEDs were invented in 1962 and were used for everyday lighting starting around 2008. They last longer, generate less heat and use less electricity to produce light. The Energy Department says:\n\nMeasures to phase out incandescent bulbs began in earnest in 2007 when President George W. Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act.\n\nOne of its goals was to increase energy efficiency, which included new standards for household appliances and incandescent lamps. The standards banned bulbs that produced fewer than 45 lumens, a measure of light, per watt, a unit of power.\n\nCompact fluorescent bulbs were invented in 1976. They were improved over the next decades and prices went down as their efficiency increased.\n\nHowever, fluorescent bulbs use small amounts of mercury, a toxic chemical, to convert electricity to light. Broken CFLs should be disposed of as hazardous items.\n\nWhat are the advantages of LED bulbs?\n\nIncandescent bulbs produce light by using electricity to heat a wire filament until it glows. The drawback is that the bulbs use 90% of their energy to produce heat. CFLs use about 80% for heat.\n\nLEDs work by sending electricity through a diode that generates light without much heat. You can unscrew an LED that's been lit for hours without burning yourself. However, LEDs should be placed where they won't heat surfaces or household items by prolonged exposure.\n\nIncandescents are less expensive to buy, but don't last as long as LEDs or CFLs, which cost less to us over the long run.\n\nHow three types of bulbs compare\n\nWhat's the difference between lumens and watts?\n\nLumens measure how much light is given off by a bulb. The higher the number of lumens, the brighter the bulb. Watts measure how much electricity a bulb uses.\n\nWith incandescent bulbs, watts used to be the measure for brightness. Now, with LEDs and CFLs producing more light using less electricity, consumers are advised to check lumens when choosing brightness.\n\nLED bulbs aren't perfect\n\nDepending on the quality of the bulb and the amount of wattage delivered, LEDs can sometimes flicker or become too dim or too bright or work erratically. New switches or fixtures can usually solve the problem.\n\nAnd while LEDs last much longer and don't burn out suddenly like incandescents, they can lose brightness over time, a condition called lumen depreciation. LEDs are usually replaced when their light output falls to 70% or less.\n\nSome white LEDs can emit a \"cooler\" light that's more on the blue side of the spectrum than incandescent bulbs. \"Daylight\" or \"natural\" LEDs produce what's considered a \"warmer\" color.\n\nAre all incandescent bulbs banned?\n\nNot all incandescents will be prohibited. The Energy Department lists exceptions, including:\n\nAppliance lamps.\n\nBlack light lamps.\n\nBug lamps.\n\nColored lamps.\n\nG-shape lamps with a diameter of 5 inches or more.\n\nGeneral service fluorescent lamps.\n\nHigh-intensity discharge lamps.\n\nInfrared lamps.\n\nTimeline of electric lighting legislation\n\n1880: Edison patents the electric incandescent light bulb.\n\n1976: First CFL is invented.\n\n2002: White LEDs for residential use are introduced.\n\n2007: Congress passes legislation to phase in more efficient incandescents.\n\n2010-2012: The Environmental Protection Agency releases specifications for LED bulbs as incandescent replacements.\n\n2019: Trump administration blocks regulation that would phase out older incandescent bulbs.\n\n2022: Biden administration reinstates phase-out of incandescents.

Lumens are a measure of brightness. The rule is an effective nail in the coffin for incandescent bulbs, which use a higher wattage than LED bulbs for the same amount of brightness.\n\nOld bulbs that don’t meet the new standard will need to be phased out of production within 75 days, and the Department of Energy will work with manufacturers to ease the transition. Full enforcement of the rule will go into effect in July 2023, which is also the deadline for retailers to stop selling them.\n\nThe move is the culmination of a decades-long, bipartisan effort to phase out inefficient light bulbs. Energy efficiency standards were included in an energy bill passed under the George W. Bush administration and implemented during the Obama administration.\n\nBut the Trump administration rolled those regulations back in 2019. Trump himself complained about the light coming from LED light bulbs, once telling House Republicans “I always look orange” in the energy-efficient lighting.\n\nThe new rules put enforcement teeth into a transition that’s been happening for years with the rise of energy efficient LED bulbs. The efficiency of LEDs mean they last much longer than incandescent bulbs: LED’s typically last 30,000 to 50,000 hours or longer, while incandescent bulbs last around 1,000 hours, according to DOE data.\n\nThe Energy Department estimates the rules will save US consumers close to $3 billion on their utility bills, and project it will also cut planet-warming carbon emissions by 222 million metric tons over the next 30 years.\n\n“By raising energy efficiency standards for light bulbs, we’re putting $3 billion back in the pockets of American consumers every year and substantially reducing domestic carbon emissions,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement. “The lighting industry is already embracing more energy efficient products, and this measure will accelerate progress to deliver the best products to American consumers and build a better and brighter future.”\n\nEven with the Trump administration’s delay, LED use has been increasing in US households. Nearly half of US households said they used LED bulbs for most or all their indoor lighting, according to the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey. It was a huge increase from the 2015 survey, where just 4% of households reported using LED’s for most or all indoor light use.\n\nEnvironmental groups applauded the Biden administration’s move on Tuesday.\n\n“We are long overdue to phase out inefficient old-fashioned light bulbs as this progress was illegally delayed by the Trump administration for more than two years,” Joe Vukovich, an energy efficiency advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “LED bulbs, which will replace the old incandescents, use one-sixth the amount of energy to deliver the same amount of light and last at least 10 times longer.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/politics/biden-tsa-cybersecurity-requirements-rail-operators/index.html", "title": "Biden administration issues new cybersecurity requirements for rail ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday released a directive requiring freight railroad owners and operators to tighten their security in the face of hacking threats from criminals and foreign governments.\n\nIt’s the latest move by US officials to use their policy authorities to try to boost cybersecurity in key sectors following the damaging ransomware attack on a major pipeline last year.\n\nThe new directive from the Transportation Security Administration requires rail companies to report hacking incidents to the Department of Homeland Security, and to have a plan to keep a cybersecurity incident from hampering their operations.\n\nRail operators, like other sectors, have to contend with a variety of hacking threats. In 2016, a ransomware attack affected the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, forcing authorities to turn off ticketing machines and turnstiles for metro stations for a weekend.\n\nAmericans saw the disruptive potential of a cyber incident last year when a pipeline company – which delivers some 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast – halted operations for days following a ransomware attack. The incident led to long lines at gas stations in multiple states.\n\nIn July, the TSA issued updated cybersecurity requirements for big US pipeline operators that give them more flexibility over the defensive measures they take. The revision came after criticism from the oil and gas industry claiming that the TSA’s initial requirements were too rigid and unrealistic.\n\nThe directive focuses on achieving key cybersecurity outcomes rather than dictating to pipelines how to achieve them. It also requires certain pipeline operators to maintain security controls that would allow industrial equipment to keep operating if IT systems were hacked. Pipeline operators are also required to have an incident response plan outlining how they would recover from a major cyberattack.\n\nFrustrated by lax security practices from some critical infrastructure firms, the Biden administration has issued a series of cybersecurity policy directives to get a better sense of which sectors were vulnerable and how often they were being hacked.\n\nUS officials are also working on cybersecurity requirements for the communications sector, including emergency warning systems, and standards for the water and health care sectors, senior White House official Anne Neuberger said last week.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/01/10/gas-stove-ban-us/11022254002/", "title": "Gas stove ban?

In October, Trumka recommended the agency seek public comment on the hazards associated with gas stoves after pollutants were linked to asthma and worsening respiratory conditions.\n\nGas stove use and child asthma\n\nPeer-reviewed research published in December in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health also found more than 12% of childhood asthma cases in the nation can be attributed to the use of a gas stove.\n\n\"Our results quantify the U.S. public health burden attributed to gas stove use and childhood asthma,\" researchers wrote. \"Further research is needed to quantify the burden experienced at the county levels, as well as the impacts of implementing mitigation strategies through intervention studies.\"\n\nIn a Dec. 21 letter addressed to CPSC chair Alexander Hoehn-Saric, lawmakers including Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Elizabeth Warren argued Black, Latino and low-income households are more likely to be affected by the effects, because they are either more likely to live near outdoor air pollution sources too or are in a home with poor ventilation.\n\nTulsa sister in custody after killing:12-year-old girl fatally stabs 9-year-old brother as parent slept in Oklahoma home, police say\n\nVentilation is where 'discussion should be'\n\nBut cooking produces emissions and harmful byproducts no matter what type of stove is used, according to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, which represents gas range manufacturers including Whirlpool Corp..\n\n“Ventilation is really where this discussion should be, rather than banning one particular type of technology,” Jill Notini, a vice president with the association told Bloomberg. “Banning one type of a cooking appliance is not going to address the concerns about overall indoor air quality. We may need some behavior change, we may need (people) to turn on their hoods when cooking.”\n\nThe American Gas Association pushed back against a natural gas ban in a December blog post saying it makes housing more costly because “electric homes require expensive retrofits.”\n\nBut President Joe Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act includes a rebate of up to $840 for an electric stove or other electric appliances, and up to an $500 to help cover costs of converting from gas to electric.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund covers trending news for USA TODAY.

Some carriers were charging customers flight change fees – even for flights canceled by the airline.\n\n“They cancel on you, and you have to pay a fee to rebook,” Biden said. “Come on, man. It’s just simply not fair. It’s not fair.”\n\nBiden’s comments came during a meeting of the White House Competition Council.

What will the nanny state think of next?\n\nContext is for chumps\n\nLike my reasonable friends at Fox News, I did not read beyond those three paragraphs to examine the potential health concerns involving childhood asthma – or to see that public comment on the issue won’t start until “later this winter” at the earliest and that nobody is actually coming to take my stove and there are other options being considered, like “setting standards on emissions from the appliances.”\n\nInstead, I looked at cogent reactions from Republican lawmakers like Rep. Ronny Jackson of Texas, who tweeted: “I’ll NEVER give up my gas stove. If the maniacs in the White House come for my stove, they can pry it from my cold dead hands. COME AND TAKE IT!!\"\n\nAnd I looked at a Fox News graphic that read, “My Kitchen My Choice,” with a chyron that incorrectly read, “Biden Wants to Ban Gas Stoves.”\n\nTime for patriotic gas-stove lovers to stand up to tyranny!\n\nAnd I listened to Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, who suggested the ban on gas stoves that the libs claim does not exist (on the spurious basis that it does not exist) is a “red line” Americans won’t tolerate. “I would counsel mass disobedience in the face of tyranny in this case,” Carlson said.\n\nAmen! I completely agree with what Carlson and others told me to think, and there’s no way I’m going to forgo my constitutional right to be in a continuous state of unbridled rage by “learning more about the issue” or “considering the fact that if a nanny state exists, it’s really, really bad at nannying since I still have a closet full of guns, a freezer full of hamburgers and a yard full of still-up Christmas decorations.”\n\nWhat if the gas stove is all that can save me from feminist M&Ms?\n\nSo though I was busy being outraged that they’re now selling M&M's in packages that show all-female M&M's, presumably some kind of left-wing wokeness-via-candy plot, I still took the time to tweet the following:\n\n“GO TO HELL, LIBS, A GAS STOVE COULD BE MY LAST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST RADICAL FEMINIST M&Ms AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF I'M GOING TO LET YOU AND HUNTER BIDEN TAKE IT FROM ME!!”\n\nI will NOT let your facts get in the way of my irrational anger!\n\nI then chained myself to the stove and ignored the follow-up Bloomberg News story that carried this headline: “No Ban of Gas Stoves Is Planned, Head of US Safety Agency Says.”\n\nI also disregarded this information in a Washington Post story about the gas stove issue: “According to one study, children living in a household with gas stoves have a 42 percent increased likelihood of already having asthma and a 24 percent increased risk of developing asthma at some point in their lifetime. Last week, scientists from the clean energy think tank RMI estimated in a peer-reviewed study that 12.7 percent of childhood asthmas could be attributed to living in a household with a gas stove.”\n\nSure, whatever you say, “science.” I’m not about to let peer-reviewed evidence of potential adverse health impacts on children stop me from protesting a federal ban I’m imagining. I’m too busy pushing for a local ban on drag queen story hours, which I KNOW are harming children based on the nones of peer-reviewed evidence I’ve been shown by no one.\n\nWhat's next, Biden? Cricket burgers cooked on electric stoves??\n\nNext thing the lamestream media is going to want me to stop being intermittently terrified that a massive migrant caravan is on its way to take my job (which presently involves angrily sitting on top of a gas stove) and turn my kids into woke socialists while the Biden administration outlaws cows and forces me to eat cricket burgers and nonbinary M&M’s.\n\nNo, I’ll remain chained to this stove for as long as it takes to defeat tyranny.\n\nOr at least until tomorrow, when I’m given a new thing to fear and feel apoplectically angry about.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on Twitter @RexHuppke and Facebook facebook.com/RexIsAJerk, or contact him at rhuppke@usatoday.com\n\nMore from Rex Huppke:\n\nHouse GOP heard the American voters.

It also wants to see new appliance efficiency standards from the Department of Energy. And it’s urging the Department of Interior to “do everything possible to end all new onshore and offshore leasing.”\n\nRicketts told CNN Evergreen is not pushing for increased executive action in lieu of Congressional action – they want both. As their report details, “multiple analyses have shown that these investments will need to be complemented by executive action if the US is going to reach this 2030 goal.”\n\n“The job isn’t done; failure’s not an option,” Ricketts said.\n\nEvergreen isn’t the only group that’s applying pressure ahead of the State of the Union.\n\nClimate Power also shared first with CNN its plan to spend over $600,000 on new ads touting clean energy to run nationwide. The ads will run on several TV networks, stations and news websites, including CNN, MSNBC and Axios.\n\nThe Center for American Progress will release an analysis the average consumer could save hundreds of dollars a year on energy costs if the government invests significantly in renewables like wind and solar.\n\n“It’s just connecting the dots for folks,” Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power told CNN. “We have a very narrow window if we’re going to lower emissions as much as we must. Because of all the advances in clean energy, it’s the cheapest energy source right now. And if we invest in it, it’s going to get cheaper.”\n\n2022 is a decisive year\n\nBiden began his presidency by promising to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nIn its first year, the administration introduced regulations to raise fuel mileage standards, phased out hydrofluorocarbons and passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that included $7.5 billion for a network of electric-vehicle charging stations around the country.\n\nBut climate groups haven’t gotten what they really want: Major legislation.\n\nOver $550 billion in climate and clean energy provisions were tucked into the Build Back Better Act, which is no longer being considered by the Senate. While some Senate Democrats are hopeful that a smaller, climate-central bill can be agreed on, there’s not much forward momentum in Congress.\n\nWith the clock running out for the 2022 midterms, climate advocates are getting nervous.\n\n“Where we are right now as a climate movement is feeling pretty panicked, I would say,” Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president for Energy and Environment Policy at the Center for American Progress told CNN.\n\nWhile all advocates CNN spoke to said strong administrative action is important, Goldfuss and others stressed Congress should pass significant investments in clean energy, especially $320 billion worth of clean energy tax credits in Biden’s bill, to help pave the way for regulation. They said Biden’s infrastructure bill, while a starting point, is not the whole ballgame.\n\nBuild Back Better’s climate commitments are “also what’s going to help the average household and business in their bottom line,” said Ryan Fitzpatrick, director of the Climate and Energy Program at center-left think tank Third Way. “We need to make sure we follow through with the second part of the agenda.”\n\nAs a new geopolitical crisis unfolds in Europe with potential repercussions for rising gas prices, other climate groups told CNN Biden and Congressional Democrats can’t lose focus on passing clean energy provisions to help Americans transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n“We need to see the White House and climate champions in Congress really make the case for investing in renewables at home now, as an answer to the fossil fuel fluctuations we see every decade, basically,” said Goldfuss. “What we’re seeing now that we’re facing inflation is just how important those climate investments are in driving down energy costs.”\n\nThe courts pose another potential roadblock for the administration. Republican attorneys general have already sued to block some of Biden’s climate initiatives, and the administration is facing a major US Supreme Court case over power plant emissions regulations – even though it has not yet implemented its own power plant rules.\n\nRicketts said that even with a tough legal landscape, Biden’s agencies should forge ahead with bold steps to bring down carbon emissions dramatically.\n\n“The administration can only do what the administration can do,” Ricketts said. “They can’t and should not anticipate future roadblocks and use those as excuses not to do something. They’ve got to use every tool they’ve got access to.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}]}

File early ...", "text": "It’s almost a new year, but there’s still something about 2023 that needs to be wrapped up: your taxes.\n\nTax season typically opens in late January when the IRS officially starts accepting and processing tax filings. You usually have until April 15 to file, unless it's a holiday or weekend, which gives you more time to submit your taxes.\n\nProfessionals, however, urge most people to prepare now and get them done as soon as possible, if for no other reason than to get their refund quicker.\n\n“Refunds were down a little last year due to waning pandemic benefits, but I think it has settled and may be up because of inflation adjustments,” said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at tax preparer Jackson Hewitt.\n\nLast year, the average tax refund by the April deadline was $2,753, down from the prior year’s $3,012, when pandemic-related benefits helped boost refunds, the IRS said.\n\nHow does inflation affect my taxes and refund?\n\nThe IRS makes annual inflation adjustments to many tax provisions, including tax brackets, standard deductions, 401(k) and IRA contributions. Here are just a few examples of how these tweaks could help you with your taxes this year:\n\nIncome thresholds for 2023 tax brackets were adjusted up by a record 7% because of soaring inflation. So, if your taxable income stayed relatively flat, you could end up in a lower tax bracket with a lower tax rate that goes with it.\n\nSingle filers with taxable income of $41,776 to $89,075, for example, were in the 22% federal income tax bracket last year. For 2023, that bracket applies to single filers with taxable income of $44,725 to $95,375.\n\nSo, if you have $42,000 of taxable income in 2022 and 2023, you’ll move from the 22% federal tax bracket to the 12% bracket when you file your 2023 tax return.\n\nStandard deductions also were adjusted up by about 7%, meaning more of your income will escape tax. Nearly 90% of American taxpayers take the standard deduction, the IRS said.\n\nIncreased contribution limits for 401(k) and IRAs allow you to shield more income from taxes. Contributions are made with pretax money and not taxed until withdrawn unless they are added to Roth accounts. Roth accounts are funded with after-tax money and withdrawals are not taxed.\n\nMaking the rich pay more:Flush with new funding, the IRS zeroes in on the taxes of uber-wealthy Americans\n\nWhy should I file my taxes early?\n\nA refund is usually the biggest incentive to file your taxes early. Three out of 4 taxpayers will likely get a refund, and “for most Americans, it’s the single largest payday of the year,” Steber said.\n\nHowever, there are other reasons to file early too. They include:\n\nLocking down your information. Once you file and the IRS has your return, no one can steal your information and try to file a return on your behalf and steal your refund.\n\nOnce you file and the IRS has your return, no one can steal your information and try to file a return on your behalf and steal your refund. More time to file an accurate return. If you or your tax preparer find a mistake, you have more time to correct it. Filing an accurate return will ensure you’ll get your refund quickly if you’re due one and cut the chances of any IRS questions or audits.\n\nIf you or your tax preparer find a mistake, you have more time to correct it. Filing an accurate return will ensure you’ll get your refund quickly if you’re due one and cut the chances of any IRS questions or audits. Time to prepare finances in case you owe money. If you owe money, it’s better to find out sooner than later so you can come up with the money. Even if you file your taxes early, you still have until the April deadline to pay.\n\nWhen can I get started?\n\nThough you can't officially submit your taxes to the IRS until it says it's ready to accept them, you can begin to prepare them as soon as you receive all your 2023 tax information from employers, banks, and other financial institutions. You should start receiving and collecting this in January.\n\nOnce you've received everything, you can begin preparing your tax forms so they're ready to go as soon as the IRS says \"Go!\"\n\nIf you use a tax preparer, they can put them in the queue to be automatically filed as soon as the IRS opens tax season, and you can be among the first to file taxes, and hopefully, receive a refund, Steber said.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

When will I get my refund?", "text": "Tax Day is coming, and if you are the sort who works best against a deadline, we can give you several to pencil into your calendar.\n\nWhen is the filing deadline for 2024?\n\nTaxes are due by April 15, which falls on a Monday. If you don't expect to file by then, you can request a six-month extension.\n\nWhat happens if I miss the tax deadline?\n\nIf you fail to file your federal tax return on time, the standard penalty is a whopping 5% of any tax due for every month the return is late, up to 25% of the unpaid balance. If you file a return but fail to pay any taxes you owe, or if you get an extension, you typically face a much smaller monthly penalty of 0.5% of any unpaid amount.\n\nTax season can be terrifying.Here's everything to know before filing your taxes in 2024.\n\nAre there exceptions to the April 15 tax deadline?\n\nYes. The IRS extends the annual tax deadline for taxpayers who live or do business in areas afflicted by disasters and for people in states with local holidays.\n\nA complete list of disaster-related extensions is on their website.\n\nMaine and Massachusetts tax deadline\n\nResidents of Massachusetts and Maine have until April 17 to file their federal tax returns because of state holidays.\n\nTennessee tax deadline\n\nIndividuals and businesses in parts of Tennessee affected by the series of severe storms and tornadoes that began on Dec. 9 now have until June 17 to file their taxes.\n\nTax deadline for taxpayers impacted by Israel terrorist attacks\n\nIndividuals and businesses affected by the recent terrorist attacks in Israel now have until Oct. 7 to file their taxes.\n\nDeadline for filing income tax returns that have received extensions\n\nIf you request an extension, you'll have until Oct. 15 to file your return. Importantly, that doesn't buy you more time to pay your taxes. You'll still have to pay any amount due to avoid penalties, but you'll have more time to complete your tax forms.\n\n1099 deadline\n\nIf you're a freelancer, an independent contractor, or earn income from other sources outside of a traditional job, you should have received a 1099 tax form by Feb. 15.

When is the latest? Have the income brackets changed? What about deductions?\n\nHere are answers to 13 common questions that crop up in the weeks before tax season begins:\n\nWhen is the tax deadline in 2024?\n\nApril 15. Tax Day always falls on that date, unless April 15 falls on a weekend or holiday. Next year, it comes on that darkest of days, a Monday.\n\nWhen does tax season start?\n\nLate January. In 2023, the IRS set Jan. 23 as the official start of tax season, marking the date the agency began accepting 2022 tax returns.\n\nHow early can I file my 2023 taxes?\n\nAgain, late January. The IRS has not yet set the date it will begin accepting 2023 returns.\n\nWhat are the new income tax brackets?\n\nIncome tax brackets jumped by 7% for 2023. Income tax is progressive: the more you earn, the more you pay as a percentage of your earnings. Each bracket represents a range of incomes subject to a particular income tax rate. Tax brackets will rise again in 2024.\n\nHere are the 2023 tax brackets:\n\nFor individual filers:\n\n◾ 37% for incomes over $578,125.\n\n◾ 35% for incomes over $231,250.\n\n◾ 32% for incomes over $182,100.\n\n◾ 24% for incomes over $95,375.\n\n◾ 22% for incomes over $44,725.\n\n◾ 12% for incomes over $11,000.\n\n◾ 10% for income below $11,000.\n\nFor married couples filing jointly:\n\n◾ 37% for income greater than $693,750.\n\n◾ 35% for incomes over $462,500.\n\n◾ 32% for incomes over $364,200.\n\n◾ 24% for incomes over $190,750.\n\n◾ 22% for incomes over $89,450.\n\n◾ 12% for incomes over $22,000.\n\n◾ 10% for income below $22,000.\n\nWhat is the new standard deduction?\n\nThe standard deduction for 2023 also increased by about 7%, to $13,850 for individuals and $27,700 for married couples filing jointly.\n\nWhat is the standard deduction for seniors?\n\nPeople over 65 qualify for an additional standard deduction. For 2023, it’s $1,850 if you are single or filing as a head of household, and $1,500 for married taxpayers. Both figures increased by $100 over 2022.\n\nHave itemized deductions changed?\n\nItemized deductions “mostly remain the same” in 2023, according to Charles Schwab. A few specifics:\n\n◾ State and local taxes: Taxpayers who itemize may deduct up to $10,000 in property, sales, or income taxes they have already paid to local or state governments.\n\n◾ Mortgage interest: You can generally deduct interest paid on the first $750,000 of mortgage debt, according to NerdWallet. People who bought a house before Dec. 16, 2017, may deduct interest on the first $1 million.\n\n◾ Medical expenses: You may deduct only medical and dental expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income.\n\nWhat are the new IRA and 401(k) contribution limits?\n\nEmployees who participate in company retirement plans could generally contribute $22,500 to their 401(k) this year, up from $20,500 in 2022. Those who didn’t participate in an employer-sponsored plan could contribute $6,500 to an individual retirement account (IRA). People 50 and older have higher limits.\n\nFor 2024, the limits rise to $23,000 and $7,000.\n\nWhat is the new health savings account (HSA) contribution limit?\n\nHSA contribution limits were $3,850 for individual coverage and $7,750 for family coverage in 2023, according to Fidelity. In 2024, they rise to $4,150 and $8,300.\n\nWhat is the income limit for child tax credits?\n\nThe 2023 child tax credit is worth up to $2,000 per qualifying dependent under age 17, according to NerdWallet. The credit decreases if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000, or $400,000 for a married couple filing jointly.\n\nWhat’s the difference between filing as single or head of household?\n\nYou can claim “Head of Household” status if you are single or unmarried and maintain a household that includes a child or relative. The status provides for a larger standard deduction and more generous tax rates, according to H&R Block.\n\nEarly birds:Your single largest payday may be a 2023 tax filing away. File early to get a refund sooner\n\nWhere can I find a tax refund estimator?\n\nTurboTax, H&R Block, NerdWallet and AARP all offer tax refund estimators.\n\nWhen can I expect my refund?\n\nIn a month or less, in most cases. The IRS says it issues most refunds within 21 calendar days. Paper returns, however, can take four weeks or more.

If you're not ready, file for an automatic extension to Oct 16.\n\nRemember, an extension of time is not an extension to pay. So to avoid penalties, include a payment.\n\nAnd if you're self-employed, don't forget first-quarter estimated payments are due April 18, too.\n\nThere are only two weeks left before the April 18 tax deadline, and if you haven't filed your taxes yet, you'd better hurry up and do it or file an extension to avoid penalties and interest.\n\nFor the week ended March 24, less than half the number of Americans the IRS expects to file individual returns had done so. Only about 80.7 million returns had been received, down 0.8% from the same time a year earlier and well below the more than 168 million individual returns the IRS forecast for this season.\n\nThat likely means there'll be many late filers this year – both those who scramble to meet the April 18 midnight deadline or those who should file an extension to Oct. 16.\n\nIf you're in the first camp, the good news is the IRS is processing returns and churning out refunds faster than in 2022. It has so far processed 1.9% more returns compared with the same time last year and issued 2.6% more refunds. The bad news is the average refund is down 11% to $2,903.\n\nBut if you need to file an extension, here's what you need to know.\n\nTax Day 2023 live updates:Deadline to file tax returns is April 18.

You should estimate and pay any owed taxes by your regular deadline to help avoid possible penalties.\n\nDeadline for filing income tax returns that have received an extension\n\nAn extension request must be filed by the normal April 18 tax deadline. Since it's automatic as soon as you file it, your new deadline will be Oct. 16. If you owe taxes and don't file for an extension, the IRS will charge you a steep penalty for failing to file.\n\nIf you're due a refund or not required to file, you won't be charged a penalty, according to the IRS. However, experts say that could be a risky strategy. If you miscalculated and end up owing money, you could end up paying a big penalty.\n\nSometimes you just need more time:How long should you wait before filing taxes? Surprise! Later can sometimes be better\n\nImportant info:Are you ready to file your taxes? Here's everything you need to know to file taxes in 2023.\n\nHow to request an extension for a tax return\n\nFiling for an extension is simple and free. You'll need basic information like name, address, Social Security number, estimated tax liability, and payment if you owe anything. Only those who owe less than $1,000 or paid at least 90% of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year or 100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year, whichever amount is less, can avoid an underpayment penalty, the IRS says.\n\nIndividual tax filers, regardless of income, can use IRS Free File to electronically request an extension. Or you can electronically pay all or part of your estimated income tax due and indicate the payment is for an extension. Payments can be made with Direct Pay using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) or with a credit or debit card.\n\nIf you prefer to mail in a paper version of form 4868, make sure it's postmarked no later than April 18.\n\nTax avoidance goals:Wondering how to avoid taxes?

IRS might offer more time to file\n\nResidents in states affected by a natural disaster could get more time to file returns and pay the IRS.\n\nFor example, Mississippi storm and tornado victims now have until July 31 to file various federal individual and business tax returns and make tax payments.\n\nMississippi was hit by tornadoes and severe storms on March 24 and 25.\n\nResidents in other states could see relief as well, including Californians and New Yorkers hit by severe snowstorms and/or flooding this past winter.\n\nLast-minute tax benefits:The tax deadline is a month away. Here are some contributions you can still make – and deduct.\n\nUnemployment and taxes:Laid off last year? What you need to know about filing your tax return after a layoff\n\nWhat happens if you file taxes late?\n\nIf you're receiving a refund, there's no penalty, according to the IRS. But if you don't file a return within three years, usually from the April deadline, you could lose the refund.\n\nIf you owe money, you face two penalties:\n\nFailure to file, which the IRS says will cost \"5% of the unpaid taxes for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late. The penalty won't exceed 25% of your unpaid taxes.\" However, if your return is more than 60 days late, a minimum penalty kicks in – which is the lesser of $450 or 100% of the tax owed. For example, if you owed $2,000, the penalty would be $100 in the first month, but after the first 60 days, the minimum penalty of $450 would kick in. The penalty would remain at $450 until the fifth month, when the penalty would max out at 25% of the $2,000 in unpaid taxes, or $500.\n\nFailure to pay, which amounts to 0.5% of your unpaid taxes plus interest but won't exceed 25% of your unpaid taxes. So, if you owed $1,000, the penalty would be $5 each month, maxing out at $250.\n\nIf both penalties are applied in the same month, the failure-to-file penalty will be reduced by the amount of the failure-to-pay penalty applied in that month. For example, instead of a 5% failure-to-file penalty for the month, IRS would apply a 4.5% failure-to-file penalty and a 0.5% failure-to-pay penalty.\n\nOn top of those penalties, the IRS charges interest on unpaid balances. The IRS updates the interest rate each quarter, but currently, individuals will be charged 7%.\n\nInflation relief curveball:IRS: Wait to file your taxes if you received an inflation relief check in 2022\n\nCar credits:Should I buy an EV? Your buying guide on big discounts, tax credits and when to buy.\n\nWhat if I can't pay?\n\nFile your taxes or file for an extension anyway. As you can see from the examples above, the failure-to-file penalty is much steeper than the failure-to-pay penalty. Also, making a payment, even a partial payment, will help limit penalty and interest charges.\n\nThe IRS offers taxpayers a few options:\n\nOnline payment plans that can be applied immediately. Short-term payment plans for 180 days or less for amounts less than $100,000 in combined tax, penalties and interest or long-term payment plans longer than 180 days, paid monthly for amounts less than $50,000 in combined tax, penalties and interest.\n\nfor 180 days or less for amounts less than $100,000 in combined tax, penalties and interest or longer than 180 days, paid monthly for amounts less than $50,000 in combined tax, penalties and interest.

How to amend your ...", "text": "Millions of people were entitled to exclude up to $10,200 in 2020 unemployment benefits from income.\n\nSince the change came after tax season opened, the IRS said it would auto-correct early returns.\n\nIt issued 12 million refunds from the corrections, but there may be more people entitled to a refund that it missed.\n\nIf you're one of them, you need to amend your 2020 return. Accountants warn this is no easy task.\n\nMany Americans may still be owed money from their 2020 tax year returns but are now on their own to find and claim it.\n\nUnder the American Rescue Plan Act, individuals who received unemployment benefits in 2020 could exclude from their taxable income up to $10,200 (or double that for couples) if they earned less than $150,000 per year.\n\nSince this one-time pandemic-relief change came in March 2021, after tax season started, and 76 million Americans had already filed their taxes, the IRS said it would make the corrections for people.\n\nEarlier this month, though, IRS said it was finished with its corrections and anyone it may have missed would now have to file an amended return.\n\nBasically, the IRS has shifted back the burden of correcting old tax returns to taxpayers. Though it’s hard to quantify exactly how many people are affected, accountants warn this could be quite a burden for the unlucky ones who have to file a 1040-X, the amended tax form needed to correct the issue.\n\n“Most likely, the 1040-X is not intuitive,” said Ryan Losi, executive vice president at certified public accounting firm PIASCIK. Most people who must amend their returns will likely have to pay someone to help them or buy additional software to figure it out, accountants warn.\n\nImportant stuff:Are you ready to file your taxes? Here's everything you need to know to file taxes in 2023.\n\nDeadlines:Tax season 2023 officially started: Here are key deadlines to keep in mind\n\nWhat makes filing an amendment so complicated?\n\nIt's not as simple as just subtracting the unemployment benefits from your taxable income, or adjusted gross income (AGI), explains Mark Steber, chief tax information officer at tax preparer Jackson Hewitt.\n\n“You have to consider what else is in the return,” he said. That's because changes in AGI can directly affect the deductions and credits you are eligible for. “You might qualify for some of those now.”\n\nIn the approximately 14 million returns the IRS corrected, the agency even noted many of the adjustments included corrections to the:\n\nEarned Income Tax Credit\n\nRecovery Rebate Credit\n\nAdditional Child Tax Credit\n\nAmerican Opportunity Tax Credit\n\nPremium Tax Credit\n\nAdvance Premium Tax Credit\n\nAdditionally, state income tax returns might have to be amended, Steber said. Many states with income tax use your federal taxable income as the starting point for calculating your state taxable income.\n\nBetter footing:IRS tax backlog smaller leading into 2023 tax season than it was in 2022\n\nDouble your money:File your taxes early for a chance to double your refund money with Jackson Hewitt\n\nOne last wrinkle is that amended returns must still go through the old IRS manual process behind the scenes, even if they are filed electronically. Once the IRS receives them, \"someone still has to key it in manually,” Steber said. That means it will take at least a few months to get a refund if you’re owed one, and that’s if there are no problems.\n\nIs it worth it to file an amended tax return?\n\nIt depends on whether you think you’re due a refund and how much it might be. The amended returns can’t be filed via IRS free file, and of the roughly 14 million returns the IRS corrected, it said it issued 12 million refunds totaling $14.8 billion, with an average refund of $1,232.\n\nFirst, check your 2020 tax return to see if you included the unemployment compensation exclusion on your 1040. If you received jobless benefits and didn't enter an exclusion, you could try to calculate what you might have overpaid using the IRS' unemployment compensation exclusion worksheet. It might be hard, though, to tell how much the unemployment exclusion would affect your federal and state returns, so Steber suggests considering taking your return to a professional for a look.\n\nWhat you'll pay:What are the 2022 US federal tax brackets?

Steber says fees vary due to location and how complicated the return is but “usually, it’s a pretty low fee.”\n\nIf you're still stumped or having tax issues, consumers can also tap the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS, for help.\n\nWho has to file a tax return: It's not necessary for everyone.

But even if you're sleep-deprived and haven't left your home in months, you still have to find the time to prepare a return.\n\nWith a new child, your taxes will get more complicated. But the flip side is you may qualify for a slew of new tax credits and deductions.\n\nHere's what new parents need to know for the 2024 tax season:\n\nGet a Social Security card for your child\n\nThe first order of business is to make sure your child has a Social Security number, said John Karls, a tax partner at Armanino, a national tax advisory firm. \"You can't claim your child as a dependent on your tax return if they don't have a Social Security number.\"\n\nIf you don't already have one for your child, you should apply now. But it could take awhile for the Social Security Administration to verify your child's birth certificate and identity, so Karls recommends filing for a six-month tax extension while you wait.\n\nWhen can you file taxes this year?Here's when the 2024 tax season opens.\n\nTax season 2024:Tax deadlines to keep in mind with Tax Day coming up\n\nHead of household status\n\nIf you're a single parent, for tax purposes you're considered the head of the household. That means you'll be able to claim a $20,800 standard deduction versus a $13,850 standard deduction for single filers without dependents.\n\nThere are also separate, more favorable tax brackets for heads of households.\n\nImportantly, the IRS won't automatically recognize that you're a single parent and thereby qualify for head-of-household status. You'll have to manually check a box yourself, or inform your tax preparer.\n\nIf you're married and cover more than half of your child's expenses, you would also be considered a head of household, but only if you file separately from your spouse.\n\nHow much do you get back in taxes for a child in 2023?\n\nGenerally, people think having a child will automatically lower their tax bill or trigger a larger refund. But in many cases, it depends on your income. Lower-income taxpayers are generally eligible for more generous tax credits and deductions after having or adopting a child, said Jim Daniels, a CPA and managing director at UHY Advisors, a tax and consulting services firm.\n\nAdoption tax credit\n\nIf you adopted a child in 2023, you may be able to qualify for a credit of up to $15,950 in adoption-related expenses you incurred per child. This could include adoption-related attorney fees, adoption fees, traveling expenses and more.\n\nTo claim the full credit, your modified adjusted gross income, which is generally close to your adjusted gross income, must be below $239,230. After that, the credit phases out and is not available for people who have a modified gross adjusted income of $279,230.\n\nThe credit is not refundable, meaning if you don't owe any taxes, you won't be able to claim the credit. However, you can carry it forward to reduce your tax liability in the future.\n\nHow much is the Child Tax Credit this year? What are the qualifications?\n\nIf you became a parent in 2023, you could qualify for the Child Tax Credit if you have an adjusted gross income of less than $200,000 or less than $400,000 if you're filing a joint return with a spouse.\n\nChild and dependent care credit income limit\n\nIf you are employed and pay for child care services, you may qualify for the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. To qualify, you must have earned income in 2023 and have work-related care expenses, among other rules. You can seek the credit for up to $3,000 of expenses for one child, $6,000 for two or more children. The actual credit is a percentage of those expenses. See IRS Publication 503 for the formulas.\n\nEITC qualifications\n\nHaving a child could make you eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. If you have one child and your adjusted gross income was $46,560 (filing alone) or $53,120 (filing jointly with a spouse), you could claim up to $3,995 in a refundable tax credit.\n\nMake adjustments to your W-4 withholding\n\nFinally, if you haven't already, you should make sure to fill out a new W-4 form if you have an employer, to reflect that you now have a dependent. This will likely lower the refund you get next year, but it will increase the size of your paychecks going forward, Daniels said, because less money will be withheld.\n\nMore of your 2024 tax season questions answered\n\nNew Federal tax brackets for 2023-2024.

By mid-May, more than 142 million taxpayers had filed returns, according to the IRS. But the agency expected about 168 million returns, which means more than 25 million taxpayers were waiting beyond the April 18 deadline to file.\n\nNow, there's no more procrastinating. The final deadline to file your tax return is Monday. If you don’t meet it, expect to start accumulating hefty penalties. The late-filing penalty “can be 10 times as costly as the penalty for not paying,” the IRS said.\n\nHow much are IRS penalties if I miss the deadline?\n\nThe failure-to-file penalty depends on how late your filing is and how much you owe, and the clock started on the original due date of April 18, not the Oct. 16 extension deadline. Interest is also charged on penalties, meaning your balance will continue to balloon until it’s paid in full.\n\nThe interest rate for an individual's unpaid taxes is 7%, compounded daily. The monthly late-filing penalty is generally 5% and the late-payment penalty is normally 0.5%. Both max out at 25%, the IRS said.\n\nEven if you owe money you can’t pay, file anyway. “The worst thing to do is not to file,” said Phil Drudy, managing director and head of tax at CBIZ MHM’s New York Tax Department.\n\nCalifornia extension:California taxpayers get extended federal, state tax deadlines due to 2023 winter storms\n\nWhat if I can’t pay my tax bill?\n\n“If you owe money, file your return and then go start the process of working out a plan. There are several legitimate ways to pay off your debt,” Drudy said.\n\nMost people can set up a payment plan on IRS.gov to pay off their balance over time. Some may opt to get a loan or pay by credit card to resolve a tax debt, the IRS said.\n\nIf you owe both federal and state taxes, try to pay off your state tax debt first.\n\n“States, for the most part, don’t have as robust plans and mechanisms to pay over time, and they can become very aggressive, depending on the state,” Drudy said. “Some states have private collection agencies you’ll have to deal with if you don’t pay your taxes.”\n\nState penalties for late filings and payments are also generally higher than IRS ones, he added.\n\nWhat about my FTX holdings?\n\nAfter the government filed criminal charges against FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and some fellow executives when the company imploded, more than a million taxpayers were in limbo last spring, not knowing if they could use the IRS theft loss rule. That rule allows you to claim the loss as an itemized deduction if the theft was considered illegal in the state where it occurred and it was done with criminal intent.\n\nSome may have even filed for a tax extension, hoping for clarification from the IRS on how to handle potential crypto losses from the scandal.\n\nBut “nothing has changed with FTX,” Drudy said. “We’re still in limbo.” Bankman-Fried's trial has only recently begun, so a resolution won’t come in time, he said.\n\nThe way Drudy sees it, taxpayers have three choices:\n\nIf you have gains you want to use your crypto losses against, work with tax and financial advisers to determine if you can pinpoint a time in 2022 when your holdings could be declared worthless.\n\nIf you want to “abandon” your holding, you can send your crypto to a null address and take a loss. However, it’s too late to do this for your 2022 taxes. It’ll count against your 2023 tax year gains.\n\nDo nothing and continue waiting for IRS guidance. “I wouldn’t look to abandon unless I knew for a fact it had no value,” Drudy said.\n\nWhat happens if you're late paying:Delaying on taxes? Here's what happens if you don't pay on time.\n\nAre there any exceptions to the deadline?\n\nOn Friday, the IRS granted a special extension until Oct. 7, 2024 to \"individuals and businesses affected by the terrorist attacks in the State of Israel.\"\n\nThe relief applies to individuals with a principal residence in Israel, the West Bank or Gaza Strip, as well as a business or sole proprietor whose principal place of business is in the covered area. Other circumstances qualify, too. However, the IRS noted those who had requested a valid extension earlier and were facing an Oct. 16 filing deadline now, must still pay taxes owed on Monday. It is only an extension to file, not an extension to pay.\n\nOtherwise, those with an address on record with the IRS covered by Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster declarations and those returning from a combat zone may have additional time to file.\n\nThey include:\n\n◾ Taxpayers affected by flooding in Illinois and Alaska have until Oct. 31 to file.\n\n◾ Those affected by flooding in Vermont have until Nov. 15 to file.\n\n◾ Taxpayers affected by recent natural disasters, including those impacted by the recent Maui fires and hurricane Idalia in parts of Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Those people have until Feb. 24 to file various individual and business tax returns. Taxpayers potentially affected by recent storms should visit the disaster relief page on IRS.gov for the latest information.\n\n◾ Members of the military and others serving in a combat zone typically have 180 days after they leave the combat zone to file returns and pay any taxes due.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf your taxes are due, file no matter what.\n\nEven if you’re unsure about all the line items, \"you can include a statement to say the filing is to the best of your knowledge and you will adjust the filing, if necessary,” Drudy said. “What matters if they ever come and you get audited, you can say I acted in good faith\" and have a better chance for reduced penalties.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

That’s why it’ll be important to pay even closer attention to your return to ensure you get the tax refund you can, accountants say.\n\nThe IRS warned on Tuesday that tax refunds may be smaller because there were no stimulus payments in 2022. Additionally, it noted a pandemic-era exception in 2020 and 2021 that allowed those taking the standard deduction to claim a tax deduction of up to $300 for cash donations to charity hasn’t been extended. The only way, again, to write off gifts to charity is to itemize.\n\nThat can be alarming to millions of Americans who rely on tax refunds for large purchases, savings, investments or paying off debt. In 2022, 46% of taxpayers said they were relying on their refunds to do some of those things, a LendingTree survey showed.\n\nTax experts say, however, that you shouldn't worry yet. “There are still many tax benefits, credits, deductions and many ways to pay the minimum amount of taxes you owe and get the biggest refund you can,” said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt.\n\nWhat are some basic tax preparation steps to take now?\n\nGet organized. “You do not have to be super-organized with a file cabinet and records valet,” Steber said. “A simple method of shoebox or large envelope will work.

If you use a professional, make sure the person is trusted, trained and experienced.\n\nWhat are some tax changes you need to know this year?\n\nPeople who have part-time work, side hustles, or just sell the occasional goods on Etsy or eBay will need to be vigilant for Form 1099-K. Anyone who sells $600 or more in a calendar year of services or goods and accepts payments using third-party networks, such as Venmo, PayPal or debit or credit cards, will receive a 1099-K with these transactions, and you must report this income or risk an automatic IRS notice or even an audit, said Ryan Losi, executive vice president of PIASCIK, a certified public accounting firm.\n\nThis change came from passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Before that, the reporting threshold was for taxpayers with more than 200 transactions worth an aggregate above $20,000.\n\nGifts to charity can be written off only if you itemize your deductions. This contrasts with the last two years, when those taking the standard deduction could claim a tax deduction of up to $300 for cash donations to charity.\n\nStill waiting:Is the IRS still processing 2020 unemployment tax refund? Yes. For many, the wait continues\n\nTax benefit if you can get it:IRS raises 2023 retirement savings cap, but few even hit it. Here's what you can do about it.\n\nWhat are some tips to lower your tax bill or get a bigger refund?\n\nCheck eligibility for the premium tax credit, a refundable credit that helps eligible individuals and families cover the premiums for their health insurance purchased through the Health Insurance Marketplace. A refundable credit means that if the credit exceeds the amount of taxes owed, you’re refunded the difference.\n\nFor tax years 2021 and 2022, eligibility was temporarily expanded by eliminating the rule that a taxpayer with household income above 400% of the federal poverty line cannot qualify for a premium tax credit. If you received unemployment compensation at all during the year, your income automatically qualifies.\n\nCheck eligibility for the clean vehicle credit. Until Dec. 31, buyers of certain electric vehicles can benefit from the federal tax credit of $7,500.\n\nUntil Dec. 31, buyers of certain electric vehicles can benefit from the federal tax credit of $7,500. Harvest losses. Go through your investment holdings and you’re likely to find some losses this year. If you sold at a loss, you can use that to reduce your taxable capital gains and possibly offset up to $3,000 of your ordinary income.\n\n\"If you have more losses, the excess will carry forward and you can use it next year,” Losi said. Just remember to use them, he said.\n\nHow early should I file my taxes?\n\nIt's advice accountants give every year: File as early as you can once tax season opens, typically in late January. Here’s why, according to Steber:\n\nTypically, 3 out of 4 taxpayers get a refund each year, and 2022 will probably be the same. So, file early, get your money early – it's that simple\n\nIf you file early, you lock up your personal data with the IRS and states, so no one can file a fake tax return and try to steal your refund\n\nIf you file early and your tax professional finds another deduction or credit that might need some new or more data, you have time to get those records and won’t be up against a last-minute deadline\n\nIf you owe money and file early, you can still pay at midnight on the last day when taxes are due and still file your tax return and protect your data. Filing your taxes and paying your taxes don’t have to be done at the same time.\n\nThe IRS warned this week that taxpayers shouldn't rely on receiving their refund this year by a certain date, especially when making major purchases or paying bills, because some returns may require additional review and may take longer.\n\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

And the range of income subject to each of those rates is called a tax bracket.\n\nThe more you earn, the higher your “top” rate – that’s the rate at which your last dollar is taxed.\n\nThe IRS inflation adjustments amount to a roughly 7% increase in each bracket.\n\nStarting next year, here are the amounts of income that will apply to each rate:\n\n10% applies to the first $11,000 of income for single filers ($22,000 for married couples filing jointly).\n\n12% applies to income over $11,000 ($22,000 for joint filers)\n\n22% applies to income over $44,725 ($89,450 for joint filers)\n\n24% applies to incomes over $95,375 ($190,750 for joint filers)\n\n32% applies to incomes over $182,100 ($364,200 for joint filers)\n\n37% applies to incomes over $578,125 ($693,750 for joint filers)\n\nStandard deduction\n\nThe standard deduction, which most filers claim, will go up by $900 to $13,850 for single people and by $1,800 to $27,700 for married couples filing jointly.\n\nThe standard deduction is the dollar amount that those who don’t itemize deductions can subtract from their adjustable gross income before federal income tax is applied.\n\nHealthcare Flexible Spending Account contribution limits\n\nNext year, you will be allowed to contribute up to $3,050 to a flexible spending account, which can cover some out-of-pocket healthcare costs not covered by health insurance. That money is deductible so it will reduce the amount of tax taken out of your paycheck. If your employer’s plan also allows you to carry over unused portions of your FSA amount, the maximum carryover permitted will be $610, $40 higher than this year’s maximum.\n\nEarned Income Tax Credit\n\nThe Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) enables low-income workers to keep more of their paycheck. However, they will not get paid the money until they file their 2023 taxes in early 2024.\n\nThe IRS raised the maximum amounts one can claim for the EITC by about 7%.\n\nFor example, a qualifying taxpayer with three or more qualifying children could get an EITC of up to $7,430 in 2023, up from $6,935 this year.", "authors": ["Jeanne Sahadi"], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}]}

Tate Reeves defeats Democratic challenger Brandon Presley\n\nRepublican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves won reelection on Tuesday, officially defeating Democratic challenger candidate Brandon Presley.\n\nReeves was favored in part because he – like other Southern Republicans – cast his opponent as a tool of national Democrats who support abortion rights and other policies rejected by conservatives from coast to coast.\n\n\"Joe Biden and his buddies have funded his campaign,\" Reeves said last week during his debate with Presley, which was marked by insults and interruptions.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nAnother blow to Youngkin: Virginia Democrats win House majority\n\nDemocrats in Virginia took the House of Delegates majority back from Republicans Tuesday, dealing Gov. Glenn Youngkin a major setback.\n\nYoungkin had rallied Republicans in the state behind a vision of a red Virginia and total Republican legislature. Democrats already put a stop to the governor's plans earlier on election night by holding their state Senate majority.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nBiden fares better than Youngkin on Virginia election night\n\nPresident Joe Biden released his list of Virginia endorsements over the weekend, including 23 Democrats running for both the House of Delegates and state Senate.

Tate Reeves and congratulated him on the win.\n\n— Lici Beveridge\n\nDemocrats declare success in Virginia\n\nDemocrats Tuesday effectively won Virginia by holding on to their state Senate majority and officially stunting Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Republicans’ plans for a red Virginia.\n\nDemocrats had said they were “cautiously optimistic” heading into Election Day, particularly about their chances in the upper chamber. The deciding seat was called just before midnight Tuesday.\n\nTheir success means Youngkin will have an uphill battle with his proposed 15-week abortion limit, which Democrats in the state already blocked in January. Candidates on the left made abortion a top campaign message in 2023, and the final outcome could be a bellwether for 2024.\n\nHeather Williams, interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Monday that Democrats would consider winning just one chamber “a huge win.”\n\n“With this victory, Gov. Youngkin has been denied a governing trifecta and our newly elected majority stands ready to defend Virginia from Republican extremism,” Williams said in a statement Tuesday evening.\n\nThe House of Delegates majority has yet to be called, though Democrats currently lead in that chamber as well.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nMember of ‘Central Park Five’ elected to NYC council\n\nYusef Salaam, one of the \"Central Park Five\" who was exonerated for a 1989 attack on a jogger, won election Tuesday to be a member of the New York City Council. Salaam ran unopposed.\n\nThen a New York-based real estate magnate, Donald Trump called for Salaam's execution, taking out a newspaper ad calling on New York state to re-institute the death penalty.\n\nSalaam and four other Black and Latino men were imprisoned after being wrongfully convicted for the 1989 rape and beating of a white jogger in Central Park. DNA evidence exonerated Salaam and the other co-defendants.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMom of daughter killed in Robb Elementary School shooting loses Uvalde mayor race\n\nCody Smith won the Uvalde, Texas, mayoral race. He defeated Kimberly Mata-Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi Rubio was killed during the shooting at Robb Elementary School last year.\n\nSmith will succeed Mayor Don McLaughlin, who is stepping down after nearly 10 years leading the city to pursue a seat in the Texas House.\n\nHis campaign has called for “better communications among police agencies and mobilizing volunteers from the community to help those in need,” according to the New York Times.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVirginia Democrat makes history as state’s first transgender senator\n\nDanica Roem became Virginia’s first, and the country’s second ever, openly transgender state senator. Roem won her race in northern Virginia by defeating Republican opponent Bill Woolf by about four points.\n\nThe former journalist entered politics in 2017, when she became the first transgender state legislator in Virginia.

Andy Beshear \"to congratulate him on his re-election win tonight.\"\n\nBiden also hailed Ohio's approval of a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights.\n\n\"My Administration will continue to protect access to reproductive health care,\" said Biden, who plans to make abortion a key issue in his 2024 re-election campaign.\n\nBiden also appeared to take aim at former President Donald Trump on election night, sharing in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter \"Across the country tonight, democracy won and MAGA lost.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nOhio voters approve abortion ballot measure\n\nOhio voters on Tuesday approved a ballot measure to protect abortion rights until viability - typically around 24 weeks gestation - and the right to access contraception, fertility treatment and other services in the state.\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, abortion rights activists have been on a winning streak, with voters in six other states either passing measures to protect abortion access or rejecting efforts to restrict it.\n\nThe move sends a strong signal ahead of the 2024 election, when multiple other states will consider similar measures.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nAndy Beshear wins Kentucky governor race\n\nDemocratic incumbent Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won a second term on Tuesday, defeating Republican challenger Daniel Cameron.\n\nBeshear is one of the most popular governors across the country. Experts told USA TODAY ahead of Election Day that Beshear's charm coupled with incumbency would be the irresistible force that gave him an edge going into Tuesday.\n\n\"I'd like to think that it's about doing a good job, working as hard as you can every day and caring about people because we've been through a ton,\" Beshear told USA TODAY in an interview when asked about his first-term high marks.\n\n– Phillip M.

Polls will remain open there until 9 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nThe state’s top-of-the-ticket race is an open seat for state Supreme Court, which could play an important role in settling legal challenges in the 2024 presidential election in the battleground state.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRhode Island makes history after electing its first Black representative\n\nDemocrat Gabriel Amo made history after winning Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District Tuesday. He will be the state's first Black representative to Congress\n\nHe competed against Republican candidate Gerry Leonard for former Democratic Rep. David Cicilline’s seat. Cicilline stepped down this summer to become president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAmo most recently served as the deputy director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs under the Biden administration. – Sudiksha Kochi\n\nOhio Issue 2 election results: Voters consider marijuana ballot measure\n\nAn effort to legalize recreational marijuana in Ohio is passing, according to unofficial early votes.\n\nIssue 2 would allow adults 21 and older to buy, possess and grow cannabis.

David Cicilline’s seat after he stepped down earlier this year to become president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIf Amo is elected, he could be the state’s first Black representative to Congress. He most recently served as the deputy director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs under the Biden administration.\n\n– SudEiksha Kochi\n\nMississippi election results: Some precincts given extra time due to ballot issues\n\nMany voting precincts in Hinds County have been given a one-hour extension to 8 p.m. to allow more people time to vote, according to the Mississippi Democratic Party. Party Chairman Cheikh Taylor said that extension could be changed to 9 p.m., but that has not been confirmed yet.\n\nSome locations in the county ran out of ballots, and the Hinds County Election Commission was in the process of trying to print more ballots and deliver them as time was running out on voting Tuesday afternoon, according to Pete Perry of the Hinds County Republican Party.\n\nAs many as nine precincts have run out of ballots.\n\n– Mississippi Clarion Ledger\n\nWhen is the next presidential election? Tonight is a prelude to Nov. 5, 2024\n\nThe political world is looking at these off-year elections for signs of what might happen in one year's time: The next presidential election on Nov. 5, 2024.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Republican presidential candidates like former President Donald Trump and their aides are already analyzing how various issues will play out, from abortion rights to Trumpism.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin continues to avoid talking 2024\n\nVirginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin again sidestepped questions about a potential last-minute presidential bid, telling CNN Tuesday night he is “humbled” by the inquiries but “laser focused” on his state.\n\nYoungkin also dodged committing to endorse former President Donald Trump in 2024.\n\n“After polls close, I’m not going to endorse anyone,” Youngkin said. “I think the voters should choose who the nominee is, and then of course I will support the Republican nominee.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nThree critical races for Joe Biden to watch\n\nOne year out from the 2024 presidential election, the outcomes of Tuesday's off-year elections in a handful of states could provide major clues for President Joe Biden's road ahead.\n\nHere are three races you can bet the White House will be watching closely tonight:\n\nOhio: Ohio voters will vote on Issue 1, which would change the Ohio Constitution to add abortion protections. Abortion rights are an issue Biden and Democrats are looking to campaign on in 2024.\n\nVirginia: In another bellwether on the power of abortion politics, control of Virginia's state legislature is up for grabs.\n\nKentucky: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a rare Democrat leading a southern state, is by some metrics the most popular Democratic governor in the country. Yet he is in a fight to stave off Republican challenger Daniel Cameron, Kentucky's attorney general.– Joey Garrison\n\nActivists eye Black voter turnout in Mississippi after repeal of Jim Crow-era law\n\nMississippi is holding its first gubernatorial election since the overturning of a Jim Crow-era measure in Mississippi’s 1890 state constitution that targeted the power of Black voters.\n\nThe measure required any individual running for state office to win the majority of the popular vote and a majority of the state’s 122 House districts to be elected. If no candidate was able to do both, then the Mississippi House decided on the election outcome.\n\nIn 2020, voters repealed the system, instead requiring candidates to receive only a majority of the popular vote to get elected in the state.\n\n\"Now that it's just a popular vote, then the influence of the Black vote means more,\" said Charles V. Taylor Jr., the executive director of the Mississippi state conference of the NAACP.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nPolls close in parts of Kentucky\n\nPolls have closed in parts of Kentucky as voters consider whether to reelect Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear or replace him with Republican Daniel Cameron.\n\nMuch of Beshear’s first term was dominated by his response to a series of natural disasters and the pandemic. But his reelection campaign often focused on dire warnings about the future of abortion rights.\n\nCameron would be the nation’s first Black Republican to be elected governor if he wins. He has reaffirmed his support for the current Kentucky law, which bans all abortions except when carried out to save a pregnant woman’s life or to prevent a disabling injury.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nBallots run out at several Mississippi county precincts\n\nMultiple locations in Hinds County, Mississippi, ran out of ballots, and the Hinds County Election Commission was in the process of trying to print more ballots and deliver them as time was running out on voting Tuesday afternoon, according to Pete Perry of the Hinds County Republican Party.\n\nAs many as nine precincts have run out of ballots.\n\n\"The election commission did not print enough ballots for the precincts. That's the bottom line,\" Perry said. \"Folks have been standing in line for hours waiting to vote and many of them have left.\"\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are discussing options for keeping polls open after the 7 p.m. deadline.\n\n– Ross Reily\n\nVirginia election results: What's at stake this year?\n\nAbortion has emerged as a key voter concern in Virginia in 2023. Democrats have warned that a red Virginia would lead to further abortion restrictions, while Republicans defend their proposed 15-week limit, with exceptions, as a “common sense” compromise.\n\nOut of a list of issues ranging from crime to taxes, abortion was second most top of mind for voters in a Christopher Newport University Wason Center poll last month.\n\nNext on that list: K-12 education.\n\nVirginia Republicans have campaigned on “parents’ rights\" in education, a rallying cry that began in the state during Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s successful 2021 gubernatorial campaign.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nDan McCaffery vs. Carolyn Carluccio: Pennsylvania’s state Supreme Court race could shape 2024\n\nThis year, Democratic candidate Dan McCaffery and Republican candidate Carolyn Carluccio are competing for a spot on Pennsylvania’s state Supreme Court.\n\nIn recent years, lawsuits over voting disputes and allegations of election fraud have rocked Pennsylvania. After the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging Philadelphia officials violated state law while ballots were being tallied, which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed.\n\nWhoever is elected to the state's Supreme Court this year could be crucial, as fights could play out again in Pennsylvania in 2024.\n\nThe court has a 4-2 Democratic majority after the death of Justice Max Baer. If Carluccio were to be elected, the majority balance between parties wouldn’t change. But there have been cases where justices have deadlocked, even with a Democratic majority.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKy election results: Will the race for governor map out a blueprint for a Trump, Biden rematch?\n\nRepublican Daniel Cameron is competing against Democratic incumbent Andy Beshear in Kentucky's governor race on Tuesday.\n\nRepublicans rule Kentucky politically, yet its liberal-leaning governor remains one of the country's most popular figures, even as the national Democratic brand takes a nosedive in the state.\n\nThose close to Cameron, who is a protege of Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., believe making this race a proxy battle for next year's likely presidential election rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump is the better counterpunch to the governor's popularity.\n\n– Phillip M. Bailey\n\nDisinformation, AI and poll-worker problems: How elections this week could preview 2024\n\nElection experts told USA TODAY several statewide elections on Tuesday − which include governor races in Kentucky and Mississippi − could preview challenges that might arise during the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThat includes whether states can overcome challenges to recruit poll workers, adapt to voting law changes, maintain high voter turnout levels and combat the spread of disinformation.\n\n“There are elections all around the country that I think serve kind of as a bellwether for how next year will go,” said Tammy Patrick, CEO for programs at the National Association of Election Officials.\n\n− Rachel Looker and Joey Garrison\n\nWhat is today's election?\n\nThe 2023 election is what's known as an off-year election. It's not a year where voters will cast their ballots for a presidential candidate.\n\nThey also won't weigh in on a \"midterm\" race, which usually comes halfway into a president's term and can serve as a referendum on the commander in chief. .\n\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't contentious elections this year. From ballot measures on abortion rights and marijuana legalization, to competitive legislative races, Americans will still make their voices heard Tuesday night.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen do polls close?\n\nIt depends on your state or local area. Here's a look at some of the poll schedules across the country:\n\nIn Ohio, voters must cast ballots at their designated polling place between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.\n\nIn Kentucky, polls open at 6 a.m. and close at 6 p.m.\n\nIn Virginia, polling hours are from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nKentucky man allegedly threatens voters\n\nA Louisville man was arrested Tuesday after allegedly damaging a machine and threatening voters at a polling location on Election Day. The incident took place just after 9:15 a.m. Tuesday, according to area police.\n\nOfficers who responded found a man on the scene who was \"making threatening gestures toward voters\" while \"wielding a flag attached to a fishing pole.\" The man, identified by police as 40-year-old Jacen Cockerell, is also accused of damaging a voting machine by ripping off a printer that was attached to it.\n\nCockerell is charged with tampering/destruction of a voting machine and interfering with an election, both felonies, along with two misdemeanor counts of menacing.\n\n− Lucas Aulbach\n\nVirginia race results may be close and slow to come\n\nAll eyes might be on Virginia, but the country could have to be patient for the state’s final results.\n\nWith the state's deadline for mail in ballots at noon on Monday and some races potentially coming down to a tight margin, there's a “strong likelihood” that the outcome will not be set by the end of Election Day, said Heather Williams, interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\n“These races are on a razor's edge,” Williams said in a press conference Monday. “We want to prepare you all for a long wait.”\n\nIt could be a waiting game then to see if Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Republicans are successful in their push to turn the state legislature red, or whether Democrats there manage to hold their state Senate majority.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nMother of 10-year-old girl killed in Uvalde school shooting runs for mayor\n\nKimberly Mata-Rubio, whose 10-year-old daughter Lexi Rubio was killed during the shooting at Robb Elementary School last year, is running for mayor of Uvalde in this year’s election.\n\nMata-Rubio, 34, is seeking to succeed Mayor Don McLaughlin, who is stepping down after nearly 10 years leading the city to pursue a seat in the Texas House.\n\n“I grieve for the woman you would have become and all the difference you would have made in this world,” Mata-Rubio wrote on X when she announced her run. “I grieve for the woman I was when you were still here. But, one part of me still exist, I am still your mom. I will honor your life with action. This is only the beginning.\n\n− Ryan Autullo and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nColorado voters consider Proposition HH\n\nIn the Centennial State, voters will weigh in on a measure known as Proposition HH.\n\nThe proposal asks whether voters want the state to keep some amount of surplus tax revenue that Colorado's constitution requires be refunded to taxpayers. In exchange, the measure would lower property tax rates for a decade. A portion of the funds the state retains would be spent on education and rental assistance.\n\nThe proposal was introduced by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis and Democratic lawmakers.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nVirginia sends a 2024 signal\n\nVirginia might be the country's modern bellwether, with their constituents having a near-perfect track record for picking recent national election winners. But before 2024's national elections can officially begin, voters and activists from both parties in the state say they're focused on winning this year.\n\nSenators and representatives from the Virginia State Senate and House of Delegates are all up for reelection for the first time in four years.\n\nYoungkin and other Virginia Republicans hope to hold their majority in the state House and flip their Senate red, much like the national GOP aspires to keep the U.S. House of Representatives and take back the majority in the Senate. But Democrats are hoping to block Youngkin's conservative agenda into 2024 and beyond.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nOhio election results: Abortion ballot measure in the Buckeye State\n\nThe eyes of the nation are on Ohio as voters in the state head to decide on an abortion ballot measure that has the potential to rock the state and send a message to the rest of the country.\n\nOhio voters will consider Issue 1, a measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution through viability, typically around 24 weeks gestation.

Officials aim to earn your trust in 2024\n\nWASHINGTON − Ahead of another election cycle that is already shaping up to be contentious, federal and state election officials are in the midst of campaigns of their own to reassure wary voters about the integrity of casting their ballots.\n\nThey are recruiting poll workers, certifying voting machines and hosting lessons on how election systems work in community centers, classrooms and libraries.\n\nThe steps are needed, experts say, to restore voters' confidence in a system that, despite some flaws and outspoken election deniers, was mostly trustworthy and secure in the first place.\n\nThose fraud claims, in part, gave rise to calls for major overhauls of election systems in some states led mostly by Republican lawmakers. Some, particularly voters of color, were already skeptical of a system with a history of discrimination that hasn't always been open to them. New laws to restrict access has fueled that mistrust, experts said.\n\nMuch of the work of assuring voters will fall to local elections officials, experts said. Americans have more trust in their local election systems, which they’re more familiar with, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\n\"People know their local election officials. They know when they go to city or town hall that they trust the people that work there,'' said Rob Rock, Rhode Island's deputy secretary of state. \"It's really important to make sure that people understand the process.''\n\n–Deborah Barfield Berry and Terry Collins\n\nRead the story:Fearful of voter fraud?

Bailey", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/23/politics/abortion-out-of-state-legislation/index.html", "title": "Can red states regulate abortions performed outside their borders ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIf the Supreme Court reverses its long-standing abortion precedent later this year and lets states ban abortions within their borders, it will unleash a new legal and legislative fight over how far anti-abortion lawmakers can reach to target conduct that happens outside their state lines.\n\nA draft majority opinion published by Politico on Monday suggested the court’s majority was on the cusp of overturning 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The opinion is not final, and it is possible the vote count will change before a formal opinion is later rolled out, likely by the end of June. In it, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the “authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.”\n\nAt the case’s December hearing, the conservative justices who appeared inclined to join Alito framed a post-Roe landscape as one where states can choose the contours of their abortion policies for themselves.\n\nBut legal experts say the reality, if Roe is reversed, will not be that simple.\n\nAlready, lawmakers in both red and blue states are beginning to draw new battles lines in expectation of a patchwork system where abortion rights are no longer protected nationwide.\n\nLegislation introduced this year in Missouri is an extreme example of how anti-abortion lawmakers are looking to crack down on abortions that happen beyond their states’ borders.\n\nOne measure sought to allow private citizens to sue anyone who helps a Missouri resident obtain an abortion out of state, while also targeting efforts to provide medication abortion to residents. Another bill would apply Missouri’s abortion laws to abortions obtained out of state by Missouri residents and in other circumstances, including in cases where “sexual intercourse occurred within this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse.”\n\nThat bill has seen no movement in the legislature, while lawmakers did an end run around the other legislation when it was brought up on the state House floor last month.\n\nMary Ziegler, a Florida State University College of Law professor who’s the author of “Abortion and the Law in America: A Legal History, Roe v. Wade to the Present,” said the Missouri bill is a sign of things to come.\n\n“This won’t be the last state that tries to regulate conduct outside of its borders,” Ziegler told CNN.\n\n‘The portability of medication abortion changes the access landscape’\n\nWhat has complicated the picture since the last time the Supreme Court seemed to be poised to overturn Roe is the development of medication abortion, in which pregnancies are ended with a two-pill regime. It is now the method used in more than half of all abortions in the country. A recent loosening of the regulations around abortion pills, which the Food and Drug Administration has now cleared to be dispersed by mail, has prompted anti-abortion states to think of new ways to regulate its availability. How the pandemic expanded the use of telemedicine has also changed the abortion landscape, as – coupled with the loosened FDA regulations – some abortion patients can undergo the medication abortion procedures without being inside a clinic.\n\n“In the last three years education about abortion pills has been a huge part of my job,” said Katie Glenn, the government affairs counsel for the anti-abortion group Americans United for Life.\n\nSeveral states have outlawed telemedicine abortions and sending the pills by mail.\n\nBut some, like Texas, have gone further by contemplating how they’ll prosecute providers who seek to send in abortion pills from out of state. Texas last year expanded upon its existing prohibitions on mailing medication abortion pills by classifying the offense as the type of crime that would warrant extradition.\n\n“As you start to think about all the ways that the portability of medication abortion changes the access landscape, I think you see a lot of laws targeting that,” said Rachel Rebouché, who is a co-author of a coming law review article exploring the interstate legal questions raised by a Roe reversal.\n\nOn the flip side – and in anticipation that their states will become so-called “safe havens” for abortion seekers and clinics – Democratic lawmakers are pushing proposals that would limit the ability of out-of-state authorities to investigate providers within blue states.\n\nNew York lawmakers have introduced several bills that would protect abortion providers from extradition to other states. California is considering legislation aimed at the civil enforcement mechanism – i.e. lawsuits filed by private citizens against those who facilitate outlawed abortions – that was championed by Texas’ six-week ban and is being considered by other states.\n\nA bill in Connecticut would bar state agencies from assisting investigations or prosecutions launched by out-of-state authorities and restrict the disclosure of reproductive health records sought by out-of-state subpoenas, among other provisions.\n\nGlenn argued that these bills may have unintended effects on patients. She posited, for instance, that the Connecticut bill would prevent an out-of-state resident from pursuing a lawsuit for a botched delivery performed in the state.\n\nConnecticut state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, dismissed the criticism, telling CNN that “those on the anti-choice side would say anything to try and prevent individuals from being able to access legal safe abortion care.”\n\nShe said Connecticut lawmakers were prompted to push the bill, which passed the legislature last week, by the novel Texas law. The Texas law provided a model for one of the Missouri proposals targeting out-of-state abortions.\n\n“By being able to go after individuals that assist someone with an abortion, we recognized that a Texas-like law, in other states – they could reach to Connecticut,” Gilchrest said.\n\n‘Swift and decisive action’ against companies that aid employees in obtaining abortions out of state\n\nTexas legislators have previewed how they may seek to hinder access to the procedure even beyond their state.\n\nOne statehouse Republican sent Citigroup a letter earlier this year demanding that the company end its policy – adopted in reaction to the six-week ban – of covering travel costs for employees seeking abortions out of state.\n\nTexas state Rep. Briscoe Cain promised “swift and decisive action” if the company did not rescind the policy.\n\n“I intend to introduce legislation next session that bars local governments in Texas from doing business with any company that pays the abortion-related expenses of its employees or that provides abortion coverage as an employee benefit — regardless of where the employee is located or where the abortion is performed,” Cain wrote, adding that his proposal would apply “even if the employee is located out of state and even if the abortion is performed out of state.”\n\nCitigroup declined to comment on the Cain letter.\n\nThe tactic threatened by Cain echos a bill Texas enacted last year aimed at banks that decided to no longer finance certain gun manufacturing companies. But, more broadly, key legal questions remain untested about how lawmakers can regulate abortion-related conduct that happens outside their states.\n\nThe topic was debated among legal academics ahead the 1992 Supreme Court ruling in Planned Parenthood v Casey, a case that many believed would lead to the end of Roe. (The court instead upheld its protections.) It was also the subject of a law review article in 2007, when the departure from the court of Justice Sandra Day O’ Connor, the swing vote in the Casey case, revived the belief that Roe’s days are numbered.\n\n“Basically every time there’s this inflection point, with the court changing, you see kind of these issues come up again,” said Greer Donley, who is one of the co-authors of the new article, which will be published in the Columbia Law Review, about the topic.\n\nBut, she said, this is the first time “we’re really starting to see legislators playing with the text and language of these bills coming out.”\n\n“And certainly you have an anti-abortion movement that is extremely emboldened right now with its own belief that the court is going to support a lot of its more creative measures,” Donley told CNN.\n\nThis story has been updated following the publication of a draft opinion that would overturn Roe v.

Ron DeSantis won heavily Latino, historically Democratic regions on his way to a blowout victory that could serve as a launch pad for a 2024 presidential run.\n\nBut in the hours that have followed, Democrats reclaimed ground. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the battle for the House majority – one that favored Republicans, who expected to benefit from high inflation, historical trends and friendly new district lines after 2021’s redistricting – remains unsettled.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN analyst: Here's what DeSantis' projected victory could mean for the GOP 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nHere are takeaways as votes are still being counted in key races:\n\nQuestions over control remain\n\nElection Day is over but the fundamental questions of this election cycle remain unanswered.\n\nTo start, control of the Senate remains up for grabs. Fetterman’s victory in Pennsylvania, flipping a GOP seat, gave Democrats some breathing room as they await results from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. Republicans now need to win two of those three to claim a majority, but the Georgia Senate race will go to a runoff in December after no candidate won more than 50% of the vote.\n\nThe shape of the House, too, remains uncertain. Republicans appear poised to take control but there are scant signs of the big night they were hoping for. As the votes continue to be counted, the coming days will likely reveal the strength of a new GOP House majority – and whether a potentially underwhelming performance undermines Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s standing within a rancorous GOP conference. The GOP is now in a race-by-race fight that will ultimately determine McCarthy’s ability to govern.\n\nKey states are still counting ballots\n\nVotes are still being counted in several key states – including Arizona and Nevada, where a sweep of the Senate races by either party would result in control of the chamber.\n\nArizona and Nevada also have competitive races for governor, secretary of state and more to be decided in the coming days.\n\nIn Arizona, as of late Wednesday night, about 600,000 votes remained to be counted – the bulk of them in Maricopa County, the home of Phoenix and the state’s most populous. Those votes could decide the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly and Republican nominee Blake Masters, as well as the gubernatorial contest between Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Republican former television journalist Kari Lake, an election denier.\n\nIn Nevada, CNN estimates that as of Wednesday night, about 160,000 known ballots remain to be counted. Mail-in ballots can be accepted through Saturday so more could be en route to elections offices. The state is the home of a crucial Senate contest between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt.\n\nThe final House landscape also depends on races that have not yet been decided as a handful of states, including California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona, continue to count ballots.\n\nIn Alaska, a Republican will win the Senate race – but it’s not clear whether Sen. Lisa Murkowski or her Donald Trump-backed challenger Kelly Tshibaka will cross the 50% threshold to avoid the race being decided by ranked choice voting. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola leads the House race there, but it’s also not clear whether that race’s outcome will be decided by ranked choice voting.\n\nDemocrats go a long way to protecting their Senate majority\n\nRepublicans were not shy about the importance of Pennsylvania’s Senate race: “This is a must-win race. We believe if we win Pennsylvania, we win the majority,” said Steven Law, president of the preeminent Republican Senate super PAC.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, CNN projected that Fetterman would be the next senator from Pennsylvania, defeating Oz in the most expensive and high stakes Senate campaign in the country.\n\nFetterman’s win was a thunderclap for Democrats. While the race long represented the best chance for the party to pick up a Senate seat in 2022, Fetterman’s near fatal stroke in May – and the lengthy recovery he endured in public – injected uncertainty into the race. But on Wednesday morning, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor gave Democrats the pick-up they needed to have a better chance to hold the United States Senate next year.\n\n“Fetterman’s win makes it next to impossible for the GOP to get a majority. Pennsylvania was the fire wall,” said Mike Mikus, a Democratic operative based in Western Pennsylvania.\n\nAlthough a number of key Senate races remain uncalled – including contests in Nevada and Arizona and in Georgia which will go to a runoff – earlier on Tuesday, CNN projected one Democratic incumbent: Sen. Maggie Hassan, a first-term Democrat who faced Republican retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, won her race.\n\nA Hassan loss would have effectively ended Democrats’ hopes of retaining their majority. And CNN projected Wednesday that Republican Ron Johnson will keep his Senate seat in Wisconsin. The Democrats are still defending seats in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada – so it will take time to settle Senate control.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN political director breaks down top issue for most voters 03:40 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump’s no good, very bad night\n\nFew Republicans were more involved in these midterms than Trump and the former president had a particularly bad night.\n\nIt appears that Trump knows it, too: He is “livid” and “screaming at everyone,” a Trump adviser who has been in contact with Trump’s inner circle told CNN on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe most striking loss for Trump came in Pennsylvania, where his chosen candidate, Oz, fell to Fetterman in what was the most expensive Senate race in the country. Trump endorsed Oz during the contentious Republican primary, effectively pulling through a brutal primary and narrowly into the general election. But where the former president’s backing was decisive in the primary, it was an albatross in the general election for a Republican Senate candidate who was attempting to make inroads in the suburbs by touting his own moderation.\n\nWhile Trump did score some Senate wins – Trump-backed Republican JD Vance defeated a stronger-than-expected challenge from Democrat Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race, while Republican Ted Budd defeated Democrat Cheri Beasley in North Carolina – those wins have so far been limited to Republican states.\n\nIn the House, too, some Trump acolytes lost in what were seen as competitive contests that Republicans needed to win if they were going to build a significant majority in the legislative body.\n\nIn New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt lost to Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in what was seen as a highly competitive contest. In North Carolina, Trump-backed Republican Bo Hines lost to Democrat Wiley Nickel in a race that was widely seen as a test of the former president’s influence. And in Ohio, Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert who bullishly touted her ties to Trump.\n\nTrump’s evening was particularly bad when viewed through the lens of DeSantis’ romp of a night.\n\nDeSantis, Trump’s clearest rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, overwhelmingly won reelection on Tuesday, crushing Democrat Charlie Crist by nearly 20 percentage points, continuing to consolidate Latino support in Florida and even by winning populous counties like Miami-Dade.\n\nThe headline in Trump’s one-time hometown paper, the New York Post, said it all: “DeFUTURE,” the headline blared, showing the Florida Republican on stage with his family.\n\nDemocrats hold their own in the suburbs\n\nIn 2018, the suburbs delivered Democrats the House majority. In 2020, they vaulted Joe Biden to the presidency.\n\nAnd in 2022, suburbs across the country went a long way to helping Democrats avoid a significant red wave.\n\nRepublicans may still win the House, but if the 2022 election was going to be a red wave, it was likely to come through suburban victories that have not materialized yet.\n\nIn a district made up of the Kansas City suburbs, CNN projected Democrat Sharice Davids would win reelection. In Ohio, CNN projected two suburban wins: Democrat Greg Landsman defeated Republican Rep. Steve Chabot in a district that included Cincinnati and some of the surrounding suburbs and Democratic state Rep. Emilia Sykes defeated Republican Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in a district that includes areas around Cleveland and all of Akron. In Illinois, CNN projected that Democratic incumbent Lauren Underwood would win reelection against Republican Scott Gryder in the Chicago suburbs. And in Virginia, CNN projected Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger would win reelection, largely because of the votes she picked up from the suburbs of Washington, DC.\n\nRepublicans did score some suburban victories – CNN projected Brandon Ogles the winner in a district around Nashville, Tom Kean Jr. winning in a suburban New Jersey district and Rich McCormick the victor in a district that included Atlanta’s northern suburbs – but it was their defeats that spoke volumes about the size of the GOP wave.\n\nAnother January 6 committee member loses\n\nDemocratic Rep. Elaine Luria, a member of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, lost her Virginia Beach-based House seat, CNN projected.\n\nLuria’s loss to Kiggans, Republican Navy veteran, was the latest demonstration that the lasting focus on the insurrection – even as it sheds light on a dark chapter in the nation’s capitol – is a political anchor for those involved.\n\nLuria had defeated former GOP Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018 and 2020. But the district had become slightly more favorable ground for Republicans in redistricting: Biden carried the previous version by 5 points, and would have lost the new district by 2 points.\n\nAnd Luria provided the latest evidence that voters are not rewarding those involved in the committee probing the insurrection. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney was routed in a primary by Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman, while Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a Florida Democrat, both retired rather than seeking reelection.\n\nDeSantis’ big win could be a 2024 launchpad\n\nDeSantis led a dominant Republican ticket in Florida – delivering historic margins in Democratic territory in his victory Crist on a night that provides him a powerful argument if he seeks the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.\n\nThe easy wins by DeSantis, who led by nearly 20 percentage points with 92% of the estimated vote counted, and Sen. Marco Rubio, who was 17 points up, were enough to cast doubt on Florida’s status as a national bellwether.\n\nThe most eye-popping outcome – and one that demonstrates the breadth of DeSantis’ appeal in the eyes of Sunshine State voters – came in Miami-Dade County, which is heavily Hispanic and historically a huge source of Democratic votes.\n\nRepublicans had made gains there in recent years: Hillary Clinton defeated former President Trump there by 29 percentage points in 2016. DeSantis did slightly better in the 2018 governor’s race, losing the county by 21 points. Trump made inroads there in 2020, losing by just 8 points. But a GOP candidate for governor hadn’t actually won Miami-Dade County since Jeb Bush in 2002.\n\nThe political reality is straightforward: Democrats have no realistic path to victory in statewide races in Florida without big wins in Miami-Dade County. That reality makes county’s outcome into an exclamation point on a dominant GOP performance.\n\nDeSantis’ win comes as a battle over the future of the Republican Party takes shape, with Trump signaling a potential 2024 announcement next week. Exit polls in Florida showed that 45% of the state’s voters would like to see DeSantis run for president, compared to 33% who want Trump to run in 2024.\n\nIn a victory speech Tuesday night, DeSantis offered a glimpse at how he might describe his governorship to a national audience. Touting his refusal to impose lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said that Florida “was a refuge of sanity when the world went mad.” He also described the state as “where woke goes to die” and “a ray of hope that better days still lie ahead.”\n\nGOP makes gains with Latinos in Florida\n\nRepublicans hoped to build on Trump’s inroads among Latino voters in 2020, a trend that could reshape the political landscapes in several swing states if it continues.\n\nThe strongest early signal that the GOP had continued to make gains came in Miami-Dade County, home to a large Cuban population.\n\nBut Latinos are not a monolith, and there were more important signs in Florida, too: Another traditional Democratic stronghold won by DeSantis was Osceola County, a majority Latino county south of Orlando with a heavily Puerto Rican population.\n\nHowever, it’s not clear if those GOP gains are materializing outside Florida.\n\nOne key gauge was the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where three House races in heavily Latino districts were up for grabs. Democrats have won two of those races, CNN projected. Rep. Henry Cuellar, the only House Democrat who votes against abortion rights, won reelection in his Laredo-based 28th District, while Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez defeated Republican Rep. Mayra Flores – the two were drawn into the same district – in the McAllen-based 34th District. The 15th District race, which was widely seen as the GOP’s best chance, is still too early to call.\n\n“The RED WAVE did not happen. Republicans and Independents stayed home,” Flores tweeted just after midnight.\n\nArizona and Nevada, both competitive states with significant Latino populations, are also important to watch. So are a spate of House races in California, where it could take days or weeks for winners to become clear.\n\nDemocrats had a good night in governor’s races\n\nCNN projected Wes Moore the winner in Maryland and Maura Healey the victor in Massachusetts, two seats that are currently in Republican control. Democratic governors in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico and others are projected to hold their seats, while Democrat Josh Shapiro defeated Republican Doug Mastriano in a seat where Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf was term limited.\n\nBut as Tuesday turned into Wednesday, Democrats have a shot at strengthening their grip of governor’s offices across the country.\n\nCNN projected Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly the winner in her bid for reelection on Wednesday morning, while Democrats are competitive in Oregon and Nevada, two states that would represent Democratic holds, and Arizona, a state that would represent a Democratic flip.\n\nThe night is far from an unmitigated victory for Democrats – and how the three outstanding key races tip could shift the way Democrats see their gubernatorial successes. And some of the most famous Democratic gubernatorial candidates did lose: CNN projected Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams failed to unseat Republican incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp in a rematch of their 2018 race, and Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke was unable to defeat Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nBut few Democratic operatives would have said weeks ago that they would be in line to have this kind of night in governors races.\n\nAbortion rights, and its defenders, triumph\n\nIn referendums and races where the Supreme Court’s June decision to reverse Roe v. Wade was a central issue, voters sided overwhelmingly with Democrats and in favor of abortion rights.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer – who staked her reelection campaign on her successful efforts to block the enforcement of the state’s 1931 law banning abortion in almost all instances – defeated Republican challenger Tudor Dixon, who had waged a campaign focused on cultural battles.\n\nMichigan voters also approved a Whitmer-backed amendment to the state’s constitution that will scrap that 1931 law and guarantee abortion rights.\n\nVoters in California and Vermont also green-lit constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had made abortion a central focus of his campaign. Republicans there have rejected Evers’ efforts to amend the state’s 1849 abortion ban to include exceptions for rape and incest. He highlighted that split by calling the GOP-led legislature into a special session in October and urging them to act on the issue – and then used lawmakers’ decision to adjourn in less than 30 seconds without taking action as a campaign cudgel.\n\nIt’ll take time to sort out which issues were decisive, particularly in suburban House battles. But according to CNN exit polls, 27% of voters in House races said abortion was the most important issue – second only to inflation at 31%. Among those who cited abortion as the most important issue, 76% voted Democratic.\n\nA night of firsts\n\nUp and down the ballot, in red states and blue, candidates from both parties are celebrating pathbreaking victories.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Healey is poised to become the state’s first elected female governor and the nation’s first out lesbian state executive. Republican Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary, has been elected the first female governor of Arkansas. And Moore will be the Maryland’s first Black governor.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Massachusetts elected its first female governor.

Summer Lee will be the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania.\n\nFlorida has also elected the youngest-ever House member, 25-year-old Maxwell Alejandro Frost, now on track to become the first Gen Z candidate to hold federal office.\n\nVirginia’s split decision offers early signals\n\nThree Democratic-controlled House races in Virginia were widely viewed as an early warning signal of the night’s results. With all House districts in the commonwealth projected by CNN, the results hint at a night where Democrats could lose the House – but would not face a 2014-style wave.\n\nDemocrats held seats in two Virginia districts Biden won in 2020.\n\nCNN projected that Democratic Jennifer Wexton won her reelection bid in Virginia’s 10th District. Republicans were hoping Wexton could fall on Tuesday if the night was particularly bad for Democrats.\n\nIn an even more competitive race, CNN projected Spanberger also won reelection in Virginia’s 7th District. Spanberger was widely seen as a vulnerable incumbent, especially after Republican Glenn Youngkin carried the district in his successful gubernatorial campaign in 2021.\n\nBut Democrats lost in southeastern Virginia, with CNN projecting that Republican state Sen. Jen Kiggans defeated Luria.\n\n“I was in the White House in 2010 when the big wave rolled in. I know what it feels like. It doesn’t feel like this,” said David Axelrod, the top political adviser to former President Barack Obama.\n\nScott Jennings, a Republican operative and CNN contributor, said whether the results are a wave or just a slight shift in the House, the impact will be the same on President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\n“Whether it is a wave, a ripple, or whatever you want to call it, the oversight is going to feel all the same,” Jennings said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Dan Merica Gregory Krieg", "Eric Bradner", "Dan Merica", "Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/us/gun-control-laws-2022/index.html", "title": "These are the gun control laws passed in 2022 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nSeveral high-profile mass shootings and a sustained rise in gun violence across the United States in 2022 have spurred law enforcement officials and lawmakers to push for more gun control measures.\n\nPresident Joe Biden in June signed into law the first major gun safety legislation passed in decades. The measure failed to ban any weapons, but it includes funding for school safety and state crisis intervention programs. Many states – including California, Delaware and New York – have also passed new laws to help curb gun violence, such as regulating untraceable ghost guns and strengthening background check systems.\n\nThe year 2022 is the second-highest year of mass shootings in the United States on record, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit tracking gun violence incidents across the country.\n\nThere have been at least 647 mass shootings through December 31 this year. The country saw 692 mass shootings in 2021, the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014.\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nThere is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings, according to a January study published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit focused on gun violence prevention.\n\nNot everyone agrees increased gun control is the answer. Some Americans advocate for their right to keep and bear arms, enshrined in the Constitution, while others argue gun control measures save lives and do not infringe citizen rights.\n\nAmid the debate, some lawmakers have forged ahead with passing gun control laws.\n\n“States continue to lead on gun safety, passing new and innovative policies that we will work to replicate across the country while continuing to secure significant investments in community violence intervention programs,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, which killed 20 children and six educators.\n\n“This progress and our electoral victories in November shows that the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than ever and sets the stage for continued progress in the new year,” Watts continued.\n\nHere is a summary of the state and federal laws approved in 2022:\n\nFederal legislation\n\nOn June 25, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act after the House and the Senate approved the measure. The package represents the most significant federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he signed the bill.\n\nThe package includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs, which can be used to manage red flag programs, as well as for other crisis intervention programs such as mental health, drug and veteran courts.\n\nRed flag laws, approved by the federal measure, are also known as Extreme Risk Protection Order laws. They allow courts to temporarily seize firearms from anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe legislation encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which would provide a more comprehensive background check for people between 18 and 21 who want to buy guns.\n\nIt also requires more individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income to register as Federally Licensed Firearm Dealers, which are required to administer background checks before they sell a gun to someone.\n\nThe law bars guns from anyone convicted of a domestic violence crime who has a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law, however, allows those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia was ranked the top state in the nation for gun safety in 2021. It has the strongest system in the nation for removing firearms from people who become prohibited from having them, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in July signed a package of five bills on gun safety after they were passed by the California State Senate.\n\nOn July 1, Newsom signed AB 2571, which prohibits the gun industry from marketing firearm-related products to minors, as well as AB 1621, which further restricts ghost guns, including the parts used to build them.\n\nOn July 12, the governor signed AB 1594, legislation establishing a firearm industry standard of conduct to promote “safe and responsible firearm industry member practices,” the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is AB 2156, signed on July 21, which cracks down on the manufacture of firearms by prohibiting any person, regardless of federal licensure, from manufacturing firearms without a state license. It also prohibits unlicensed individuals from using 3D printing to manufacture any firearm or precursor part.\n\nThe last bill, signed on July 22, is SB 1327. It allows private citizens to bring civil action against anyone who manufactures, distributes, transports or imports assault weapons or ghost guns, which are banned in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis signed House Bill 22-1086, or The Vote Without Fear Act, on March 30.\n\nThe law prohibits a person from openly carrying a firearm within any polling location or central count facility.\n\nIt also bans individuals from open carrying within “100 feet of a ballot drop box or any building in which a polling location or central count facility is located,” while election activity is in progress, according to the legislation. Violations are punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine, up to 364 days imprisonment in the county jail, or both.\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney on June 30 signed a package of gun safety bills including legislation to prohibit assault weapons, regulate high-capacity magazines and strengthen background checks.\n\nThe Delaware Lethal Firearms Safety Act of 2022 prohibits the manufacture, sale, offer to sell, transfer, purchase, receipt, possession or transport of assault weapons in Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, according to HB 450.\n\nThe package also includes legislation to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase or possess a firearm from 18 to 21, ban the use of devices which convert handguns into fully automatic weapons and hold gun manufacturers and dealers “liable for reckless or negligent actions that lead to gun violence,” the bill states.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed two bills to address secure storage of firearms and regulating ghost guns.\n\nOn May 18, the governor signed HB 4383, which prohibits individuals from selling or possessing ghost guns and ensures all firearms are serialized, allowing law enforcement to better trace them.\n\nPritzker later signed HB4729 on June 10, which requires the Department of Public Health to develop and implement a two-year public awareness campaign focused on safe gun storage, which includes sharing information about safe gun storage, the bill says.\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced on April 8 he would allow Senate Bill 387, which bans the sale or possession of ghost guns, to become law without his signature, noting it doesn’t go far enough in taking “decisive action to hold violent criminals accountable.”\n\nThe bill, which took effect on June 1 after bipartisan support, expands the definition of “firearm” to include an unfinished frame or receiver. It requires the Secretary of State Police to maintain a system to register firearms imprinted with serial numbers and “prohibits a person from purchasing, receiving, selling, offering to sell, or transferring an ‘unfinished frame or receiver’ or a firearm unless imprinted with specified information,” the bill states.\n\nThe law also requires the governor to allocate $150,000 in the annual state budget to fund registration proceedings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on July 5 signed seven gun safety bills, six of which were part of his Gun Safety 3.0 package he introduced to the state legislature in April 2021.\n\nThe package includes legislation which would allow the state’s attorney general to sue members of the firearm industry for violations stemming from the sale or marketing of firearms, the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is legislation to regulate the sale of handgun ammunition, developing a system of electronic reporting of these sales; and require training prior to the issuance of a gun purchaser identification card with a validity date of 10 years.\n\nAnother bill in the package mandates firearm owners who become state residents to obtain a Firearm Purchaser Identification Card and register out-of-state acquired handguns, according to the bill.\n\nOn December 22, Murphy signed another gun safety bill strengthening the state’s firearm licensing laws and established a list of ‘sensitive places’ where concealed carry is prohibited, including playgrounds, bars and restaurants serving alcohol, train stations, and polling places.\n\nNew York\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed a package of bills and an additional piece of legislation to address a wide range of gun safety issues.\n\nHochul signed a gun safety package on June 6, which includes bills requiring microstamping on handguns, strengthen the state’s extreme risk and firearm purchase permit law, raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21 and enhance information sharing between state, local and federal agencies when guns are used in crimes.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision on June 23 to strike down a New York gun law enacted more than a century ago which places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside the home, Hochul signed legislation to strengthen the state’s gun laws and bolster restrictions on concealed carry weapons.\n\nThe law, which takes effect on September 1, will expand eligibility requirements in the concealed carry permitting process, restrict the carrying of concealed weapons in sensitive locations and establish state oversight over background checks for guns and regular checks on license holders for criminal convictions, according to the legislation.\n\nOregon\n\nIn the November 2022 US midterm elections, Oregon voters enacted a gun safety ballot measure, Measure 114, which strengthens background checks and prohibits the sale and transfer of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nThe measure also closes the “Charleston Loophole,” which allows gun purchases to move forward by default after three days even if a background check has not been completed. It requires state police to complete background checks on individuals before a gun sale or transfer is made.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee signed three gun safety bills on June 21. They prohibit high-capacity magazines, ban the open carry of rifles and shotguns in public and raise the legal age to purchase firearms or ammunition from 18 to 21, with exceptions for law enforcement officers.\n\nOne of the bills also changes the definition of “rifle” and “shotgun” consistent with federal law.\n\nVermont\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott signed into law a package on March 25 banning firearms from hospital buildings and prohibits the transfer of firearms between unlicensed people.\n\nThe governor vetoed a similar bill, S.30, in February which would have closed the “Charleston Loophole.”\n\nThe new law, S.4, addresses the policy by extending the time period to seven days for the federal government to complete a background check before an individual can purchase a firearm. It also strengthens protections for victims of domestic violence, according to the bill.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee signed three gun safety bills into law on March 23.\n\nHB 1705 prohibits the manufacture, sale, purchase or possession of ghost guns, while HB 1630 prohibits the open carry of firearms at local government meetings and restricts them at school board meetings and election-related locations.\n\nThe third bill, SB 5078, prohibits high-capacity magazines, defined as an “ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 17 rounds of ammunition,” the bill states.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/republicans-civil-liberties-abortion-voting-race/index.html", "title": "Red states are remaking the civil liberties landscape | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFrom Florida, Georgia and Tennessee through Texas, South Dakota and Montana, Republican-controlled states are approving a torrent of culturally conservative hot-button legislation at a pace unmatched in recent times, and probably ever.\n\nStates where the GOP controls both the governorship and state legislature are moving in unprecedented numbers to restrict abortion, limit access to voting, ban books, retrench transgender rights and constrain teachers’ ability to discuss race, gender and sexual orientation at public K-12 schools and increasingly at public colleges and universities.\n\nMany of the same states are simultaneously rescinding restrictions on gun ownership, stiffening penalties for people engaged in unruly public protests and, in a new twist, empowering private citizens to bring lawsuits to enforce many of these initiatives, as Texas Republicans did on their recent law banning abortion after about six weeks.\n\nRapidly spreading from state to state, these Republican-driven initiatives reflect the GOP coalition’s shifting center of gravity away from the small-government, low-tax agenda that long topped its priorities toward the roiling cultural anxieties and resentments that have become central to its messaging, especially in the Donald Trump era.\n\nYou have an emerging generation that is multiracial, multicultural, where no single ethnic or racial group is the majority, and it has struck an existential fear within those who are used to controlling everything, from the boardroom to the White House. So what we are seeing here is people playing on that fear of that graying generation that votes with regularity and feels as though something is slipping away. Nadine Smith, executive director, Equality Florida\n\nMore fundamentally, these red state moves are remaking the American civil liberties landscape at breathtaking speed – and with little national attention to their cumulative effect. Taken together, these moves amount to a stark reversal of what many legal scholars call the “rights revolution” beginning in the 1960s, in which Congress and especially the Supreme Court expanded the number of rights available to all Americans nationwide and struck down state laws that constricted those rights on issues from racial segregation to abortion and same-sex marriage. In many ways, the red states are attempting to tilt the nation back toward a pre-1960s model, when the basic civil rights and civil liberties available to Americans diverged far more depending on where they lived.\n\nFurther, with GOP senators wielding the filibuster and the Republican-appointed majority on the Supreme Court both providing powerful air cover for this red state ground offensive, Democrats and groups focused on defending civil rights, abortion rights and LGBTQ rights, among other issues, have not yet found any effective means of slowing the conservative onslaught. Even as the nation grows more racially, religiously and culturally diverse than ever, that means roughly half the states are on track to impose rules across this broad array of cultural flashpoints that primarily reflect the demands of one shrinking group: conservative and often older White Christians.\n\n“You have an emerging generation that is multiracial, multicultural, where no single ethnic or racial group is the majority, and it has struck an existential fear within those who are used to controlling everything, from the boardroom to the White House,” says Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, an LGBTQ advocacy group battling against the “don’t say gay” proposals from Florida Republicans that would severely restrict how teachers can talk about sexual orientation or gender identity in the classroom. “So what we are seeing here is people playing on that fear of that graying generation that votes with regularity and feels as though something is slipping away.”\n\nAnti-abortion activists protest outside of a Planned Parenthood clinic on January 20, 2022, in Washington. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nConservatives praise the widening divergence among the states on this broad array of issues as a vindication of the belief among the nation’s founders that states should have great leeway to set their own courses – a belief embodied in the 10th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\n“This is going to be a new test of federalism,” Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action, a conservative group that has promoted some of the conservative state initiatives, told me in a 2021 interview. “But I think it’s a good thing, and it’s largely how the founders envisioned this.”\n\nA wide array of groups that promote civil rights and liberties, however, see the red state moves as a fundamental assault on constitutional rights that should be available nationwide to all Americans.\n\n“We are absolutely seeing what feels like two countries – opposed on so many fundamental questions,” Deborah Archer, a professor at the New York University Law School and president of the American Civil Liberties Union, told me in an email. “That’s the reality we are facing with abortion rights – pregnant people with fundamentally different protection of their Constitutional rights based on geography. That’s the reality we may face with voting rights – Black voters with fundamentally different rights based on geography. That’s the reality we are facing with the censorship of discussions about race in the classroom – children getting wildly different opportunities to learn about the history and reality of racism and racial inequality based on geography.”\n\nThe one undisputed point: On a panoramic range of volatile issues revolving around cultural values and racial equity, Republican-controlled states are advancing the most aggressive conservative agenda in memory. In a comment echoed to me by analysts in other states, political scientist Richard Murray, a senior researcher at the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston, described last year’s Texas state legislative session as “the most extreme session in modern Texas history. I’ve been here since 1966 and nothing was comparable in all of those years.”\n\nFronts in the fight\n\nThe red state offensive is advancing across a wide range of fronts, including:\n\nAbortion: Anticipating that the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority later this year will strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion, GOP-controlled states are approving a raft of new restrictions on the procedure. Seven states in 2021 passed laws retrenching access to abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute; that list included total bans that Texas and Oklahoma approved to go into effect if the high court allows. Texas also passed its separate law banning abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, usually around six weeks of pregnancy, and empowering citizens to sue anyone involved in providing one; five GOP-appointed Supreme Court justices, over the vehement objections of Chief Justice John Roberts and the three Democratic appointees, have refused to block implementation of that law while lower courts debate its constitutionality.\n\nIn all, Guttmacher calculated, states approved 108 abortion restrictions of some sort in 2021 (such as constraints on access to abortion medication). The group says that’s by far the most that have been approved in any single year since Roe. And the wave has not yet crested: Just this month, GOP-controlled legislatures in Florida, West Virginia and Arizona, anticipating that the GOP Supreme Court majority will overturn Roe, have advanced bills to ban abortion after 15 weeks.\n\nVoting: Laws making it more difficult to vote, and in several cases increasing the opportunity for Republican partisans to exert more influence over election administration and vote tabulation, have been probably the most visible component of the red state push. In 2021, 19 states – including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Montana and Texas – passed a total of 34 laws restricting access to voting, according to tabulations by the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School. The center counts 250 bills to further restrict voting access that have been introduced this year or carried over from last year’s session and another 41 that could erode the integrity of election administration. Meanwhile, the new voter identification requirements in Texas have resulted in the rejection of so many mail ballots that local Democratic officials in Harris County have asked the US Justice Department to intervene.\n\nEducation: Nothing has spread more rapidly across the red states than the laws – dubbed “gag orders” by critics – restricting how public school K-12 teachers can talk about current and historic racial and gender inequities. In 2021, nine Republican-controlled states passed laws establishing such restrictions and four others imposed them through executive branch actions. This year, according to PEN America, a free-speech group founded by prominent authors, 112 similar bills have been introduced in 34 states.\n\nVariations on the theme are multiplying: Virginia’s newly elected Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, for instance, has created a “tip line” that residents can use to complain about teachers discussing supposedly “divisive” concepts. Iowa’s Republican-controlled legislature is considering legislation to install cameras in every classroom so that parents or others can monitor what teachers are saying.\n\nThis push to control what students are taught is also broadening in several ways. On one front, more of the red state bills would impose restrictions not only on K-12 teachers, but also on professors in public colleges and universities; PEN counts 48 such bills pending. Last week, Texas’ Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the leader of the state’s social conservatives, said he will push legislation to both end tenure for new hires at the University of Texas and make it easier to revoke tenure for professors who teach critical race theory, an academic analysis that explores structural racism.\n\nOn another front, Republican-controlled states are pushing beyond race and gender inequities to advance legislation that limits how public schools discuss sexual orientation and gender identity or bars it completely for younger students. The most prominent of these bills – the Florida legislation that critics have dubbed the “don’t say gay” bill – could receive approval from the full state House of Representatives this week, with the enthusiastic support of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. In all, nine states are considering 15 similar bills, according to PEN America.\n\nOn yet another front, more states and local school districts are banning books, including many by authors who are racial minorities or who identify as LGBTQ: The American Library Association told me in an email that its Office for Intellectual Freedom has received more than 330 reports of attempted book bans from just September through November 2021. Finally, several of the red state education proposals borrow from the new Texas abortion statute and empower private citizens to sue schools or school districts if they object to how teachers discuss the restricted topics.\n\nLGBTQ rights: The Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for the LGBTQ community, says 10 states in 2021 adopted 26 bills restricting their rights. One of the most common themes has been legislation prohibiting transgender girls and women from participating in high school and often college-level sports; among the eight states that approved such bans in 2021 were Arkansas, Florida, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. In Republican-controlled states, this wave also shows no sign of cresting: South Dakota recently approved its own ban, proposals are advancing in Kentucky and Utah, and the Human Rights Campaign counts 56 sports bans pending across the states.\n\nOn a parallel track, Tennessee last year approved legislation requiring students to use the bathrooms for their genders at birth, and Arkansas’ GOP-controlled legislature overrode a veto from Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to approve the nation’s first law prohibiting gender-affirming medical care for transgender people below age 18; Tennessee also approved such a ban. Texas’ GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton issued an opinion last Friday that such treatments constituted “child abuse” under Texas law.\n\nThe left with their defund the police, the mask mandate in schools and all that kind of stuff opened the door. People got tired of it. They got sick of it, and they are fighting back. They are not sitting back and just saying no. They are organizing and … they are pushing back aggressively. They feel it’s been in their face, so [if it’s] ‘good for the goose, good for the gander.’ Bill Miller, lobbyist and political consultant in Texas\n\nProtest rights: In the aftermath of 2020’s massive Black Lives Matter demonstrations, multiple Republican-controlled states – including Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas – have approved laws stiffening penalties on protesters accused of damaging property. In a few cases, red states have also approved laws immunizing drivers who run over protesters if they are caught in demonstrations. The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, which tracks these proposals, counts more than a dozen that have been approved since 2020, with 17 more pending this year, preponderantly in Republican-controlled states.\n\nGun rights: In sharp contrast to the laws limiting rights across all the arenas discussed above, red states are rushing to loosen restrictions on gun owners. In 2021, five Republican-controlled states, including Montana, Tennessee and Texas, eliminated requirements for gun owners to receive permits or undergo training before being allowed to carry concealed handguns – or in some cases before being allowed to openly carry weapons, according to tracking by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group. This year the group says seven more Republican-controlled states are moving to eliminate such requirements; three of them (Georgia, Indiana and South Carolina) would allow the open carrying of handguns without any training or permitting.\n\nThe sweep of this challenge has left civil rights and liberties groups gasping. “What is disturbing is how … many of the legal protections are falling at the same time,” says Archer, the ACLU president. “We have seen the protection of our civil rights and civil liberties being chipped away, death by a thousand cuts. Today, we are seeing more protections torn down all at once.”\n\nDemocrats in Washington have found no effective response. The House has passed legislation to reverse many of the state voting restrictions and to codify the national right to abortion, but a Republican Senate filibuster blocked the former last month and is expected to similarly doom the latter next week.\n\nNeither the Biden administration nor congressional Democrats have focused much attention on the other state restrictions (particularly the educational “gag orders”), much less devised an approach to resist them. While the red state offensive has advanced, Democrats have been much more consumed by the critique from party centrists that liberals are pushing excessively “woke” policies on public safety and schooling.\n\nWhy this is happening, and why now\n\nMultiple factors probably explain why Republican-controlled states are simultaneously moving so quickly across so many fronts. Anderson, from Heritage Action, says a key factor is that conservative activists have shifted their attention more to state and local governments. That shift has occurred, she says, both because they realize they have few opportunities to advance their priorities at the national level while Democrats control the White House and Congress and also because the Covid-19 crisis made them realize that local decisions “probably impact their day-to-day [life] more than even federal.”\n\nBill Miller, a lobbyist and political consultant who has worked for both parties in Texas, says the hard push from social conservatives there reflects a long-gestating backlash on the right to the left’s efforts to advance socially liberal causes, such as more explicit discussion of racial issues in the schools.\n\n“The left with their defund the police, the mask mandate in schools and all that kind of stuff opened the door,” he says in a view echoed by Anderson. “People got tired of it. They got sick of it, and they are fighting back. They are not sitting back and just saying no. They are organizing and … they are pushing back aggressively. They feel it’s been in their face, so [if it’s] ‘good for the goose, good for the gander.’ “\n\nOthers see the key factor as the shifting internal dynamics of the Republican coalition. Particularly in the Trump era, the GOP has become more dominant among the White voters who are the most uneasy about cultural and demographic change. Those voters, energized by Trump, are creating enormous demand in the party for hardline policies on race and culture.\n\nThere is definitely a difference between action and words. Lamenting the state of affairs in the Republican Party at a cocktail reception is not the necessary action that we need. … These folks are hoping they will wake up from this bad dream, but the better medicine is for them to pinch themselves that they are not dreaming. Democratic Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer\n\nThe widespread gerrymandering of state legislative disticts, experts say, has magnified the influence of those voters because it means that almost all GOP lawmakers are running in staunchly conservative districts where they face more risk of losing primaries to opponents on their right than they do of losing general elections to opponents on their left. Murray, the Texas political scientist, says Republican primaries there typically attract only about one-fourth as many voters as the party wins in presidential general elections and those who do turn out “are disproportionately the cultural warriors.”\n\nOther institutional factors have propelled the rapid dispersion of these ideas across red states. Conservative groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council and Heritage Action energetically encourage Republican legislators to adopt many of these proposals; Heritage, for instance, recently issued a strategy memo urging red state legislatures “to embrace the culture war” over the teaching of race and sexual orientation as a means of building support for vouchers that would provide parents public funds to send their kids to private schools, a perennial goal on the right.\n\nThe increasing reliance of right-leaning voters on explicitly conservative media sources that relentlessly stoke cultural and racial grievance, from Fox to talk radio, also provides a powerful transmission belt.\n\n“The nationalization of media, aided by social media and the internet, is part of the story,” says Jake Grumbach, a political scientist at the University of Washington and author of an upcoming book on the polarization of state policy. “This kind of environment means that agendas can be set, with similar talking points and framing, across states very quickly.”\n\nAnother factor has been the indications from the Republican majority on the Supreme Court that it is unlikely to resist many of these red state initiatives. The red states “feel completely emboldened by the Supreme Court,” says Jessica Post, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which focuses on state legislative races. In particular, she believes, the court’s “lack of action on the Texas case” authorizing private lawsuits against abortions “lit a wildfire of socially conservative legislation.”\n\nAlso critical, many analysts say, is the erosion of resistance from business groups. Under pressure from employees and consumers, business groups often pushed back forcefully during the early stages of this wave – for instance, with boycotts of North Carolina after Republicans there passed the original “bathroom bill” for transgender individuals in 2016.\n\nBut apart from modest public criticism of some of the voting laws, business has mostly stood to the side amid this new spasm of socially conservative legislation – even, critics note, when the bills directly contradict their public claims to support LGBTQ rights or racial equity. The journalist and activist Judd Legum, for instance, has documented that multiple companies that publicly proclaim their support for LGBTQ rights are heavily contributing to the Florida Republican legislators pushing the “don’t say gay” bill.\n\n“There is definitely a difference between action and words,” says Democratic Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer. “Lamenting the state of affairs in the Republican Party at a cocktail reception is not the necessary action that we need. … These folks are hoping they will wake up from this bad dream, but the better medicine is for them to pinch themselves that they are not dreaming.”\n\nRepublicans in these states also may have been emboldened because Democrats, after making gains in 2018, failed to flip any of the state legislative chambers they targeted in 2020. Now Republicans have been able to fortify their legislative majorities in many states with strong gerrymanders, while Democrats face the headwind of diminished approval ratings for President Joe Biden even among the suburban voters who powered their state-level wins during the Trump years.\n\nLike many red state GOP strategists, Austin-based Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak says, “I do not expect to see a suburban revolt due to the legislature’s [social issue] priorities.” He predicts that Republicans will actually gain in those areas “due to parental anger at school and Covid overreach.”\n\nBut perhaps the most powerful reason for this surge of culturally conservative legislation is the force and immediacy of the wave it seeks to counter. The evidence of irreversible demographic and cultural change continues to accumulate: The 2020 census, for the first time, recorded that kids of color now constitute a majority of the nation’s under-18 population; Gallup recently reported that a stunning one-fifth of Generation Z (as well as about 1 in 10 millennials) identifies as LGBTQ; and the latest figures from the Public Religion Research Institute show that White Christians, long the nation’s majority, now compose only a little more than two-fifths of the population.\n\nAll of that, critics argue, has created a sense of urgency for GOP state legislators responding to voters in their coalition uneasy about the “more diverse” future “that is around the corner,” as Martinez Fischer puts it. An America in which no single group makes up a majority “is arriving, and so there’s only two paths,” says Smith of Equality Florida. “One is division, chaos, suppression, censorship, surveillance and anti-immigrant sentiment. The alternative is a [way] forward, where regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation, there is a path here for everyone.”\n\nThe striking implication of the GOP’s ongoing revolution from below is that the coming decade may see the nation’s 50 states diverge between those two paths more than they have at any point since the Supreme Court and Congress began nationalizing more civil rights and liberties over half a century ago.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/26/politics/red-states-blue-states-control-of-national-policy-fault-lines/index.html", "title": "Red states are building a nation within a nation | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt was a revealing sign of the times when the Supreme Court last week, in response to a lawsuit from the Republican state attorneys general in Texas and Louisiana, blocked President Joe Biden’s administration from changing a key element of federal immigration policy.\n\nThe case was just the latest example of how red states, supported by Republican-appointed judges, are engaging in a multi-front offensive to seize control of national policy even while Democrats hold the White House and nominally control both the House and Senate. The red states are moving social policy sharply to the right within their borders on issues from abortion to LGBTQ rights and classroom censorship, while simultaneously working to hobble the ability of either the federal government or their own largest metro areas to set a different course.\n\nTo a degree unimaginable even a decade ago, this broad offensive increasingly looks like an effort to define a nation within a nation – one operating with a set of rules and policies that diverge from the rest of America more than in almost any previous era.\n\n“The only time I can recall in American history even remotely like this [divergence] was after the Civil War when the separate but equal doctrine began to emerge” across the South as a backlash against the attempts of the 13th, 14th and 15th Constitutional amendments to ensure equality for the freed slaves, says Donald Kettl, the former dean of the public policy school at the University of Maryland and author of the book, “The Divided States of America.” He added, “It’s a multifront war with very sharp swords.”\n\nThe elements of the red state offensive include a flurry of lawsuits seeking to block actions from Biden’s administration on issues from the environment to civil rights to immigration; other lawsuits, such as the case around a Mississippi law that prompted the Supreme Court to overturn the right to abortion, aimed at providing states more leeway to deviate from previously nationally guaranteed rights; a flurry of red state laws that advance the cultural priorities of the GOP’s predominantly White Christian electoral base; and a steady flow of red state statutes blocking Democratic-leaning large cities and counties from setting their own policies on everything from police budgets to recycling.\n\nThe willingness of so many red states to adopt these common approaches testifies in part to the energetic organizing efforts of many conservative groups, from Heritage Action and the American Legislative Exchange Council to the Republican Attorneys General Association. But even more profoundly, the alignment of so many red states behind this shared agenda and strategy underscores how many of them are being shaped by a common set of economic and demographic trends.\n\nOn everything from gun ownership and religious affiliation to reliance on fossil fuels and participation (or not) in the 21st century information economy, most red states are following similar tracks, while diverging more sharply from the experience in blue states. Broadly speaking, blue states are more heavily exposed to the big demographic, cultural and economic forces reshaping American life, while red states are less exposed, and to the extent they are, those changes are centered overwhelmingly on their large metropolitan areas, which are trending Democratic and often – like in Austin or Atlanta – are a target for the Republicans controlling state government.\n\n“It’s not at the level of Jim Crow, or certainly the difference between slave states and free states, but the differences are major,” says Jake Grumbach, a University of Washington political scientist who studies divergence among the states. And like Kettl, Grumbach believes the economic and political differences between the red and blue states are on track to only widen.\n\nFor Democrats, the red state offensive has been a source of rising alarm. The fact that the red states have succeeded in shifting policy toward the right on so many fronts has spurred widespread frustration within the party, as exemplified by California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s frequent calls for a more forceful response.\n\nYet the real threat in the red state effort to set their own course may be less an advantage for one side or another than a challenge to the nation’s underlying cohesion. As red states grow more aggressive about going their own way, while working to preempt challenges from above (the federal government) or below (blue local governments), they are testing how much divergence the nation’s fundamental cohesion can take before it begins to unravel.\n\n“You have a very dangerous situation,” said David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and legal adviser to the immigration advocacy group America’s Voice. “This is a direct threat to the nation as a unified entity. This is one step closer to the country dividing into two separate countries.”\n\nNeither all red, nor all blue, states are carbon copies of each other. Significant differences remain within each bloc (and between urban and rural areas within each state).\n\nOne way to define the red states is to examine the 25 that voted for Donald Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. At a time when the foreign-born share of the total US population is nearing its all-time high, 19 of the Trump states rank among the bottom 25 states in the share of their population composed of immigrants. While the overall share of college graduates is also rising, 20 of these states also rank in the bottom 25 for the share of their population that holds at least a four-year college degree, the Census Bureau found. The vast majority of Trump states, by contrast, fall into the top half when states are ranked by the share of their population that are White Christians or who own guns.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch: Trump introduced by hype video, pyrotechnics at GOP event 03:44 - Source: CNN\n\nIn their economic structure as well, the red states, as a group, are much more rooted in the powerhouse industries of the 20th century than their blue counterparts, and less represented in the information-age industries generating the greatest economic output in the 21st century. Of the states Trump won, 23 rank in the top 26 states that emit the most carbon from their energy sector for each dollar of economic output, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. As I’ve written before, that’s a revealing metric of the states that are most heavily integrated in the existing fossil fuel economy, either as producers or big consumers of coal, oil and natural gas.\n\nBy contrast, 18 of the Trump states rank in the bottom half for the share of the workforce employed in technology jobs, according to data provided to me by Brookings Metro, a center-left thinktank.\n\nThe red states have some clear economic strengths. Housing costs and taxes are generally lower in them, which has helped some of them add population at a rapid rate. But with these high-wage, high-value information-age jobs concentrating more in blue states, a substantial gap has opened between the two regions in economic output and wages. Only three smaller red states with large energy extraction industries (Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming) have median wages that equal the average across all of the blue states, according to calculations by Grumbach and two co-authors in a chapter of the recent book, “The American Political Economy.”\n\nMichael Podhorzer, chair of the Analyst Institute, a collaborative of progressive groups that studies elections, recently quantified the economic gap between the two sections in another way. He used a slightly different definition of red and blue states (based on both presidential voting and which party controls state government) whose main impact was to remove seven states into a third purple group: Trump-won North Carolina and six captured by Biden. Looking at the remaining states, Podhorzer calculated that the gross domestic product per person and the median household income are now both more than 25% greater in the blue section than in the red.\n\nTo a somewhat remarkable extent, the two major sections are divided as well in the basic structure of where people live – with the blue states revolving much more around big metropolitan centers. Using a classification system that divides communities into six categories from most to least urban, Podhorzer calculated that over three-fifths of residents in the blue states live in the two most dense categories (core urban counties and inner suburbs) while less than one-third live in the least urban categories. Red states are almost the mirror image: almost three-in-five residents live in the three least urban categories, while slightly less than one-in-three reside in the two most urban groupings.\n\nThose population findings put an exclamation point on the underlying economic divergence. The most urban counties are the most Democratic-leaning parts of the red states – places like Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Phoenix and their inner suburbs. Conversely, the least urban places are the most Republican-leaning parts of the blue states. If you subtract each of those outlying areas from their section’s total economic output – that is, remove the most urban places from the red total and the most rural places from the blue – the gap between them in total economic output widens even further: with those counties removed from each side, the blue section’s contribution to the total US gross national product is an astonishing 75% bigger than the red section’s.\n\nTo a far greater extent than in earlier generations, control of state government now aligns with states’ preferences in presidential elections. Republicans now control both chambers of the state legislature in all of the 25 states that voted two times for Trump except for Nebraska, which has a unicameral nonpartisan legislature. Republicans also control the governorship in 21 of the two-time Trump states, all but Louisiana, Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina.\n\nWith this preponderant political control, Republicans in these states have been at the forefront of efforts to roll back what legal scholars have called the “rights revolution” of the past six decades in which the Supreme Court and Congress have nationalized a wide array of rights – from abortion to contraception and same-sex marriage – and constrained the ability of states to impinge on those rights.\n\nOf the 25 states that voted for Trump, 19 have already moved to restrict abortion access since the Supreme Court last month struck down Roe v. Wade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights thinktank that tracks state policy. Four other two-time Trump states are considered likely to also restrict abortion in the coming months, with Indiana beginning a special session on Monday that could pass new limits and Kansas voters deciding next week on a constitutional amendment that could open the door to future restrictions. The only Trump states where abortion rights do not appear in imminent jeopardy are North Carolina (where Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has vetoed anti-abortion legislation) and Alaska.\n\nSimilarly, 18 of the Trump states have passed laws preventing transgender girls from competing on girls’ school sports teams, with several also moving against parents who authorize gender-affirming care for their minor children. Most of these same states have passed laws since 2021 restricting how public school teachers can discuss issues of race, gender or sexual orientation, such as Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill. And several on the list have simultaneously passed laws making it easier for critics to ban books from school libraries. These states also dominate the list of jurisdictions that have passed legislation making it more difficult to vote in response to Trump’s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election.\n\n“Right wing culture wars are now taking on even more significance because the Supreme Court has tossed what were once protected constitutional rights into the political battlefield,” Cooper, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, told me in an interview. “A zip code should not determine a woman’s reproductive rights, but that’s where we are right now.”\n\nAs I’ve written, red states over the past decade have increasingly preempted the authority of blue-trending local governments across a dizzying array of issues – everything from environmental rules to police budgets to masking or lockdown rules issued in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Conservative Republicans in the Texas state legislature have announced they intend to introduce legislation next year that would authorize district attorneys from any county to prosecute violations of the state’s abortion ban – a means of circumventing officials in large blue counties who have indicated they would not prioritize such enforcement.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Indiana holds special session attempting to pass new laws restricting abortion 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nSimultaneously red states are aggressively using the courts to either overturn national rights or to block action from the federal government across a wide array of issues. Sixteen of the Trump states filed briefs supporting Mississippi in the lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court majority overturning Roe v. Wade. Eighteen of these states have joined a lawsuit seeking to block the Biden administration’s regulations extending to transgender students the educational civil rights protections established under Title IX. The Biden administration’s efforts to combat climate change have been another frequent target of lawsuits from various combinations of the same red states.\n\nThe rulings constraining Biden on immigration may encapsulate most precisely how the alliance of red states and GOP-appointed judges are interacting to constrict federal action.\n\nVarious combinations of these states, usually led by Texas, have launched multiple federal lawsuits designed to prevent Biden from reversing hardline immigration policies set by Trump. That included the case in which the Supreme Court last week let stand a district court ruling from a Trump-appointed judge that is preventing the Biden administration from setting immigration enforcement priorities different from those Trump established. Last year, Andrew Hanen, a conservative district court judge appointed by George W. Bush, in response to a suit brought by nine red states, issued an injunction blocking the Biden administration from accepting new applications under the program that provides legal protection to young people brought to the US illegally by their parents.\n\nLeopold, the former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, notes that these immigration cases have followed a similar trajectory. The red states, led by Texas, find a sympathetic district court judge, usually based in Texas, to target for the first hearing, which ensures that the case rises into the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, perhaps the country’s most conservative, and then from there reaches the Supreme Court, which is now dominated by six GOP-appointed justices. Leopold calls this the “anti-immigrant judicial pipeline” and says it has become a template for blocking federal action far beyond issues of migration.\n\n“These are attacks on specific policy choices that have traditionally been assigned to the executive … that are preventing Biden from effectively doing his job,” Leopold said. “What they have done is with the Trump years behind them, and with a deeper [roster] on the bench, they have completely used this politicized [Supreme] Court to make federal policy and to thwart the specific policy objectives of the Biden administration. Forget that 81 million people voted for him, this is about using the court as a political tool. And they have perfected the strategy.”\n\nSeen as a whole, the red states’ drive to set their own rules, while blocking any interference from either blue-leaning local governments or a Democratic-controlled federal government, represents the broadest effort to carve out a separate sphere of influence since the fierce resistance to reconstruction across the South after the Civil War that ultimately led to Jim Crow segregation, Kettl believes. In some respects, he argues, red states are displaying a greater separatist impulse today than the South did then.\n\n“The late 19th century had a focus on separate but equal doctrine, and it had to do with a fundamental question of social policy,” Kettl told me. “This is an effort on a far broader collection of fronts – immigration, abortion, health care, the governance of schools, the issues of transportation policy. One after another. It’s on a far broader front than was ever the case in the late 19th century.”\n\nFor now, Kettl sees the initial red state Republican goal primarily as consolidating these new rules and blocking any interference – what he calls “an effort to build very high castle walls with a very deep moat.” But like Grumbach and other experts on state policy, Kettl is dubious that Republicans will settle for imposing their values solely on the states now under their control. As the red states pursue a more consistent and coordinated course, Kettl predicts that Republicans will “try to impose [this] policy on the nation as a whole” if they achieve the federal power to do so.\n\nBlue states such as California, New York, Illinois and Colorado have moved forcefully over the past two years to expand many of the liberties now under siege in the red states. But congressional Republicans while in the minority have already introduced proposals that would apply the red state rules across the entire nation on many of these same issues. The new social order red states are now sketching behind their “castle” walls may offer the best preview of what Republicans will try to impose on all states the next time they achieve unified control of the White House and Congress in Washington.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/08/03/kansas-abortion-midterm-democrats/10224887002/", "title": "Kansas abortion vote: Primary could spell trouble for GOP in midterms", "text": "Republicans, Democrats and independents voted to protect abortion rights in a state Trump carried\n\nThe Kansas vote is the first to capture voter sentiment since Roe v.

They swear their law clerks to secrecy. They shred documents. They never reveal in advance when specific decisions will be announced.\n\nSome justices even object when colleagues arrange for their private papers to be turned over to the Library of Congress decades later when they die.\n\nBut their quest for secrecy failed to prevent the public disclosure of a first-draft opinion, a stunning 98-page document in an abortion case for the ages.\n\nAfter Politico on Monday published the draft opinion by Justice Samuel Alito that would bring the reversal of the 1973 Roe v. Wade landmark, Chief Justice John Roberts focused on “this betrayal of the confidences at the Court.”\n\nHe directed the court’s marshal, overseeing the building’s regular police force, “to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.” The chief justice said nothing about whether extra resources might be put toward the effort, whether outside experts might be enlisted and whether findings might become public.\n\nMuch is unspecified about the investigation, and it remains uncertain whether the source of the Politico disclosure will ever be known. But what is certain is the court’s extreme drive for secrecy, in all manner of operations, even those unrelated to deliberations on a case.\n\nIrrespective of this breach, the justices’ general lack of transparency has increasingly become the subject of debate, including by President Joe Biden’s bipartisan commission on court reform.\n\nAmong the issues: that the justices often issue late-night orders with no recorded votes or explanation; that they keep secret certain procedural rules related to when cases are accepted for review; and that they lack a formal code of ethics and fail to explain recusals and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThey prohibit cameras in the courtroom, and some justices go to great lengths to keep the news media from their off-bench speeches by limiting advance announcements, forbidding taping or outright barring journalists. They decline to disclose even basic information about their health and hospitalizations.\n\nYet the deliberative process regarding cases is a whole other matter. The court justifiably wants to ensure candid internal debate and allow for persuasive negotiation and changed views. Its ultimate decisions affect people beyond the dueling litigants, reaching the lives and liberties of others across the country and often moving financial markets.\n\nIn this instance, if the justices overturn nearly a half century of women’s abortion rights, they will upend constitutional privacy rights and scramble many Americans’ domestic choices and economic lives.\n\nSo the decision-making process remains intensely private. Per tradition, the nine meet alone in a small oak-paneled conference room off the chambers of the chief justice as they discuss and vote on a case. (A preliminary vote occurs a few days after oral arguments; votes can shift as opinions are drafted and circulated in the months following.)\n\nAfter that initial session at what the justices call “the conference,” individual justices inform their law clerks about the outcome, and the clerks assist in the research and writing of opinions. Clerks – each justice employs four per annual session – closely track all developments in a case and the continuing private discussions among the justices.\n\nWhen clerks are hired each summer, before the annual term begins in October, they take a vow of confidentiality. Through the years, chief justices have reminded the clerks of their pledge as the term nears its end in late June and public expectations rise.\n\nRoberts usually decides which justice will write the court’s main opinion. If he himself is not in the majority on the case, the most senior justice in the majority assigns the leading court opinion. (The senior justice among the dissenters assigns the main opinion for that side, although justices are free to write additional dissenting or concurring statements.)\n\nIn the Mississippi abortion controversy, Justice Clarence Thomas was apparently the senior member of the five seeking to reverse Roe v. Wade. Thomas, then, would have assigned the opinion to Alito. Once any justice begins writing the opinion of the court, he or she tries to keep a majority, or, in the parlance of the court, “hold five.” The author fields requests for changes in language and rationale, trying to accommodate one colleague without alienating another and losing the majority.\n\nSome justices have told CNN in the past that they did not minutely edit their colleagues; rather, they seek to make sure they agree with the bottom line and reasoning.\n\nAlito’s February 10 draft, as published by Politico, has no doubt gone through multiple drafts by now, and other justices in the majority are likely writing separate concurring opinions, adding their particular views to a reproductive rights case of such magnitude. Multiple dissents may be in the works as well.\n\nFrom legal pads to shreds\n\nSome justices begin composing their opinions on legal pads; others go right to the computer. All draft opinions are printed out and circulated among the nine chambers by court aides. So there would be both electronic and paper copies of draft opinions throughout the justices’ chambers.\n\nDocuments to be discarded are shredded and burned.\n\nIndividual justices often retain opinion drafts and memorandums associated with cases. Early drafts, at least from past cases, can be found in justices’ archives at the Library of Congress and in certain law libraries.\n\nIrrespective of what is saved, the court has extensive rules about materials that law clerks may remove from the building and the use of its dual computer systems. Former law clerks told CNN that court opinions are supposed to be handled only on the closed, internal computer system, not the one through which justices, law clerks and other employees communicate with outsiders.\n\nRELATED: Private SCOTUS files that could reveal what happened in Bush v. Gore remain locked up\n\nSources tell CNN that court employees take care to lock their desks and shred sensitive materials. But justices sometimes travel with their work, and like all institutions that have rules for computer use and document protection, compliance depends on the people involved. Roberts declared in his Tuesday statement that the disclosure arose from “a singular and egregious breach of trust.”\n\n“We at the Court are blessed to have a workforce – permanent employees and law clerks alike – intensely loyal to the institution and dedicated to the rule of law,” he said.\n\nRoberts has tried to keep tight control of court operations. During oral arguments last December in the Mississippi abortion case, in fact, he expressed his disapproval of arrangements that past justices have made with the Library of Congress.\n\nHe referred to documents in the archive of the late Justice Harry Blackmun, the author of Roe, that became public more than three decades after the 1973 decision.\n\nRoberts declared the documents “an unfortunate source” and said there was “good reason not to have papers out that early.”\n\nWith this week’s disclosure of a contemporaneous first draft, those decades-old archival materials became the least of the justices’ concerns.", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/05/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/26/politics/john-roberts-chief-justice-roe-dobbs-analysis/index.html", "title": "Chief Justice John Roberts lost the Supreme Court and the defining ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChief Justice John Roberts has long piloted America’s highest court, securing majorities on controversies over religion, race, voting rights and campaign finance regulation. But on fundamental abortion rights and in the defining case of his generation, Roberts came up short.\n\nFriday’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned nearly a half-century of precedent, will be a seminal case in the annals of law and learning. It will be paired with the 1973 Roe v. Wade landmark that had declared a constitutional right to end a pregnancy, just as the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education, which ended the “separate but equal” doctrine and began desegregation of schools, has long been tethered to Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 decision that permitted separate but equal accommodations for Black and White people.\n\nYet where Brown ensured rights, of course, Dobbs eliminated them.\n\nIt was a sober, even humble Roberts who wrote – alone – as he separated himself both from the conservatives who dissolved a constitutional guarantee and from the liberal dissenters who expressed sorrow for American women and warned of further erosions on privacy.\n\nThe 67-year-old chief justice, who is finishing his 17th session, confessed to a rare lack of confidence.\n\n“Both the Court’s opinion and the dissent display a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share,” he wrote. Referring to the disputed Mississippi law at the heart of the Dobbs case, he added, “I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminating a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fifteen weeks.”\n\nRoberts, who has forcefully pushed for conservative outcomes on race and religion, had tried to move incrementally here. He attempted to split the difference, to uphold the disputed Mississippi law that prohibits abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy but to hold off on confronting Roe.\n\n“I would take a more measured course,” he wrote and urging – in vain – some judicial restraint, said, “If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary not to decide more.”\n\nYet as much as the reversal of Roe represents a significant defeat for Roberts and is a singular, staggering moment for the country, the chief is down but not out. The 2005 appointee of Republican President George W. Bush still generally resides on the winning side of this ideologically lopsided bench.\n\nJust one day before Dobbs, Roberts was part of the supermajority that struck down a New York handgun law and greatly expanded Second Amendment rights. Earlier last week, he wrote the 6-3 opinion requiring states that subsidize private schools to include religious education, further breaching the separation of church and state.\n\nRoberts has taken the lead against racial remedies, regarding them as both outdated and unconstitutional, and he authored the consequential 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision curtailing voter protections, particularly in the South and other places with a history of discrimination at the polls.\n\nStill, Friday’s Dobbs decision was monumental and will demarcate the Roberts Court era, even as he was outflanked on abortion-rights precedent by Justice Samuel Alito, who penned the Dobbs decision, and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nThose last three justices were appointed by former President Donald Trump, and their sheer presence had emboldened Mississippi officials to seek an expansive decision in a case that originally was confined to the validity of the 15-week ban.\n\nThe three liberals who fully dissented remarked at the speed with which the relatively new five-justice bloc, secured by the 2020 addition of Barrett, moved to reverse Roe.\n\nIn doing so, they wrote, “this Court betrays its guiding principles.” They said they felt sorrow for the court itself although more “for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection.”\n\nThe right wing grew weary of waiting for ‘another day’\n\nRoberts’ fate on the losing side of Dobbs was foreshadowed last year when he heatedly dissented as the same five conservatives who controlled in the Mississippi dispute allowed Texas to put into effect a six-week ban on abortion, known as S.B.8.\n\n“The clear purpose and actual effect of S.B. 8 has been to nullify this Court’s rulings,” including Roe v. Wade, Roberts wrote last December as the five justices endorsed the Texas ban that they had first permitted to take effect on September 1.\n\nIt was a sign that the tactical and usually persuasive chief justice, who himself has been critical of abortion rights, was outmaneuvered by a fivesome who wanted to go further, faster.\n\nBarrett’s succession of the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to be sure, diminished Roberts’ negotiating power. Her appointment transformed what was a 5-4 conservative-liberal court into a 6-3 bench, where Roberts no longer holds the crucial fifth vote for either wing. As the far right showed in Dobbs: it does not need the chief.\n\nRoberts had proposed a limited resolution at oral arguments last December, but he apparently never had any real momentum against the anti-Roe five. There were no signs in the opinions released on Friday that those who joined Alito had wavered in the view that, “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.”\n\nKavanaugh, who has sometimes joined Roberts in compromise, stuck with a line of arguments he had tried out at oral arguments, that reversing Roe puts the court in a “position of neutrality” on the abortion dilemma.\n\nRoberts declined to address that assertion in his concurring opinion, but dissenting Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan wrote that eliminating the right to abortion “is not taking a ‘neutral’ position.”\n\nRoe and the 1992 case that broadly reaffirmed it, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, had prevented states from interfering with a woman’s right to end a pregnancy before a fetus was viable, that is, could live outside the womb. Viability occurs at about 23 weeks.\n\nRoberts sought to “leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all.”\n\nAlito dismissed that possibility, saying “‘another day’ would not be long in coming. Some states have set deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter than Mississippi’s.”\n\nHe said that Roberts’ “quest for a middle way would only put off the day when we would be forced to confront the question we now decide. The turmoil wrought by Roe and Casey would be prolonged. It is far better – for this Court and the country – to face up to the real issue without further delay.”", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/06/26"}]}

Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now, his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.\n\nIn August, Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image, titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”), was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.\n\n“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it,” Allen, 39, told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.\n\nIn August, Jason M. Allen's piece \"Théâtre D'opéra Spatial\" — which he created with AI image generator Midjourney — won first place in the emerging artist division's \"digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography\" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. Courtesy Jason M. Allen\n\nAllen’s winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.\n\nThe definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.\n\nMidjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord, while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation, and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.\n\nThe newness of these tools, how they’re used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.\n\nThis came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.\n\n“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics,” one Twitter user wrote.\n\n“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’,” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”\n\nYet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.\n\n“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions,” he said.\n\nYou can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds, but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.\n\nFirst, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said. Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless.

The packs were loaded with sleeping bags, camping gear, cameras and food. A bottle of scotch.\n\nIt was early May of 1976, sunny and warm but not yet hot, and a group of the artist’s friends came along. They rode all afternoon and made camp in a valley of prickly pear and manzanita. There were ancient Indian dwellings in the cliffs above, a bright moon in the night sky.\n\nDeGrazia awoke in the morning and began to stack wood for a fire, teepee style, about shoulder high. He went to the saddlebags and fetched some Apache crosses, the kind used by crown dancers in ceremonies. He stuck them into the ground, draped a Yaqui deer headdress over one of them and laid a couple of gourd rattles on the ground.\n\nAll his life, DeGrazia had struggled to earn a living as an artist. For years, the public ignored him, galleries rejected him and critics had little good to say about his work. But he continued to paint, surviving a failed marriage, the Great Depression and lukewarm sales until at last his work caught on with the public. By that warm day in 1976, his work was worth so much that the Internal Revenue Service told him it might create a tax problem for his heirs.\n\nDeGrazia decided to make a statement to the agency. He invited some of his friends to ride with him into the Superstitions and they set up camp. Some of the horses had carried unsold paintings in their saddlebags, which DeGrazia gathered up and took over to the stack of wood. Sometime around noon, he lit a match, and the wood caught fire.\n\nOne by one, DeGrazia started to burn his paintings.\n\nMorenci and back again\n\nTed DeGrazia was born in the small Arizona mining community of Morenci in 1909, a few years before Arizona became a state. His father, an Italian immigrant, worked as a mucker in the mines. The work was hard, the winters cold, summers hot, the town a gathering of cultures from around the world: Mexican, Apache, Chinese, Italian. The streets snaked over hills and wrapped around mines and the high school was built on a slag heap.\n\n“Players kicked field goals in football games at the north end of the playing field because balls kicked toward the south end would disappear down Morenci Canyon,” James and Marilyn Johnson write in the book, “DeGrazia: The Man and the Myths.”\n\nWhen DeGrazia was a toddler, his mother sometimes tied him to the leg of a kitchen table to keep him from wandering off, the Johnsons write. When he grew older, young DeGrazia wandered often, joining Apache playmates and roaming the hills.\n\nHe was named Ettore, though his birth certificate named him Ettorino, which means Little Ettore, the Johnsons write. A Morenci schoolteacher anglicized Ettore to Theodore “because it was easier to spell.” Theodore became Ted. His last name appears with and without the space — De Grazia in family documents and on some of his paintings, though the foundation that would later bear his name prefers DeGrazia.\n\nHe learned Spanish, Apache, and English growing up, but when he was 11, the family moved back to Italy, where DeGrazia wasn’t eligible for school. He learned Italian, and how to play the trumpet, but had no formal schooling. When his family moved back to Arizona five years later, his parents insisted that he enroll in school, but he was so far behind he had to repeat the first grade. By the time he graduated from high school, he had a beard. He was 23.\n\nDeGrazia worked in the mines for a time but knew that “if he didn’t succeed at something else, he would likely spend the rest of his life underground,” the Johnsons write. He admired the work ethic of miners but had no desire to join them. He had seen men slashed in fights, heard whistles mark disasters in the mines, seen women and children gather to await news from below. When the Great Depression struck and the mines started to close, DeGrazia decided to leave Morenci and go to school at the University of Arizona.\n\nHe arrived with his trumpet, a change of clothes, and $15 in his pocket. He studied music and art, played trumpet in a band and did landscaping to pay the bills. For a time he roomed with a pre-law student named John Pintek, who said they used to go down to the railroad tracks and buy bootleg whiskey.\n\n“The whiskey was so bad you had to hold your nose sometimes to drink it,” Pintek said in an interview on file in the archives at the DeGrazia Gallery in the Sun, north of Tucson.\n\nDeGrazia settled down a little when he met a young woman, Alexandra Maria Diamos, and got married. He started working at his father-in-law’s movie houses in Tucson and, later, Bisbee.\n\nDeGrazia managed to sell a few paintings around this time, including a few to Raymond Carlson, editor of Arizona Highways, who wrote an article about the artist. One of his paintings was selected for an exhibit in New York. But even with these small successes, nothing in his life suggested DeGrazia was on the fast track to become a famous artist.\n\nIn the summer of 1942, DeGrazia and his wife drove to Mexico City, where he slipped a security guard $5, the Johnsons write, and went to see the acclaimed artist Diego Rivera. He showed the painter a few sketches, came in the next day and talked to the master, who agreed to take him on as a student assistant.\n\nDeGrazia came back several weeks later for his instruction. He slept on the streets, getting by on five cents a day, the Johnsons write. He lived on corn and mescal and did several paintings for Rivera, who encouraged him to go to the Market of Thieves for subject matter.\n\nThe market was where peasants gathered to buy stolen goods. It was a place of misery and poverty, and DeGrazia took it all in. His early work was about bars, cockfights, tequila, beggars, workers, peasants, Mexicans. He painted pictures of the Mexican Revolution, of soldiers lining people up on a firing squad wall.\n\n“These were people he cared about,\" said Lance Laber, executive director of the DeGrazia Foundation. He knew what it was like to not have two nickels to rub together.”\n\nHe worked with another acclaimed artist, José Clemente Orozco, during his stay. The two artists worked him hard. He swept floors, cleaned brushes, mixed paint, moved scaffolding and soaked in everything he could. The painters encouraged him and displayed his paintings in Palacio de Bellas Artes when he was done with his apprenticeship. The paintings earned favorable reviews in Mexico, and DeGrazia came home thinking that success was at hand.\n\nIt wasn’t.\n\n“These famous Mexican artists loved his work. But he got back to the United States and it didn’t translate,\" Laber said. \"Nobody seemed to care.” The work was too dark for American commercial success, Laber said.\n\n“People didn’t want to hang the firing squad wall over their fireplace,” he said.\n\nEven though the University of Arizona declined to display the paintings. DeGrazia continued his studies there, “but he never forgot the slight,” the Johnsons write. He began to resent the time it took to manage the theater. He and his wife grew more distant over time as DeGrazia began to pour himself into his work, sleeping only a few hours a night, working to complete two undergraduate degrees and a master’s. It was about this time he borrowed $25 from one of his brothers to buy some property from a farmer on the edge of Tucson, where he built a studio on Campbell and Prince.\n\n“I had well over a hundred paintings and no place to show them,” he wrote later. The adobe studio eventually had several small rooms he rented out. One of them became a Mexican restaurant called Rosita’s.\n\nTrouble at home\n\nDeGrazia’s wife tired of her husband disappearing into his work for days at a time. After a while, she suspected an affair. It is unclear if there was one, but in 1946, she filed for divorce. He was slapped with $100 a month in child support, a small fortune for the struggling artist, but he made every payment, his wife would write later in a family history.\n\nBut it wasn’t easy, not at first.\n\nDeGrazia would put his paintings out by the street with a \"for sale\" sign and forget about them. There are variations of this story. He traveled to Mexico and forgot about them. He would go to sleep and leave the paintings outside. The story always ends the same: The paintings stayed on the street.\n\n“Nobody would even steal his work. That’s kind of what he was up against,” Laber said.\n\nBut DeGrazia kept working.\n\nThe things that would make him successful were still to come.\n\nMore appearances in Arizona Highways.\n\nA Scottsdale art dealer.\n\nA Christmas card.\n\nA gallery in the sun.\n\nA change of style\n\nIn 1946, DeGrazia met Marion Sheret, and began a relationship that would last the rest of his life. They married in Mexico after a brief courtship, remarried when they found out that the marriage wasn’t legal, the Johnsons write. Sheret had a son, about 16 at the time, named Hal Grieve, who didn’t quite fit in to their plans.\n\n“Right after they went to Mexico and got married, then they had to figure out what to do with me,” Grieve said in an interview. The newlyweds send him to live with friends and relatives of Sheret’s family in California, Colorado and Pennsylvania.\n\n“They were very much into their art,” said Grieve, who lives in Tucson and is now a member of the DeGrazia Foundation. “I was kind of a problem. I didn’t think I was being shunted off. I thought it was kind of an adventure. And it was.”\n\nAlthough the marriage was far from perfect, it provided a glue to the business side of DeGrazia’s work. His paintings only sold for $3 to $5 at the time, and so he took on a variety of projects — sculpture, pottery, murals, jewelry, clothing — anything to pay the bills.\n\n“Marion basically held down the fort,” Laber said. “She made it easy for him to go other places and take care of business.”\n\nHis wife helped him with his ceramics work, kept the books, ran the household and the business while he traveled. She “never wavered in her desire to see DeGrazia achieve his goals, often at her own expense,” the Johnsons write.\n\nIn the late 1940s, DeGrazia made changes to his art style. He took up painting with a palette knife instead of a brush. He found a lithographer who could reproduce his canvases so he could sell them to a wider market at a lower cost. He began to use lighter colors, and paint happier subject matter. Gone were the peasants and firing squads. He started painting children instead. Children, horses, “round-eyed angels and the desert Indian,” Johnson writes. The public loved it. Arizona Highways continued to showcase his work and the market began to change.\n\n“Everybody wanted some of the Southwest. So he kind of hit it right at the perfect time. And it lasted throughout his lifetime,” Laber said. It was also about this time that a Scottsdale art dealer, Buck Saunders, started showing his work.\n\nOver time, DeGrazia built a following. He promoted his work with a balance of humor, anger, kindness, generosity, a flair for self-promotion. He showed up to public events with a bottle of scotch, spiked the punch bowls at gallery events, where he spent hours talking to the public. He wore cowboy hats and Western clothing.\n\nHe once made a ceramic bowl for a children’s home near an Indian reservation. A woman working for the home thanked him and told him it would bring in hundreds of dollars. “DeGrazia took the bowl back from her and smashed it on the ground, … ” the Johnsons write. “ ‘Now it will bring thousands,’ he said.” And it did. When Arizona Highways picked up this story, donations for bowl shards came in from around the world, and it brought in $100,000.\n\n“He was a marketing genius,” Laber said.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Tucson had grown, and DeGrazia’s studio was no longer on the outskirts of town. So he bought 10 acres under the Catalina Mountains and started a new project. In time, DeGrazia’s 10-acre parcel had a chapel, the first of several buildings the artist would build on this new property. The artist painted murals inside and kept it open for the public. He built an 821-square-foot home, a small studio.\n\n“That was his base of operations. He had a place to sleep, a place to work and sell his work, and a place to pray,” Laber said. He kept building. And painting.\n\nSuccess continued to come when he signed an agreement with Hallmark, and his work began to appear on Christmas cards, but after a few years he “tired of doing them,” the Johnsons write. In 1960, an official from UNICEF asked for permission to reproduce DeGrazia’s painting of 11 Indian children dancing in a circle for holiday cards.\n\nThe cards sold five million boxes.\n\nArt and culture\n\nIn 1965, DeGrazia started building a new gallery on his property — the Gallery in the Sun. He called on his Yaqui friends again. He drew up a few sketches, but they worked without plans or blueprints, making adobe bricks on site and assembling them into a sprawling, 16,015-square-foot building.\n\nDeGrazia’s travels to Indian land influenced much of his art. He was convinced that tribal cultures were vanishing, and he wanted to document them before they did.\n\n“He wasn’t just an artist. He was a historian,” Laber said. “He loved history.\"\n\nHe painted scenes from O’odham legends, bullfights, wagon trains, Father Kino. He painted horses. Wild horses. Horses ridden by nuns or children. He found his travels to Indian reservations both relaxing and educational.\n\n“He always brought gifts,” said Carol Locust, who lived on the San Carlos Reservation in the 1960s. He spoke Apache and brought candy for the kids, hand lotion for the ladies, tobacco for the men, she said in an interview.\n\nOne day he showed up for a parade. He was an outsider with a white Jeep, gray beard and denim jacket. Locust, a Cherokee married to an Apache, was at the parade with her children. DeGrazia smiled at the children and offered them candy. He had the rough, brown hands of a man who worked in the sun. She was curious about the stranger, and asked around. People said he was a painter. She thought he painted houses.\n\nYears later, when Locust enrolled at the University of Arizona, she found herself accompanying one of her professors to Rosita’s, the Mexican restaurant at DeGrazia’s studio at Campbell and Prince. The bearded stranger walked in with a friend. Locust’s professor greeted him. She eventually realized that the \"house painter\" she had seen on the reservation was actually the artist Ted DeGrazia.\n\nLocust, whose husband had died of a heart attack, was a single mother studying at the UA, and had trouble making ends meet. She showed DeGrazia one of her drawings, and he eventually hired her to work for him.\n\nBy this time, DeGrazia had made a lot of money painting, and mass producing, big-eyed children, burros, flowers and fiestas, leading critics to dismiss his work as too commercial, and not “serious.”\n\nBut his success allowed him to work on paintings that he would never sell, paintings that he used to fill the gallery, which had begun to draw a steady stream of visitors and friends. Artists from around the country visited the gallery. Tourists visited the gallery. There were parties and impromptu gatherings.\n\n“There was always somebody around,” Laber said. His wife began to resent the constant demand for her husband’s time, followed by long silences when the artist traveled.\n\n“I think at times she felt left out of the picture,” Laber said.\n\nShe frequently turned to alcohol to fill the void. The couple remained together, but drifted apart. DeGrazia began to look to his young assistant, Locust, for company, and she became the love of his life, the Johnsons write.\n\nDeGrazia kept up a frantic pace, painting, traveling, making appearances, spending time in the gallery and with Locust at her home.\n\n“He painted from 11 p.m. to 4 a.m. every night,” Locust said. “He couldn’t sleep. He was one of these people that do not sleep.”\n\nDeGrazia told her that “at night I can talk to the creator face to face because the world is quiet,” she said.\n\nDeGrazia had three children from his first marriage, and a stepson through his second wife. Soon, he and Locust would also have a child. With so many potential heirs, DeGrazia began to think about the future. When he found out that his unsold paintings would be taxed, he planned his ride into the Superstitions.\n\nInto the mountains\n\nDeGrazia rode into the Superstitions “with an entourage of 20 people,” the Johnsons write. They stopped for a snack around noon, got back on their horses and rode deeper into the desert. They could see Weavers Needle in the distance as they came over a rise and dropped into a valley of desert scrub. They made camp under tall cliffs, the valley bathed in moonlight.\n\nDeGrazia loved the Superstitions, their tales of lost gold and hidden treasure, their rugged beauty. He made frequent trips there, searching for gold, riding horses. He even started to build a gallery there but abandoned the project.\n\nDeGrazia awoke the next day and prepared the site, said Locust, who still works at the Gallery in the Sun. The IRS had told him he could go to prison if he pretended to burn paintings, and didn’t, Locust said, and so photographers were on hand to photograph the event. He cleared an area and gathered rocks for a fire ring. The cliff dwellings towered above.\n\n“He wanted to be there so the modern world and the ancient world could see what was happening,” Locust said. He laid down the Apache spirit swords, the Yaqui deer headdress and rattles and stacked wood for the fire.\n\n“He was preparing that place of burning not as a burning but as a cremation,” she said.\n\n“He started burning around noon and he burned from noon until nearly dark,\" Locust said. \"And he cried most of the day.”\n\nA photograph shows the flames above his head, a handful of paintings set around the wood pile. At the end of the day he stirred the coals and shoved unburned pieces into the embers until everything was gone.\n\n“He took a very small drink of Chivas. He took a very small drink of water … and he said: ‘It is done.’ By that time it was getting dark and everybody was going to their sleeping bags, but he still sat there,” Locust said. He ate very little. DeGrazia finally went to his hammock to sleep.\n\nSome said the event was a publicity stunt. Others thought it was a chance to create his own legend of the Superstitions. DeGrazia certainly didn’t set fire to his best work. Abraham Chanin, a longtime friend, said in an interview on file at the Gallery in the Sun that he once asked DeGrazia about the burning. He said the artist told him “they were my worst paintings and I knew if I burned them and got publicity, I would sell a hell of lot more paintings at a better price.”\n\nWhatever the burning was, a publicity stunt or a political statement, it seemed to affect DeGrazia emotionally, perhaps because the artist painted not just what he saw, but what he felt.\n\n“I think it was like destroying his own children,\" Laber said. \"That’s the kind of person he was.\"\n\nDeGrazia didn’t paint again for another two or three years.\n\n“He would tell me I’ve tried and I’ve tried but it hurts so bad when I remember,” Locust said.\n\nEven though he wasn’t painting, he stayed busy. He started a foundation that would provide some relief from tax collectors and keep the gallery doors open. And eventually, he agreed to do a sketch, which led him to paint again. But he began to slow down.\n\nSometime in the late 1970s, DeGrazia’s health began to fail. By 1981, the Johnsons write, his calendar filled with doctor appointments, radiation treatment and chemotherapy. None of it worked. Prostate cancer eventually spread until it reached his spinal column, and he spent his final days in bed, as friends, his children, even his ex-wife came to see him. His daughter recalled in an interview on file at the gallery that lawyers and accountants showed up and pleaded with him to agree to charge admission to the museum.\n\n“My dad shook his finger and he was real weak — he whispered, he couldn’t even talk — and he said, ‘No, there will never be an admission at the Gallery to get in. … I don’t want that up here. If they want to see my work they’re welcome to come and see my work anytime, several times a week, it doesn’t matter. … ’ \" the daughter said. \"He came from poverty but he always wanted to give and to help. He never became greedy or powerful with money … He was kind even when he was rich.”\n\nTed DeGrazia died in 1982.\n\nAbout 600 people attended his funeral. They placed flowers on his grave and the gallery grounds. Yaquis danced and a priest gave the liturgy and then placed the artist’s cowboy hat on the pine coffin. A Yaqui friend, Bernardino, played “haunting music on the flute,” the Johnsons write. People took turns flinging dirt on the coffin and the sun set behind the Catalinas. Later, stones from Morenci mines were piled on his grave.\n\nFor years, DeGrazia had painted, drawn and sculpted, selling what he could, stashing the rest in nooks and crannies throughout the gallery. He was never very organized about storing it, even less so during his illness.\n\nGrieve and Laber sorted through storage rooms, through bundles of paintings, the oils, thousands of watercolors and sketches — “we still haven’t cataloged all the sketches,” Grieve said. They fixed leaky roofs, dusted and cleared away cobwebs.\n\n“This gallery is a mud adobe gallery in the middle of the desert,” Laber said. “There’s dirt, there dust, there’s animals, bugs, there’s critters everywhere. There’s rattlesnakes. There’s bats.”\n\nThey build a vault and cataloged paintings into a database.\n\n“It was so amazing … It was like a magnet. I was drawn back every day,” Laber said.\n\nToday, the gallery receives thousands of visitors from around the world. People get married in the chapel, view paintings and sculptures and stroll the grounds. Some stand by the pile of stones that mark his grave, a pile of rock hauled in from the Morenci mines.\n\n“After a while we started to notice that there weren’t quite as many stones,” Grieve said, so he staked out the grave and watched to find that people were putting stones in their pocket.\n\nAnd so the gallery had a dump truck bring a fresh load of stones.\n\nToday, visitors in search of DeGrazia's legacy make their way to Tucson, leave things in the chapel, take the stones and walk through the gallery in the sun.\n\n“It has a heartbeat all of its own,” Grieve said.\n\n10 artists who left their mark on Arizona", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/arts/2023/03/23/michelangelos-david-long-history-of-controversies-now-in-florida/70041343007/", "title": "Art or pornography? Michelangelo's David has been controversial ...", "text": "On Sept. 8, 1504, Michelangelo’s towering marble statue of David was unveiled to the public in Florence, Italy. The 17-foot-tall, 12,000-pound statue carved from a single block of white Italian Carrara marble has been considered a masterpiece of High Renaissance art ever since, and a topic of controversy for nearly as long.\n\nThe statue depicts David, hero of the Jewish Torah and Christian Bible who slew Goliath and went on to become a king. Most depictions of David in paintings and sculptures to that point showed him as a boy facing or standing over the fallen giant, but the 26-year-old Michelangelo depicted him as a muscular nude man, alone and defiant, before the fight. The sculpture is a symbol of the strength and independence of the Florentines, according to the Galleria dell'Accademia di Firenze, the museum which displays it, and it has become of the world's most recognizable and treasured works of art.\n\nThe statue also has been challenged throughout its history for its unabashed nudity, especially when copies are displayed in different cities or reproductions or photos are displayed in public. Even when it was unveiled, while he praised it as a masterwork, Leonardo da Vinci suggested it be given a loin cloth.\n\nMost recently \"David\" was called out by parents at a Florida charter school. The principal at Tallahassee Classical School in Leon County resigned after three parents complained that the required Renaissance art class, which included \"David\" as well as the \"Creation of Adam\" fresco painting and Boticelli's \"Birth of Venus,\" upset their children. Two said they wished they'd been informed beforehand, and one parent called the lesson pornographic.\n\n'Parental rights are supreme':Tallahassee principal ousted after complaints about Michelangelo's 'David' in art lesson\n\nThere are copies of \"David\" all over the world, including a cast-bronze replica in the courtyard of The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota where it became the focus of the official seal of the city.\n\nHere are some other notable controversies in the life of \"David.\"\n\nMichelangelo's 'David' has been political from the start\n\nWhen \"David\" was put outside Florence's government offices in the Palazzo Della Signoria it was seen as a defiant sign against the powerful Medici family, who had been exiled from Florence a decade previously. It was said the statue's glare was intentionally aimed at Rome.\n\nProtestors attacked it with rocks the year it debuted, and in 1527 an anti-Medici riot resulted in David's arm getting broken in three pieces.\n\nMichelangelo's 'David' was immediately covered up\n\nWhen the statue was first installed in the Piazza della Signoria, authorities placed a garland of 28 copper leaves around his waist to cover his nakedness, which remained there until they were quietly removed around 1550.\n\nBut the Catholic Church cracked down on nudity in art as immoral and several powerful figures in the Vatican weren't happy with the nudity Michelangelo displayed on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The Church issued an edict in 1953 demanding that “figures shall not be painted or adorned with a beauty exciting…lust.” Loincloths and fig leaves were added to statues and artworks across Italy.\n\nWhen the statue was moved to the Galleria dell' Accademia and replaced in the piazza with a copy, there was a raging debate over whether the copy also should get a fig leaf. Ultimately, it was decided to leave him the way Michelangelo intended him.\n\nAfter shocking Queen Victoria, England's replica of 'David' received a detachable fig leaf\n\nThere are about 30 full-size replicas around the world, all created by permission from the Galleria dell'Accademia di Firenze. The first one was placed in the Piazza della Signoria in front of the Palazzo Vecchio, where the original David statue was originally before being moved inside.\n\nBut the one sent to Queen Victoria as a gift from the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1857 got a last-minute addition. She was reportedly horrified by the statue's nudity and a detachable fig leaf made out of plaster was added to preserve David's modesty before it went on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The leaf was kept in readiness in case of a royal; visit.\n\nChinese TV blurred him out\n\nDuring a program on an art festival in Beijing where \"David\" was one of 67 masterpieces on display in Beijing as part of the 100th anniversary of the National Museum of China, state-run China Central TV blurred the statue's genitals. Outrage over this spread and the TVB station removed the blur for its evening show.\n\n'David' has been forcibly clothed around the world\n\nThe Simpsons covered the 'David' controversy\n\nIn Season 2 of \"The Simpsons,\" episode 9, \"Itchy & Scratchy,\" the show took on the problems of violent children's television, nudity in art, and the problems when a few concerned parents try to make decisions for everybody.\n\nIn it, the Simpsons baby Maggie brains her father. Homer, with a mallet after seeing a cat and mouse attack each other on a popular cartoon show. Her mother Marge unites with other concerned mothers to form a protest group, S.N.U.H: Springfieldians for Nonviolence, Understanding and Helping. The group manages to intimidate the animation studio into making the carton safe, and utterly bland. Children across the city. bored now, go outside and play instead.\n\nBut S.N.U.H. (without Marge) also protests the display of Michelangelo's \"David\" at the Springfield Museum and Marge is forced to admit that she can't object to censoring one work of art while trying to censor another.\n\nHelen: Get dressed, Marge. You've got to lead our protest against this abomination! (shows Marge a newspaper with the statue of David on the cover)Marge: Hmm, but that's Michelangelo's David. It's a masterpiece!Helen: (gasps) It's filth! It graphically portrays parts of the human body which, practical as they may be, are evil.Marge: But I like that statue.Maude: I told you she was soft on full-frontal nudity.\n\nThe show, one of the run's most popular, helped set the tone for the long-running series by taking the different concerns seriously and showing the humor from all sides.\n\nA doctor from Indiana diagnosed 'David's' bulging neck vein\n\nDuring a visit to Florence in 2018, Dr. Daniel Gelfman, a Marian University cardiologist, noticed a bulging vein on the right side of the hero’s neck, usually a sign of heart disease.\n\n“It struck me as odd, very paradoxical. You wouldn’t expect to see that,” Gelfman said. “There are certain clues that you can pick up on physical exam that tells you that someone has heart disease and one of those clues is jugular venous distension. As a cardiologist, when I saw that, it was very dramatic to me. It really stuck out.”\n\nGelfman wrote an article for JAMA Cardiology where he discussed it, and the usefulness for medical students to study artworks to improve their diagnostic skills. Later he said he realized Michelangelo was depicting David in a state of excitement when some people's jugular veins temporarily distends, just as other people flush when they’re emotional. The artist may have even realized this long before medical experts did, Gelfman said.\n\n3D replica of Michelangelo's \"David\" in Dubai displayed from the neck up\n\nIn a world's fair in Dubai in 2021, controversy broke out when a 3D replica of \"David\" was displayed in all its glory, sort of. The statue was placed in a tall octagonal shaft between floors and most visitors to Dubai's Expo 2020 could only see David's head, with the rest hidden behind a partition. Only VIPs with special access were permitted to see it from head to toe.\n\n\"What the rich, the great and the good can see and what the ordinary folk can see shouldn't be two different things,\" said Professor Paul Gwynne, who teaches medieval and renaissance studies at the American University of Rome.\n\nC.

Trump signed an executive order closing the nation’s borders to many refugees and immigrants from around the world, particularly those from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nRaja, who had been visiting family in India, was not affected personally by the travel ban. But the massive crowds at O'Hare International Airport were a jarring way to get the news about the new immigration policy, just days after Trump’s inauguration. Protesters were chanting “Let them in!” as Raja, an immigrant from India and a U.S. citizen, struggled to get out of the airport and home to Milwaukee.\n\nBecause of Trump’s election and her experience at O’Hare, Raja stopped making art for a time. It wasn’t just the surprise of the political upset. She felt shock and sadness, she says, a shift in context that she couldn’t easily put words to.\n\nLike many artists, she also wondered what the role of the artist is in fraught political times.\n\nEventually, Raja's mind drifted to the trunks full of beautiful saris she kept at home, auspicious gifts given to her for various occasions, usually by family members.\n\n“I lived on the East Coast, and I used to wear them there,” she said of the garments, traditionally worn by South Asian women. “I felt fine in them, but here I don’t feel so comfortable.”\n\nShe didn’t wear her saris in Milwaukee, describing worries about “sticking out” as a woman from another culture. She thought about what it means to belong. She wondered what it might be like to express her cultural identity more publicly, more intentionally.\n\nAfter some weeks, Raja returned to her art studio, determined to make work again. As a matter of discipline, she forced herself to make one painting a day.\n\nSpills of watercolor inks formed soft-edged shapes on paper, paintings that resemble cells, ecosystems or universes. The paintings were purely apolitical, formal exercises that took a few moments to make and many hours to dry, during which time Raja started gathering her thoughts and making notes for a new art project.\n\n'Oh, this is it'\n\nArtist and photographer Lois Bielefeld was in her own artistic funk after the 2016 election.\n\nBorn and raised here, she was thinking a lot about “the sheer volume of people around me who thought very differently than I do,” she says, referring to Wisconsin turning red in the presidential election.\n\nBielefeld had grown up in a religious and conservative home, with family who believe she is leading a sinful life as a gay woman. Reckoning with opposing beliefs became especially acute when Bielefeld decided to marry, she says.\n\nHer own views may be progressive, but she believed she was acquainted with a broad spectrum of political views because of that upbringing, though she was starting to question her understanding.\n\nRELATED:2017 Nohl Fellowship winners include Lois Bielefeld and Sky Hopinka\n\nShe longed to make sense of the polarized and shifting political landscape through her work, though she wasn’t quite sure how, she says.\n\nIn recent years, Bielefeld has been making portraits that explore themes of gender and androgyny, as well as a series about Milwaukee families, in all of their manifestations and complexity, around the dinner table.\n\nShe noticed that some local photographers and artists had started documenting rallies and activism, but that wasn’t a fit for her.\n\nThen she got a proposal from Raja, whom she’d never met.\n\nIn an email, Raja explained her idea. Wearing her saris, she would insert herself into public spaces around Milwaukee, some mundane, others beloved, from a trip to the eye doctor to City Hall.\n\nShe wanted to simply be herself, to celebrate her differences rather than to conform, and to document these quiet and deeply personal interventions through a series of photographs. She hoped Bielefeld, whose work she admired, would take the photographs.\n\n“Immediately I was like, oh, this is it,”says Bielefeld, adding that it was the kind of collaboration she was hoping for.\n\nOccupying space\n\nRaja and Bielefeld call their project “On Belonging.” They’ve been collaborating for more than a year now and speak in an easy shorthand when they’re working. They've made 70 photographs so far.\n\nRaja selects a sari or two for each shoot, unfurling and wrapping herself in more than 5 yards of brilliantly colored textile. Her bright pink sari picked up the pussyhats and signage at a woman’s march, for instance, where Raja looks directly at the camera and the crowd’s focus is elsewhere, somewhere just out of the frame.\n\nWhile divisive political rhetoric was the impetus for the project, “On Belonging” is less a rebuke of certain political views than an exploration of the subtle cues and norms that make some people feel unwelcome or out of place in certain spaces.\n\nPeople innately stereotype and categorize, often based on initial, visual perceptions, the women say. In those moments, racist and xenophobic thinking can be observed in small and subtle acts.\n\n“You don’t know what people are thinking here,” Raja says. “Midwest nice is part of things here. People don’t want to say what they are thinking, but they will vote what they are thinking.”\n\nThe project was a way for Raja, who has called Milwaukee home for many years after living in several countries, and Bielefeld, who was preparing to move to San Francisco, to better understand the cultural and political landscape in a city they both call home.\n\n\"The work becomes an act of occupying space with a celebration of difference,\" Raja says. \"It also becomes a gesture of learning what my adopted home is made out of, in all its beauty and ugliness.\"\n\nPeople didn’t seem to notice Raja amid all of the color and costume of State Fair, though she definitely felt eyes on her during a shoot at a Brewers game. In some ways, the women have wondered if they didn’t give Milwaukee enough credit.\n\n“I do get stares, but I haven’t so far gotten any rude comments,” says Raja. “I totally thought I would….”\n\nOne photograph in the Miller Park women’s room is a complex portrait of both friendliness and distance among Raja and a woman, a stranger, who came into the bathroom and agreed to be part of the project.\n\nThe complex cultural negotiations of people and places are not always easy to read in the resulting photographs. Sometimes they are as much about how the viewer looks at the them.\n\nWhat does it mean to stand in a sari facing the altar of an old church, amid the novelty architecture of the Oriental Theatre or in front of Freedom Grocery in a mostly black neighborhood? What does it mean for her to walk alone across the 16th Street viaduct, once known as a racial dividing line and famous for being the site of fair housing marches half a century ago?\n\nHow did people perceive Raja’s garments on Bradford Beach or at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, where Christmas decorations and a sign for a meeting of a group who celebrate a freedom from religion coexisted?\n\nIn one photograph, Raja walks across a downtown bridge in a deep purple sari, while a group of pompom-carrying cheerleaders in red, white and blue walks the opposite direction. American flags flap above Raja and the girls.\n\nIn another image she stands beside the famous Milwaukee Public Museum diorama featuring Native Americans hunting bison. The historical confusion over the term “Indian” made that spot a natural for the project, Raja and Bielefeld say.\n\nRaja wore a handwoven sari to the museum. She associates these with ideas of resistance and India’s freedom struggle in the early 20th century, when Mahatma Gandhi encouraged independence through home weaving and the boycotting of expensive foreign fabrics, often made with cotton from India.\n\nRaja also describes a kind of self-segregation that happens among some immigrant communities, including her own. Some focus on re-creating a sense of home through tight-knit circles, she says. She and Bielefeld made photographs during some of these intimate gatherings, too.\n\nAs time went on, the sites for “On Belonging” became more personal to the women and the conversations they were having through the project. They made a photograph during a bus ride to Mayfair Mall with Bielefeld’s mother, for instance.\n\n“This is my most courageous work so far,” says Raja, who has never included her own image in her work or worked in public before. It’s a departure for Bielefeld, too, who is used to more controlled circumstances, creating photos that are carefully choreographed and lit.\n\nMany artists across the U.S. have refocused their art making around issues of cultural identity and politics in recent years, an art-world trend that has only become more pronounced in the current political climate.\n\n“We wanted to take notice of what’s happening,” says Raja, adding that cultural vigilance seems needed. “That’s what’s happening now. Everyone is anxious.”\n\nBielefeld says: \"It has been fascinating to dig much deeper into Milwaukee … and to see how we fit in.\"\n\n\"On Belonging,\" and elements of a second collaboration about the ways women are underrepresented in versions of Milwaukee's history, will be presented in spring of 2019 at a soon-to-open art gallery, The Warehouse, 1635 W.

But in the case of the world-renowned artist Faith Ringgold, Bergen County is — at least — trying.\n\nThirty years after she met with \"resistance\" (her word) by neighbors when she arrived in Englewood to set up her own studio, North Jersey is giving her the royal welcome she didn't get in 1992.\n\nNot, for Ringgold, an unfamiliar story arc.\n\n\"I have spent my entire life facing challenging situations and turning them into positive outcomes,\" Ringgold said.\n\n\"Faith Ringgold: Coming to Jones Road\" in Paramus, and \"The Art of Faith Ringgold\" in Teaneck are concurrent local art exhibitions, both up this month and running through April.\n\nThey're part of a package that also includes a newly-commissioned jazz suite in her honor, a children's craft program and an oral history project. Three grants are helping fund the whole thing, including $10,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\n\"This is an homage to someone who is long overdue for recognition in her own community,\" said Tim Blunk, director of Gallery Bergen at Bergen Community College in Paramus.\n\nAll the honors\n\nPut together, these events are the biggest tribute ever given to Ringgold in her own county. And \"Coming to Jones Road,\" running through April 27, is a first for this area. \"This work has never been shown in Bergen County before,\" Blunk said.\n\nPerhaps it doesn't really add luster to an already illustrious Q.V. — one that includes being in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, The Whitney, The Guggenheim, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nPerhaps it isn't as impressive as being a staple of art textbooks, a subject of dissertations, the namesake of a public school in Northern California. Perhaps it doesn't even rate the bragging rights of being a Trivial Pursuit answer: \"Which famous artist painted Campbell's soup cans?\" (hint — not Faith Ringgold).\n\nBut it's a nice thought.\n\n\"New Jersey has been my home for almost 30 years,\" said Ringgold, 92. \"Support for local institutions is very important for the cultural life of a community.\"\n\nThat community, she might argue, has not always been so supportive of her.\n\nRocky start\n\nExhibit A is the \"Coming to Jones Road\" pieces, 21 from an ongoing series that Ringgold has been doing, over the years, in multiple media. They are, among other things, an attempt to exorcise old demons.\n\nSome of them are \"narrative quilts\" — the acrylic-on-fabric form she pioneered and made famous. Paragraphs of text are built into the picture. Squares of fabric pay homage to the African American quilting of her ancestors.\n\n\"The story quilts were a natural progression from my series of oil paintings in the 1960s,\" she said. \"The last three oil paintings were monumental in size, which posed several problems. As a feminist, I wanted the ability to paint large without having to rely on my husband or anyone else to help me move them around.\"\n\nPaintings — as anyone who has ever tried to move one can tell you — can weigh a ton.\n\nA big part of that is the frame. And that was the germ of Ringgold's big breakthrough.\n\n\"I discovered Tibetan tankas [Tibetan Buddhist paintings on fabric] in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and realized a solution — to quilt the borders in place of wooden frames,\" Ringgold said. \"This made the work easy to handle and lightweight without compromising size. I wrote my words on the quilts when I couldn't get my autobiography published, not realizing I created a unique medium all my own.\"\n\nOne of her most famous works in this vein is \"Tar Beach\" — her tribute to the wonderful evenings on city rooftops where kids, from time immemorial, have partied, picnicked and slept.\n\nThe piece, part of her \"Woman on a Bridge\" series, was the basis for the first of her 21 children's books, the award-winning \"Tar Beach.\" It's part of the Bergen exhibit.\n\nOthers pieces in the \"Coming to Jones Road\" exhibit are silk screens and etchings.\n\nThat's Jones Road, as in Englewood. A pretty upscale part of it — not far from Flat Rock Brook Nature Center.\n\nRinggold, originally from Harlem, moved there with her husband, Burdette \"Birdie\" Ringgold, in 1992 — after she had already established herself internationally as a painter, sculptor, performance artist, innovator in fabric-based art, author, political activist, and voice for the disenfranchised, especially African Americans and women.\n\nIt did not go well.\n\nBest laid plans\n\n\"When my husband and I moved to Englewood from Harlem the zoning board opposed my plans,\" Ringgold said. \"The neighbors rallied to stop the addition of a studio.\"\n\nIt was a heated conflict. How heated can be seen in an exchange of letters, years later, in the summer of 2004 in the Northern Valley Suburbanite.\n\nThe hostility was \"largely\" on Ringgold's side, claimed one neighbor in a June 30 letter. She had personally gone to welcome the artist to the street, she said. \"I was happy that the neighborhood was becoming racially mixed and said as much that day,\" she wrote.\n\nThere were objections — she noted — to Ringgold building a two story studio in her backyard. \"Yes, the neighbors did not care for this idea,\" this woman wrote. But they were \"more than happy\" for her to add a second-floor studio to the existing house.\n\nRinggold responded, Aug. 25, by citing a 1993 Board of Adjustment meeting. A \"full house\" of hostile neighbors, as she remembered it.\n\n\"One after another they testified that my artists' studio was really a ploy to build a 'two family dwelling' which would create a 'parking lot' in front of my house and 'diminish the quality of life,' \" she wrote.\n\nIn other words: There Goes the Neighborhood. \"Blatant racism,\" she called it.\n\n\"They brought me to court and ultimately lost after several years,\" Ringgold told The Record.\n\nIn the end, she got her studio. Or at least, a studio. \"I have a wonderful spacious bright studio on the second floor which has been a blessing,\" she said. You might also say that she got the last word.\n\nThanks to her \"Coming to Jones Road\" series, which she began in 1999 while the story was still unfolding, it's Ringgold's take on events that people know. That's one advantage of being a famous artist.\n\nBut in the bigger scheme of things, who really gets the last word? Not the Faith Ringgolds of the world.\n\nA bigger story\n\nAfrican Americans, in this country, are still seen as interlopers in white folks' neighborhoods. They are there at the sufferance of the majority. And that may be what Ringgold is getting at in her \"Jones Road\" pieces — which are not, Blunk points out, an angry screed or a victory lap. In fact, they're not literally about the events of 1992 at all.\n\n\"Anyone would have understood if she had done a very angry series, very in-your-face protest art,\" Blunk said. \"She's known for that, from her work in the '60s. Instead, she took a very different path.\"\n\nWhat Ringgold has chosen to tell is a fictionalized version of her own family history, going back to the days of slavery.\n\n\"She said, I'm going to honor the ancestors who brought me to this studio that I'm building in Englewood,\" Blunk said. \"It was really a sublime reaction to it all.\"\n\nThere is a narrative, in wraparound writing, on the pieces: the story of Barn Door, Precious, and Baby Freedom, making their way North to the white house of their Aunt Emmy (based on her great-grandmother, Betsy Bingham), on Jones Road. Shadowy figures in black paint — some with auras or haloes — can be seen trooping through in the forest, under a blood-red sky, toward the welcoming white house in Englewood. Sanctuary? Maybe.\n\n\"It's important to find the bright light in a bad situation,\" Ringgold said.\n\nIt's a powerful narrative. So much so that it inspired BCC to create an ancillary program.\n\n\"The Ancestors Journey Oral History Project\" invites North Jersey residents to record the stories of their own forebears.\n\nQuotes from some of them will be used as part of a theater presentation at the College's Ciccone Theater on April 27. A newly-commissioned jazz suite, by famed Teaneck bassist and composer Rufus Reid, will accompany images of the \"Jones Road\" art, and snippets of narrative, in what Blunk calls a \"verbatim theater event.\"\n\n\"We're trying to encourage people from the African American community to tell their own ancestor stories, to share their own ancestor journeys,\" Blunk said.\n\nChildren's Hour\n\nAnd there's yet another side to Ringgold: her work with, and for, children. That's what inspired another adjunct feature of the BCC show: the \"Children's Makerspace.\"\n\n\"She's all about children,\" Blunk said. \"She has such a way of tapping into that child's unsullied, unpolluted, joyful view of the world.\"\n\nAt BCC, kids will be encouraged to make their own art, tell their own stories, with the aid of on-site child development experts. The Black Child Development Initiative (Paramus affiliate), the BCC Child Development Center, and the Bergen County Office for Children have partnered to create the program, adjacent to the museum space, which is by appointment only (Visit comingtojonesroad.wordpress.com).\n\nAll of it is very much in the Ringgold spirit.\n\n\"When you see Faith Ringgold's work, particularly works like 'Dancing on the George Washington Bridge' or 'Tar Beach,' it takes you back to that place as a child where play is the first thing in your mind, and invention is a natural part of your daily experience,\" Blunk said.\n\nMeanwhile, six miles away in Teaneck, there is a second Ringgold show, running simultaneously with the Paramus exhibit. \"The Art of Faith Ringgold\" will also consist of some 20 pieces, mostly smaller prints. It runs Feb. 26 to April 28.\n\n\"The other exhibit focuses more on her experience when she moved to Englewood,\" said Andrew Lee, director of Puffin Cultural Forum. \"The Puffin exhibit displays a more varied selection of prints and images. There are works regarding Faith's love of music, and portraits of Black historical figures.\"\n\nSo the \"Coming to Jones Road\" story has a happy ending — to this extent. The Englewood studio that Ringgold fought for, 30 years ago, has been very, very busy since.\n\n\"I have felt at home since I moved in despite my neighbors' resistance,\" Ringgold said. \"I focused on my work and my career moved forward.\"\n\nIf you go\n\n\"Faith Ringgold: Coming to Jones Road.\" At Gallery Bergen, West Hall, Bergen Community College, 400 Paramus Road, Paramus, through April 27.

Senior GOP sources close to leadership say it’s a matter of when – not if – House Republicans initiate an impeachment inquiry and that Mayorkas has become their No. 1 target, with their base itching for revenge after Trump’s two impeachments.\n\nImpeaching a Cabinet official has only happened once in US history, and the issue would become moot if Mayorkas were to resign. But talk of impeaching Mayorkas already has prompted internal pushback among some veteran Republicans who are skeptical that their policy disputes with the Cabinet secretary meet the bar of charging him with committing “high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nYet as they have railed over the migrant crisis in their push to regain the House, a number of leading Republicans fully endorse the idea and acknowledge it’s one that McCarthy will have to deal with if he wins the speakership following the midterms.\n\n“Mayorkas deserves (impeachment) for sure, because we no longer have a border,” said Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a McCarthy ally who is in line to chair the powerful House Judiciary Committee, which oversees impeachment proceedings.\n\nBut while Jordan personally supports the idea, he believes it will be “a conference decision,” saying, “I think we’ll all sit down. Kevin is open to sitting down and figuring out what we do.”\n\nAdded Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, a freshman GOP firebrand who has already endorsed impeachment articles for both Biden and Mayorkas: “Secretary Mayorkas should be a priority. Joe Biden’s his own demise.”\n\nYet McCarthy must also contend with a larger yet less vocal group of moderate and mainstream Republicans, who are wary of the potential political blowback over such a move and warning their colleagues not to weaponize the most powerful oversight tool at their disposal.\n\nGOP Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas said Republicans “should focus on policy” and “leave some of the other more emotional topics for another day.”\n\n“The risk is if people lose faith in the ability of Congress to even do its basic function,” Womack said of voter blowback for impeaching Mayorkas. “The people that I talk to from all stripes tell me they want a Congress that works – not a Congress that is preoccupied with kind of revenge-type agendas. Because then a lot of other things (that) need to happen don’t get to happen. And then that hurts the country.”\n\nSo far, McCarthy has carefully sidestepped impeachment questions, insisting Republicans are not going to pre-determine the outcome but are willing to go wherever the facts and the law lead them.\n\nYet McCarthy has not shut the door on the idea either, particularly when it comes to Mayorkas. And when pressed by CNN on whether Mayorkas is vulnerable to impeachment in a GOP-led House, he replied: “What happens at the border is above everything else.”\n\nDemocrats argue the talk is politically motivated and have instead called for Republicans to revisit immigration legislation that they say would alleviate the influx at the border. Biden’s Homeland Security Department has strongly defended its handling of the migrant crisis at the border, and said Mayorkas is solely focused on his mission at the agency — and has no intention of stepping down.\n\n“Secretary Mayorkas is proud to advance the noble mission of this Department, support its extraordinary workforce, and serve our country,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement. “He has no plan to resign.”\n\nInside the strategy shift\n\nHow McCarthy handles the impeachment drive from his right flank will be a defining moment of his potential speakership. Those calls — while doomed in the Senate — may be difficult, if not impossible, to resist if McCarthy is working with narrow margins in the House, and those demands are only going to grow louder in the immediate aftermath of a potential GOP takeover next month.\n\nSome lawmakers think McCarthy may be more amenable to impeaching Mayorkas than Biden, describing it as a release valve for the inevitable pressure from his right. Going after Mayorkas, even if it’s a fruitless endeavor that would almost certainly fail in the Senate, would also force more attention on immigration and the border, two issues that rile up the GOP base and that Republicans are eager to keep in the spotlight.\n\nIndeed, part of the reason for the shift in strategy: These Republicans believe they’ll have an easier time convincing McCarthy and their GOP colleagues to go along with impeaching a Biden political appointee versus a President who was elected to his position, a more politically tenable move that still would throw red meat to the base, according to GOP sources familiar with their thinking.\n\nAnd of all the various impeachment articles already filed by House Republicans, the resolution calling for Mayorkas to be removed from his post has by far the most cosponsors, with 31 GOP lawmakers backing the effort thus far – including Rep. Yvette Herrell of New Mexico, who is in a competitive reelection race, and Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, who is poised to take over the conservative Republican Study Committee next year.\n\n“There is a greater appetite among Republicans to impeach Mayorkas,” said conservative Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus. “The reason is, in my opinion, some don’t have the stomach for impeaching Biden or are fearful of the political impact of impeaching Biden. So, (the thinking is) here’s a consolation prize.”\n\nRepublicans say there’s ground to impeach Mayorkas over allegedly failing to maintain operational control of the border, which they argue caused an influx of fentanyl and illegal immigration, while accusing him of standing in the way of more stringent border controls like constructing Trump’s border wall. One GOP congressman, Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, accused Mayorkas of lying to him under oath.\n\nThe DHS has begun staffing up and taking other steps to prepare for potential investigations and impeachment proceedings in a GOP-led House, according to sources familiar with the situation. But the agency has defended how it has handled the situation at the border, while arguing they’re dealing with a broken immigration system.\n\nThe Biden administration is still implementing a Trump-era pandemic emergency rule, known as Title 42, that allows authorities to turn away migrants at the US-Mexico border following a court order earlier this year. But that authority has limits, and border officials have been overwhelmed by shifting demographics – many of the migrants are now from Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua.\n\nThe department maintains that the border is secure, but the change in people arriving at the US southern border has posed a steep challenge given in part frosty relations that largely bar the US from removing those nationalities. DHS has also noted that more individuals encountered at the border will be removed or expelled this year than any previous year, while the agency has stopped over 10,000 pounds of fentanyl from coming into the country during the first six months of this year, though the majority of fentanyl drug smuggling attempts occur at ports of entry.\n\nIf Mayorkas were to be impeached, he would join the ranks of William Belknap, the secretary of war, who was the only Cabinet official ever to be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors by the House before being acquitted by the Senate in 1876, according to congressional records.\n\nSome Republicans don’t think it would be the right move to have Mayorkas meet the same fate.\n\n“I don’t think it’d be a very wise decision, and I don’t think (premature impeachment talk) would be appropriate to engage in,” said veteran Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who is the ranking member of the House Rules Committee.\n\n“Even talking about that impeachment right now is irresponsible, because it’s a very serious thing. And it’s gotta be handled seriously.” said moderate Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee. “I felt the same way about the previous attempts as well. We have to restore it to what it was always intended to be, which is a last resort.”\n\nRepublicans setting stage for impeachment inquiry\n\nRegardless of whether Republicans end up going the impeachment route, there will be aggressive oversight of Mayorkas in a GOP-led House, as well as fierce funding fights over border security.\n\nOf the more than 500 preservation letters that House Republicans have sent to the Biden administration, a substantial chunk of them have been focused on the border, according to sources familiar with all the requests.\n\nRepublicans are seeking more information from the Department of Homeland Security about who is coming across the border; the status of the border wall; the administration’s plan to stem the flow of fentanyl and other drugs coming across the border; and how they define “operational control” of the border.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, quipped to CNN that Mayorkas “might have a reserved parking spot (at the Capitol) he’s gonna be up here so much.” But Scalise stopped short of calling for his impeachment.\n\nWhile hardliners aren’t backing away from saying Biden ought to be removed from office, they think they should primarily direct their energy toward Mayorkas.\n\n“I believe Mayorkas has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. You might see some (impeachment pushes) on Biden, but certainly Mayorkas, what he has done, has just been unconscionable,” said Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, the former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. “I’m pushing hard.”\n\n“It seems to me Secretary Mayorkas is deserving of a look (on impeachment),” Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, the current Freedom Caucus chief, said last week. “Let’s talk about it in 40 days.”\n\nRep. Brian Babin of Texas, who co-chairs the Border Security Caucus, told CNN that Mayorkas “certainly deserves” to be removed from office. Earlier this year, he spearheaded a letter along with GOP Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana that put Mayorkas on notice – and it was signed by every member of Republican leadership.\n\n“We didn’t use the word impeach, but it was pretty plain: if you don’t do your job, you could be removed from office,” Babin said. “It’s going to be something we look at.”\n\nSome hardliners are signaling they could back impeachment but they say they’re not there yet.\n\n“I think that’s something that we ought to consider,” said Roy, the Texas Republican. “But impeachment cases are something you build.”", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/politics/kevin-mccarthy-homeland-security-secretary-alejandro-mayorkas-impeachment/index.html", "title": "McCarthy demands DHS Secretary Mayorkas' resignation over ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKevin McCarthy on Tuesday demanded the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and warned of potential impeachment proceedings if he doesn’t step down, marking the House Republican leader’s strongest comments on the matter to date as he scrambles to lock down the votes for his speakership.\n\nMcCarthy, speaking from an event at the southern border, said that when Republicans take over the House in January, they will “investigate every order, every action, and every failure” to determine if they should begin impeachment proceedings.\n\n“Our country may never recover from Secretary Mayorkas’ dereliction of duty. This is why today I am calling on the secretary to resign,” he said. “If Secretary Mayorkas does not resign, House Republicans will investigate every order, every action and every failure. And we will determine whether we can begin an impeachment inquiry.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Mayorkas has no plans to resign and called on Congress to come up with legislative solutions to fix the nation’s broken immigration system. The agency continues to maintain that the border is secure, but has acknowledged it is dealing with an unprecedented number of noncitizens seeking to enter the country and that shifting demographics have added to the migration challenges they are facing.\n\n“Secretary Mayorkas is proud to advance the noble mission of this Department, support its extraordinary workforce, and serve the American people. He has no plans to resign,” a DHS spokeswoman said in a statement. “The Department will continue our work to enforce our laws and secure our border, while building a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system. Members of Congress should come to the table and work on solutions for our broken system and outdated laws, which have not been overhauled in over 40 years.”\n\nWhile McCarthy and top Republicans have repeatedly promised to launch rigorous investigations into problems at the southern border, McCarthy had – up until this point – largely tamped down impeachment talk, saying they would not pre-determine the outcome or use impeachment as a political weapon and would follow the facts wherever they lead next year.\n\nMcCarthy’s shift in tone comes as he is facing a rebellion from his right flank in the speaker’s race, with at least five House Republicans vowing to vote against him on the floor in January. One of the complaints about McCarthy from the GOP hardliners is that he isn’t aggressive enough when it comes to investigations and impeachment.\n\nThe right flank has been agitating to impeach Mayorkas in particular, though others in the party are skeptical that the secretary’s actions meet the bar of high crimes and misdemeanors. Impeaching a Cabinet official has only happened once in US history.\n\nMcCarthy – who was nominated by his party last week to serve as speaker – made his comments about Mayorkas from El Paso, Texas, where he and a group of House Republicans met with border patrol agents and received an operational briefing earlier in the day.\n\n“We spent the day with border agents,” McCarthy said at a news conference following their visit. “I asked each and every one that this border is secure. They laughed. They said it is not; it is one of the worst points in the history of this nation.”\n\nWhen pressed on what potential crimes Republicans would investigate, McCarthy responded: “Lying to the American public, withholding ICE from doing their job, not following through on what the laws in the books are today.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded to McCarthy’s planned visit to the US-Mexico border earlier Tuesday by asking what his plan is on immigration and accusing Republicans of having “no plan” and just “political stunts.”\n\n“The question that we have for Kevin McCarthy – who is soon to be Speaker McCarthy – what is his plan? What is he doing to help the situation that we’re seeing. What is his plan? He goes down there and does a political stunt, like many Republicans do, that we have seen them do, but he actually is not putting forth a plan,” Jean-Pierre said when asked about the White House reaction to McCarthy’s visit.\n\nRepublicans have already started to lay the groundwork for investigations related to the border next year. Top GOP lawmakers have requested a wide swath of documents related to the Biden administration’s enforcement of immigration policies and have formally told the White House that they’d like to possibly hold hearings and conduct transcribed interviews with Mayorkas and a number of other officials.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Kristin Wilson", "Melanie Zanona", "Kristin Wilson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/07/25/mccarthy-impeachment-biden/70461126007/", "title": "House Speaker Kevin McCarthy talks possible Biden impeachment", "text": "WASHINGTON — House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Monday evening in an interview with Fox News he believes investigations by House Republicans into the business dealings of President Joe Biden's family are \"rising to the level of impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nMcCarthy's comments are the strongest indication to date that Republicans will launch impeachment proceedings against Biden over his family's business dealings with Ukrainian and Chinese companies.

But I think the Cabinet should meet and discuss this. Because the behavior yesterday, and the weeks and months before that, has just been outrageous by the president. What happened on Capitol Hill yesterday was a direct result of his poisoning the minds of people with the lies and the frauds.”\n\nAt first, Kelly hesitated when asked whether he would vote to remove Trump from office right now if he were in the Cabinet.\n\n“Yes, I would,” he then said. “The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is it’s only 13 days. And no one – as indicated yesterday by our vice president – no one around him anymore is going to break the law. He can give all the orders he wants, and no one is going to break the law. And we saw Vice President Pence stand his ground yesterday.”\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have pushed for Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump before his term ends in two weeks. Pelosi told reporters she would be prepared to vote on articles of impeachment if it doesn’t happen.\n\nKelly, a retired general who also served as Trump's secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, left the White House in January 2019. After initially holding back criticism, Kelly in June said “we need to look harder at who we elect” after Trump used the military to break up a protest outside the White House.\n\nTrump excoriated Kelly in September, saying he was \"exhausted\" and \"unable to handle the pressure\" as his former chief of staff. It came after The Atlantic magazine reported Trump accompanied Kelly on a 2017 Memorial Day visit to his son's grave at Arlington National Cemetery and openly questioned the slain Marine's sacrifice.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump phones in to RNC meeting, doesn't mention calls for his removal\n\nPresident Donald Trump phoned in to a Thursday breakfast meeting of the Republican National Committee winter conference as lawmakers call for him to be removed from office following violent riots at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump, who had considered giving a speech to the RNC, perhaps by video, called in to express regrets for missing the event, said two people familiar with the call, which lasted about a minute and took place during a private meeting.\n\nThe president did not mention his vast political troubles, including calls for his removal from office after Wednesday's invasion of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters protesting the Electoral College count. Trump had egged on supporters to protest the vote that confirmed the victory of President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nMembers cheered Trump during his brief phone call, officials said.\n\nThe Republicans, who are meeting at Amelia Island, Fla., near Jacksonville, have closed most of their sessions to the media. The only public event is scheduled for Friday morning, when members are expected to reelect Trump ally Ronna McDaniel as the party chairwoman.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPelosi says the House's chief law enforcement official is resigning, calls for Capitol Police chief to resign\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House Sergeant at Arms – the chamber's top law enforcement official – is resigning in the aftermath of Wednesday's siege on the Capitol.\n\nPaul Irving, who serves as the House's chief officer in charge of securing the building and tasked with overseeing the safety of lawmakers, was a target of criticism after the intense security breach that led to dozens of Trump protesters storming the Capitol.\n\n\"I have received notice from Mr. Irving that he will be submitting his resignation,\" Pelosi said. \"Having said that, we'll have the after action review but it goes beyond the Capitol Police.\"\n\nThe California Democrat also called for the resignation of the Capitol Police Chief, Steven Sund, calling it a \"failure of leadership at the top of the Capitol Police.\" Pelosi added that she hadn't heard from Sund since Wednesday's attack. \"He hasn't even called us since this happened.\"\n\n– Christal Hayes\n\n'This man is deadly': Pelosi calls for Trump's removal from office using 25th Amendment\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi joined the growing calls by many Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Donald Trump from office in the final days of his presidency, telling reporters at a press conference that if this wasn't done the House would be prepared to vote on articles of impeachment.\n\n\"I join with the Senate Democratic leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment,\" she told reporters. \"If the vice president and Cabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment.\"\n\nPelosi delivered stinging comments about Trump, calling him a dangerous man who the country – for its own safety – can't afford to keep in the White House for his final two weeks of his term.\n\n\"This man is deadly – to our democracy and to our people,\" Pelosi said.\n\nHer remarks come a day after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol as they counted electoral votes, disrupting proceedings and forcing lawmakers to evacuate. Pelosi's office was among those that were ransacked. Some congressional Democrats laid the blame on Trump for inciting the riot, calling for his removal from office or impeachment for a second time.\n\n\"The President has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,\" she said, characterizing the insurrection from the pro-Trump rioters as \"acts of sedition and acts of cowardice.\"\n\nPelosi was visibly upset as she spoke about the trauma of congressional staff members who were forced to lock themselves in rooms and hide under desks while \"terrorists\" banged on doors. “They didn’t sign up for that,” she said.\n\n\"To meet with them and to see how frightened they were because these thugs – these Trump thugs – decided that they would desecrate the Capitol with no thought what harm they might do physically, psychologically or in any other way.\n\n“And they will be prosecuted,” she added. “They will be prosecuted. Justice will be done.\"\n\nPelosi's comments came shortly after the Senate's top Democrat, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, joined the chorus of lawmakers calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and move with the Cabinet to remove Trump from office. If they failed to do so, Congress needed to reconvene to impeach Trump for a second time, he said.\n\nDeclaring \"the president must be held accountable again,\" Pelosi put out a challenge to Trump's Cabinet: \"Ask each member of the Cabinet, do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say in the next 13 days, this dangerous man can do further harm on this country?\"\n\n\"We are in a dangerous place in this country as long as Donald Trump still sits in the White House,\" she said.\n\nPelosi said she's not sure when Pence will respond to her call to trigger the 25th Amendment\n\n\"I don't think that it will take long to get an answer form the vice president. It will be yes or it will be no,\" she said.\n\n\"I say I pray for the president every day, and I do. Last night was the hardest day for me. At 5 o'clock in the morning, when I finally got home, as I was praying at night, I said, 'You gotta keep praying for him, you've gotta keep praying for him. Maybe, maybe there's some hope.' But we can't take that chance because people's lives are at stake as well as our democracy,\" she said.\n\n– Christal Hayes and Joey Garrison\n\nBiden says Trump administration treats protesters differently\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden took a personal moment while introducing his nominees to the Justice Department to point out unequal treatment he said rioters received while swarming the Capitol on Wednesday, in contrast to how Black Lives Matter protesters were treated during summer protests for racial justice.\n\nBiden said his granddaughter, Finnegan, sent him a picture of troops in military gear standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during Black Lives Matter protests. Yet D.C. and Capitol police were unable to prevent rioters Wednesday from smashing windows and doors to break into the Capitol.\n\n“This isn’t fair,” Biden quoted Finnegan as saying.\n\nBiden said there is no question the Trump administration treated Black protesters differently than the rioters challenging the congressional count of the Electoral College votes confirming that Biden beat President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Nobody can tell me that if it was a group of Black Lives Matter protesters that they wouldn't have been treated differently than the thugs who stormed the Capitol,' Biden said. \"We all know that is true. And it is unacceptable – totally unacceptable.\"\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nTransportation Secretary Chao to resign\n\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao will resign from her position, she announced Thursday.\n\nChao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is the first Cabinet secretary to resign after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday in an attempt to halt the counting of Electoral College votes.\n\n\"Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the President stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed,\" Chao said in a statement. \"As I'm sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.\"\n\nChao noted her office would continue to help Pete Buttigieg, President-elect Joe Biden's choice for transportation secretary, transition into his role.\n\n– Phillip Bailey\n\nSchumer says he'll fire Senate Sergeant at Arms after Capitol riot\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday the Senate Sergeant at Arms had to resign or would be fired following rioters' storming of the U.S. Capitol Wednesday during the electoral vote count.\n\n“If Senate Sergeant Arms Stenger hasn't vacated the position by then, I will fire him as soon as Democrats have a majority in the Senate,\" Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement.\n\nThe Senate Sergeant at Arms is the Senate's highest-ranking law enforcement official. Michael Stenger currently holds the role.\n\nSchumer is set to become the Senate majority leader as soon as Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are sworn into the Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called the breach of security a \"massive failure\" and vowed a \"painstaking investigation and thorough review.\"\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nDOJ, FBI promise arrests, criminal charges after violence at Capitol\n\nFederal officials on Thursday promised arrests and criminal charges are forthcoming against rioters who participated in the violence at the Capitol.\n\nActing Attorney General Jeffery Rosen said charges are expected Thursday and in the coming days and weeks.\n\n“Yesterday, our Nation watched in disbelief as a mob breached the Capitol Building and required federal and local law enforcement to help restore order. The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that those responsible for this attack on our Government and the rule of law face the full consequences of their actions under the law,\" Rosen said.\n\nA mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol Wednesday, prompting an hours-long lockdown and disrupting what should have been a largely ceremonial process of counting state-certified Electoral College votes. President Donald Trump has for weeks falsely claimed the election had been stolen from him and urged his supporters to go to the Capitol. Images of the aftermath showed broken windows and vandalized property.\n\nOne protester was shot and killed by a Capitol police officer during the melee.\n\nIn a separate statement Thursday, FBI Director Chris Wray described those who stormed the Capitol as \"violent agitators and extremists\" who incited violence under the guise of the First Amendment.\n\nThe FBI has created an online form for people to submit tips and video evidence.\n\n– Kristine Phillips\n\nNational Guard troops, perimeter fence part off tighter security measures around Capitol\n\nThousands of National Guard troops will be arriving in Washington by the weekend, part of a stepped-up security effort local federal officials announced Thursday in the wake of an unprecedented riot at the U.S. Capitol Wednesday by pro-Trump supporters.\n\nU.S. Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy said 850 troops already have been deployed to the U.S. Capitol grounds and that as many as 6,200 National Guard soldiers from around the region will be available by this weekend to help quell any lingering protests from Wednesday’s attack on the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nIn addition, McCarthy said a seven-foot “non-scalable” fence was being erected around the perimeter of the Capitol grounds which will be in place for at least 30 days. That period would include the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden who will take the oath of office on the west side of the Capitol.\n\nOfficials hope to prevent a repeat of Wednesday’s breach of the Capitol, where hundreds of rioters stormed into the building, destroyed offices and broke windows. They broke into the building after attending a rally near the White House where President Donald Trump exhorted them to go and support lawmakers trying to object to the ceremonial count of the Electoral College votes that gave Biden his election victory.\n\n“The current president must be held accountable for this unprecedented attack on our democracy,” Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a news conference Thursday. “What happened yesterday is textbook terrorism.”\n\nMetropolitan DC Police Chief Robert Contee said 68 people were arrested including 41 on the grounds of the Capitol, many of them after the city imposed a 6 p.m. curfew Wednesday. Only one of the those arrested was from D.C.\n\nThe police are trying to identify many of the rioters by sharing images with local hotels, airports and FBI offices throughout the country.\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer: Trump should be removed from office\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer joined the growing calls among congressional Democrats to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Donald Trump from office following riots at the Capitol Wednesday.\n\nSchumer, who is set to be the Senate majority leader when Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock take office, said Trump incited the riot and \"should not hold office one day longer.\"\n\nThe New York Democrat said Vice President Mike Pence should invoke the 25th Amendment and move with the Cabinet to remove Trump from office. If they failed to do so, Congress needed to reconvene to impeach Trump for a second time, he said.\n\nAn administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the prospect of invoking the 25th Amendment has not been brought to the vice president.\n\nAfter the riot, some congressional Democrats, laying the blame at Trump's feet for inciting the riot, have called for his removal from office.\n\nRep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., the fourth-ranking House Democrat, seemed to endorse invoking the 25th Amendment in a Wednesday night statement saying Trump needed to be removed from office.\n\nSome centrist Democrats called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked too. Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., the chair of the moderate New Democrat Coalition, said Wednesday the 25th Amendment needed to be invoked \"for the good of the country.\"\n\nAnd on MSNBC, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a close ally to President-elect Joe Biden, said \"This is a fire that he first lit in Charlottesville, and that has only been building in intensity in the last few years, and will only be solved by the removal of President Trump.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet commented on the issue.\n\n– Nicholas Wu and Maureen Groppe\n\nWhite House pulls acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf's nomination after he urged Trump to 'strongly condemn' unrest\n\nThe White House on Thursday withdrew its nomination of Chad Wolf to be the permanent Department of Homeland Security secretary just over an hour after Wolf urged the president to \"strongly condemn\" the unrest at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWolf, who serves as acting DHS secretary, joined several former and current administration officials in denouncing the president's supporters who violently forced their way into the Capitol building during a joint session of Congress to count the Electoral Votes to affirm President-elect Joe Biden's win. The upheaval led to 68 arrests and four deaths, including a woman who was shot inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"What transpired yesterday was tragic and sickening. While I have consistently condemned political violence on both sides of the aisle, specifically violence directed at law enforcement, we now see some supporters of the President using violence as a means to achieve political ends,\" Wolf said in a statement.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere said the withdrawal had no correlation to Wolf's statement.\n\n\"The withdrawal occurred yesterday and was not related at all to Wednesday’s events or the Acting Secretary’s comments this morning. Acting Secretary Wolf remains the acting secretary and continues to perform the duties of his office,\" Deere said in a statement.\n\nThe White House did not provide any details on why it withdrew the nomination.\n\nThe acting DHS secretary is the first Cabinet official to publicly call on Trump to roundly condemn the violence.\n\n\"This is unacceptable. These violent actions are unconscionable, and I implore the President and all elected officials to strongly condemn the violence that took place yesterday.\"\n\nWolf, who is abroad in the Middle East, added that he planned to remain in his position until Jan. 20, when Trump leaves office to ensure an \"orderly transition\" to Biden's administration.\n\n– Courtney Subramanian\n\nBarr calls Trump's actions 'betrayal of his office'\n\nFormer attorney general William Barr, once one of Trump's strongest defenders, issued a scathing account of the president's conduct, casting it as a \"betrayal of his office.\"\n\n“Orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable. The President’s conduct yesterday was a betrayal of his office and supporters,” Barr said in a statement Thursday.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nBiden's win affirmed by Congress after day of rioting\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden's presidential victory was affirmed by Congress on Thursday hours after a pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol during a day of violence that sent lawmakers scrambling for cover and led to the deaths of four people.\n\nThe constitutionally required count of Electoral College votes, typically a brief ceremonial event, came to an abrupt halt as lawmakers were swiftly escorted away and people waving Trump flags were seen knocking down police barriers around the Capitol and walking through halls normally reserved for lawmakers and tourists.\n\nViolence flared as Republican leaders engaged in a stunning and historic series of political maneuvers, with Trump demanding Vice President Mike Pence use his perch in the Senate to overturn the election – an outcome Pence had no authority to pursue.\n\nCongress affirms Biden win:Electoral count is formalized after riots at the Capitol\n\nTrump, who has raised baseless claims and conspiracy theories about election fraud, has refused to concede the election despite state-certified results showing Biden won the Electoral College, 306-232.\n\nOnce the Capitol was secured Wednesday evening, lawmakers resumed their session hold the formal count of the Electoral College results that showed Biden had defeated Trump in the Nov. 3 election. Lawmakers spent several hours debating GOP objections to the count before rejecting them.\n\nPence confirmed Biden as the winner at 3:41 a.m. EST.\n\nNot long after, Trump released a statement through a White House social media account, acknowledging Biden's win, a first. \"Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,” Trump's statement said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/07/26/white-house-mocks-gop-for-potential-biden-impeachment-inquiry/70471076007/", "title": "White House mocks GOP for potential Biden impeachment inquiry", "text": "WASHINGTON − The White House mocked House Republicans on Wednesday for threatening impeachment inquiries targeting President Joe Biden and members of his Cabinet, characterizing such talk as a desperate response to an improving economy under Biden's watch.\n\nThe rebuttal signals an aggressive, head-on approach from the White House to get in front of potential impeachment proceedings that would collide with the 2024 presidential campaign season.\n\n\"Now House Republicans are channeling their frustrated energy into a measured and purposeful urge to impeach… someone… somewhere… for something,\" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in an memo, in which he provided the ellipses for emphasis.\n\n\"We’re sure they’ll figure that one out. And this time, it’ll work wonders! Just like their pursuit of manufactured conspiracy theories about the President for the past four years has.\"\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy, under pressure from the right flank of his party to pursue impeachment of Biden and other administration officials, said Monday that investigations by House Republicans into the business dealings Biden's family are \"rising to the level of impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe next day, McCarthy seemed to walk back the certainty of an inquiry, telling reporters he \"wasn't announcing it.\"\n\n\"I simply said that the actions that I’m seeing by this administration − withholding the agencies from being able to work with us, that would rise to the level of an impeachment inquiry,\" McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy's comments were the strongest indication to date that Republicans could launch impeachment proceedings against Biden over unsubstantiated allegations that he was involved in his son Hunter's business dealings with Ukrainian and Chinese companies when he was vice president.\n\nThe House speaker said an impeachment inquiry would give Congress \"the strongest power to get the rest of the knowledge and information needed\" to take further action against the president.\n\nIn a statement on the White House memo that fired back at House Republicans, Chad Gilmartin, deputy spokesman for McCarthy, told USA TODAY, “Every day our committees uncover new evidence concerning Biden Inc. They will continue to follow the facts – even as the White House changes their story while refusing to answer important questions.”\n\nHouse Republicans have not clearly identified a criminal wrongdoing from Biden that would be the basis of an impeachment inquiry but have recently pointed to evidence cited by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chairman of the Oversight Committee, that Hunter Biden put his then-vice president father on the phone with foreign business associates.\n\nGOP members of Congress have also launched investigations into Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who faced a barrage of questioning from Republicans Wednesday over his handling of migration at the southern border during a House Judiciary Committee hearing. House Republicans have talked about targeting Attorney General Merrick Garland with impeachment as well.\n\nAt the House hearing, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y, derided the GOP for making \"bogus claims\" against Mayorkas. \"Some of it dangerous. Some of it petty. None of it true.”\n\n\"To be clear, Republicans have not established any legitimate grounds to impeach Secretary Mayorkas. They have not uncovered evidence of wrongdoing or malfeasance of any kind,\" Nadler said. \"They have policy disagreements with the secretary. And so do we. But policy disagreements and personal grudges are not a basis for impeachment.\"\n\n\"I think the Republican desire to impeach someone, anyone, no matter whether there's any evidence, just shows how they have descended into chaos,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Fox News on Tuesday of the GOP threat to impeach Biden.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis endorsed an impeachment inquiry into Biden, saying House Republicans would be within their rights to pursue.\n\n\"They impeached Trump for a phone call,\" DeSantis said in an interview on Fox News. \"Are you trying to tell me Biden's conduct isn't as significant at that? It's way more significant. So they are absolutely within their rights to do that.\"\n\nIn the White House memo, Bates accused Republicans − who for months blasted Biden over inflation that was previously rising − of failing to find a coherent message to combat \"Bidenomics,\" the White House's newly branded name for the president's economic agenda.\n\nThe White House has celebrated a string of good news on the economic front that it credits the president with: inflation that has now declined 12 straight months, downgraded recession predictions, historically low unemployment and rising consumer confidence.\n\nBates characterized Republicans' impeachment talk as their latest addition to a \"haphazard non-message.\"\n\n\"Instead of having a consistent, disciplined message, the congressional GOP’s public criticisms of the Biden-Harris Administration are now a fragmented grab-bag that runs the gamut ...,\" Bates said. \"The bottom line is this. The subtitle to everything that makes up congressional Republicans’ disjointed message is this: 'Bidenomics is working.'\"\n\nBefore former President Donald Trump’s two impeachments, only two presidents had ever been impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nWhile a potential Biden impeachment inquiry has moved into the mainstream of the Republican Party, some lawmakers in the GOP are opposed to spending what little time that Congress before the end of the fiscal year to work on appropriations bills investigating the president. The House will recess at the end of this week until mid-September.\n\nAppearing on CNN, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., called McCarthy's moves \"impeachment theater.\"\n\n\"What he is doing is he is saying there is a shiny object over here, and we're really going to focus on that. We just need to get all these things done so that we can focus on this shiny object,\" Buck said. \"Most of us are concerned about spending. It is an existential threat to this country.

But the conservative hardliners are emboldened by the likelihood of a narrow House GOP majority and are threatening to withhold their support – something that could imperil his bid or force him to make deals to weaken the speakership, something he has long resisted.\n\nRep. Chip Roy of Texas told reporters that “no one currently has 218” votes for speaker, which is the magic number McCarthy would need to secure the speaker’s gavel on the House floor in January, and said he wants McCarthy to list in greater detail his plans for a wide array of investigations into the Biden administration. And Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona complained that McCarthy seemed to backpedal on whether he’d be willing to launch impeachment proceedings into President Joe Biden or members of his Cabinet.\n\n“I’ve heard from multiple of my constituents who question the wisdom of proceeding forward with that leadership,” Biggs said, adding that there needs to be a “frank conversation” about who they elect for the top job.\n\nMembers of the group are also pushing to make it easier for lawmakers to call for floor votes on ousting a sitting speaker. That is something that McCarthy is adamantly against and was wielded over former Speaker John Boehner before he eventually resigned.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado said it was a “red line” for her, but not everyone in the Freedom Caucus is united on whether to make that a hard line.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus, a group that includes dozens of hardline members, have been meeting in Washington, DC, this week for their new member orientation, where they have begun to plot out their strategy for the speaker’s race. With a slimmer-than-expected majority, they see an opportunity, and are planning to use their leverage to get more power in a GOP-led House.\n\nBut the group’s push to extract concessions from McCarthy has exacerbated tensions inside the party. Said one senior GOP lawmaker: “They are a bunch of selfish, prima dona a**holes who want attention for themselves. They are trading effectiveness for the warm embrace of their social media followers.”\n\nMcCarthy, who has been working the phones locking down support from across the conference and received former President Donald Trump’s endorsement on Monday, still remains a frontrunner for the job, and no serious challenger has emerged. And two would-be challengers, Reps. Jim Jordan and Steve Scalise, have lined up behind his speakership bid.\n\nMcCarthy also has time to win over critics. The GOP’s internal leadership elections, where he only needs a simple majority to win his party’s nomination for speaker, are next week, but the floor vote where McCarthy needs a majority of the entire House is not until January.\n\nHis ability to round up 218 votes for speaker will ultimately depend on two things: the size of his majority and whether he’s willing to cut deals with the conservatives that he assiduously courted after they denied him the speakership in 2015. So far, however, McCarthy has not made any promises or given in their demands, with sources saying he has just been in listening mode with potential holdouts.\n\nCNN has yet to project which party will have control of the House of Representatives, though as of Friday morning, CNN has projected that Republicans have 211 seats to Democrats’ 198.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina said McCarthy personally called and asked for his support for speaker, but Norman wouldn’t commit. He told McCarthy there’s a group of them that wants to meet in person, which he said McCarthy was amenable to.\n\nNorman said the group hopes to formalize a lengthier list of all the rules changes they are seeking. They are also pushing to delay next week’s internal leadership elections, though there is no indication McCarthy plans to do so.\n\n“I’m not supporting anybody until I know what the blueprint is,” Norman said.\n\nWhen asked whether McCarthy should get credit for delivering the majority, Norman responded: “The taxpayers that voted the representatives in deserve the credit.”\n\nRep. Bob Good, a member of the Freedom Caucus, told reporters that McCarthy “has not done anything to earn my vote” for speaker.\n\nThe Virginia Republican also predicted that “there will be a challenge to (McCarthy) as a speaker candidate,” a possibility that CNN first reported was under consideration by the group.\n\nSuch a challenge would be more of a protest candidate than a serious one. The group just wants to show McCarthy during next week’s internal GOP leadership elections that he doesn’t have the floor votes for speaker, in hopes of forcing him to the negotiating table.\n\nBut there is at least one member who has said there is nothing McCarthy could do to earn his vote. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida said on his podcast that not only was McCarthy not his first choice to lead, he was not “even in my top 100”.\n\n“With a slim majority, we shouldn’t be starting the C team,” Gaetz said. “We need to put our star players in a position to shine brightest so that we can attract more people to our policies and ideas.”", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Manu Raju", "Melanie Zanona", "Manu Raju"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/01/26/politics-live-updates-senators-sworn-impeachment-trial/4254926001/", "title": "Politics live updates: Sen.

It's not hyperbole,\" Biden said during remarks on the COVID-19 pandemic at the White House.\n\nBiden outlined the new purchase plans, along with an increase in the weekly vaccine allocation to states, tribes and territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses over the next three weeks.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is also planning to provide states, tribes and territories with allocation estimates for the upcoming three weeks instead of the one week look-ahead they previously received, Biden said.\n\n\"This is going to help make sure governors, mayors and local leaders have greater certainty around supply, so they can carry out their plans to vaccinate as many people as possible,\" he said.\n\nThe 1.4 million federal boost will primarily be supplied by Moderna's vaccine, one of two authorized for emergency use in the United States. Pfizer, which makes the second authorized vaccine, announced earlier Tuesday it was ahead of schedule on fulfilling the 200 million doses the U.S. purchased last year.\n\nEach of the vaccines require two doses. A second shot should be administered about three or four weeks after the first, depending on the vaccinegiven.\n\nThe announcement comes after several states have reported vaccine and supply shortages while tens of thousands of people who managed to get appointments for a first dose have complained of cancellations.\n\nThe president again warned that coronavirus cases would continue to climb, noting the death toll could top 500,000 by the end of next month, but remained confident in his administration's COVID-19 plan.\n\n\"I hope you're all asking me by the end of the summer that you have too much vaccine left over, you have too much equipment left over,\" he said.\n\nFollowing a joint phone call with the nation's governors and senior Biden administration officials, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said the limited vaccine supply was \"only a tiny fraction of what our citizens desperately need.\"\n\n“We appreciate the administration stating that it will provide states with slightly higher allocations for the next few weeks, but we are going to need much more supply,\" he said in a statement.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nSenate upholds constitutionality of Trump impeachment trial\n\nThe Senate voted Tuesday to uphold the constitutionality of the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, but the vote suggested a lack of support for convicting him on the charge of inciting insurrection.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., forced the vote with a point of order arguing that Trump couldn’t be tried as a private citizen – and if he were tried, that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts should preside.\n\nInstead, the longest-serving member of the Democratic majority, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, will preside. The Constitution calls for the chief justice to preside only over a trial of a sitting president.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Paul's argument \"has been completely debunked by constitutional scholars from all across the political spectrum.\"\n\n“The theory that the impeachment of a former official is unconstitutional is flat-out wrong by every frame of analysis,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe Senate voted 55-45 to reject Paul’s motion. The vote revealed more than one-third of the chamber opposing the trial. A two-thirds majority is required to convict Trump.\n\nThe vote signaled that more than one-third of the Senate – and the vast majority of Republicans – found the trial unconstitutional. \"We're excited about it,\" Paul said after the vote. \"It was one of the few times in Washington where a loss is actually a victory.\"\n\nMark Meadows, who was Trump’s White House chief of staff, said the vote showed the case is “dead on arrival.”\n\n“If today’s Senate vote is any sign, the Democrats’ ridiculous impeachment of former President Trump will fail – again – by a long shot,” Meadows said in a tweet. “Dead on arrival.”\n\nPaul had argued that the trial is a “kangaroo court” that will stoke partisan division. But the Senate has tried a former Cabinet official and former judges after leaving office.\n\nImpeachment is typically used to remove someone from office, but the sentence upon conviction could also bar an official from holding future office.\n\nRepublican Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania joined Democrats in killing Paul's motion.\n\nCollins said the vote indicated Trump would likely be acquitted.\n\n\"I do the math, but I think that it's extraordinarily unlikely the president will be convicted,\" she said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nSenators take oath in impeachment trial of former President Trump\n\nSenators took their oaths Tuesday as jurors in the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, setting the stage for oral arguments to begin Feb. 9.\n\nThe ceremonial start to the trial also formally installed Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the longest-serving member of the Democratic majority, as the presiding officer. Some Republicans argued that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts should preside, but the Constitution calls for the chief justice only in trials of a sitting president.\n\nThe longest-serving Republican in the chamber, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, administered the oath to the longest-serving member of the Democratic majority, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont.\n\nLeahy then administered the oath to the 99 other senators, to serve as jurors in the trial.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., raised a point of order challenging the constitutionality of trying a president who is already out of office. He didn’t expect to win the vote, but to demonstrate that the necessary two-thirds of the Senate wouldn’t vote to convict Trump.\n\nSenators were sworn in after House prosecutors, who are called managers, carried over Monday the article of impeachment that charges Trump with inciting the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nA clerk handed each senator a different pen as a health precaution during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., signed with a quill pen.\n\nThe trial will pause while sides in the trial prepare written arguments about the case. Senators will resume debating confirmation of President Joe Biden’s Cabinet nominees and legislation to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHouse managers now have until Feb. 2 to provide the Senate with written arguments in the case. Trump’s defense team will have until Feb. 8 to file written arguments. Then oral arguments begin the next day.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden and Putin talk arms control, election meddling and Navalny’s poisoning\n\nPresident Joe Biden had his first phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin since being sworn into office last week – a conversation that came amid heightened US-Russia tensions.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden called Putin on Tuesday to discuss renewing an expiring US-Russia nuclear arms control agreement and to press the Russian leader on a batch of more nettlesome issues.\n\nBiden used the call to “reaffirm our strong support for Ukraine sovereignty in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression,” she said, and to raise questions about Russia’s alleged role in the massive SolarWinds cyberattack, the country’s meddling in US elections, and reports that it offered bounties to militant extremists in Afghanistan to kill American soldiers.\n\n“His intention was also to make clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of our national interests in response to malign actions by Russia,” Psaki said.\n\nShe said the president also pressed Putin on allegations that the Kremlin tried to poison Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader, and then engaged in a widespread crackdown against protesters who demanded Navalny’s release from prison in demonstrations over the weekend.\n\nPutin’s spokesman has denied playing a role in Navalny’s poisoning.\n\nEven though Tuesday’s call focused on several flashpoints between the two countries, a readout from the White House suggested the U.S. and Russia would be able to work together on renewing the New START treaty for five years. That arms control agreement expires next week, so it’s an urgent issue, but Putin and Biden have both expressed support for a long-term extension.\n\n“They also agreed to explore strategic stability discussions on a range of arms control and emerging security issues,” the White House said in its readout of the conversation.\n\nWhile this is Biden’s first call as U.S. president with Putin, the two men have a long history of engagement – much of it frosty.\n\nIn 2011, for example, Biden was in Russia for a meeting with Putin when Biden made a startling remark about Putin’s character.\n\n“Mr. Prime Minister, I’m looking into your eyes, and I don’t think you have a soul,” Biden recalled in an interview with Evan Osnos, whose biography of Biden was published in October. “And he looked back at me, and he smiled, and he said, ‘We understand one another.’ ”\n\nThe comment was a play on former President George W. Bush’s warmer assessment of Putin in 2001, when Bush called the Russian strongman “very straightforward and trustworthy.”\n\nPutin was among the last major world leaders to recognize Biden's win in the 2020 election. He had a seemingly cozy relationship with President Donald Trump, who often downplayed Russia's malign actions.\n\n— Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nSenate confirms Antony Blinken as Biden's secretary of State\n\nThe Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Antony Blinken to be the nation’s 71st secretary of State on Tuesday, as lawmakers scrambled to approve President Joe Biden's Cabinet nominees before impeachment proceedings begin.\n\nIn a strong show of bipartisan support, the final Senate tally was 78 to 22 and included \"yes\" votes from several top Republicans.\n\nBlinken will become America’s top diplomat as the world confronts a confluence of threats: the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and a great-power competition that increasingly pits the U.S. against China on trade, technology and other issues.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n— Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nBiden to sign more orders addressing racial equality issues\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday will take steps to address what the administration calls systemic racism in housing and criminal justice, including ending the federal government's use of private prisons.\n\nBiden will sign four new executive orders, building on steps taken in his first week as part of his campaign promise to create a more equitable society.\n\nBiden will also lay out his agenda to address racial inequity, which a senior Biden administration official said will be substantially an economic agenda,\n\nThe official also stressed that the actions aimed at creating a more equitable society are not aimed solely at communities of color and stressed that helping the disadvantaged will help the entire society.\n\nThe executive actions Biden will sign include:\n\nDirecting the Housing Department to address racially discriminatory federal housing policies.\n\nNot renewing the Justice Department's contracts with private prisons.\n\nRecommitting federal respect for tribal sovereignty\n\nDirecting federal agencies to mitigate xenophobia and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\nOn Biden's first day in office, he signed an order launching a government-wide initiative directing every federal agency to review its state of racial equity and deliver an action plan within 200 days to address any disparities in policies and programs.\n\nThe administration said Biden's \"comprehensive mandate\" to embed racial equity throughout everything being done is unprecedented.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nGOP senator to force vote over constitutionality of Trump impeachment\n\nSen. Rand Paul plans to force a vote Tuesday challenging the constitutionality of the impeachment trial for former President Donald Trump – a move he doesn’t expect to win, but one to demonstrate the unlikelihood of conviction.\n\nPaul, R-Ky., called the trial “a sham impeachment” if the chief justice doesn’t preside. “It’s just a partisan farce,” he told reporters.\n\nThe Senate is scheduled to be sworn in at 2:30 p.m. to serve as jurors in the trial, after the House delivered a charge that Trump incited insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nPaul plans to raise a point of order during that ceremonial start to the trial to challenge its constitutionality. He doesn’t expect to win in a chamber controlled by Democrats. But because a two-thirds majority is required for conviction in the 100-member Senate, Paul said if the vote could demonstrate that Trump won’t be convicted.\n\n“I think it'll be enough to show that, you know, more than a third of the Senate thinks that the whole proceeding is unconstitutional, which will show that ultimately they don't have the votes to do an impeachment,” Paul said.\n\nPaul and some other Republicans contend the trial is unconstitutional because Trump left office Jan. 20. A Cabinet member and judges have been tried after leaving office, but never a president.\n\n“The Constitution says you can only impeach the president, and it says if you impeach the president, the chief justice shall preside,” Paul said.\n\nThe result of prosecuting a former president is that Chief Justice John Roberts won’t be presiding, as he did at Trump’s first impeachment trial. The Constitution calls for the chief justice to preside at the trial of a sitting president, but is silent on who presides for a former president.\n\nInstead, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the longest-serving member of the Democratic majority, will preside, as happens in the impeachment of judges or executive branch officials. Leahy has insisted he will be impartial in overseeing the proceedings.\n\nPaul called the trial a “kangaroo court” that would further divide the country. He argued both that Trump can’t be tried as a private citizen and that if he were tried, the chief justice should preside.\n\n“Democrats brazenly appointing a pro-impeachment Democrat to preside over the trial is not fair or impartial,” Paul said on the Senate floor. “Hyper-partisan Democrats are about to drag our great country down into the gutter of rancor and vitriol, the likes of which has never been seen in our nation’s history.”\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called Trump’s rhetoric at a rally near the White House on Jan. 6, before a violent mob stormed the Capitol, “inflammatory” and “irresponsible.” But Hawley called the trial unconstitutional for pursuing a former president without the chief justice presiding.\n\n“I think it's clearly unconstitutional,” Hawley said. “To me, this is an incredibly abusive process.”\n\nAt least one Republican senator said he wouldn't support Paul's motion. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the only Republican to vote for Trump's conviction in the first impeachment trial, said most opinion supports the constitutionality of trying a former president.\n\n\"The preponderance of opinion with regards to the constitutionality of a trial of impeachment of a former president is saying that it is a constitutional process,\" Romney said.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said the trial was constitutional.\n\n“My review of it has led me to conclude that it is constitutional in recognizing that impeachment is not solely about removing a president, it is also a matter of political consequence,” Murkowski said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nSenate panel approves Mayorkas for DHS, paving way to full Senate vote\n\nA Senate panel recommended confirmation Tuesday of Alejandro Mayorkas to become secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, where he would be the first immigrant and the first Latino to lead the department.\n\nThe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted 7-4 to recommend his confirmation by the whole Senate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had asked for the Senate to confirm Mayorkas and three other top posts quickly. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was confirmed last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was confirmed Monday, and Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken has a confirmation vote scheduled Tuesday.\n\nMayorkas has faced the most contentious confirmation hearing of Biden’s Cabinet so far. Republicans posed pointed questions about Biden’s proposals to create a path to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants and to suspend construction of the wall along the southern border with Mexico.\n\nRepublicans also questioned him about an inspector general’s report that found an appearance of favoritism in how he handled visas associated with business investments during a previous stint with the Democrat. But Mayorkas said he was trying to fix problems in a complicated bureaucracy, and Democrats called the report an attempt to smear him.\n\nThe top Republican on the committee, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said Tuesday he would not support Mayorkas’ nomination, citing “serious issues” in his background like the inspector general report, but Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who also serves on the panel, said Mayorkas had acknowledged his previous errors and supported his nomination heading to a full Senate vote.\n\nMayorkas has previously been deputy secretary of the department and headed its citizenship agency. He arrived with his parents from Cuba as refugees from Fidel Castro's regime in 1960.\n\n— Bart Jansen and Nicholas Wu\n\nBiden to outline racial equity agenda\n\nAfter focusing his first few days on the coronavirus pandemic, President Joe Biden is turning the spotlight on another top priority: racial inequality.\n\nBiden plans to outline on Tuesday has agenda for fighting racial inequality, one of the four “converging crises” he has said is facing the nation.\n\n“The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer,” Biden said in his inauguration speech.\n\nOfficials have said that addressing inequality will be a focus across all issues. For example, Biden has emphasized the need to help minority communities hit harder by the health and economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut the administration is also putting a standalone emphasis on the initiative.\n\nSusan Rice, the head of Biden’s Domestic Policy Council, is expected to talk about the efforts at Tuesday’s White House press briefing.\n\nOn Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the administration is speeding up a move stalled under President Donald Trump to put abolitionist hero Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.\n\nPsaki said it’s important the nation’s currency “reflect the history and diversity of our country.”\n\nAlso on Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris administered the oath of office to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.\n\n“The first Secretary of Defense in history to be sworn in by an African American @VP…is an African American Secretary of Defense,” tweeted Ron Klain, Biden’s chief of staff.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nMore:Amid calls for unity, President Biden and Republicans don't agree what that looks like\n\nSenate to take oath for second Trump impeachment trial\n\nSenators on Tuesday will be sworn in as jurors in the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, who is charged with inciting the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6 that left five dead.\n\nThe formal oath-taking comes after House prosecutors walked the article of impeachment Monday across the Capitol, which some have called the scene of the crime.\n\nTrump has said his rally speech near the White House questioning the results of the 2020 election was “appropriate.” But Democrats contend he exhorted a violent mob to lay siege to the Capitol, which interrupted the House and Senate while counting Electoral College votes.\n\nHouse prosecutors, who are called managers, will present their written arguments to the Senate by Feb. 2.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean he’ll be removed from office.\n\nImpeachment, embedded in the constitution, is a lengthy, complicated process.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, under pressure from some Democrats to start impeachment proceedings, announced Tuesday the opening of an impeachment inquiry against Trump amid revelations he urged Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden.\n\nPelosi understands the challenges Democrats face in proceeding with impeachment proceedings and has spent months trying to swat away such talk whenever it comes up.\n\nBut the revelations about Trump's phone call about Biden apparently were the tipping point, with several Democrats who had been on the fence now in favor of opening an impeachment inquiry.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHere are a few things to know about the impeachment process and how it works:\n\nWhat is impeachment?\n\nAmericans often equate impeachment with the removal of a president or other federal officials from office for committing a crime.\n\nBut that’s incorrect.\n\nImpeachment is nothing more than the approval of formal charges against a president, vice president or other federal officeholder who stands accused of committing a crime. It’s like an indictment in a criminal proceeding.\n\nOnce an officeholder is impeached by the House of Representatives, a trial is held by the Senate to determine whether the accused is guilty of the charges. If a guilty verdict is returned, only then can the accused be removed from office.\n\nWhy is Trump under fire?\n\nTrump’s admission that he urged Ukraine to investigate Biden has set off new calls for the president's impeachment.\n\nThe controversy over Ukraine began with reports that a whistleblower in the intelligence community called attention to conversations between Trump and a foreign leader. Trump acknowledged calling Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, on July 25 to urge him to fight corruption and investigate Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of an energy company.\n\nTrump also withheld military aid for Ukraine, although he insisted he didn't use the money as leverage to demand an investigation by Kiev into Biden. Democrats, however, argued the demand to investigate Biden sound like extortion.\n\nFacing increasing pressure, Trump said Tuesday he has authorized the release of a transcript of the call.\n\nTrump delays aid:Says he didn't do it to force a Biden investigation\n\nSome Democrats have been pushing for months for Pelosi to open an impeachment inquiry, even before the latest controversy involving Ukraine.\n\nImpeachment chatter started earlier this year as special counsel Robert Mueller was investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether anyone in Trump’s campaign conspired with Moscow.\n\nMueller’s long-awaited report, released in April, detailed multiple contacts between Russian operatives and Trump associates during the campaign, but investigators didn’t find any evidence of a criminal conspiracy.\n\nThe report did document a series of actions by Trump to derail the special counsel's investigation and cites 10 instances of possible obstruction by the president. Mueller’s office did not conclude Trump's actions were illegal but also pointedly refused to clear him of wrongdoing.\n\nSome House Democrats, however, seized on what they called the \"damning details\" against Trump and argued his actions were illegal and should be the basis to begin impeachment proceedings. Pelosi resisted, and the impeachment talk died down until the latest revelations came to light.\n\nTipping point?:House Democrats debate impeachment over Ukraine allegations\n\nWho files impeachment charges?\n\nThe U.S. Constitution gives the House the sole power to impeach a federal official. Individual House members can introduce impeachment resolutions like ordinary bills, or the House could initiate impeachment proceedings by passing a resolution authorizing an inquiry.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over impeachment proceedings, decides whether to pursue articles of impeachment against the accused official and can hold hearings to review the accusations. If the committee votes to approve articles of impeachment, the formal charges move to the full House for consideration.\n\nThe House votes on each of the articles of impeachment separately and can approve them with a simple majority of those voting. If all 435 House members vote, then 218 votes would be needed.\n\nIf the articles are adopted, the accused has formally been impeached.\n\nIf the House were to initiate impeachment proceedings, it’s certainly possible they would have the votes to approve impeachment articles against Trump. Democrats hold a 235-198 majority in the House, giving them far more than the 218 votes needed to impeach.\n\nIn the Senate, however, Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage over Democrats. To remove Trump from office, Democrats would have to persuade at least 20 Republicans to vote for his conviction. That won’t happen unless something extraordinary happens to cause his support to dwindle among GOP senators.\n\nMore:What's going on with Trump and Ukraine and a whistleblower complaint?\n\nWhat happens after an impeachment?\n\nOnce an officeholder has been impeached, the proceedings shift to the Senate, which holds a trial and decides whether to convict the accused and remove him or her from office.\n\nThe House appoints members to manage the trial and act as prosecutors in the Senate. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides. At the end of the trial, which can last for weeks or even months, the Senate votes whether to convict the accused on each of the charges.\n\nA two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, is needed to convict and remove the accused from office.\n\nBiden weighs in:Former VP to call for impeachment if Trump doesn't comply with Congressional inquiries\n\nWhat's an impeachable offense?\n\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution says the president, vice president and other federal officials can be removed from office upon conviction for treason, bribery and “other high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nBut what are “high crimes and misdemeanors?”\n\n“This is one of the most famously contested phrases in all of constitutional law,” said Joshua Matz, one of the authors of the book “To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment.”\n\n“Simply put,” Matz said in an interview with USA TODAY, “impeachable offenses involve an abuse of power, a betrayal of the nation or a corruption of the office for private benefit that poses a substantial and ongoing risk of harm to the ongoing constitutional order if the president is allowed to remain in office.”\n\nUnder that standard, a president can’t be impeached simply over policy disagreements, partisan differences, negligence or recklessness, or for making poor personnel decisions.\n\n“The president has to have done something bad, very bad,” Matz said.\n\nTrump's personal lawyer:'I can't tell you if it's 100%' false Trump offered Ukraine aid for Biden investigation\n\nWho has been impeached?\n\nThe House has initiated impeachment proceedings more than 60 times, but less than a third have led to full impeachments, according to the House’s History, Art and Archives website.\n\nJust eight of those impeached – all federal judges – have been convicted and removed from office by the Senate. Officeholders impeached but not removed include a cabinet secretary (Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876), a U.S. senator (William Blount of North Carolina in 1797) and two presidents.\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 after a political conflict with Congress involving his Reconstruction policies after the Civil War and his removal of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Thirty-five senators voted to find him guilty of the charges – a single vote short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction and removal from office.\n\nMore than a century later, President Bill Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice in the wake of his extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Senate failed to muster the two-thirds majority for a conviction on either of the charges, and Clinton went on to serve the remainder of his second term in office.\n\nLooking back on Clinton:Lesson to learn from his impeachment, 20 years later\n\nPresident Richard Nixon was on the verge of impeachment in 1974 over his role in the Watergate scandal. The House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against him alleging obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress. But Nixon resigned from office before the charges were taken up by the full House.\n\nCan impeachment be appealed?\n\nWhen impeachment talk was swirling around Trump following the release of the Mueller report, Trump suggested he’d ask the Supreme Court to intervene if Democrats tried to impeach him.\n\nMatz said the comment shows Trump has “a fundamental misunderstanding” of the Constitution and how the impeachment process works.\n\nWhile the chief justice presides over an impeachment trial in the Senate, the framers of the Constitution explicitly refused to give the other justices a role in the process, he said, in part because they feared a president would pack the courts with justices who share his world view and \"they didn’t want a president to choose his own judge in an impeachment.\"\n\nNearly three decades ago, a federal judge from Mississippi asked the courts to overturn his perjury conviction and removal from office. But in a 1993 decision written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court held that the courts may not review such cases because the Constitution makes it clear the House has the sole power of impeachment and the Senate has the sole power to try impeachment articles.\n\n\"That phrase – 'sole power' – at the very least indicates an overwhelming presumption against any Supreme Court involvement in the substance of an impeachment proceeding,\" Matz said.\n\nIn other words, \"President Trump’s apparent belief that the justices he appointed to the Supreme Court will save him from impeachment is gravely misguided,\" he said.\n\nContributing: David Jackson, John Fritze", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/09/can-members-congress-impeached-trump-wants-pelosi-schiff-out/3912234002/", "title": "Can members of congress be impeached?

A president, vice president, or \"civil officer\" can be impeached.\n\nThe House of Representatives holds the authority to vote on and submit articles of impeachment to the Senate, which then has the power to preside over an impeachment trial and ultimately vote on removal from office.\n\nImpeachment is a step that can be taken against an official appointed by the president, including members of the president's Cabinet and judges.\n\nMore:How does a Supreme Court justice get impeached?\n\nHouse Democrats are leading the impeachment probe into the president to uncover more details about his dealings with Ukraine, and whether he withheld financial aid to the country in exchange for an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump has made the allegation without evidence that the former vice president pressed Ukraine to fire a top prosecutor who was looking into corruption in a company where his son once sat on the board.\n\nExplainer:What really happened when Biden forced out Ukraine's top prosecutor\n\nCan impeachment be used against members of Congress?\n\nTechnically, members of Congress do not go through impeachment proceedings. But they can be expelled from office and disciplined in other ways.\n\nAccording to a report by the Congressional Research Service, expulsion is a more simplified process than impeachment.\n\n\"A removal through an impeachment requires the action of both houses of Congress – impeachment in the House and trial and conviction in the Senate; while an expulsion is accomplished merely by the House or Senate acting alone concerning one of its own Members, and without the constitutional requirement of trial and conviction,\" the report states.\n\nHouse and Senate members can expel members with a two-thirds vote, as is laid out in Article I of the Constitution.\n\nA congressional recall, on the other hand, is not provided for by the Constitution. This consists of constituents voting to place an early limit on the term of their representative through a special election. Some states do provide for recalls for some other state officials, but Supreme Court decisions have opposed the right of states to impose a recall on members of Congress, according to the CRS report.\n\nAnother way to discipline a members of Congress, but that would not result in removal from office, is a censure, which is a formal reprimand of a member that requires a simple majority vote.\n\nA House Republican has also introduced a motion to censure Schiff over his exaggerated reenactment of a phone call between Trump and the Ukraine president.\n\nSo, Trump's call for the impeachment of his critics won't pan out for legal reasons, and it would also be difficult to expel them from office.\n\nHas the removal of a member of Congress ever been tried?\n\nThere is only one documented case of an attempted impeachment of a member of Congress, in 1797. Though the House of Representatives voted to impeach Sen. William Blount, the Senate rejected the move for reasons including that he was not considered a \"civil officer\" based on his role in Congress and that he had already been expelled, which made impeachment a moot point.\n\nAs for expulsion, 15 senators and five members of the House have met that fate in the history of the United States. Most were related to Civil War infractions. The United States hasn't seen an expulsion since 2002, when Ohio Rep. James Traficant was convicted on bribery, racketeering and tax evasion charges.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/09"}]}

Wednesday's storm was expected to knock down trees, cause widespread flooding, wash out roads, cause hillsides to collapse, slow airports and potentially lead to the \"loss of human life,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut officials warn even then the danger isn't over. Forecasters are watching other systems out at sea that could also hit the region with more precipitation.\n\nMeanwhile, California wasn't the only place facing severe weather on Wednesday. A possible tornado touched down near Montgomery, Alabama, early Wednesday. There were no deaths but the twister damaged more than 50 homes.\n\nFlood-related deaths confirmed in Sacramento; motorists rescued\n\nTwo more bodies were found Wednesday after flooding in a rural part of south Sacramento County, authorities said, bringing the death toll from the atmospheric river storm on New Year's Eve to three.\n\nThe third body was found in a vehicle that was submerged in water , said Sgt. Amar Gandhi, a Sacramento County Sheriff's Office spokesman.\n\nThe victim had not been identified and there was no additional information about the incident, Gandhi said Wednesday night.\n\nDuring the morning, California Highway Patrol officers found the body of a woman while recovering vehicles that got stuck due to flooding.\n\nOn Sunday, authorities discovered the body of a man inside a submerged vehicle. Gandhi said rescue efforts in Sacramento County are ongoing.\n\nElsewhere across Northern California communities, several motorists were rescued from flooded roads and fallen trees.\n\nThe San Francisco Fire Department rescued a family Wednesday night after fallen trees on a city road trapped the family.\n\nCalifornia residents face outages\n\nWith heavy rain saturating the ground and strong winds, trees are more likely to fall and can cause widespread power outages, according to Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources.\n\nOfficials and power companies warned residents to prepare for possible outages due to the storm by creating emergency kits and keeping essential devices charged.\n\nNearly 178,000 homes and businesses were in the dark Wednesday night, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages. Most outages were reported on the north coast of the state.\n\nHelping homeless people from storm\n\nAt the foot of San Francisco’s Bernal Heights neighborhood, Magaly Rowell waited for her bus under an umbrella at what passes for a bus shelter next to Precita Park. She was defying the elements not because of her job at a security company, but to feed homeless people at a nearby church, something Rowell said she does daily.\n\n“It’s not so bad if there’s no wind,” Rowell said as her umbrella got pelted by the rain and torrents of water flowed down Folsom Street. “It gets harder when the wind picks up like today. I worry about the homeless people. They’re the ones who suffer the most when the weather gets like this.”\n\nEvacuations ordered in coastal cities\n\nOfficials in Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara issued evacuation orders Wednesday as the huge storm puts the coastal areas at high risk due to potential mudslides and flooding.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were issued for those living in burn scar areas in Santa Barbara County due to potential flooding and debris flows, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown announced during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nThe Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office issued numerous evacuation orders for southern parts of the county throughout Wednesday due to concerns over potential flooding and debris flow from storm conditions.\n\nFlight disruptions amid powerful storm\n\nWith its high winds and heavy rains, the storm is already causing flight disruptions in the Bay Area with more anticipated to come as the peak approaches.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, San Francisco International Airport has experienced 74 flight cancellations, accounting for 8% of all flights.\n\nAbout 191 flights have been delayed by an average of 35 minutes, according to Doug Yakel, a public information officer for the airport. \"Delays and cancellations are a result of both the reduced ceilings and winds,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\n\"In regards to general airport operations here at OAK, our operations team is prepared,\" a spokesperson for Oakland International Airport told USA TODAY. Passengers with flights to and from Oakland are strongly encouraged to check with their airline through their mobile app or website for updates on their flights.\n\nTravel waivers for flights disrupted by California's \"bomb cyclone\":\n\nSouthwest Airlines is offering free rebooking for flights scheduled for Wednesday, for flights to and from Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose. The rebooking must have the same city pairs and travel dates within 14 days of the original travel date.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Delta Air Lines issued a travel waiver for flights scheduled on Thursday and Friday to or from San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose, and Fresno. The fare difference will be waived when the rebooked travel takes place on or before Jan. 8.\n\nResidents brace for floods\n\nIn San Francisco, customers at Papenhausen Hardware were most worried about flooding, said store co-owner Karl Aguilar.\n\n“Last week a fair amount of people were focused on the roofs – small leaks, windows, things like that,’’ Aguilar said. “There was a point where it transitioned and people became much more concerned with flooding mitigation. This particular storm, it’s all flood mitigation.’’\n\nA few doors to the east, Grace Daryanani at Bulls Head restaurant has sandbags and wet/dry vacuum cleaners at the ready. Her space has flooded in big storms before but she's hoping a new outdoor dining area might divert some of the water.\n\n“Maybe that will help,\" she said.\n\nLEARN MORE:What is a bomb cyclone?\n\nWEATHER TERMS:What is an 'atmospheric river'?\n\nWind gusts as high as 80 mph\n\nForecasters warned of flood threats and issued high wind warnings in the lead-up to the storm. The National Weather Service in the Bay Area delivered a rare admonition saying the coming \"brutal\" storm system \"needs to be taken seriously.\"\n\n\"Honestly, the biggest story right now is the winds,\" said Palmer. Coastal areas could be hit with winds in the 40 to 50 mph range, while some mountain areas could get gusts as high as 80 mph.\n\nFlooding and landslides likely\n\nBecause the ground was already saturated with the more than 5 inches of rain that fell on New Year's Eve, Wednesday's storm could cause severe problems and damage in some areas.\n\n\"The main concern is the smaller watersheds and steep slopes. So mudslides, shallow landslides and urban and small creek flooding could get quite significant for a period of time on Wednesday night in some locations,\" said Daniel Swain, a climatologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nSevere weather, possible tornadoes in South\n\nThe South, too, was being hit with intense weather Wednesday. Heavy rains, flash floods and severe weather were seen in a swath across Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina.\n\nA possible tornado touched down in east Montgomery, Alabama at 3:14 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nRodney Penn, who was home when the storm hit, said a fallen tree limb broke out the windows in his wife's car but there was no structural damage to his apartment.\n\n“It literally sounded like there were a thousand baseball bats hitting the side of the house at the same time,” Penn said.\n\nIn South Carolina, five counties were under a tornado watch Wednesday.\n\nHeavy rain in California not an end to drought in West\n\nThe extreme drought conditions California has struggled under are helping avert some possible flooding because many of the state's larger reservoirs are still quite low, said Swain.\n\n\"They have a lot of headroom right now to absorb a lot of water,\" he said.\n\nThe state finds itself in the middle of a flood emergency even as it's in the middle of a drought emergency, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"A lot of our trees are stressed after three years of intensive drought, the ground is saturated and there is a significant chance of downed trees that will create significant problems, potentially flooding problems, potentially power problems,\" she said.\n\nWhile the rains are likely to alleviate the short-term drought in Northern California along the coast, they will do little in terms of bringing drought relief to the West as a whole.\n\n\"It won't really help move the needle in the Colorado basin but it certainly will in central and northern California,\" Swain said.\n\nMore water is on the way\n\nThere are two more possible storms also out in the Pacific, one that could arrive late Friday and run into Sunday and then another possible storm that could arrive Tuesday, Canepa said.\n\nBoth could bring higher-than-normal rain levels through the middle of January.\n\nThere's a wide range of uncertainty for next week, ranging from a couple of additional moderate storms which wouldn't cause too many problems to one or possibly more atmospheric river events.\n\nWhat's an atmospheric river?\n\nThe storm, the second of three or possibly four headed toward the California coast, is coming from across the Pacific ocean. It's what's known as an atmospheric river or, to use the term more common a few years ago, a Pineapple Express because it originates over Hawaii.\n\nThese storms bring heavy rainfall and occur when a line of warm, moist air flows from near the islands across the Pacific Ocean to the West Coast.\n\nWhen it reaches the cooler air over the western landmass, the water vapor falls as heavy rain. Atmospheric rivers are long, flowing regions of the atmosphere that carry water vapor across a swath of sky 250 to 375 miles wide. They can be more than 1,000 miles long – and can carry more water than the Mississippi River.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver and Kathleen Wong, USA TODAY; Evan Mealins and Alex Gladden, Montgomery Advertiser; Hannah Workman, The Record", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/10/weather/weekend-atmospheric-river-storm-tornadoes-snow-flooding/index.html", "title": "Major storm to bring feet of snow, heavy rain and possible tornadoes ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAn atmospheric river event, bringing ample amounts of moisture to the West this weekend, will gradually move across the country and bring hazardous weather to millions.\n\nThe blockbuster storm will begin in the West with heavy snow, gusty winds, and coastal flooding, then move eastward, threatening potential blizzard conditions in the Midwest and tornadoes in the South.\n\nWinter weather alerts are in place for more than 10 million people across nearly a dozen states from California to Minnesota Sunday.\n\nSnow could top out at 1 to 2 feet in the Rockies, and 3 to 5 feet in the Sierras by the end of the weekend.

Power outages will also be possible due to very strong winds.\n\nSevere storms for the South next week\n\nThe threat for severe storms is also increasing across the southern Plains and Gulf Coast region including tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds.\n\n“While tornadoes in December are relatively uncommon when compared to the springtime, they are often more likely across portions of the Southeast and Lower Mississippi Valley, where there is often a secondary peak in the fall and winter,” Matthew Elliott, a meteorologist at the Storm Prediction Center, told CNN.\n\nCNN Weather\n\nThe severe storm potential begins Monday night across Oklahoma and northern Texas, gradually spreading into Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi on Tuesday.\n\nSevere storms will likely continue Tuesday overnight across the Gulf Coast region. Nocturnal tornadoes are more dangerous because many people are asleep and unaware they need to be seeking a safe location.\n\nWhile the greater tornado threat exists during the day, there is still the possibility for a few rotating storms through the evening hours.\n\nBy Wednesday, the greatest threat exists for an area from New Orleans to Panama City, Florida.\n\n“The details regarding the areas most at risk from tornadoes will become clearer as the event approaches and smaller-scale trends become more evident,” Elliott said.\n\nBecause the forecast can change it is important to pay attention to developments in the coming days.", "authors": ["Allison Chinchar"], "publish_date": "2022/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/03/13/monday-weather-forecast-noreaster-atmospheric-river/11460270002/", "title": "Live weather updates: California atmospheric river; nor'easter looms", "text": "Looking for the latest weather updates?

The state faces an increasing risk of floods that could submerge cities and displace millions of people across the state, according to a study released in August. Swain, the UCLA climate scientist, was a co-author of the study. It warned that a monthlong storm could bring feet of rain to hundreds of miles of California.\n\nSimilarly, unrelenting storms have happened in the past before the region became home to tens of millions of people. Now, each degree of global warming dramatically increases the odds and size of the next megaflood, the study said.\n\n'ABSOLUTE MIRACLE':4 people survive after Tesla plunges over cliff along Pacific Coast Highway\n\nTornadoes in Arkansas damage buildings, trap people in homes\n\nAt least three tornadoes were reported Monday in the South-Central U.S. The National Weather Service said it had reports of a damaging twister in Montrose, Arkansas, that trapped people in their homes. Another near Jessieville, Arkansas, damaged at least 14 homes and multiple commercial and government buildings, including a local high school, AccuWeather reported.\n\nThe storm hit with little warning, Jessieville School District Superintendent Melissa Speers told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette. It was the first day of school after the holiday break.\n\n\"Out of the blue, high winds, awnings began to blow away, the flagpole blows over,\" she said. \"Students and staff began moving to the safe room. We didn't have any prior warning.\"\n\nSoutheast struggles with flooding, more rain on the way\n\nFlash flooding was prompting water rescues and school closures in parts of Kentucky, and severe thunderstorm warnings were posted for much of the state. In Muhlenberg County, near the Tennessee border, the Greenville Fire Department said it had responded to numerous stranded motorists and provided water rescues from residences. Numerous roadways were flooded, and first responders and road crews were blocking flooded roadways. The school district was one of several across Kentucky that canceled classes.\n\nForecasters issued severe thunderstorm warnings across much of Mississippi. In Alabama, forecasters warned of severe storms and possible tornadoes Tuesday and Wednesday. The weather service said moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico surging northward over the Lower Mississippi Valley and much of the Southeast was fueling the foul weather.\n\nSnowy winter so far in Midwest\n\nAcross much of the Midwest, heavy snow, significant freezing rain and some sleet were expected Tuesday and Wednesday. Intense snow rates of 1-3 inches per hour, in some instances accompanied by thunder, were forecast for parts of Nebraska, South Dakota and Minnesota.\n\nGusty, 30 mph winds will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow throughout the day Tuesday. The precipitation will result in snow-covered roads, reduced visibility and \"difficult-to-impossible travel,\" the National Weather Service warned.\n\nThe young season's snowfall totals are already well above average across much of the nation's Plains and Upper Midwest. Minneapolis has received 32.6 inches of snow since Nov. 1, compared to the average of 18 inches, AccuWeather reports. Rapid City and Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Fargo, North Dakota, have also seen snow amounts 150%-160% of normal since Nov. 1.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/11/01/atmospheric-river-to-bring-heavy-rain-across-oregon-november-forecast/71396316007/", "title": "Atmospheric river to bring heavy rain across Oregon, November ...", "text": "The beginning of Oregon’s peak rainy season will arrive right on time this year, as the beginning of November will usher in a burst of heavy rain and wet conditions likely to hang around.\n\nAn atmospheric river of moisture is forecast to drop 1 to 2 inches of rain in the Willamette Valley, and 2 to 6 inches of rain in the mountains over the next few days, according to the National Weather Service in Portland.\n\nThose numbers could rise to an eye-popping 4 to 5 inches in the valley and 10 to 15 inches in the mountains across the next seven days, according to advanced models, forecasters said.\n\nNovember and December are Oregon’s two wettest months statistically.\n\n\"The next week is going to be very wet,\" NWS hydrologist Andy Bryant said. \"Right now we're not seeing major flooding impacts — but it's something we're going to keep an eye on.\"\n\nOregon State climatologist Larry O'Neill said that even without much of any snow associated with the system, the heavy rain would help ease the state's long term drought.\n\n\"It's really good news not only for drought reduction, but to recharge our soil moisture in the mountains before the ground freezes and the snowpack lays down,\" O'Neill said. \"It's really good for our natural water supply and not something we've seen much lately.\"\n\nHow long will rain last?\n\nIn the short term, the heaviest rain is forecast Wednesday night into Thursday morning, with another dump Friday evening into Saturday.\n\nMinor urban flooding is expected, mostly from leaves blocking storm drains and water pooling on roadways.\n\nWestern Oregon’s rivers are expected to rise, but no widespread flooding is forecast.\n\n“Our main concern is urban areas,” Bryant said. “River flooding seems unlikely because coming into this, we’ve got fairly dry soils and low river levels. We’ll also likely get some breaks between the heavy rain.”\n\nBut, even if the impacts are likely to be fairly minor, the system of wet weather appears long-lasting.\n\n“We should stay on the wet side well into next week,” Bryant said. “There’s a good possibility we won’t have any days completely dry starting Wednesday for the next seven to eight days.”\n\nEye-popping rainfall totals possible\n\nThe higher rainfall totals come from longer-term NOAA forecasts across seven days. Bryant said Oregon said totals as high as 4 to 5 in the valley and 10 to 15 in the mountains was possible, but there was a lot of uncertainty.\n\nO'Neill said such a strong atmospheric river could be a sign of a developing \"very strong\" El Nino weather pattern that's still developing in the tropics of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\"We won't know how strong this El Nino will be, and the impact on Oregon's winter, for a few weeks,\" O'Neill said. \"But the 'very strong' El Ninos do tend to produce more rain than normal.\"\n\nNot much snow likely in the mountains\n\nUnfortunately, for those hoping the rain would build up Oregon’s early-season snowpack, this system is a warm one and snow levels are expected to rocket up as high as 9,000 feet, Bryant said. That’s likely to melt much of the snow that fell on the Cascade Range passes and in the 4,000 to 6,000 foot range.\n\nThe long-term forecast models favor wet and very warm conditions, and across the rest of November, the forecast calls for warmer than normal weather and about average rainfall.\n\nZach Urness has been an outdoors reporter in Oregon for 15 years and is host of the Explore Oregon Podcast.

It then will move through Minneapolis, bringing a mix of rain, snow and ice overnight.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 16 million people in parts of California and Nevada are under flood watches Thursday morning in anticipation of a fresh set of storms along the West Coast in the next couple days. They include San Francisco, Sacramento, Fresno, Oakland and Reno.\n\nIn Colorado, the weather prompted the state to announce the safety closure along I-70 near Silverthorne around 8 p.m. ET Wednesday.\n\n“For much of the day yesterday Colorado was above freezing with some light rain, then the rain changed to snow and the roads froze almost instantly,” CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. “Drivers were caught off guard with the accumulating snow and ice.”\n\nTractor-trailers got stuck along the interstate, prompting the traffic jams, while other vehicles struggled to get traction on steep inclines, said storm chaser Aaron Rigsby, noting he was was stuck in traffic for over eight hours.\n\nA packed charter bus had to be rescued, and at one point, dozens of vehicles were turned off the road and people slept inside, Rigsby told CNN of what he saw.\n\n“After like four to six hours, you can see a drastic change in the tone of people’s voices and just kind of their demeanor,” Rigsby added. Sentiments went from, “This is kind of cool,” he said, to “How long are we gonna be stuck here,” and “Is there enough fuel?”\n\nThroughout the Denver region, vehicles slid off the icy roads and caused tractor trailers to jackknife, per the CDOT. However, none of the accidents caused by the weather involved fatalities or serious injuries, according to the Colorado State Patrol.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, CDOT had around 112 plows working, spokesperson Jared Field said, a force that would cover the Denver area and the I-70 mountain corridor.\n\nMore plows were out clearing the roads statewide, but at least one ran into trouble: A plow slid into a ditch and had to be pulled out by another plow, Field told CNN.\n\nElsewhere, the dangerous conditions Tuesday in Oregon left five people dead, including a 4-year-old girl, after severe weather caused trees to fall on passing vehicles, state police said. Wind gusts in the state exceeded 100 mph in some areas, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe forceful atmospheric river – a long, narrow region in the atmosphere that can carry moisture thousands of miles – is forecast to continue battering the Western and Central US after the initial round of moisture shifts eastward Thursday.\n\nNew rounds of rain and mountainous snow will inundate the coast into Friday before shifting to Southern California and the Southwest through the weekend.\n\nMore coastal rain and mountain snow to come\n\nAs the initial wave of moisture hovered over Colorado overnight Wednesday, the Denver and Boulder areas saw as much as 2 inches of snow per hour.\n\nMore than 9 inches of snow had fallen over Boulder and 7.1 inches were reported at Denver International Airport as of Thursday.\n\n“Heavy snow will accumulate on tree branches and powerlines, possibly causing them to break and lead to power outages. Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous conditions could impact the Thursday morning commute,” warned the National Weather Service in Boulder.\n\nMeantime, a new bout of moisture is expected to hit the West coast Thursday morning before a more forceful surge ushers in heavy rain in the evening. That storm system is forecast to remain focused on Northern California, southern Oregon and northern Nevada from Thursday evening through Saturday morning before finally shifting to Southern California and the Four Corners region through the rest of the weekend.\n\nSnowfall across much of the West over the next five days is expected to be between 1 to 7 inches in lower elevation areas and 1 to 2 feet in higher elevation areas.

Here are the latest rain totals from the National Weather Service as of 2 p.m., with rain still falling.\n\nPalm Desert 1.18 inches\n\nCathedral Canyon 1 inch\n\nThermal airport 0.91 inches\n\nPalm Springs Airport 0.89 inches\n\nLower Tahquitz Creek 0.86 inches\n\nFlash flood, severe thunderstorm warning issued for some Coachella Valley cities\n\nThe National Weather Service in San Diego has issued Flash Flood Warnings for most of the Coachella Valley until 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nSome locations that will experience flash flooding include Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, Indio, Coachella, Thermal, La Quinta, Mecca and the Santa Rosa Mountain.\n\nAt 1:51 p.m., doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated heavy rain falling across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 to 1 inch in 1 hour. Hourly rainfall rates in Palm Desert have exceeded 0.75 inches per hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\n\nAt 1:40 p.m., doppler radar indicated heavy rain across the warned area. Rainfall rates of three-quarters of an inch per hour are occurring.\n\nFlash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly. The weather service warns life threatening flash flooding is possible from heavy rain, particularly of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.\n\nMotorists should turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary: Heavier rain, winds forecast for Palm Springs area Sunday\n\nThe Coachella Valley remains under a tropical storm warning on Sunday morning, and a flood watch is in effect until 5 p.m. on Monday. Light rain is falling at Palm Springs International — as of 8 a.m., 0.32 inches had fallen since midnight — and the temperature is a cool 78 degrees with 88% humidity and 6-mph winds out of the southwest, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBut more rain, and heavier wind, is on the way. Thunderstorms are in the forecast throughout the day, with an additional two to four inches of rain expected in the valley, along with wind gusts of up to 40 to 50 mph. Temps are expected to top out at 86 degrees.\n\nNWS Meteorologist Adam Roser said the biggest threat in the Coachella Valley is \"definitely flash flooding.\"\n\n\"Many of the mountain roads going into the valley are very vulnerable,\" he said. \"As are any of those that go over those washes and things like that.'\n\nRoser said most of the rain will fall in heavy bands that could potentially produce 2 inches of rain an hour in the afternoon. There also remains a small chance of tornadoes in the valley, he said.\n\n\"WIth tropical storm systems, any tornadoes are usually weak and brief, but the storm prediction center does have around a 5% chance of a tornado occurring in the area,\" he said.\n\nThe rain and wind will likely be finished by the time most people are waking up on Monday morning, Roser said.\n\n— Kate Franco, Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nHow much rain has fallen so far?\n\nSo far, Tropical Storm Hilary has brought a light but steady rainfall to the Coachella Valley, but weather forecasts advise the rain should become heavier on Sunday afternoon and evening.\n\nAs of noon, official National Weather Service rain totals included 0.40 at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.46 in Thermal at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport, 0.46 in Thousand Palms and 0.36 in Palm Desert.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHilary makes landfall over Baja California\n\nThe now-downgraded Tropical Storm Hilary made landfall along Mexico's Baja California coast Sunday as concerns mounted over the storm causing what could be deadly flash flooding in the border city of Tijuana, Southern California and places as far north as Idaho that rarely get such heavy rain.\n\nHilary hit the coast in a sparsely populated area about 150 miles south of Ensenada.\n\nThe storm has already caused flooding in places across Mexico’s arid peninsula and threatens to unleash torrential rains on mudslide-prone Tijuana, where many improvised houses cling to steep hillsides just south of the U.S. border.\n\nForecasters warned the storm could cause extreme flooding, mudslides and even tornadoes. Parts of the U.S. Southwest could be hit with once-in-a-century rains and there is a good chance Hilary could break all-time records as the wettest known tropical cyclone to douse Nevada, Oregon and Idaho.\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Pacific time, Hilary was located about 215 miles south-southeast of San Diego, the National Hurricane Center reported. Hilary had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and was moving northwest at 25 mph.\n\nThe Mexican cities of Ensenada and Tijuana, directly in the storm’s path, closed all beaches and opened a half-dozen shelters at sports complexes and government offices.\n\n—The Associated Press\n\nEvacuation order near Banning\n\nRiverside County has issued an evacuation order north of Banning and near the Morongo Reservation as the worst of Tropical Storm Hilary's impacts approach.\n\nThe county's emergency management department announced the order late Sunday morning for the Mias zone in the Apple/ElDorado burn scar.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSplash House says it will carry on amid storm\n\nOrganizers of Splash House said the Palm Springs pool party and music festival will go on Sunday despite Tropical Storm Hilary's expected inundation of the Coachella Valley and the rest of Southern California.\n\nEarlier in the weekend, the festival had been moved inside at the three hotels where it's held, which are miles apart.\n\n\"We're gonna keep it real with you — we're not big fans of today's projected weather,\" organizers wrote in an Instagram post about 10 a.m. Sunday. \"But we are big fans of keeping this party going safely. Let's take things inside and close out this weekend in unprecedented style!\"\n\nEvents will be at the Renaissance, Margaritaville Resort and Saguaro Palm Springs hotels between about 1 p.m. and 9 p.m., according to an online schedule.\n\n\"Shuttles with run as planned between hotels,\" the Instagram post said, without addressing the possible heavy rain — predicted to be as much as two inches an hour at times Sunday afternoon.\n\nLocal and national officials, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have advised people to stay indoors and off the roads during the storm.\n\nLater, organizers seemingly acknowledged the storm could make it hard for festival attendees from out of town to drive or fly out as scheduled. They posted a list of hotels that were offering late checkout and discounted rates for extending stays.\n\n—Eric Hartley\n\nMost flights canceled out of Palm Springs on Sunday\n\nAhead of the anticipated impacts from now Tropical Storm Hilary, a majority of airlines have canceled flights in and out of Palm Springs International Airport on Sunday.\n\nAs of 9 a.m., only five of 15 flight arrivals through 6 p.m were still scheduled. United, American and WestJet all canceled flights into the airport. Southwest Airlines canceled its entire Sunday schedule at the airport a day earlier.\n\nDelta’s flight from Salt Lake City to Palm Springs that arrives at 12:18 p.m. Sunday was one of the few still scheduled.\n\nEight of 10 evening flight arrivals into Palm Springs were still scheduled, as were several evening departures, but airport officials cautioned anyone flying to check ahead with their airline before arriving at the airport.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary within striking distance of Baja early Sunday\n\nThe National Weather Center in Miami said in the most recent advisory at 2 a.m. that Hurricane Hilary was about 30 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 385 miles from San Diego, California. The maximum sustained wind speed remained unchanged at 85 mph while spreading “heavy rains” northward over the peninsula.\n\nMeteorologists warned that despite weakening, the storm remained treacherous. Forecasters said the storm was still expected to enter the history books as the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, bringing flash floods, mudslides, isolated tornadoes, high winds and power outages.\n\nElizabeth Adams, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service San Diego office, said rain could fall up to 3 inches an hour across the desert and mountains surrounding the Coachella Valley and beyond from late Sunday morning into the afternoon. The intense rainfall during those hours could cause widespread and life-threatening flash floods.\n\nOne person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalia, on the peninsula’s eastern coast, when a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream. Rescue workers managed to save four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege township.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether officials considered the fatality related to the hurricane, but video posted by local officials showed torrents of water coursing through the town’s streets.\n\nThe forecast prompted authorities to issue an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, urging residents and beachgoers to leave the tourist destination 23 miles off the coast.\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nHurricane Hilary: Storm drops 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Sunday\n\nAs of 7 a.m. Sunday, rainfall totals since midnight were 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.41 inches at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in Thermal and 0.29 inches in Thousand Palms, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nRain totals so far Sunday in Palm Springs area\n\nPreliminary precipitation data from the National Weather Service's San Diego station shows 24-hour rain totals as of 5 a.m. Sunday in the Coachella Valley vary from 0.86 inches in Thermal to 0.04 inches in Indio Hills. Palm Springs International Airport reported 0.18 inches of rain so far.\n\nThermal: 0.86 inches\n\nMorongo Valley: 0.39 inches\n\nDesert Hot Springs: 0.31 inches\n\nPalm Springs International Airport: 0.18 inches\n\nPalm Desert: 0.16 inches\n\nIndio Hills: 0.04 inches\n\n— Kate Franco\n\nRoad closures in Palm Springs, Cathedral City\n\nPalm Springs: Indian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino will be closed at the washes until further notice in preparation of potential flooding due to Hurricane Hilary, the Palm Springs Police Department announced late Saturday.\n\nCathedral City: Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive has been closed, city officials said Saturday.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declares State of Emergency\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California Saturday to support the Hurricane Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nHeavy rainfall and high winds were expected to last through Monday. At the governor's direction, there were currently more than 7,500 boots on the ground deployed to help local communities protect Californians from the impacts of Hilary.\n\nThe governor also signed an emergency proclamation in San Diego while visiting with California National Guard troops. He met with first responders and local officials, including San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. He was also in touch with federal officials, including the White House.\n\nThe Emergency Medical Services Authority has assets on standby, including California Medical Assistance Teams to augment local capacity, aid in evacuations and support medical needs in communities impacted by flooding. The EMSA was ready to assist with Ambulance Strike Teams as necessary to support local communities. The Flood Operations Center is activated and has prepositioned flood-fight materials should they be needed.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSandbag availability low, exhausted in some valley cities\n\nSand and sandbags are no longer available at local fire stations in Palm Desert as of Saturday afternoon. Instead, residents can find these resources at the Palm Desert Civic Center, 43-900 San Pablo Ave., Palm Desert.\n\nRancho Mirage ran out of sand at its distribution site at the Rancho Mirage Library & Observatory parking lot, so many people took their empty bags to a nearby empty lot to fill them with sand straight from the ground. Empty sandbags are still available for Rancho Mirage residents at Fire Station 69 at 71-751 Gerald Ford Drive. Proof of Rancho Mirage address is required.\n\nIndian Wells announced mid-afternoon on Saturday that sandbags are no longer available from that city, and residents are encouraged to seek supplies from local home improvement stores, instead.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nHurricane Hilary: How experts say you should prepare\n\nTwo Palm Springs emergency officials have some advice for valley residents on how they can prepare their homes and themselves for the storm. The officials are Capt. Nathan Gunkel of the city fire department and Daniel DeSelms, Palm Springs’ emergency management coordinator.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nThey said residents should make sure they have enough food and water to make it through a few days, including food that can be eaten if the power goes out.\n\nThey also recommended preparing for the power outages by charging their cellphones and making sure they have flashlights and batteries on hand. DeSelms said he generally recommends using flashlights rather than candles because of the fire risks that come with candles.\n\nIn general, they said residents should be prepared to remain at home for multiple days as it will likely be unsafe to go out during the storm and roads could potentially remained closed or impassable even after it passes.\n\nGunkel recommended that residents make sure they know how to get out of their neighborhoods in the event the city does need to evacuate, keeping in mind that roads like Indian Canyon Drive and Gene Autry Road will likely be impassable. However, he said people should remember it is impossible to anticipate which other roads may be closed.\n\nTo protect your home:\n\nBoth DeSelms and Gunkel recommend residents make use of the free sandbags Palm Springs and other cities and agencies are providing, particularly if their homes have ever experienced flooding in the past. It often makes sense to place sand bags in front of the front door or other places where water might pool, Gunkel said.\n\nDeSelms also said those with leaky roofs can put a tarp over them. However, he cautioned that it is important to try to make sure the tarp will be secured enough to withstand the strong expected winds.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}]}

And even looked up a little bit to try and get the lay of the land … I’m saying, ‘How did all that happen in just those few seconds?’ It didn’t make any sense. Like, I just don’t understand it.”\n\nHarris died just days before the 50th anniversary of the catch, and the Steelers had planned to retire his No. 32 jersey during halftime of their game against the Raiders on Saturday.\n\nThe NFL Network in 2019 named the Immaculate Reception the top play in the 100 years of the league.\n\nThe play was not without controversy: There were no convincing replays to determine who deflected the ball when two opposing players collided and whether the ball actually hit the ground when Harris caught it.\n\nIn the interview, Russo said some believe that the nose of the football hit the turf, “But you’re saying that’s not the case, correct?”\n\n“I have no idea, I have no idea,” Harris said. “I remember nothing. That’s what baffles me…”\n\nRusso noted Harris was “a long way away from where the ball ricocheted.” If another Steeler had touched the ball, Harris’ catch would not have been legal.\n\n“I have no recollection of seeing the ball at all,” Harris said. “I have no visual of the ball. I have no recollection. But look at … how fast it came back.”\n\nHarry Cabluck/AP\n\n‘You don’t practice stuff like this’\n\nLooking at the film, Harris says, “I’m thinking that it could only have been” Raiders defender Jack Tatum “that the ball bounced off of” before Harris made the shoestring catch. Tatum had collided with Steelers fullback Frenchy Fuqua.\n\nIn explaining how he made the play, Harris noted that he “always had great reflexes but you don’t practice stuff like this. … So it kind of blows my mind.”\n\nThe Steelers won the game 13-7 for the team’s first-ever playoff victory but lost their next game. Still, the team went on to dominate the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls.\n\nRusso, the host, opened the interview by asking, “How are you today, OK pal?” It was likely the last interview Harris did before his death was announced on Wednesday. His cause of death was not provided.\n\n“Doing great. Fantastic,” Harris said, though he was coughing here and there. “And, like as you said, 50 years ago, and, and it still feels brand new.”\n\nHarris then went on to talk about the game-winning drive, how it started off poorly and left the Steelers in a desperate spot.\n\n“So, things didn’t go too well on those first three plays, as you know. And then it gets down to fourth down. A long way to go. 22 seconds.\n\nAnd I go into the huddle and I tell myself, ‘Franco, this will probably be the last play of the season. It was a good season. Just play it till the end.’\n\nAnd (the coach) called that 66 halfback option.”\n\nHarris’ assignment was to stay in and block.\n\nHe recalled that “there wasn’t much … adrenaline” in the huddle.\n\nWe were winning the whole game and right at the end (the Raiders) scored. It seemed more of a letdown than anything.”\n\nHarris joined the Seattle Seahawks in 1984. Barry Sweet/AP\n\nRusso noted that Harris “did block well” on the play and noticed that quarterback Terry Bradshaw was scrambling under pressure from the defense.\n\n“My thought was to release to be an outlet pass,” Harris said. “And Bradshaw, being as, you know, big and as strong as he is, you know, guys trying to bring him down, he’s able to fight them off and get the ball into the air.”\n\nHarris said when the ball was in the air, “I tell myself, right, I tell myself ‘Go to the ball, go to the ball.’”\n\nHarris said that was his instinct because that was what he was taught as a running back in college, under Joe Paterno at Penn State University.\n\n“That’s what Joe preached to us all four years at Penn State. You know, always go to the ball … And so I start taking some steps to the ball and I remember nothing after that… which blows my mind, that I have no visual, no recollection of anything until I am stiff arming (Raiders defender) Jimmy Warren, going into the end zone.”\n\nSome old-time Raiders still salty\n\nHarris noted how important it was that he didn’t dive for the ball. In those days when a player hits the ground while possessing the ball, he was officially down and could not advance it.\n\n“How lucky am I that I was conscious that, you know, catch it that low without diving for it,” Harris said.\n\nHarris said that after the players collided and the ball deflected into the air, some of the Raiders started to clap and celebrate.\n\n“And the Raiders stop, just for a few seconds, and that few seconds that they stopped gave me the head start to get into the end zone.”\n\nAll these years later, when some old-time Raiders still assert that the catch wasn’t a legal catch, Harris says he pays it no mind.\n\n“As a matter of fact,” Harris said, “I feel good that they’re still sulking about that.”", "authors": ["David J.

It’s also not the final word in the scandal that consumed the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\n\nIt is considered very likely that WADA will appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which would then make a final decision on Valieva’s punishment and eligibility to compete.\n\nWADA said it will wait to announce its plans until after it sees a copy of the RUSADA decision.\n\n“However, based on the elements of the case with which WADA is already familiar, the agency is concerned by the finding of ‘no fault or negligence’ and will not hesitate to exercise its right of appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, as appropriate,” WADA said in a statement.\n\nWADA also noted that due to “an unacceptable delay by RUSADA in rendering a decision in this matter,” it referred the case directly to CAS in November, seeking a four-year ban as punishment for Valieva.\n\nU.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart blasted the RUSADA ruling in a text message Friday morning, urging action not only from WADA but also the International Skating Union, the worldwide federation governing figure skating.\n\n“WADA and the ISU have to appeal this decision for the sake of the credibility of the anti-doping system and the rights of all athletes,” Tygart said. \"The world can’t possibly accept this self-serving decision by RUSADA, which has been a key instrument of Russian state-sponsored doping fraud and is non-compliant with the world anti-doping code.”\n\nEleven months ago at the Winter Olympics, Russia won the gold medal, the United States won the silver medal and Japan won the bronze in the team figure skating competition. The following day, those results were thrown into disarray when Valieva, the star of the Russian team, was found to have tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine the previous December, forcing the unprecedented cancellation of the event’s medal ceremony.\n\nOPINION:Kamila Valieva was failed by the adults in her life – and it showed in Olympic meltdown\n\nMORE:World Anti-Doping Agency seeks four-year ban for Russian Olympic skater Kamila Valieva\n\nThere could be a re-ordering of the medals if Valieva were to be disqualified by CAS, with the United States moving up to take the gold, followed by Japan and Canada, the fourth-place finishers in the competition.\n\nAnother CAS panel that convened at the Beijing Olympics allowed Valieva to continue to compete in the women’s competition at the Games, citing the fact that Valieva was a “protected person” (a minor in this case) under WADA rules. That CAS ruling did not address the merits of the doping case and in fact allowed her to compete in part because of the possibility that she might not be banned at a later date.\n\nSkating under the weight of a full-blown Olympic scandal, Valieva, the gold-medal favorite, stumbled to a fourth-place finish.\n\n\"As we approach the one-year anniversary of the Beijing Games, it remains very important that the figure skating team event athletes who competed in Beijing get the resolution they deserve,” U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland said Friday afternoon. \"We thank WADA for their commitment to reviewing this issue and moving the process forward as expeditiously as possible.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/01/29/kamila-valieva-russian-skater-banned-four-years-doping-beijing-olympics/72393824007/", "title": "Kamila Valieva banned four years for doping, ending 2022 Olympic ...", "text": "In a stunning rebuke of Russia’s notorious doping system, the Court of Arbitration for Sport banned Russian Olympic figure skater Kamila Valieva Monday morning for four years and said her 2022 Olympic results were disqualified, ending an unprecedented and protracted international sports drama that has dragged on for nearly two years.\n\nThe CAS ruling means that the International Skating Union, the worldwide governing body for figure skating, will now be called upon to decide the results of the 2022 team figure skating competition based on the arbitration panel’s decision. If Valieva’s results are disallowed and/or the Russian team is disqualified, the ISU is likely to move the United States up to the gold medal, followed by Japan with the silver medal and fourth-place finisher Canada moving up to win the bronze medal.\n\nAn ISU spokesperson told USA TODAY Sports in an email that the federation will issue a statement on the situation Tuesday.\n\n“It is now imperative for the ISU to effectuate the technical decision of her disqualification from the Games and redistribute the medals to the right winners,” U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart told USA TODAY Sports immediately after the CAS decision was announced.\n\nIn response to the CAS decision, Tygart said: \"It’s the right outcome and let’s hope the clean athletes who competed in the Games can finally have some joy and satisfaction for their long wait for some justice despite their moment never being replaced. At the same time, our hearts hurt for yet another Russian athlete who the system failed, this one a young 15-year old girl. The system has to fix itself.\"\n\nThe decision comes 720 days after Valieva, then 15, led Russia to the gold medal in the Olympic team event in Beijing on Feb. 7, 2022. The United States finished second and Japan was third.\n\nBut the next day, the medal ceremony for the event was canceled and the results were thrown into disarray after Valieva was found to have tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine six weeks earlier at the Russian championships.\n\nCAS ruled that Valieva's four-year suspension begins on the date she took that test, Dec. 25, 2021.\n\nOnce the ISU rules on who wins the medals, how the skaters will actually receive their medals is anyone’s guess. One idea that has been floated is to honor the medal winners with a ceremony at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games this summer.\n\nThere certainly is no playbook for this. Never before has an Olympic medal ceremony been canceled, so never before have athletes had to wait what will actually end up being more than two years to receive their medals.\n\nAfter the Beijing Olympics ended, the sole organization charged with beginning the Valieva investigation was the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, which itself was suspended from 2015-2018 for helping Russian athletes cheat. Not surprisingly, RUSADA dithered and delayed through most of the rest of 2022, setting the process back by months.\n\nValieva’s hearing in front of a three-member CAS panel was held in late September 2023 in Lausanne, Switzerland, but was further delayed when the arbitrators ordered “the production of further documentation,” necessitating another meeting in early November before the arbitrators’ deliberations began.\n\nOutrage on behalf of the athletes from the United States and Japan has accompanied this controversy from the moment Valieva’s positive drug test forced the cancellation of the medal ceremony.\n\n“Justice hasn’t just been denied for the athletes who have been waiting nearly two years now for their medals,” Tygart told USA TODAY Sports in November. \"Justice has been defeated. The athletes will never be able to replace the moment they would have had on the Olympic medal podium.\"\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency said in a statement that it “welcomes\" the CAS decision, adding, \"WADA took this appeal to CAS in the interests of fairness for athletes and clean sport and we believe that has been delivered through this decision.”\n\nThe statement also addressed the lengthy process to get to Monday’s decision. \"WADA understands the frustration of the affected parties in relation to the time it took to complete this case. Indeed, WADA shared those frustrations, which is why, at every stage of the process, including during the first instance proceedings in Russia, WADA pushed hard for a timely resolution.”\n\nIn a statement from the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, CEO Sarah Hirshland praised the decision. \"Today is a day we have been eagerly awaiting for two years, as it is a significant win not only for Team USA athletes but also for athletes worldwide who practice fair play and advocate for clean sport.\n\n\"The incredible athletes of Team USA, including Evan Bates, Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Madison Chock, Zachary Donohue, Brandon Frazier, Madison Hubbell, Alexa Knierim and Vincent Zhou have displayed remarkable fortitude. Their outstanding performances in Beijing will forever symbolize their commitment to clean competition.\n\n\"We now anticipate the day when we can wholeheartedly celebrate these athletes, along with their peers from around the world. Their moment is approaching, and when it arrives, it will serve as a testament to the justice and recognition they truly deserve.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2023/02/21/kamila-valieva-wada-appeals-rusada-decision-cas/11312263002/", "title": "Kamila Valieva 'wrong' decision on figure skater appealed by WADA", "text": "The World Anti-Doping Agency announced Tuesday morning, as expected, that it will appeal the Russian Anti-Doping Agency’s “wrong\" decision on figure skater Kamila Valieva to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, seeking a four-year ban for Valieva and disqualification of all her results since late December 2021, including those from the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\n\nU.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart immediately applauded the decision, which could eventually affect the order of the medals from the Beijing Olympic team figure skating event. He also called for an expedited and public CAS hearing.\n\n“It had to be done in order to restore some confidence in the global anti-doping system and we are very thankful,” Tygart wrote in a text message to USA TODAY Sports. “Now, let’s hope the hearing is expedited and open to the public so that the athletes, whose dreams are hanging in the balance, can believe in the final outcome, whatever it may be, and that some justice can be salvaged soon.”\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now for daily updates sent to your inbox\n\nWADA said in its announcement that it “will continue to push for this matter to proceed without further undue delay.”\n\nIn January, a RUSADA disciplinary tribunal found that while the then-15-year-old Valieva committed an anti-doping rule violation, she bore “no fault or negligence” for it. RUSADA imposed no sanction except for the disqualification of her results on the date the sample was collected, which was Dec. 25, 2021, at the Russian national championships.\n\nThat decision hardly was a surprise and was completely consistent with the way RUSADA has handled the controversial and excruciatingly delayed case. RUSADA itself was suspended from 2015-18 for helping Russian athletes cheat.\n\nIt has now been more than a year since Russia won the gold medal, the United States won the silver medal and Japan won the bronze in the team figure skating competition in Beijing. The following day, those results were thrown into disarray when Valieva, the star of the Russian team, was found to have tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine at the December Russian championships, forcing the unprecedented cancellation of the event’s medal ceremony.\n\nThere could be a re-ordering of the medals if Valieva were to be disqualified by CAS, with the United States moving up to take the gold, followed by Japan and Canada, the fourth-place finishers in the competition.\n\n“The entire global system has failed all of the athletes including Valieva,” Tygart told USA TODAY Sports earlier this month. “Obviously, first and foremost the Russians are at fault for allowing this to happen but the whole system also is accountable for allowing this Russian fiasco to turn into a mockery of justice that has robbed athletes of their performances, hard work and sacrifice.”\n\nIn its announcement, WADA said the finding by the RUSADA disciplinary tribunal was “wrong under the terms of the World Anti-Doping Code in this case. … Within the appeal, WADA is seeking a four-year period of ineligibility and disqualification of all the athlete’s results from the date of the sample collection on 25 December 2021.”\n\nIf CAS rules in favor of Valieva, that would most likely be the end of the case and the medals would eventually be awarded in the current order: Russia, USA and Japan. There has been talk of awarding those medals at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics, although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and now-year-long war certainly would complicate any plans to highlight such a high-profile Russian gold medal.\n\nIf CAS rules against Valieva, then the International Skating Union, the worldwide federation for figure skating, and the International Olympic Committee would begin their work.\n\nAs IOC spokesman Mark Adams told USA TODAY Sports earlier this month, “Only the finalization of the case will enable the International Skating Union to establish the definitive results of the figure skating team competition at these Games and the IOC to decide on the medal allocation.”\n\nAnother CAS panel that convened at the Beijing Olympics allowed Valieva to continue to compete in the women’s competition at the Games, citing the fact that Valieva was a “protected person” (a minor in this case) under WADA rules.

Due to the excruciatingly slow pace with which Russia has supposedly been investigating the doping case against Valieva, the athletes still have not received their medals, and experts have predicted it could be many more months, and even another year or more, before they do.\n\nThere also could be a re-ordering of the medals if Valieva were to be disqualified, with the United States moving up to take the gold, followed by Japan and Canada, the fourth-place finishers in the competition.\n\nIn a statement emailed to USA TODAY Sports, RUSADA said it was keeping all details of the Valieva hearing process secret because she is a “protected person,” or minor.\n\nBut for a case that is so renowned worldwide, and one that cuts to the very heart of the integrity of the popular and controversial sport of figure skating, Tygart said much more is at stake.\n\n“If she is exonerated, then there is nothing to hide, so make it public,” he texted. “Certainly, keeping the decision and facts secret makes a mockery of the whole process and there is no wonder athletes and the public do not trust the global WADA anti-doping system.”\n\nWADA spokesman James Fitzgerald said in an email Friday night that while there is “no obligation” of RUSADA “to make public details of an anti-doping case …, given the fact this case is already public, WADA will encourage RUSADA to make appropriate public disclosure bearing in mind the circumstances of the case.\n\n“As it does with all cases, WADA will thoroughly review RUSADA’s decision in this instance and reserves the right to appeal it to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, if appropriate.”\n\nThe ISU also said in an email Saturday it “will carefully review RUSADA's decision and that it reserves its right to appeal the decision to CAS, if appropriate.”\n\nThe IOC did not respond to an email seeking comment Friday.\n\nLast month, RUSADA did publicize the completion of its investigation of Valieva without revealing its results, saying the next step in the case would be hearings. That development seemed to be a clear indication that evidence showed Valieva was found to have committed a doping violation, Tygart told USA TODAY Sports at the time.\n\n“Given it appears that RUSADA’s investigation is over and the case is now headed to court, they must have found sufficient evidence of a violation or otherwise the case would be closed and WADA would be notified of its right to appeal,” Tygart said in a text message.\n\nTygart is not the only U.S. international sports official who has spoken out about the stunningly slow process and its detrimental impact on the athletes who still have not received their medals.\n\n“It continues to be an outrageous situation,” U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee CEO Sarah Hirshland said in a teleconference interview in September. “We saw yesterday … RUSADA announced that there would be disciplinary hearings. That is all we know. I don’t have any details.\n\n“If I tried to be optimistic, I would propose that maybe that’s the next step in the process after the closing of the investigation that now there will be hearings; however, we don’t have any time frame around that and so I don’t know how to set expectations,” Hirshland continued. “There can be hearings and then of course there can be appeals and so I fear that this is going to linger for quite some time still.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/sport/olympics-kamila-valieva-eteri-tutberidze-russia-doping-intl-hnk-spt/index.html", "title": "Kamila Valieva drug case puts spotlight on adults around teen figure ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nRussian figure skater Kamila Valieva placed fourth in the women’s figure skating final at the Beijing Winter Olympics on Thursday, capping off more than a week of controversy after the teen was cleared to skate despite testing positive for a banned substance.\n\nThe Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) still dominated the program, with compatriots Anna Shcherbakova and Alexandra Trusova clinching first and second respectively. Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto finished in third.\n\nValieva was tipped for gold in the event but fell numerous times during her free skate routine. Standing by the 15-year-old was her coach Eteri Tutberidze on whom the spotlight now falls.\n\nIn a sample taken in December, prior to the Olympics, Valieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine, a drug commonly used to treat angina and which experts say can enhance endurance by increasing blood flow to the heart.\n\nKamila Valiyeva (R) talks to her coach Eteri Tutberidze during a training session in Beijing.

Valery Sharifulin/TASS/Getty Images\n\nValieva blamed her positive drug test on a mix-up that occurred with her grandfather’s medication, Denis Oswald, the Chair of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Disciplinary Commission, told reporters Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the results only came to light during the Olympics. Last week, the Court of Arbitration for Sport gave Valieva the green light to continue competing in the Games because of the exceptional circumstances of her being a minor.\n\nThe fact that Valieva is a child and failed a drug test has put renewed focus on the adults around her and the alleged dark underworld of Russian figure skating beneath the glittering surface.\n\n“It is clearly a wish and a decision of the IOC but also WADA to examine all aspects of this case including the situation of the entourage, because of course you can imagine a girl of 15 would not do something wrong alone – so yes, the entourage will be investigated,” said Oswald.\n\nGlobal Athlete, an athlete-led group working for change across the sporting world, called Valieva’s positive drug test “evidence of abuse of a minor.”\n\nKamila Valyeva of the Russian Olympic Committee in action Thursday night at Beijing's Capital Indoor Stadium. Peter Kneffel/Picture Alliance/Getty Images\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which regulates the use of drugs in international sport, said it will be investigating the 15-year-old’s entourage – the adults responsible for her skating and welfare.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) for comment from Tutberidze and ROC team doctor Filipp Shvetsky on the points raised in this story but has not received a response.\n\n“These (past few) days have been very difficult for me,” Valieva told Russia’s Channel One earlier this week, after training. “It’s as if I don’t have any emotions left. I am happy, but at the same time, I am emotionally tired.”\n\nValieva’s coach in the spotlight\n\nAt the center of the controversy – and the Russian skating world – is Valieva’s coach, Eteri Tutberidze.\n\nFrequently called the most powerful woman in figure skating, Tutberidze is the driving force behind Russia’s dominance in the sport. Her studio in Moscow attracts the best female figure skaters from around Russia, who are trained from an early age to break records and perform dazzlingly complex jumps, multiple coaches and skaters told CNN.\n\nValieva made history last week by becoming the first woman to land a quad at the Olympics, and recent female Russian skaters have been known for pushing boundaries on the tricks they can do, from triple axels to triple flips and other difficult combinations.\n\n“We are absolutely sure that Kamila is innocent and clean,” Tutberidze told Russian TV last week.\n\nTutberidze is also infamous for her brutal training regimens.\n\nIn a December interview with Russian TV, she said her skaters train 12 hours a day, saying they can “always do more, demand more from yourself.”\n\nYulia Lipnitskaia (R) and her coach Eteri Tutberidze during the Sochi Winter Olympics on February 20, 2014. Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe coach has trained a string of Olympic medalists, but scrutiny has also been cast on how her best protégées have had short-lived careers.\n\nLike Valieva, Yulia Lipnitskaya was 15 when she helped Russia win gold in the team event at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. But at 19 years old, Lipitskaya retired from figure skating following a battle with anorexia and injuries.\n\nEvgenia Medvedeva was 18 when she won two silver medals at the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics, one each for the single and team event. The two-time world champion unofficially retired from competition last year citing back injuries.\n\nAnd Medvedeva’s teammate Alina Zagitova, who won gold in PyeongChang at the age of 15, announced an indefinite break from competition at 19. Zagitova’s dominance was record breaking: she was Russia’s first skater to win Olympic gold, the World Figure Skating Championships, European Figure Skating Championships and the Grand Prix of Figure Skating.\n\nAll three were coached by Tutberidze.\n\nBut Tutberidze also has a lot of supporters. Russian figure skater-turned-coach Anna Pogorilaya, who briefly trained with Tutberidze at her studio, described her as “an iron lady,” in an interview with CNN.\n\n“She is so dedicated to her vocation… for her, every athlete is like her own child,” she said, adding that she doesn’t believe Tutberidze would pressure her skaters to take performance enhancing drugs.\n\n“I am 100% sure she cannot force her athlete to take anything… I am 100% sure they are clean,” Pogorilaya said.\n\nTeam doctor was banned for doping violations\n\nAnother adult close to Valieva is the ROC team doctor Filipp Shvetsky.\n\nThe World Rowing Federation confirmed to CNN that Shvetsky was team doctor for the Russian rowing team.\n\nHe was banned by Russia in 2007 over doping violations, according to Jim Walden, a lawyer for Russian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, who is under witness protection in the United States\n\nWorld Rowing says three members of the Russian Rowing Federation were declared ineligible for two years because of violations of the World Anti-Doping Code. He was reinstated by Russia in 2010.\n\n“But this guy (Shvetsky) who’s got a history with performance enhancing drugs suddenly shows up as the doctor for this 15-year-old skater… and allegedly, she tests positive for a performance enhancing drug,” said Walden.\n\nROC figure skating coaches Dannil Gleikhengauz, Eteri Tutberidze (L-R front) and team doctor Filipp Shvetsky attend a training session in Beijing. Sergei Bobylev/TASS/Getty Images\n\nWalden said Valieva’s situation should be looked at within the context of Russia’s state-sponsored doping scandal.\n\nRussian athletes competing at the Olympics are already under the shadow of a history of illegal doping: WADA barred Russia from international competitions in 2019 over doping violations. Under the ban set to expire later this year, they’ve only been able to participate as neutrals in the Games.\n\nRodchenkov, the former head of Russia’s anti-doping laboratory, defected to the US and formed the basis of the 2016 McLaren Report which found that more than 1,000 Russian athletes benefited from a systematic doping program between 2011 and 2015. Dozens of Russian athletes were banned after the 2014 Sochi Olympics – where Russian athletes won more medals than any other country.\n\nRussia continues to deny Rodchenkov’s accusations and has said he had personally given drugs to the athletes, who were unaware they were taking banned substances.\n\nUnder the ban set to expire later this year, Russian athletes have only been able to participate if they can prove they are clean. They compete under the banner of the Russian Olympic Committee, not technically under the Russian flag.\n\n“Russia’s not writing on a clean slate. Russia has had a state sponsored doping program since at least the 1960s. It is very well established, it is heavily documented. And so when any Russian athlete tests positive, the Russian state is not doing anyone any favors because there is now a presumption of guilt instead of a presumption of innocence, which for a 15-year-old skater is terrible,” Walden said.\n\nIn 2020, the US government signed into law the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, allowing it to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international sports competitions that feature American athletes, sponsors and broadcasters.\n\nWalden suggested the US could use the law against Valieva’s entourage.\n\n“I’m very sure that the FBI and the Department of Justice are going to be investigating already to try to make an example out of the Russian trainers, doctors, coaches, etc. that were responsible for putting this young athlete in harm’s way,” he said.\n\nRussian athletes and heart medications\n\nValieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine and the investigation into the merits of that positive test is ongoing. But it is not the first time Russian athletes have been pulled up for using the drug, or a “close relative” of the drug, Walden said.\n\nRussian tennis star Maria Sharapova served a 15-month suspension after testing positive for the banned substance meldonium in 2016. Sharapova denied doping and said she was first prescribed meldonium in 2006 for heart issues and was unaware the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had recently added it to the banned substance list because she was taking the drug prescribed under another name.\n\nThe normal course of treatment, according to the drug’s prescribing label, is a matter of days to weeks. It is not known why Sharapova’s doctor continued to prescribe the drug for years.\n\nIn PyeongChang 2018, two Russian athletes – mixed doubles curler Alexander Krushelnitckii and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva – were excluded from walking behind the national flag during the Closing Ceremony after testing positive for banned substances. Krushelnitckii tested positive for meldonium and Sergeeva tested positive in an out-of-competition test for trimetazidine.\n\nKamila Valieva (R) and Eteri Tutberidze attend a training session on February 12, 2022.

In making the decision the panel considered “fundamental principles of fairness, proportionality, irreparable harm,” a statement said.\n\nWhile Tygart acknowledged the that decision should be respected, he said that it was “a rushed one.”\n\n“Only time will tell if [Valieva] should be competing in these Games and whether or not all of her results will be disqualified,” he said.\n\nHowever, if it is found that Valieva should not have competed, Tygart said that the verdict will “reveal what a farce the handling of the Russia state-sponsored doping system by the IOC has been over the last eight years.”\n\n“If Russia had followed the rules, we would know for certain the outcome of the Figure Skating Team Event and those athletes who gave it their all could have their podium moment during these Games as they rightfully deserve with the world in celebration with them.”\n\nREAD: Timeline of Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva’s failed drug test\n\nRussia's Kamila Valieva attends a training session on February 11.

At the end of the day, there was a positive test and there is no question in my mind that she should not be allowed to compete,” Lipinski wrote in a series of tweets.\n\n“Regardless of age or timing of the test/results.

She is the reigning European champion.\n\nBEIJING — A star Russian figure skater is in Olympic limbo following a positive doping test, setting the stage for a dramatic legal hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nAfter days of uncertainty and media reports, the International Testing Agency confirmed Friday that Kamila Valieva, the favorite to win individual gold at the Winter Olympics, tested positive for a banned metabolic agent called trimetazidine and has since been both provisionally suspended and reinstated by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nThe test could ultimately knock Valieva, 15, out of the Games and also impact the results of the team competition, where she helped lead Russia to gold earlier this week.\n\nA final decision on whether Valieva can skate in the women's individual competition, which starts Tuesday, has not yet been reached. And the question has now become the driving force behind an urgent, complex legal battle between the International Olympic Committee and RUSADA.\n\n\"We want to expedite this as quickly as possible,\" IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said in a news conference Friday. \"It's a legal issue, and legal issues unfortunately can be very, very complicated. But for all those concerned – not just the Russian athlete, but obviously all the athletes concerned in the previous competition – we all need to see as quickly as we can a resolution to this.\"\n\nRussia says team medal was 'honestly won'\n\nThe Russian Olympic Committee defended Valieva in a statement Friday, saying that she has since taken other doping tests – at the European Figure Skating Championships in January and in Beijing during the Olympics – that came back negative.\n\n\"(Valieva) has the right to train and take part in competitions in full without restrictions, unless the Court of Arbitration for Sport makes a different decision regarding her status in relation to the Olympic Games,\" the ROC said, which also described its gold medal in the team figure skating event as \"honestly won.\"\n\nRUSADA did not immediately reply to an email from USA TODAY Sports seeking comment.\n\nFOLLOW THE CHASE FOR GOLD: Sign up now and never miss a moment from Beijing\n\nBEIJING TEXT UPDATES: Get behind-the-scenes access to the Olympics\n\nValieva's case is extremely complex, due in part to the timeline of events.\n\nAccording to the ITA, which oversees the anti-doping program at the Olympics, the sample at issue was collected on December 25 at the Russian Figure Skating Championships in St. Petersburg. A lab in Stockholm, Sweden reported the presence of trimetazidine in the sample to RUSADA on Tuesday – after the conclusion of the team event and before the scheduled medal ceremony that night.\n\nThe reason for the delay between the two dates is not immediately clear.\n\nIOC to appeal RUSADA committee's decision\n\nIn the 72 hours since, the positive test has triggered a convoluted series of hearings involving multiple organizations at multiple levels of the international sport ecosystem, as detailed by the ITA.\n\nFirst, RUSADA provisionally suspended Valieva from competing or practicing, because it is required by the World Anti-Doping Agency code to do so. Then, Valieva successfully appealed her suspension before a RUSADA disciplinary committee. That hearing took place Wednesday, which enabled her to practice Thursday and Friday.\n\nNow, it is up to the IOC or another international organization to appeal the decision of that RUSADA disciplinary committee.\n\nThe IOC has already said it plans to do so, even though it has yet to receive the full explanation behind the RUSADA committee's decision. The matter will then go to CAS, a Swiss-based court that effectively has the final say on global sports disputes.\n\n\"A decision is needed before the next competition the athlete is due to take part in,\" said the ITA, which will essentially represent the IOC in its appeal.\n\nOPINION: Russian doping controversy in Beijing is entirely of IOC's own making\n\nCAS had not received a formal application for an appeal regarding the Valieva case as of early Friday afternoon in Beijing, according to a CAS spokesperson. WADA spokesperson James Fitzgerald said his organization is not involved at this time.\n\nNow here's the complicated part: The first CAS hearing that is being pursued by the IOC only involves the decision of the RUSADA disciplinary panel to lift Valieva's suspension. It is not about the specifics of Valieva's case.\n\n\"The proceedings on the merits of the apparent anti-doping rule violation, including the athlete’s right to request the analysis of the B-sample, will be pursued by RUSADA in due course,\" the ITA said in the statement.\n\nThis means that, if the IOC's appeal is successful, it could lead to a scenario in which Valieva is once again provisionally suspended but then still able to file her own appeal, regarding the specifics of the positive test. That would prompt a separate hearing.\n\nComplicated case involves a minor\n\nIt is worth noting that, at 15, Valieva is considered a \"protected person\" under anti-doping rules, which can lead to lighter penalties and more scrutiny on \"athlete support personnel\" who might have contributed to the situation.\n\nThen there's also the matter of the team event, where as many as four Olympic figure skating teams are now wondering if or when they will receive their medals. The International Skating Union will not be able to rule on the outcome of the team event until Valieva's case has been resolved.\n\n\"I hope that, at least before we leave, we'll be able to get (our team medal),\" said Nathan Chen, a member of the U.S. team that won silver. (Japan claimed the bronze.)\n\nValieva's case comes at a delicate and highly-charged time for both the IOC and Russia, which is not supposed to have a formal presence at these Games as punishment for its previous state-sponsored doping efforts. Russian athletes in Beijing are technically representing the \"Russian Olympic Committee\" rather than the nation itself.\n\nIt is a particularly high-stakes matter given that it involves Valieva, the reigning European champion, and figure skating, a sport that is beloved in Russia. Russian women have won each of the past two Olympics and five of the past six world championships, including a podium sweep at the most recent world championships in March.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/11/14/kamila-valieva-wada-russian-olympic-skater-ban-doping/10697762002/", "title": "WADA wants Russian Olympic skater Kamila Valieva to get 4-year ban", "text": "The Court of Arbitration for Sport’s Monday announcement that the World Anti-Doping Agency is seeking a four-year ban of Russian Olympic figure skater Kamila Valieva does not mean the months-long doping saga is going to end soon.\n\n\"Unless the case is expedited, which should happen, this could take awhile even though it's a pretty straightforward case,\" U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis Tygart told USA TODAY Sports Monday morning. “Under normal CAS process, it easily could be the end of 2023. Since it seems that the Russian strategy is to delay and avoid, if that continues at CAS, this easily could be another nine to 18 months.”\n\nLast week, Tygart proposed that the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic athletes who still have not received their medals due to excruciating Russian delays in the Valieva case finally could be celebrated with a medal ceremony at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, possibly at the opening ceremony.\n\nWhile that is only a suggestion, the idea was met very positively by several people within the international Olympic community, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the subjective and uncertain nature of the matter.\n\nNine months ago at the Beijing Games, Russia won the gold medal, the United States won the silver medal and Japan won the bronze in the team figure skating competition.

Tesla said at the time it could be worth nearly $56 billion, and the net value today is $50.9 billion.\n\nMusk took the stand in the Delaware Court of Chancery in Wilmington shortly after 9 a.m. Musk’s testimony came just as he is asserting his control over Twitter, overnight giving an employees an ultimatum to become “extremely hardcore,” involving “working long hours at high intensity,” or leave the company.\n\nMusk began the day under questioning from his defense attorney and an attorney for the plaintiff, where they asked him about Tesla’s governance and his time spent at the company, as well as his relationship with the board, which is supposed to be independent from Musk and represent shareholders. Musk acknowledged his friendship with board members, including some shared family vacations. Under questioning, Musk defended himself, saying he upheld his duty to increase Tesla’s market value, but conceded that he at times does not seek board approval for public statements.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Musk’s huge pay package was unjust enrichment, and alleges the board failed to meet its legal duty to act in the best interest of Tesla shareholders. The suit describes Musk as a “part-time CEO,” as he leads other ventures. One of the points of contention in the case is whether or not Tesla’s board is truly independent from Musk and represents shareholders, or if he had undue influence on the board to award him such a massive payday.\n\nMusk himself controls more than 20% of all outstanding Tesla shares, including unexercised options.\n\nMusk initially denied Thursday that he essentially negotiated against himself regarding how many shares he would receive in the pay package. (To negotiate against oneself would essentially give Musk total control over the outcome, and raise big questions about the board and if it met its fiduciary responsibilities.)\n\nBut the plaintiff’s attorney Gregory Varallo then replayed some of Musk’s deposition in which he said at one point regarding the pay package, “that was I guess me negotiating against myself.”\n\nMusk then acknowledged saying this. It was one of several occasions where Varallo appeared to highlight inconsistencies in Musk’s statements, current and former.\n\nFewer than three minutes into questioning, Musk said that he believed that there had been consultation with the board of directors before his title changed to “Technoking.”\n\nVarallo then played back Musk’s deposition in which Musk said that he hadn’t consulted with the board over the title change.\n\nMusk also had said in his deposition, which was replayed in court Wednesday, that he was the person that came up with the vision for Tesla.\n\nBut in court Wednesday Musk struck a different tone, and objected to being asked the question in a yes-no format.\n\n“I believe you are asking complex questions where yes or not is not possible. Yes is more accurate than no,” Musk said Wednesday. “But your question is a complex question that is commonly used to mislead people.”\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk testifies before Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick in Wilmington, Delaware. Elizabeth Williams/AP\n\nVarallo highlighted the degree of control Musk holds over Tesla.\n\nMusk said he didn’t seek approval when he announced a potential stock buyback recently. He also said that he didn’t seek approval over stating that he saw a path to Tesla becoming worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco, the two most valuable companies in the world.\n\nThe plaintiff’s lawyers have described the package this week as close to the gross domestic product of the entire state of Delaware, and vastly more expensive than building the World Trade Center. They’ve also contrasted Musk’s compensation with the average Tesla salary, which they’ve said is $40,000.\n\nWhile the trial is focused on Musk’s compensation, the lawyers for the plaintiffs asked a wide variety of questions concerning his governance of Tesla. Musk protested a question regarding when he tweets about Tesla.\n\n“We’re on cross-examination in an interesting case Mr. Musk,” Varallo fired back. “So when your lawyer wants to make an objection he has a right to do it, but sadly you don’t. I suspect that he will if he doesn’t like the question.’\n\nThe exchange led to Musk repeating his criticisms of the SEC.\n\n“The consent decree was made under duress,” Musk claimed Wednesday, referring to a 2018 settlement with the SEC over Musk’s claims that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share. “An agreement made under duress is not valid as a foundation of law.”\n\nAt a TED conference earlier this year, Musk said he agreed to a settlement only because if he continued to fight the SEC, Tesla’s banks would have cut off funding at a time when it needed cash. “I was forced [to lie] to save Tesla’s life and that’s the only reason,” Musk said at the April event.\n\nVarallo then asked if Musk had any legal training. Musk described some familiarity.\n\n“If you’re in enough lawsuits you pick up a few things along the way,” Musk said.\n\nTesla executives have defended Musk’s pay package in two days of testimony so far.\n\n“It was around motivating him to achieve things that were bold and audacious and him putting his time and energy into that as opposed to his other interests,” Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm testified Tuesday. Musk was interested in funding inter-planetary travel, she said. Beyond Tesla, Musk is also the CEO of SpaceX and owner of Twitter, as well as leading the Boring Company, which specializes in underground tunneling, and he is the founder of Neuralink, which seeks to put computer chips in people’s brains.\n\nTesla board member James Murdoch, son of media magnate Rupert Murdoch, testified Wednesday that Musk has discussed someone replacing him as CEO of the automaker.\n\nAn attorney for the plaintiff asked Murdoch whether Musk has ever “identified anybody as a potential successor” as Tesla’s CEO.\n\n“He actually has,” Murdoch responded. “But it’s in between the time where you took that deposition and now,” referring to Murdoch’s testimony before the trial. Murdoch clarified that the conversation was in the past few months.\n\nMurdoch said that Musk has never suggested to him that he may imminently leave Tesla. And Murdoch said he was not aware of Musk suggesting to anyone else that he was going to imminently quit Tesla.\n\nMurdoch did not reveal any other details about who a potential successor for Musk could be. Musk has mused about leaving his role at Tesla for years.\n\nTesla executives and board members like Murdoch have characterized the compensation package’s goals as lofty and incredibly difficult to achieve.\n\nFormer Tesla Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja described the plan as “extremely high-risk, high-reward” on Tuesday.\n\n“Even though I believe in Tesla deeply, I felt the level of difficulty of these milestones was so high that for a mere mortal like me, I did not find this as a compelling incentive plan at a personal level,” Ahuja said.\n\nMusk pushed for shareholders to approve the plan, warning that he was “very offended” by a lack of support and those who opposed it would not be welcome in any of his companies, according to emails read in court by the plaintiff ‘s attorneys.\n\nChris Isidore contributed to this story.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html", "title": "Twitter whistleblower Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko raises concerns over ...", "text": "Twitter has major security problems that pose a threat to its own users’ personal information, to company shareholders, to national security, and to democracy, according to an explosive whistleblower disclosure obtained exclusively by CNN and The Washington Post.\n\nThe disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies, paints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a mismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the platform’s central controls and most sensitive information without adequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company’s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims).\n\nZatko was fired by Twitter (TWTR) in January for what the company claims was poor performance. According to Zatko, his public whistleblowing comes after he attempted to flag the security lapses to Twitter (TWTR)’s board and to help Twitter (TWTR) fix years of technical shortcomings and alleged non-compliance with an earlier privacy agreement with the Federal Trade Commission. Zatko is being represented by Whistleblower Aid, the same group that represented Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen.\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told CNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko began the whistleblower process before there was any indication of Musk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding.”\n\nCNN sought comment from Twitter on more than 50 specific questions regarding the disclosure.\n\nIn a statement, a Twitter spokesperson told CNN that security and privacy are both longtime priorities for the company. Twitter also said the company provides clear tools for users to control privacy, ad targeting and data sharing, and added that it has created internal workflows to ensure users know that when they cancel their accounts, Twitter will deactivate the accounts and start a deletion process. Twitter declined to say whether it typically completes the process.\n\n“Mr. Zatko was fired from his senior executive role at Twitter in January 2022 for ineffective leadership and poor performance,” the Twitter spokesperson said. “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.”\n\nSome of Zatko’s most damning claims spring from his apparently tense relationship with Parag Agrawal, the company’s former chief technology officer who was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. According to the disclosure, Agrawal and his lieutenants repeatedly discouraged Zatko from providing a full accounting of Twitter’s security problems to the company’s board of directors. The company’s executive team allegedly instructed Zatko to provide an oral report of his initial findings on the company’s security condition to the board rather than a detailed written account, ordered Zatko to knowingly present cherry-picked and misrepresented data to create the false perception of progress on urgent cybersecurity issues, and went behind Zatko’s back to have a third-party consulting firm’s report scrubbed to hide the true extent of the company’s problems.\n\nThe disclosure is generally much kinder to Dorsey, who hired Zatko and whom Zatko believes wanted to see the problems within the company fixed. But it does depict him as extremely disengaged in his final months leading Twitter – so much so that some senior staff even considered the possibility he was sick.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dorsey for comment. A person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told CNN the company investigated several claims he brought forward around the time he was fired, and ultimately found them unpersuasive; the person added that Zatko at times lacked understanding of Twitter’s FTC obligations.\n\nZatko believes his firing was in retaliation for his sounding the alarm about the company’s security problems.\n\nThe scathing disclosure, which totals around 200 pages, including supporting exhibits – was sent last month to a number of US government agencies and congressional committees, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The existence and details of the disclosure have not previously been reported. CNN obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill. The SEC, DOJ and FTC declined to comment; the Senate Intelligence Committee, which received a copy of the report, is taking the disclosure seriously and is setting a meeting to discuss the allegations, according to Rachel Cohen, a committee spokesperson.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee and also received the report, vowed to investigate “and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations.”\n\nThe claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, the same panel’s top Republican and an avid Twitter user, also expressed deep concerns about the allegations in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster,” Grassley said. “The claims I’ve received from a Twitter whistleblower raise serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”\n\nThe FTC should investigate the claims, and impose fines and individual liability on specific Twitter executives if a probe finds they were responsible for security lapses, Sen. Richard Blumenthal wrote to the agency in a letter on Tuesday obtained by CNN.\n\nThe letter by Blumenthal — who chairs the Senate subcommittee on consumer protection — highlights the pressure Twitter now faces from Washington as a result of the disclosure.\n\n“If the Commission does not vigorously oversee and enforce its orders, they will not be taken seriously and these dangerous breaches will continue,” Blumenthal wrote.\n\nZatko may be eligible for a monetary award from the US government as a result of his whistleblower activities. “Original, timely and credible information that leads to a successful enforcement action” by the SEC can earn whistleblowers up to a 30% cut of agency fines related to the action if the penalties amount to more than $1 million, the SEC has said. The SEC has awarded more than $1 billion to nearly 300 whistleblowers since 2012.\n\nTye told CNN that Zatko filed his disclosure to the SEC “to help the agency enforce the laws,” and to gain federal whistleblower protections. “The prospect of a reward was not a factor in Mudge’s decision, and in fact he didn’t even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower.”\n\nThe Whistleblower\n\nZatko first came to national attention in 1998 when he took part in the first congressional hearings on cybersecurity.\n\n“All my life, I’ve been about finding places where I can go and make a difference. I’ve done that through the security field. That’s my main lever,” he told CNN in an interview earlier this month.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Twitter whistleblower was on CNN 22 years ago. Here's what he had to say 03:22 - Source: CNN\n\nThe events leading to his decision to become a whistleblower began before he worked at Twitter, with a devastating hack in 2020 in which the Twitter accounts of some of the world’s most famous people, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Kim Kardashian and Musk, were compromised. Twitter told CNN that in response to the incident, the company began compartmentalizing access to customer support tools.\n\nAfter the attack, Dorsey recruited Zatko, a well-known “ethical hacker” turned cybersecurity insider and executive who previously held senior roles at Google, Stripe and the US Department of Defense, and who told CNN that he’d been offered a senior, day-one cyber position in the Biden administration.\n\nZatko, center, was among a group of hackers who testified before Congress on cybersecurity in 1998. Douglas Graham/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images\n\nWhat Zatko says he found was a company with extraordinarily poor security practices, including giving thousands of the company’s employees — amounting to roughly half the company’s workforce — access to some of the platform’s critical controls. His disclosure describes his overall findings as “egregious deficiencies, negligence, willful ignorance, and threats to national security and democracy.”\n\nAfter the January 6 insurrection, Zatko was concerned about the possibility someone within Twitter who sympathized with the insurrectionists could try to manipulate the company’s platform, according to his disclosure. He sought to clamp down on internal access that allows Twitter engineers to make changes to the platform, known as the “production environment.”\n\nBut, the disclosure says, Zatko soon learned “it was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did…. Nobody knew where data lived or whether it was critical, and all engineers had some form of critical access to the production environment.” Twitter also lacked the ability to hold workers accountable for information security lapses because it has little control or visibility into employees’ individual work computers, Zatko claims, citing internal cybersecurity reports estimating that 4 in 10 devices do not meet basic security standards.\n\nTwitter’s flimsy server infrastructure is a separate yet equally serious vulnerability, the disclosure claims. About half of the company’s 500,000 servers run on outdated software that does not support basic security features such as encryption for stored data or regular security updates by vendors, according to the letter to regulators and a February email Zatko wrote to Patrick Pichette, a Twitter board member, that is included in the disclosure.\n\n[I]t was impossible to protect the production environment. All engineers had access. There was no logging of who went into the environment or what they did. From Zatko's disclosure\n\nThe company also lacks sufficient redundancies and procedures to restart or recover from data center crashes, Zatko’s disclosure says, meaning that even minor outages of several data centers at the same time could knock the entire Twitter service offline, perhaps for good.\n\nTwitter did not respond to questions about the risk of data center outages, but told CNN that people on Twitter’s engineering and product teams are authorized to access the production environment if they have a specific business justification for doing so. Twitter’s employees use devices overseen by other IT and security teams with the power to prevent a device from connecting to sensitive internal systems if it is running outdated software, Twitter added.\n\nThe company also said it uses automated checks to ensure laptops running outdated software cannot access the production environment, and that employees may only make changes to Twitter’s live product after the code meets certain record-keeping and review requirements.\n\nTwitter has internal security tools that are tested by the company regularly, and every two years by external auditors, according to the person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at the company. The person added that some of Zatko’s statistics surrounding device security lacked credibility and were derived by a small team that did not properly account for Twitter’s existing security procedures.\n\nBut Twitter’s security concerns had come to light prior to 2020. In 2010, the FTC filed a complaint against Twitter for its mishandling of users’ private information and the issue of too many employees having access to Twitter’s central controls. The complaint resulted in an FTC consent order finalized the following year in which Twitter vowed to clean up its act, including by creating and maintaining “a comprehensive information security program.”\n\nZatko alleges that despite the company’s claims to the contrary, it had “never been in compliance” with what the FTC demanded more than 10 years ago. As a result of its alleged failures to address vulnerabilities raised by the FTC as well as other deficiencies, he says, Twitter suffers an “anomalously high rate of security incidents,” approximately one per week serious enough to require disclosure to government agencies. “Based on my professional experience, peer companies do not have this magnitude or volume of incidents,” Zatko wrote in a February letter to Twitter’s board after he was fired by Twitter in January.\n\nThe stakes of Zatko’s disclosure are enormous. It could lead to billions of dollars in new fines for Twitter if it’s found to have violated its legal obligations, according to Jon Leibowitz, who was chair of the FTC at the time of Twitter’s original 2011 consent order.\n\nThe agency now has another opportunity to show the tech industry it is serious about holding platforms accountable, Leibowitz added, after officials opted not to name top Facebook execs including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg in the FTC’s $5 billion privacy settlement with that company in 2019.\n\n[I]f there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order. Jon Leibowitz, former chair of the FTC\n\n“One of the big disappointments in the Facebook order violation case was that the FTC let executives off the hook; they should’ve been named,” Leibowitz told CNN in an interview. “And if there’s a violation here — and that’s a big if — then I think the FTC should very seriously consider not just fining the corporation but also putting the executives responsible under order.”\n\nTwitter told CNN its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, citing third-party audits filed to the agency under the 2011 consent order in which it said Zatko did not participate. Twitter also said it is in compliance with relevant privacy rules and that it has been transparent with regulators about its efforts to fix any shortcomings in its systems.\n\nZatko’s allegations are based in part on a failure to grasp how Twitter’s existing programs and processes work to fulfill Twitter’s FTC obligations, the person familiar with his tenure told CNN, saying that misunderstanding has prompted him to make inaccurate claims about the company’s level of compliance.\n\nForeign threats\n\nTwitter is exceptionally vulnerable to foreign government exploitation in ways that undermine US national security, and the company may even have foreign spies currently on its payroll, the disclosure alleges.\n\nThe whistleblower report says the US government provided specific evidence to Twitter shortly before Zatko’s firing that at least one of its employees, perhaps more, were working for another government’s intelligence service. The report does not say whether Twitter was already aware or if it subsequently acted on the tip.\n\nParag Agrawal, Twitter's former chief technology officer, was made CEO after Jack Dorsey stepped down last November. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nLast year, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Agrawal — then Twitter’s chief technology officer — proposed to Zatko that Twitter comply with Russian demands that could result in broad-based censorship or surveillance of the platform, Zatko alleges.\n\nThe disclosure does not provide details of Agrawal’s suggestion. Last summer, however, Russia passed a law pressuring tech platforms to open local offices in the country or face potential advertising bans, a move western security experts said was intended to give Russia greater leverage over US tech companies.\n\nWhile Agrawal’s suggestion was ultimately discarded, it was still an alarming sign of how far Twitter was willing to go in pursuit of growth, according to Zatko.\n\n“The fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on U.S. national security,” Zatko’s disclosure says.\n\nThe fact that Twitter’s current CEO even suggested Twitter become complicit with the Putin regime is cause for concern about Twitter’s effects on US national security, From Zatko's disclosure\n\nZatko’s report is becoming public just two weeks after a former Twitter manager was convicted of spying for Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi case underscores the gravity of the allegations Zatko now levels at Twitter. His report could further inflame bipartisan concerns in Washington about foreign adversaries and the cybersecurity threats they pose to Americans, ranging from the theft of US citizens’ data to manipulating US voters or stealing technology and trade secrets.\n\nTwitter did not respond to specific questions about its alleged foreign intelligence vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Musk element\n\nZatko’s disclosure comes at a particularly fortuitous moment for Musk, who is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Musk has accused Twitter of lying about the number of spam bots on its platform, an issue that he claims should let him terminate the deal.\n\nWhile the binding acquisition agreement that Musk signed with Twitter in April did not include any bot-related exemptions, the billionaire claims that the number of bots on the platform affect the user experience and that having more bots than previously known could therefore impact the company’s long-term value. After Musk moved to terminate the purchase, Twitter responded with a lawsuit alleging that he is using bots as a pretext to get out of a deal over which he now has buyers’ remorse following the recent market downturn, and asking a court to force him to close the deal. The case is set to go to trial in Delaware Chancery Court in October.\n\nTwitter employees walk by the company's headquarters in San Francisco. Glenn Chapman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUser numbers are vital information for any social media business, as advertising revenue depends on how many people could potentially see an ad. But figures about how many users a service has, or how many people actually view a given ad on a site, are notoriously unreliable throughout the tech and media industries due to manipulation and error.\n\nAlone among social media companies, Twitter reports its user numbers to investors and advertisers using a measurement it calls monetizable daily active users, or mDAUs. Its rivals simply count and report all active users; until 2019, Twitter had worked that way as well. But that meant Twitter’s figures were subject to significant swings in certain situations, including takedowns of major bot networks. So Twitter switched to mDAUs, which it says counts all users that could be shown an advertisement on Twitter – leaving all accounts that for some reason can’t, for instance because they’re known to be bots, in a separate bucket, according to Zatko’s disclosure.\n\nThe company has repeatedly reported that less than 5% of its mDAUs are fake or spam accounts, and a person familiar with the matter both affirmed that assessment to CNN this week and pointed to other investor disclosures saying the figure relies on significant judgement that may not accurately reflect reality. But Zatko’s disclosure argues that by reporting bots only as a percentage of mDAU, rather than as a percentage of the total number of accounts on the platform, Twitter obscures the true scale of fake and spam accounts on the service, a move Zatko alleges is deliberately misleading.\n\nZatko says he began asking about the prevalence of bot accounts on Twitter in early 2021, and was told by Twitter’s head of site integrity that the company didn’t know how many total bots are on its platform. He alleges that he came away from conversations with the integrity team with the understanding that the company “had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bots,” in part because if the true number became public, it could harm the company’s value and image.\n\nJack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter. I signed on to do it and believe I’m still performing that mission. Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, former Twitter head of security\n\nExperts on inauthentic behavior online say it can be difficult to quantify “bots” because there isn’t a widely agreed upon definition of the term, and because bad actors constantly change their tactics. There are also many harmless bots on Twitter (and across the internet), such as automated news accounts, and Twitter offers an opt-in feature to allow such accounts to transparently label themselves as automated. Twitter told CNN that the claim it doesn’t know how many bots are on its platform lacks context, reiterating that not all bots are bad and adding that to focus on the total number of bots on Twitter would include those the company may have already identified and taken action against. The company also does not believe it can catch every spam account on the platform, Twitter said, which is why it reports its less-than-5% figure, which reflects a manual estimate, in its financial filings.\n\nBut Zatko told CNN he thinks there would still be value in attempting to measure the total number of spam, false or otherwise potentially harmful automated accounts on the platform. “The executive team, the board, the shareholders and the users all deserve an honest answer as to what it is that they are consuming as far as data and information and content [on the platform … At least from my point of view, I want to invest in a company where I know what’s actually going on because I want to invest strategically in the long-term value of an organization,” he said.\n\nTwitter says that it allows bots on its platform, but its rules prohibit those that engage in spam or platform manipulation. But, as with all social media platforms’ rules, the challenge often lies in enforcing its policies.\n\nElon Musk is engaged in a legal battle with Twitter over his attempt to back out of buying the company. Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe company says it regularly challenges, suspends and removes accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation, including typically removing more than one million spam accounts each day. Twitter said the total number of bots on the platform is not a useful number. The company declined to answer questions about the total number of accounts on the platform or the average number of new accounts added on the platform daily as context around its daily bot deletion figure.\n\nBut in casting doubt on Twitter’s ability to estimate the true number of fake and spam accounts, Zatko’s allegations could provide ammunition to Musk’s central claim that the figure is much higher than Twitter has publicly reported.\n\nBy going public, Zatko says, he believes he is doing the job he was hired to do for a platform he says is critical to democracy. “Jack Dorsey reached out and asked me to come and perform a critical task at Twitter.

The former Delaware State University student led with nine nominations for the 2024 Grammy Awards, to be held Feb. 4 in Los Angeles.\n\nOf her 24 career nominations, the alt-R&B/soul songstress born Solána Rowe has won only once and never been nominated as a solo artist in the major categories of record and song of the year, as she is for “Kill Bill,” nor album of the year, as she is for “SOS.”\n\nMORE ON SZA:R&B singer came to UD and the reason why may be found at her sold-out Philly concert\n\nFollowing SZA’s impressive haul of nods are Phoebe Bridgers, Victoria Monét and audio engineer Serban Ghenea with seven each and Jack Antonoff, Jon Batiste, boygenius, Brandy Clark, Cyrus, Eilish, Rodrigo and Swift with six apiece.\n\nBridgers, who is part of the indie folk rock trio boygenius with Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, has been nominated four times prior to this year. Six of her seven nominations for the 2024 ceremony are with boygenius, including record of the year (“Not Strong Enough”) and album of the year (“The Record”).\n\nRecording Academy president Harvey Mason jr. believes this crop of nominees showcases “the aspirational nature of what we do. They really set the stage for the next group of people who come up because they’re going to see themselves in the nominations. The Grammy voters have done what we’ve asked them to do – listen intently to the music and evaluate it and in the mind of 12,000 voters, there is a tendency to hear the evolution of art.”\n\nThis is also a notable year for relative veteran Cyrus, who, despite her significant popularity and consistent chart presence since 2007, only snagged two career nominations leading into this year’s list. Her “Endless Summer Vacation” marks her initial arrival in the album of the year category, while “Flowers” drops her in the record and song of the year races for the first time.\n\nThe frequently lauded Swift – 52 career nominations and 12 wins – can potentially add even more achievements to her resume.\n\nHer album of the year nod for “Midnights” ties her with Barbra Streisand for the most nominations by a female artist in the category (each has six). If Swift wins the prestigious album of the year, she will be the first to earn the honor four times. She’s currently tied with Frank Sinatra, Paul Simon and Stevie Wonder with three victories.\n\n“I think Taylor has a one in eight chance of winning that category,” Mason says with a laugh referencing the total number of nominees. “But seriously, she has a really good shot. She’s had an incredible year with a massive record and she’s profoundly talented. But it’s a tough category – there are some great records in there.”\n\nAmong the 94 Grammy categories, there are three newcomers: best African music performance, best alternative jazz album and best pop dance recording.\n\nThe “big four” categories – song, record and album of the year, plus best new artist – have also been pared down from 10 nominees in each to eight.\n\n“I want us to honor as much music as possible and respect as many creators as possible and the move to 10 (in 2021) was an opportunity to do that,” Mason says. “But we listen and learn and evaluate and the music community felt 10 was too many and maybe there was some dilution with that many nominees. We’ll see how eight goes because, you know, there’s a lot of talent that are nine, 10, 11 and 12, too.”\n\nThe eligibility period for the 66th annual Grammy Awards ran from Oct. 1, 2022 to Sept. 15, 2023.

The sale price also was eye-popping considering Flexus had landed only $36 million in venture capital at that point.\n\n\"A pre-clinical biotech being acquired for more than $1 billion is largely unheard of,\" said Reni Benjamin, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates Inc. in New York. \"When you have tested things in rabbits, mice and monkeys, that is usually worth a lot less than when you have tested it in humans.\"\n\nTo date, the Silicon Valley company ranks as one of the fastest launch-to-billion-dollar acquisition for any venture capital-backed U.S. startup.\n\nFlexus's astounding fortune also raised eyebrows in the executive boardroom of Delaware’s most promising drugmaker. Incyte was pioneering virtually the same combination therapy that had become the focus of Flexus's business.\n\nThe company had already taken the experimental medication through early and mid-stage clinical trials — a rigorous research effort that dated back to 2006, according to the lawsuit. Yet Flexus managed to attract a buyer after delving into the science for mere months.\n\nIncyte officials declined to comment for this story. But in court filings, lawyers for the Delaware company argue the deal was the fruit of Fridman's deception.\n\nThe scientist jumped ship for Flexus a year before the company was acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb. In court documents, Incyte officials claim the 46-year-old colluded with Flexus founders Juan Jaen and Terry Rosen to take advantage of the closely guarded trade secrets he grabbed on his way out the door.\n\n\"We are saying, 'Pay us the money you are making on the knowledge you took,'\" said Incyte attorney Michael Kelly, chair of the Wilmington law firm McCarter & English. \"For me, it's a slammus dunkus case. We got 'em.\"\n\nThe case may not be so cut-and-dried, however. The legal battle has dragged out for years and could go at least one more before reaching a jury. The trial is scheduled for October 2018.\n\nFridman, who could not be reached for comment, is not a defendant. His employment contract with Incyte stipulated that any dispute with the company must be handled in arbitration.\n\nInstead, Incyte seeks damages from Flexus' two founders and the company itself that could top $2 billion, Kelly said.\n\nJaen and Rosen could not be reached for comment. They are now the top executives at another California startup called Arcus Biosciences.\n\n\"Flexus feels this case does not have merit and will be defending it vigorously,\" said Patricia Carson, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis, who is representing the defendants.\n\nThe outcome could impact how long Incyte will be the only company with a new blockbuster cancer therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — a huge advantage in what some anticipate will be a $3 billion to $5 billion market.\n\n\"The value of [that] is potentially huge,\" said analyst Y. Katherine Xu of the New York firm William Blair & Co. \"The farther ahead of the competition they are, the better.\"\n\nA coming breakthrough\n\nAt the heart of the legal battle is a promising new type of therapy industry watchers say could be the next big advance in immuno-oncology.\n\nDrugs like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol-Myer Squibb's' Opdivo are the most prominent therapies in the area that enhances a patient's immune system to fight cancer.\n\nThose drugs are effective in about 20 to 50 percent of patients, depending on the type of cancer, Xu said.\n\nIncyte currently leads the race to bring a companion drug to market aimed at boosting the efficacy of those therapies by suppressing an enzyme called IDO-1.\n\nThat enzyme keeps the body's natural immune system from attacking cancerous growth in the same way a fetus is shielded from attack by a pregnant mother’s immune system. In cancer patients, the enzyme tricks the body from recognizing an actual threat.\n\nIncyte's foray into this therapy is known as epacadostat. The experimental drug could help a cancer patient's immune system \"see\" a tumor and then fight it with the help of a companion drug.\n\n\"It is really a revolution maneuvering these systems in a way to fight cancer,\" Xu said.\n\nThe drug cocktail has shown promise for the treatment of melanoma, a potentially deadly form of skin cancer diagnosed in nearly 90,000 U.S. residents per year. But the hope is the drug combo can be expanded to battle other forms of cancer.\n\nIt’s an important line of research for Incyte and, in turn, Delaware.\n\nWidely hailed as one of the state's biggest success stories, the publicly traded company is now valued at $24 billion. It first moved to Delaware in 2001 after Paul A. Friedman, the former president of DuPont Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories, became its chief executive.\n\nThe company scored its first blockbuster drug in 2011 when Jakafi became the first and only treatment for the rare blood cancer myelofibrosis approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The drug also was approved for treatment of patients diagnosed with another rare blood cancer in late 2014.\n\nSales of the drug are expected to reach more than $1 billion this year alone.\n\nBased largely on the success of Jakafi, Incyte spent $80 million to acquire the former John Wanamaker department store on Augustine Cut-off near Wilmington, which it renamed the Paul A. Friedman Building.\n\nLast month, the company also completed the construction of a four-story, 154,000-square-footaddition and a 475-space parking garage. Recent land purchases next door to its headquarters have spurred speculation among New Castle County government officials that the company is planning further growth.\n\n\"Incyte is a darling of Wall Street,\" Benjamin said. \"They are unlike three-fourths of the biotech companies out there because they are not just a development-stage company. They are a revenue-generating company.\"\n\nThe company now employs about 700 people in Delaware who pull down an average salary of about $150,000 — growth supported by roughly $1.3 million in state taxpayer grants and loans.\n\nIncyte's product line also is growing. Last year, Incyte purchased the rights to a last-resort blood cancer drug and is close to winning federal approval for an arthritis treatment.\n\nEpacadostat is seen as another breakthrough that could eventually reap billions of dollars for Incyte.\n\n\"It is a hugely valuable asset if it realizes its promise,\" Xu said. \"The market could be quite huge, in the tens of billions.\"\n\nFor years, Incyte had the clearest path to reaching FDA approval for an IDO-1 inhibitor, analysts said. But Bristol-Myers Squibb is now nipping at its ankles with the drug candidate it acquired in the Flexus deal.\n\nAnd the rise of that drug candidate just so happened to coincide with Flexus's hiring of Fridman.\n\nStolen secrets?\n\nWith Fridman's help, Incyte had gathered enough Phase II clinical data by late 2013 to demonstrate, for the first time ever, that the IDO-1 inhibitor — in combination with other drugs — is effective in reducing the size of tumors, company lawyers say.\n\nIncyte went to “great lengths to keep its clinical contracts secret,” hoping to commercialize the drug and become the “first mover” – an advantage the lawsuit states is worth at least $1 billion.\n\nHEALTH:AstraZeneca says 2 drugs help women with metastatic breast cancer\n\nBy then, Fridman already was discussing his possible exit with Jaen, one of two men who founded Flexus in August 2013, according to court documents.\n\nTwo months later, Flexus had raised $13 million in venture capital and was asking Fridman to come in for a formal job interview. In advance of that meeting, Fridman began ordering a colleague to download Incyte's confidential clinical trial data for him, Incyte contends in court pleadings.\n\nIncyte's lawyers claim Flexus chose to focus its research and development on IDO-1 inhibitors soon after interviewing Fridman — a point strongly disputed by the attorneys for Jaen and Rosen.\n\nFridman told Jaen that Flexus's timing \"couldn't be better\" and that data from Incyte's clinical trials soon would be made public, according to court documents.\n\n\"They don't go all in on this IDO inhibitor until he joins,\" said Kelly, Incyte's attorney. \"We have emails that they admit that they were looking at confidential Incyte information so we got them dead to rights.\"\n\nA member of Flexus's board of directors also spoke with Fridman. Afterward, the board member sent an email to the company's founders stating that Incyte's non-public data \"is very interesting ... and it looks great.\"\n\nBut he warned Jaen and Rosen that hiring Fridman presented \"a dangerous conflict,\" according to court records.\n\nIn December 2013, Fridman gave Incyte three months notice that he planned to leave the company. Before leaving he also signed a document certifying that he did not possess any Incyte records and had complied with all of the terms of a nondisclosure agreement he signed years earlier, the court record shows.\n\nBut Fridman never mentioned his new job was as chief scientific officer for a direct competitor until bumping into his former colleagues at the June 2014 American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meeting — where his former employer publicly revealed its new cancer drug's promise in early clinical trials, according to court filings.\n\nAt the event, Fridman told his former co-workers that Flexus did not have an IDO-1 inhibitor project and that he was no longer working on IDO-1 inhibitors, Incyte claims.\n\nCourt documents, however, indicate Fridman provided Flexus executives detailed information about the molecular structure of Incyte's drug weeks later. And by December 2014, he was emailing his former boss at Incyte to admit he was working on IDO-1 inhibitor research and to apologize for misleading him about Flexus' activities, according to court filings.\n\nWithin days of Fridman sending that email, Flexus raised another $25 million in venture capital to \"advance its pipeline of immunotherapies and to select a clinical candidate from its IDO-1 inhibitor program,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nFlexus was purchased by Bristol-Myers Squibb eight weeks later.\n\nIncyte then launched the first salvo in a protracted legal fight over the stolen trade secrets it says were at the center of that $1.25 billion deal.\n\nSending a message\n\nFridman was ordered by Delaware Chancery Court in April 2015 to abstain from conducting any further work on IDO-1 inhibitors for Flexus or Bristol-Myers Squibb. He also was expressly barred from disclosing any of Incyte's trade secrets.\n\nIncyte has set its sights squarely on Jaen and Rosen, who it claims got rich off Incyte's stolen intellectual property.\n\nIncyte filed a lawsuit against Flexus' founders in September 2015 that leveled five claims under Delaware law, ranging from unjust enrichment to conspiracy.\n\nFlexus' attorneys have convinced Delaware Superior Court Judge Mary Johnston to dismiss two of those claims and are now seeking to have the remaining three combined into a single count of misappropriation of trade secrets.\n\nThe bulk of the legal wrangling, however, has centered on what documents each side should be required to turn over as both sides seek to withhold as much information as possible.\n\nDue to the secretive nature of the research being discussed, a large number of the court filings have been sealed. But court filings indicate at least 50,000 documents have been traded between the two sides.\n\nThe case is now tentatively scheduled for a jury trial in October 2018.\n\nIncyte, meanwhile, continues to advance clinical trials involving epocadostat, while Bristol-Myers Squibb does the same for its IDO-1 inhibitor it bought in the Flexus deal.\n\nSome analysts believe Incyte's drug could hit the market by 2019, while Bristol-Myers may only be a year or two behind.\n\nBut they disagree about the potential impact if the alleged theft of trade secrets results in Incyte facing competition sooner rather than later.\n\n\"It would be huge,\" Xu said. \"[Incyte] could have 40 percent of a melanoma market versus 60 or 70 percent if [it doesn't] have competition.\"\n\nBenjamin said even without Bristol-Myers' drug on the market, Incyte would still be facing competition from other cancer therapies. And market watchers fully expect another IDO-1 inhibitor eventually will win FDA approval.\n\n\"Unless they can stop the development of Bristol's program, which doesn't look like they can, there is not going to be any impact,\" Benjamin said.\n\nBristol-Myers is not named as a defendant in Incyte's lawsuit, but Kelly said the drugmaker's legal team could seek a percentage of the pharma giant's future royalties from any FDA-approved IDO-1 inhibitor.\n\n\"We're saying, 'All this money you made on our product and all the money you will make are ill-gotten gains,'\" he said. \"I applaud [Incyte] for saying we can't stand for this, and if we let these people get away with it, other people might do it.\"\n\nBenjamin, the analyst for Raymond James, said he suspects the true goal of the fight is to send a message.\n\n\"Anybody that leaves the company, it says, 'Look, we are not screwing around,'\" Benjamin added. \"The things you do here is Incyte's, not yours to take and do something with. And we will pursue this to the ends of our days.\"\n\nContact Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.

The 13-year-old drug discovery company has separated itself from the crowd with its relocation to the landmark former John Wanamaker department store on Augustine Cut-off in Wilmington.\n\nNot only has Incyte helped preserve an important part of Delaware's architectural history, the project is a granite and marble statement that the company is an up-and-coming player in the biopharmaceutical industry.\n\n\"The move underscores Incyte's rapid growth and success over the past few years,\" Hoppenot said.\n\nFor Delaware, which has steadily watched longtime employers cut back or disappear, the Incyte project is a \"big win,\" said Delaware Economic Development Director Alan Levin.\n\nThe company employs 580 highly educated people with an average salary of $125,000, and had been aggressively wooed by other states. Over the past 12 months, the company has added approximately 120 employees.\n\n\"This is Delaware of the future,\" Levin said\n\nThe relocation marks the first time the drugmaker has its own stand-alone identity on the Delaware landscape. Since 2003, the company leased space in DuPont Co.'s Experimental Station near Alapocas.\n\nDuring that time, it brought a drug to market that is used to treat a rare blood cancer called myelofibrosis in which bone marrow is no longer able to produce blood cells.\n\nLevin described the drug, Jakafi, as a \"home run.\" And Incyte has an impressive pipeline of potential medicines, which could result in a grand slam, Levin said.\n\nEmployees moved earlier this month into the headquarters, named the Paul A. Friedman Building for the scientist and physician who led the company from 2001 to 2014. Louis J. Capano Jr., who owns building with his son, Louis J. Capano III and picked up most of the renovation cost, described the project as the biggest he's tackled in terms of size and cost.\n\n\"Buildings are meaningful,\" said Hoppenot, who took over at Incyte in January after 10 years with Novartis AG, including serving as president of Novartis Oncology.\n\n\"Innovative science capable of producing new medicines requires the best scientists and we wanted our new building to provide them with an environment that they can take pride in, enjoy and flourish. The Wanamaker building has allowed us to do just that.\"\n\nOn the move\n\nUntil taking over the 16.7-acre Wanamaker campus, Incyte had kept a low profile in Delaware, Levin said.\n\nThe company started in 1991 in Palo Alto, Calif., with a focus on genomics. It went public in 1993 and developed a name in the genomics industry for making money by selling access to its human genes database.\n\nThen in 2001, the company went through a major restructuring to add drug discovery to its business and tapped Friedman as chief executive.\n\nFriedman had been president of DuPont Pharmaceuticals Research Laboratories, a wholly owned subsidiary of DuPont Pharmaceuticals Co. (formerly The DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co.). DuPont Pharma was sold to Bristol Myers-Squibb in 2001 for $7.8 billion.\n\nFriedman was joined at Incyte by nearly 30 other DuPont Pharma scientists. Many were part of a DuPont team that developed Sustiva, a successful drug used in the treatment of HIV.\n\nThe company started with a number of discovery targets, including medicines for the treatment of diabetes, HIV, cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n\nA pivotal moment came in 2007 when the company got the first clinical trial results for its treatment of a myelofibrosis. Incyte's focus then shifted into bringing the discovery to patients. In 2009, it secured a partnership with Novartis. Incyte kept the rights in the United States and Novartis got the rest of the world.\n\nIncyte reached a significant milestone in 2011 when it received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its myelofibrosis drug, Jakafi. It is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for myelofibrosis, and is first in a new class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2014, Jakafi sales were $251.5 million, up 55 percent from $162.6 million in the same period a year before. The company expects Jakafi sales for 2014 revenues to be in the $350 million to $360 million range. As of September 30, its cash or cash equivalents totaled $532.4 million.\n\nThe company expects sales of Jakafi in the United States could top $1 billion for the treatment of myelofibrosis and a related disorder.\n\n\"We're in a field where we are on the cutting edge of the science,\" Hoppenot said. \"We're on the top of that ladder of worldwide competition.\"\n\nIn addition to Novartis, the company has a partnership with Eli Lily and Company. Incyte is working on the development of medicine for another cancer related to myelofibrosis. In addition, it is working on the use of Jakafi in treating such things as pancreatic, breast and colon cancers.\n\nHoppenot, who described the field as \"very, very competitive,\" said a first-class headquarters is an important element in recruiting high-level employees. Ninety percent of Incyte's employees have college degrees and more than a third have advanced degrees, including doctorates.\n\n\"The challenge for us in the future is attracting top talent,\" he said.\n\nWhen it came time for a stand-alone headquarters, Incyte spent three years looking for a suitable location. Since many of its employees are located in Delaware and surrounding states, the company wanted to stay close its original home, said Pam Murphy, vice president of investor relations and corporate communications.\n\n\"Delaware is part of Incyte,\" Hoppenot said.\n\nThe Wanamaker building allowed the company to design an open, \"high-energy environment\" with state of the art labs, he said.\n\nSaving a landmark\n\n\n\n\n\nOther states, including Pennsylvania, were wooing the company but officials here \"worked hard to make Delaware the most attractive option for our headquarters,\" Murphy said. The state jumped in with an $11 million grant.\n\nThe 15-year lease for the John Wanamaker building was very complicated, said Capano. What's more, the renovation was the most challenging in Capano's more than 30 years in the real estate business, he said.\n\nSince Capano had never done a research building with laboratory space, which required temperature and air quality standards in compliance with the FDA, he brought in Turner Construction Co. of Philadelphia.\n\nThe approximately 190,000-square-foot building has been a landmark since the Philadelphia retailer opened the $6 million location just outside city limits in 1950. The retailer retained the Massena and du Pont architectural firm to design the store in the Moderne style.\n\nBesides the Wanamaker building, Massena and du Pont's work included the sunken gardens and Carillon bell tower at Nemours, the Alfred I. du Pont estate on Del. 141. The firm also designed the original Veterans Administration Hospital in Elsmere, Maynard said.\n\nAlfred Victor du Pont, the son of Alfred I. du Pont, one of the three cousins who created the modern DuPont Co., met Gabriel Massena in Paris in the 1920s, Maynard said.\n\nThe Wanamaker building is one of the state's rare examples of Moderne architecture, with Avondale granite and pink-buff Mansota veined marble, said W. Barksdale Maynard, author of \"Buildings of Delaware.\"\n\n\"Massena really brought first-hand with him the art deco style that originated in Paris in the late 1920s,\" Maynard has said.\n\nMany people still remember interior features of the store, including the teddy bear on a swing, the escalators and the restaurant with its view of the city skyline.\n\nCapano purchased the property in 1988 for an undisclosed price as part of a plan for the retailer to build a new store in Christiana Mall. Real estate brokers said at the time Capano had paid about $12 million. For several years, John Wanamaker leased the building back from Capano before moving to the mall.\n\nThe property got new life in 1997 and 1998, when Andersen Consulting agreed to lease the property for its management and technology consulting operations. The company, which had a 10-year contract to handle information systems support for the DuPont Co., said it was creating a global center to support the chemical industry.\n\nAndersen touted the renovation as an environment that \"inspires creativity and the formation of high-performance work teams.\" Large skylights were cut into the former department store close to where the iconic teddy bear on a swing. An oval was also cut into the floor providing a view of the lower floor at the bottom of the escalators.\n\nBut by 2008, a much smaller Andersen, renamed Accenture, moved out.\n\nMaynard, who has studied Delaware's architectural history, praised Incyte for its efforts.\n\n\"They've done a terrific thing in protecting and preserving a significant building,\" Maynard said.\n\nContact Maureen Milford at (302) 324-2881 or mmilford@dealwareonline.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nIncyte Corp.\n\nHeadquarters project cost: $35 million\n\nEmployees: 580\n\nAverage salary: $125,000", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/10/31/incyte-tops-1-billion-revenue-already-year/816645001/", "title": "Incyte tops $1 billion in revenue, partners with AstraZeneca for ...", "text": "Last year was the first time Incyte brought in more than $1 billion in revenue.

The drug in 2014 also was approved for treatment of patients diagnosed with another rare blood cancer.\n\nSales of Jakafi in 2017 accounted for more than 75 percent of all company revenues.\n\nBased largely on the success of the drug, Incyte in 2014 moved its operations into a former department store on Augustine Cut-off near Wilmington, which it had purchased for $80 million and renamed the Paul A. Friedman Building.\n\nLast month, the company also completed the construction of a four-story, 154,000-square-foot addition and a 475-space parking garage.

At the time, many analysts believed that Incyte's new cancer drug could hit the market by 2019, with Bristol-Myers only a year or two behind.\n\nYet, during the past six months, industry hopes for that family of immunotherapy cancer drugs, called IDO inhibitors, have dissipated.\n\nLast spring, Incyte shelved last-stage clinical testing of the drug after results failed to perform up to expectations. Most competitors have done the same.\n\nHurst shared the industry news with jurors, and noted that the alleged trade-secret theft did not impact Incyte's top or bottom line.\n\n\"Incyte is not arguing that they lost sales or profits, because they don’t have any,\" he said.\n\nIncyte's stock prices has dropped 44 percent during the past year, outpacing industry wide struggles, including those at Bristol-Meyers, which is down about 17 percent in the past year.\n\nStill, Incyte's revenues grew tremendously during the second quarter of 2018, up 29 percent from the same time last year. Those sales were powered by another drug, called Jakafi, the company's chief cancer treatment.\n\nBecause of rapid growth powered by sales of Jakafi, Incyte has been lauded by numerous elected officials, including Gov. John Carney, who called the company \"a real Delaware success story.\"\n\nThe spy and the sellout?\n\nThroughout his opening argument, Wood repeatedly told jurors that Flexus' founders were cheaters who did business \"the wrong way.\"\n\nHe said the \"right way\" was arduous, requiring companies to first identify, then create and then test new drugs. It takes massive amounts of investment, he said, and only about 1 percent of tested drugs ultimately are sold to patients.\n\nIncyte researchers \"did the hard work, they did the science, and they did it the right way,\" he said. \"Flexus did not do it the right way, they cheated.\"\n\nWoods pinned the cheating on Incyte's former director of pharmacology, Dr. Jordan Fridman, and a former Stanford researcher, Dr. Holbrook Kohrt.\n\nFridman left Incyte to become head of cancer research at Flexus in 2014, taking with him knowledge of chemical structures and compound half-lives.\n\nKohrt was among a community of scholarly scientists who observed the Delaware company's confidential clinical trials.\n\nEach had access to Incyte’s trade secrets, Wood said.\n\nHurst said Flexus had already made progress before Fridman and Kohrt joined the company. Its founders, Juan Jaen and Terry Rosen, have had a track record of consequential discoveries, before and after Flexus, he said.\n\n“Where you don’t want them is sitting in a courtroom in Delaware for two weeks ...standing accused falsely,” he said.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

Incyte signed a 15-year lease to occupy space in the building, a former John Wanamaker department store, in 2013.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close on April 1, 2016, according to a Securities & Exchange Commission filing.\n\nCompleted in 1950, the Wanamaker building sat vacant after the previous tenant, technology outsourcing and consulting venture Accenture, moved out in 2008. Capano spent $35 million to renovate the building last year.\n\nAs part of the sales agreement, Incyte will also assume control of the right to use the name Wanamaker Building, according to the regulatory filing.\n\nPrior to occupying the Augustine Cut-Off space, Incyte leased space in DuPont’s Experimental Station near Alapocas for about a decade.\n\nLast month, Incyte filed plans with New Castle County to construct a 154,000-square-foot, four-story office building and 473-space parking garage to be built next to the existing headquarters.\n\n“Discussions around the new building are in the exploratory stage, but if we purchase the land we are another step closer towards the potential construction of a new building,” Loveman said.\n\nThe new building construction could begin in 2016 with completion occurring within 18 to 24 months, Michael Booth, vice president for investor relations told The News Journal in July.\n\nLoveman said the company is still conducting reviewing possibilities for the potential new office building.\n\nFounded in Palo Alto, California, in 1991, Incyte focuses on genomics. In 2011, the company received its only Food and Drug Administration approval for its myelofibrosis medicine, Jakafi. The drug is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for myelofibrosis, a form of leukemia that disrupts the body’s production of normal blood cells.\n\nIncyte’s European subsidiary this month reached a development agreement with Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine, a Chinese pharmaceutical company. In a deal that could generate more than $795 million for Hengrui, Incyte will gain exclusive development and commercialization rights to the Chinese company’s compound to treat patients with advanced solid cancer tumors.\n\nIncyte will provide Henguri with an upfront payment of $25 million as well as potential milestone payments that could total $770 million, including $90 million for regulatory approval milestones, $530 million for performance milestones and $150 million for clinical milestones, according to an SEC filing.\n\nHenguri may also receive tiered royalties on net sales, which total range from the high single digits to the mid-double digits, Incyte disclosed in the filing. The company will also retain commercialization rights in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macua and Taiwan.\n\nThe News Journal reporter Xerxes Wilson contributed to this report.\n\nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ orjmordock@delawareonline.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/industries/healthcare/2013/12/11/inctyte-touts-recent-jakafi-effectiveness-studies-/3991527/", "title": "Incyte touts recent Jakafi effectiveness studies", "text": "By Cori Anne Natoli\n\nThe News Journal\n\nGrowing pharmaceutical firm Incyte Corp. is reporting positive results from a series of clinical studies of its first drug, Jakafi, which is the first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a rare blood cancer called myelofibrosis.\n\nThe results of more than 35 analyses of clinical studies of Jakafi told a story of improved overall survival for myelofibrosis patients. The news was presented by Paul A. Friedman, Incyte chief executive officer, at the 2013 American Society of Hematology 55th Annual Meeting this week in New Orleans, La.\n\n\"Myelofibrosis is a debilitating, life-threatening blood cancer with limited treatment options,\" Friedman said. \"It is, therefore, rewarding to see that the expanding body of clinical data for Jakafi shows durable reductions in spleen volume and clinically meaningful improvements in health-related quality of life measures and supports a survival benefit for patients.\"\n\nThe news continues a steady stream of meaningful results and forward steps for the small Alapocas-based pharma which occupies space in the DuPont Experimental Station.\n\nLess than a month ago, Incyte executives confirmed they signed a 15-year lease for the landmark John Wanamaker building on Augustine Cut-off outside Wilmington.

In the unanimous ruling Friday, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals also denied former Limestone County Sheriff Mike Blakely’s request for a new trial, AL.com reports. “This evidence was sufficient for the jury to have concluded that Blakely acted with intent to use his public office to obtain personal gain,” Presiding Judge Mary B. Windom wrote. Blakely was removed from office in August 2021 after a jury convicted him of theft and abuse of power. Prosecutors said the theft charge was tied to accusations that he deposited $4,000 of campaign funds into his personal account. The abuse of power charge was tied to Blakely borrowing money from a jail safe that held inmates’ money. Prosecutors said Blakely received $29,050 in interest-free loans from the safe. Blakely’s attorneys argued that no inmate was ever deprived of money. The trial judge gave him a three-year sentence. Blakely remains out on bond and can ask the Alabama Supreme Court to review the case. Blakely’s attorneys argued to the appeals court that the state failed to show sufficient evidence that he intentionally used his office for personal gain.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A reality television star and Iditarod musher was injured last week while helping to clean up storm damage along the state’s western coast. Jessie Holmes, who since 2015 has starred in “Life Below Zero,” a show about life in rural Alaska produced by National Geographic TV, was injured by falling debris in a building in the community of Golovin on Wednesday, the Anchorage Daily News reports. He was flown for treatment to Nome and then sent to an Anchorage hospital, where officials said he was treated and released. “I wanted to take a moment to let everyone know how much I appreciate all the love, support, and prayers,” Holmes wrote in a post on his kennel’s Facebook page Thursday. Parts of Alaska’s Bering Sea coast were left with severe damage beginning Sept. 16 when the remnants of Typhoon Merbok traveled north through the Bering Strait. Holmes had reached out to defending Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race champion Brent Sass and two other mushers, Jeff Deeter and Richie Beattie, to travel to hard-hit Golovin to volunteer in the cleanup effort, Sass told the Anchorage newspaper. On Wednesday, they were pulling waterlogged plywood and insulation to help them dry out, Sass said. They were standing underneath the plywood when Holmes pulled down a board, and the entire area collapsed on top of them. Holmes, who finished third in this year’s Iditarod, was trapped underneath the pile of plywood, insulation and other building materials.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: All Arizona parents now can use state tax money to send their children to private or religious schools or pay home-schooling costs after an effort by public school advocates to block a massive expansion of the state’s private school voucher law failed to collect enough signatures to block it. Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs announced Friday that her office’s review of signatures turned in a week ago to refer the expansion to the ballot came up short of the nearly 119,000 that were needed. Hobbs is a Democrat running for governor who opposed the plan. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey championed the plan and signed it into law in July. He celebrated on Twitter, saying “Let’s Roll!” and “Parents Prevail.” Arizona now has the nation’s most expansive private school voucher law. It allows parents of the state’s more than 1.2 million school-age children to get 90% of the state money that would normally go to their local public schools and use it for private or other school costs. That’s typically about $7,000 per student. The effort to block the expansion passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature over Democratic opposition was organized by Save Our Schools Arizona, a grassroots group of teachers, parents and public education advocates who blocked a similar expansion in 2017. Voters then overwhelmingly rejected the law in the 2018 election.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Voters will decide next month whether recreational marijuana will be legal in the state. Issue 4, to legalize cannabis for residents 21 and older, will be on the Nov. 8 ballots. And the votes will count, the state’s high court has ruled. The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the petition submitted by Responsible Growth Arkansas is sufficient. “Accordingly, we grant the petition and order the Secretary of State to certify the proposed amendment for inclusion on the Nov. 8 general election ballot,” the court said in its opinion. Steve Lancaster, an attorney for Responsible Growth Arkansas, the group that gathered the petition signatures, said he learned of the ruling late Thursday afternoon. “It was a surprise to all of us,” Lancaster said. About 193,000 signature were submitted – over 100,000 signatures more than required to make the ballot. “We were well above what we needed,” Lancaster said. “The result is what we expected from the very beginning. We put a lot of work into a good ballot title, and the court agreed this is good to go to let the voters in Arkansas make their own decision on this. And we’re very grateful to the court for giving the people the right to make this decision.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced that oil refineries could start selling more polluting winter-blend gasoline ahead of schedule to ease soaring fuel prices, directly contradicting his own goals for reducing climate emissions. The average cost of a gallon of gas was $6.30 in California on Friday, far above the national average of $3.80, according to AAA. Newsom administration officials said the difference between state prices and the national average has never been larger. The Democratic governor also called on state lawmakers to pass a new tax on oil company profits and return the money to California taxpayers. Lawmakers don’t return to the Capitol until January, and Newsom’s office provided few details on the proposal. “They’re ripping you off,” he said of the oil industry in a video posted to Twitter. Oil industry representatives said it is state regulations that cause higher prices in California than the rest of the country. The summer blend of gasoline that refineries are required by law to produce in the hotter months costs more money to make but is designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions and smog during summer months. Most refineries can’t switch to the winter blend until November.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: When people who had been homeless for years moved off the city’s streets and into apartments, they were far less likely to end up in hospital emergency rooms or get locked up in jail. But they still died at the same rate as those who lived outside, the Colorado Sun reports. That’s the grim finding from a new study of Denver’s social impact bond program, which sends outreach workers to find the highest users of taxpayer-funded services including hospitals, detox centers and the jail. Hundreds of people who were chronically homeless have been housed through the program, which began seven years ago. Previous research showed that the first 250 participants had cost the government a total of $7.3 million per year when they lived outside and in shelters and cycled through the health care and criminal justice systems. After they were housed, researchers found a 40% reduction in arrests, a 30% reduction in jail stays, a 65% decrease in detox services and a 40% drop in emergency department visits. The reductions made up for half of the cost of the program, which was started with $8.6 million from eight private investors as well as local housing resources. The researchers, from the Urban Institute based in Washington, D.C., noticed high levels of mortality among those who were living in supportive housing. A second study confirmed the death rate among those in apartments was the same as those living outside.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision earlier this year, gun rights groups and firearms owners have launched another attempt to overturn the state’s ban on certain semi-automatic rifles that was enacted in response to the Sandy Hook School shooting. A new lawsuit was filed Thursday in federal court by three gun owners, the Connecticut Citizens Defense League and the Second Amendment Foundation seeking to overturn the state prohibition on what they call “modern sporting arms” such as AR-15-style rifles like the one used to kill 20 first graders and six educators at the Newtown school in 2012. “We all deserve to live in safe communities, but denying ownership of the most commonly owned firearms in the country is not the way to achieve it,” Holly Sullivan, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, said in a statement. “The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision … has opened the door to this challenge, and we believe Connecticut will be hard pressed to prove its statutes are constitutional.” State officials vowed to defend the 2013 gun laws. “Connecticut’s gun laws save lives, and we are not going back,” state Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “We will not allow weapons of war back into our schools, our houses of worship, our grocery stores, and our communities.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Perfect attendance isn’t just for bragging rights anymore – for one University of Delaware student, it’s going to mean money, too. This year the University of Delaware athletics department has unveiled the Cockpit HENergy Challenge, a high-stakes contest to incentivize football game attendance. At the end of the season, one UD student who attended all six home football games will be randomly chosen to win $10,000 in financial aid. “Student engagement is really important to us, and it’s important to the program, in terms of the support and stance and making that atmosphere on game day feel really positive, not just for the team but for the students as well,” said Nick LaMarca, who oversees marketing and engagement for the UD athletics department. LaMarca said the department chose to give out financial aid as the prize after “thinking about what’s important to the students.” He said the money comes from the athletics department specifically, not the university overall. To win the competition, UD students must scan their student football tickets before halftime at every home game. Students who participate in the games – including players, marching band members and people in the UD spirit program – are not eligible.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two bills introduced in Congress on Thursday aim to begin the process of creating a national museum for American LGBTQ+ history and culture in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., a co-chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, introduced the pair of bills ahead of the nation preparing to celebrate LGBTQ+ History Month in October. “As our community faces unprecedented attacks and attempts to erase our history, we must preserve and protect our stories for future generations,” Pocan said. The bills would establish an eight-member commission to study the potential creation of the national museum and to establish it within the Smithsonian Institution. The bills would be required to be signed into law to become the newest Smithsonian. Pocan said it is vital to remember the nation’s collective past, especially as certain states seek to constrain and repeal existing rights by passing bills that are harmful to LGBTQ+ youth and the community as a whole. During the process, the developed commission would look into the success of the potential Smithsonian museum by creating a plan of action for the establishment, proposing a fundraising path, identifying potential locations within the District to house the facility and more.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Photos and videos of sharks and other marine life swimming in suburban floodwaters make for popular hoaxes during massive storms. But a cellphone video filmed during Hurricane Ian’s assault on southwest Florida isn’t just another fish story. The eye-popping video, which showed a large, dark fish with sharp dorsal fins thrashing around an inundated Fort Myers backyard, racked up more than 12 million views on Twitter within a day, as users responded with disbelief and comparisons to the “Sharknado” film series. Dominic Cameratta, a local real estate developer, confirmed he filmed the clip from his back patio Wednesday morning when he saw something “flopping around” in his neighbor’s flooded yard. “I didn’t know what it was – it just looked like a fish or something,” he said. “I zoomed in, and all my friends are like, ‘It’s like a shark, man!’ ” He guessed the fish was about 4 feet long. Experts were of mixed opinion on whether the clip showed a shark or another large fish, likely a swordfish. George Burgess, former director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark program, said in an email that it “appears to be a juvenile shark,” while Dr. Neil Hammerschlag, director of the University of Miami’s shark conservation program, wrote that “it’s pretty hard to tell.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Friday found that Georgia election practices challenged by a group associated with Democrat Stacey Abrams do not violate the constitutional rights of voters, ruling in favor of the state on all remaining issues in a lawsuit filed nearly four years ago. “Although Georgia’s election system is not perfect, the challenged practices violate neither the constitution nor the VRA,” U.S. District Judge Steve Jones in Atlanta wrote, referring to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He detailed his reasoning in a 288-page order. The lawsuit was filed in November 2018, just weeks after Abrams narrowly lost the governor’s race to Republican Brian Kemp. Throughout that contest, Abrams had accused Kemp, then secretary of state, of using his position as the state’s top elections official to promote voter suppression. Kemp vehemently denied the allegations. Kemp on Friday applauded the ruling, calling it a loss for Abrams. “Judge Jones’ ruling exposes this legal effort for what it really is: a tool wielded by a politician hoping to wrongfully weaponize the legal system to further her own political goals,” Kemp said in a statement. Abrams and Fair Fight expressed disappointment in the decision but said the lawsuit helped bring about positive change in Georgia.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin visited the state last week amid lingering community frustration and distrust after jet fuel from a military storage facility last year spilled into Pearl Harbor’s drinking water, poisoned thousands of military families and threatened the purity of Honolulu’s water supply. Austin traveled to the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in the hills above Pearl Harbor on Friday and met the commander of the joint task force in charge of draining its tanks so it can be shut down. He also met with several families affected by the fuel spill and Hawaii state officials, the military said in a news release. The meetings were closed to the media, and Austin didn’t hold a news conference afterward. Outside Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, several dozen protesters held signs saying “Navy Lies” and “Shut Down Red Hill.” People driving by – including many exiting the base – honked in support. Samantha McCoy, whose husband is in the Air Force, said her family suffered migraines, rashes, skin sores and gastrointestinal problems that only subsided when they moved out of military housing last month. She called on Austin to make more medical care available to families. “It took four months of daily migraines to even get a referral to a neurologist. And that’s really unacceptable,” she said at the protest.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: A box truck equipped with a bright LED billboard began circling around the University of Idaho campus Friday. “Pregnant? You still have a choice,” said one of the bright blue-and-white messages flashing across the side. “You can still get abortion pills by mail,” read another message. The moving billboard was a salvo by Mayday Health against Idaho’s anti-abortion laws, including some that prohibit state employees from promoting or endorsing abortion or emergency contraception. The organization seeks to inform people in anti-abortion states how to access abortion and contraception. Mayday Health chose Moscow for the action after the university warned employees not to refer students to abortion or birth control providers lest they run afoul of the state laws. “This effort is part of protecting free speech and the First Amendment,” said Kaori Sueyoshi, Mayday Health ‘s head of strategy. “We want to make sure that students at the University of Idaho and surrounding area have accurate information about how to get birth control pills, Plan B (emergency contraception) as well as how to get safe abortion access.” University of Idaho Provost Torrey Lawrence said the legal guidance simply was intended to protect staffers. Boise State University recently issued similar, albeit less strict, advice.\n\nIllinois\n\nZion: Millions of Ahmadi Muslims around the world believe holy miracle happened in Zion 115 years ago. The Ahmadis view this small city, 40 miles north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan, as a place of special religious significance for their global messianic faith. Their reverence for the community began more than a century ago – with fighting words, a prayer duel and a prophecy. Zion was founded in 1900 as a Christian theocracy by John Alexander Dowie, an evangelical and early Pentecostal preacher who drew thousands to the city with his faith healing ministry. The Ahmadis believe their founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, defended the faith from Dowie’s verbal attacks against Islam and defeated him in a sensational faceoff armed only with prayers. Most current residents may not have an inkling of that high-stakes holy fight of a bygone era. But for the Ahmadis, it is one that has created an eternal bond with the city of Zion. Over the weekend, thousands of Ahmadi Muslims from around the world congregated in the city to celebrate that century-old miracle and a significant milestone in the life of Zion and of their faith: the building of the city’s first mosque.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: All tax rebate payments from the state’s budget surplus have been printed and mailed, Indiana State Auditor Tera Klutz said. “We successfully completed printing on September 21 and sent the last batch of automatic taxpayer refund checks to the postal service on September 22,” Klutz said in a statement Thursday. “Most Hoosiers who filed a 2020 tax return in 2021 should have received their automatic taxpayer refund via direct deposit or mailed check by now.” More than 1.5 million checks with the $125 refund were mailed, Klutz’s office said. Eligible Hoosiers will also receive additional payments for $200 for individuals or $400 for couples filing jointly. The Indiana Department of Revenue noted that the eligibility requirements for the two refunds are different. Although all who were eligible for the initial $125 payment qualify for the subsequent $200 refund, some who were not eligible for the first do qualify for the second. Direct deposit payments for the first round of rebates were sent starting in May.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly two years after a federal policy required the nation’s hospitals to unveil the hidden costs of medical care, a tiny fraction of Iowa facilities are in compliance, according to a new report. And patients are paying the price. Only six of the state’s 61 hospitals in Iowa reviewed by researchers – 10% – have complied with the federal rule intended to bring more transparency to health care costs, according to the audit by PatientRightsAdvocate.org published in August. Iowa’s compliance rate is even worse than the national rate. The audit of 2,000 hospitals nationwide found that 319 hospitals, or 16%, complied with the rule. Noncompliant hospitals ranged from small, independent hospitals to some of the largest health care systems in the country, according to PatientRightsAdvocate.org. Iowa health care officials contend their noncompliance is not for lack of trying. Hospitals face significant barriers to publishing the massive amounts of data required under the federal rule, they say. “If you don’t have the knowledge, tools, resources or financial availability to get it done, I’m sure hospitals are not compliant for those reasons,” said Heather Vandewater, business office and patient access director for Mary Greeley Medical Center in Ames.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Three months after the National Park Service announced James Williams as the new superintendent of Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Park, the site opened its doors Friday in celebration of the 30th anniversary of its designation. The symposium at the Brown v. Board of Education site also welcomed leaders from five new affiliated areas and an additional National Park Service site. “It’s just interesting to me to get to know the people, get to know their stories, and see the potential for us as an agency to help the American people understand the complexity of the Brown decision and all the history that went into it,” Williams said. Last week’s symposium is historic because it brought together – for the first time – people from each of the sites that are part of Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park, said Sean Dixon, president of Visit Topeka. He noted that President Joe Biden last May signed the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park Expansion and Redesignation Act. That act continues federal government efforts to recognize the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, which banned racial segregation in schools in 1954.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: An advisory committee set up this year by Gov. Andy Beshear reported that many Kentucky adults favor legalizing medical marijuana, Beshear’s office said Friday. The Democratic governor formed the Medical Cannabis Advisory Committee after a bill to legalize medical marijuana died in the state Senate this year. The committee found that Kentuckians who suffer from chronic conditions are not getting relief from painkillers and opioids and fear their addictive properties, Beshear said. The committee also reported that residents are crossing state lines to obtain medical cannabis where it is legal and want to return to Kentucky without breaking the law. The panel found that military veterans from Kentucky reported that cannabis use eased post-traumatic stress disorder, Beshear’s office said in a news release. Justice and Public Safety Secretary Kerry Harvey, the committee co-chair, said the panel did not hear any opposition at town hall meetings on the topic. “Everyone who spoke supported legalizing medical cannabis in Kentucky,” Harvey said. “We heard from many Kentuckians that use cannabis for its beneficial medical effects but can only do so by breaking the law as it now exists.” Beshear said he is considering the information while he decides what steps to take next to legalize medical marijuana, which he supports.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Rule No. 1 for this week’s animal blessing at a Catholic university: “Please leave venomous animals at home.” Rule No. 2: Be prepared to clean up after your pet. “We will provide a pet station with complimentary water and waste bags,” said a news release Thursday. The group blessing of the animals – all comers welcome – will be the first since 1999 at Loyola University New Orleans. The Rev. Justin Daffron, Loyola’s interim president, and Parleaux, a black cockapoo he trained as the university’s therapy dog, will attend, university spokeswoman Patricia Murret said Thursday. The service is scheduled for Tuesday evening on the lawn next to the university’s church. Oct. 4 is the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi, patron saint of animals, ecology, merchants and Italy. Churches and schools from the East Coast to the West Coast hold Blessing of the Animals services. Murret said they were popular at Loyola during the 1990s but apparently fell by the wayside for the next two decades. She doesn’t know why. She said someone suggested resuming the tradition at a late August or early September meeting “about alumni events, bringing people together, reconnecting in this post-pandemic world as we return to life and joy and connections with each other.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state housing authority has halted new applications for emergency rental assistance while it waits to find out if a request for more federal money will be approved. MaineHousing said in a statement that an “unanticipated uptick in demand” and uncertainty about new revenue prompted the decision to pause applications. The program started in March 2021 and stopped taking applications at the end of the day Thursday. The housing authority described the program as a temporary support that is funded via federal money through COVID-19 relief laws. The authority said the pause will allow more than 11,000 pending requests to be processed. The program has helped more than 33,000 households and spent more than $275 million, MaineHousing officials said. The program is mostly used to pay rent directly to landlords. MaineHousing spokesperson Scott Thistle said the pause in applications “a fiscally responsible and reasonable move that will allow us to ensure all who have already applied to this program get a fair opportunity to receive help.” Dozens of other states have paused or ended similar programs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Aging infrastructure contributed to an E. coli contamination of the city of Baltimore’s water system in early September, officials said last week. A confluence of events in several parts of the water system reduced chlorine levels, which led to three positive tests for E. coli, a Department of Public Works official told The Washington Post. City officials also detailed their findings during a City Council hearing Thursday. The contamination led to a boil-water advisory for a wide swath of the city and into Baltimore County, which is served by the city system, The Baltimore Sun reports. No illnesses were linked to the contaminated water, a city spokeswoman said Friday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A former tenant charged with setting a fire at an apartment building that claimed the lives of four people pleaded not guilty at her arraignment Friday and was held without bail. Yvonne Ngoiri, 36, faces four counts of second-degree murder as well as arson and assault charges in connection with the May 14 blaze in Worcester. Among the victims was a man who in 2018 had sued right-wing radio host Alex Jones’ Infowars website. Ngoiri, who once lived in the building, was taken into custody Thursday, the office of Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said in a statement. The cause of the early-morning fire at the three-story, six-unit building was determined to be “incendiary,” according to the district attorney’s office, but no motive was disclosed in court. Ngoiri is scheduled back in court Nov. 29. The victims have previously been identified as Joseph Garchali, 47; Christopher Lozeau, 53; Vincent Page, 41; and Marcel Fontaine, 29. In addition, several residents were injured, including one who jumped from a third-story window and two who suffered from smoke inhalation. The building had about 20 tenants. Two nearby buildings were also damaged. Fontaine sued Infowars in 2018, saying it posted his photograph on its website the day of a mass school shooting in Parkland, Florida, depicting him as the gunman.\n\nMichigan\n\nOdessa Township: A homeowner has been charged with shooting and wounding an 84-year-old woman who was canvassing door-to-door against a proposed constitutional amendment that would guarantee the right to abortion in the state. Richard Harvey was charged Friday on charges of felonious assault and reckless discharge of a firearm causing injury charges, Ionia County Prosecutor Kyle Butler said in a statement. Harvey surrendered to authorities Friday morning and was being held in the county jail. The State Police investigated the Sept. 20 shooting at Harvey’s home in Odessa Township and submitted charging recommendations to the prosecutor’s office, Butler said. The canvasser, Joan Jacobson, told investigators she was asking a woman at the home to vote against Proposal 3 in November when she was told to leave. Jacobson told The Detroit News that she was headed to her car when she “heard a shot” and “felt some pain.” Jacobson said she then drove to a local police station and was later treated at a hospital. Harvey, 74, told WOOD-TV he shot Jacobson accidentally while she was arguing with his wife, and he told Jacobson numerous times to leave their property. Harvey said he fired a warning shot at a tree, and the woman continued “ranting and raving” and waving a clipboard.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Mayor Jacob Frey said Thursday that he is nominating a former public safety director from New Jersey as his top pick for the city’s next police chief, at a time when the department is struggling with depleted staffing and the uncertainty of an ongoing federal investigation following the killing of George Floyd. If confirmed by the City Council, Brian O’Hara, deputy mayor of Newark, would be taking over a department that some city leaders and community members had sought to abolish in recent years, and he would lead the agency through court-ordered changes that are expected as the result of the U.S. Department of Justice’s ongoing probe into policing practices. “What we heard loud and clear is that people wanted a changemaker,” Frey said. “They wanted a reform-minded candidate that would both be accountable to the city of Minneapolis and our residents and also able to drive down crime in a serious way. … Minneapolis has been asking for change, and Brian O’Hara, the deputy mayor, is answering that call.” O’Hara said Thursday that he will work toward driving down gun violence, building up ranks in the police department, and working with the community “to heal the heart of this great city,” and he plans to build a department so good that people of all races and backgrounds will want to be part of it.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The University of Mississippi is paying tribute to 89-year-old James Meredith 60 years after white protesters erupted into violence as he became the first Black student to enroll in what was then a bastion of Deep South segregation. Meredith was honored Saturday during the Ole Miss-Kentucky football game, receiving a framed Ole Miss jersey with the number 62 – for 1962, the year he integrated the university. The ceremony happened two days after he attended the Rebels’ practice to speak to players. “He came and revolutionized our thinking. He came to open our closed society,” Donald Cole, who retired in 2018 as the university’s assistant provost and head of multicultural affairs, said during a celebration Wednesday night. The enigmatic Meredith, who lives in Jackson, has long resisted the label of “civil rights leader,” as if civil rights are separate from other human rights. He has said his effort to enter Ole Miss was his own battle to conquer white supremacy. Meredith’s being honored at the Ole Miss-Kentucky game was an ironic echo of history. Two days before he enrolled on the Oxford campus in 1962, race-baiting Gov. Ross Barnett worked a white crowd into a frenzy at a football stadium in Jackson. Ole Miss fans waved Confederate flags to support their Rebels over the Kentucky Wildcats and to defy any move toward racial integration.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Lawmakers on Thursday gave final approval to an income tax cut that Gov. Mike Parson requested and ditched a last-minute proposal to cut corporate taxes. The Republican-led Missouri House voted 98-32 in favor of the bill, which would cut income taxes from 5.3% to 4.95% beginning next year and phase in additional cuts until the rate hits 4.5%. The bill applies to the top income tax rate, which covers those who make more than about $8,700 a year in taxable income. The additional cuts would be triggered by revenue growth benchmarks tied to inflation. The roughly $1 billion measure also eliminates the lowest tax bracket, meaning earners who bring in less than about $1,000 a year no longer will have to pay state income taxes. The measure now heads to Parson, who is expected to sign it. The Republican governor called lawmakers back to work to spend some of the state’s record revenue surplus on tax cuts. “We are thrilled that the General Assembly has answered our call to cut Missourians’ taxes and return some of their hard-earned dollars,” he said in a statement. If Parson signs the bill into law, taxpayers who make between $22,000 and $66,000 a year would on average see savings of $10 to $50 next year because of the income tax cut, according to an analysis by the Missouri Budget Project.\n\nMontana\n\nBridger: An evacuation warning was put in place for residents near the town after a train derailed, and two fuel cars ruptured and leaked an estimated 31,000 gallons of gasoline, authorities said Saturday. BNSF Railway Co. said there were no injuries, and crews were working with local officials and hazardous-materials responders to safely clear the site. The derailment of the southbound train occurred on a curving portion of the track about half a mile east of the small south-central Montana town of Bridger, population of about 660, about 45 miles southwest of Billings. “Two of the derailed cars were compromised and leaked gasoline,” BNSF spokesman Ben Wilemon said in an email to the Associated Press. “The cause of the derailment is under investigation.” A 30,000-gallon tank emptied completely, and a second damaged tank leaked about 1,000 gallons before BNSF workers repaired the tank, The Billings Gazette reports. There was no immediate information on whether the spill contaminated groundwater or the area’s irrigation systems. Authorities said about 15 cars derailed not long after midnight. Four of the derailed cars contained petroleum. Officials said the train was also moving coal, sorghum and particle board. The tracks in that area in some portions run near the meandering Clark’s Fork of the Yellowstone River.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A passenger’s cellphone automatically alerted responders after a car hit a tree early Sunday in a crash that killed all six of its young occupants, authorities said. Five men in the car died at the scene of the crash about 2:15 a.m. in Lincoln, about 3 miles east of the state Capitol, police said. A 24-year-old woman died later at a hospital where she was taken in critical condition. The five men who died included the 22-year-old driver. The other victims were one 21-year-old, one 23-year-old and two 22-year-olds. Police did not release any details on what caused the crash but said it was reported by an iPhone that detected the impact and called responders automatically when the phone’s owner didn’t respond.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Thousands of people in hundreds of cars took over northern Nevada parking lots and intersections Friday night and into Saturday, performing stunts in souped-up vehicles and leading to crashes and arrests, police said. Police beefed up nighttime staffing after social media posts urged people from San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, to come to the “sideshow” in Reno, Police Lt. Michael Browett said. The disturbances started late Friday as several hundred cars and their occupants met in the parking lot of a still-open Walmart store. Police tried to break up the crowds, and drivers sped off, meeting up again at several intersections and industrial parks into Saturday morning. A dozen people were arrested, 14 cars impounded and 33 people issued citations. Browett said Reno is just the latest city to see late-night takeovers by auto enthusiasts who ignore law enforcement efforts to stop the illegal and dangerous activity. “I don’t know what the underlying movement is with this group, but it goes a little beyond cars,” Browett said. “They’re very anti-authoritarian, and they basically just show up and do whatever they want.” In Reno, no one was seriously injured. But Browett said those arrested face charges including reckless driving, hit and run causing injury and weapons possession.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNashua: Investigators are trying to determine the cause of a fire that heavily damaged a strip mall, the fire department said in a Saturday news release. The fire in the building on Amherst Street that contained a number of businesses was reported about 7:30 p.m. Friday. People who were inside a pizza shop and an Asian market left the building before firefighters arrived. The fire was brought under control in about an hour. There were no injuries. The Nashua Fire Department says the structure was left unusable by the fire. The City of Nashua Fire Marshal’s office is trying to determine the cause of the fire.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The Democrat-led state Senate on Thursday confirmed Gov. Phil Murphy’s former chief counsel to be New Jersey’s attorney general. Attorney General Matt Platkin had been serving as the state’s acting top law enforcement official since earlier this year when Murphy nominated him. “I pledge to continue to work tirelessly to end the scourge of gun violence, to strengthen trust between law enforcement and the broader public, and to protect the rights of our residents,” he said. Platkin, 35, served as the Murphy administration’s top attorney overseeing pending bills and executive orders for the Democratic governor from the start of the administration in early 2018 until late 2020. He left to take a post at the firm Lowenstein Sandler where he handled white-collar cases and business disputes. Platkin was a fixture during Murphy’s regular news conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic and regularly fielded questions related to executive orders aimed at curbing the effects of the virus. He was also a lead negotiator for the governor for three annual budget bills and oversaw the vast appointment and nominations apparatus in the governor’s office. New Jersey’s governor is among the most powerful in the country because the state constitution provides for the executive to appoint many offices in the state.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons lifted off Saturday morning, marking the start of an annual fiesta that has drawn pilots and spectators from across the globe to the high desert for 50 years. As one of the most photographed events in the world, the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta has become an economic driver for the state’s largest city and a rare – and colorful – opportunity for enthusiasts to be within arm’s reach as the giant balloons are unpacked and inflated. Three of the original pilots who participated in the first fiesta in 1972 and the family members of others are among this year’s attendees. That first year, 13 balloons launched from an open lot near a shopping center on what was then the edge of Albuquerque. It has since grown into a multimillion-dollar production. Pilot Gene Dennis, 78, remembers the snowstorm that almost caused him to miss the 1972 fiesta. He had to rearrange his flight plans from Michigan so he could make it to Albuquerque in time. The weather was perfect when he got to New Mexico, said Dennis, who flew under the alias “Captain Phairweather.” He was quoted at the time as saying he had brought good weather with him. He was on the hook again, as pilots hope predictions for the rest of opening weekend are fair. “Ballooning is infectious,” Dennis said, describing being aloft like drifting in a dream, quietly observing the countryside below.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Struggling taxi drivers have gotten $225 million in debt relief over the past two weeks, but thousands more loans have yet to be refinanced after a cabbie debt crisis, officials and advocates said Friday as the relief program deadline was extended. Over 1,000 loans have been refinanced in the first two weeks of the program. It was announced in August after drivers appealed for years for help with a crippling economic crunch surrounding the city’s famous yellow cabs. “Every time we raised our hands to hail a cab at a curb, they responded. Now it’s time for us to stand with them, and that’s what we’ve done,” Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, said at a news conference where scores of drivers lined the steps of City Hall. Still, the major lender participating in the program, Marblegate Asset Management, said it had yet to hear from the borrowers of roughly 2,000 eligible loans. An estimated 850 loans handled by other lenders haven’t been addressed, according to Bhairavi Desai of the Taxi Workers Alliance, a drivers’ union. Officials urged drivers with Marblegate loans to inquire by the program deadline – now extended by a week, to next Friday – and encouraged other lenders to participate.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: One week before election officials begin processing by-mail ballots in the closely watched Southern swing state, the GOP is pursuing its latest legal challenge to the electoral procedures established by the Democrat-led State Board of Elections. The North Carolina Republican Party filed two motions in Wake County Superior Court last week, asking the court to block the board from enforcing its prohibition of county election officials scrutinizing signatures on absentee voting documents. The legal challenge follows the state board’s July rejection of a Republican Party request to authorize county officials to compare signatures on absentee ballot request forms and container envelopes with the signatures included in voter registration records. Citing concerns that the proposal would create unequal voting access, the board denied the request in a 3-2 party-line vote, with three Democrats voting against signature checks and two Republicans voting in favor. “Why the Board of Elections continues to undermine the integrity of our elections is inexplicable,” North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley said. “The NCGOP is pursuing this lawsuit to ensure our elections remain secure and free from doubt.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMcHenry: A man accused in the fatal hit-and-run of a teenager after a small-town street dance is now charged with murder, after prosecutors say he intentionally ran over the 18-year-old, according to upgraded charges made public Friday. Shannon Brandt, 41, was initially charged with criminal vehicular homicide in the Sept. 18 killing of Cayler Ellingson, but that charge has been dropped. The new charge – murder with a dangerous weapon – is a felony that carries a maximum sentence of life in prison upon conviction. Brandt is also charged with leaving the scene of a crash that resulted in death. According to a probable cause affidavit released Friday, Brandt told a 911 dispatcher that if it had been a total accident, he wouldn’t be so scared, “but I know it was more than that.” Brandt initially told authorities that there had been a political argument and that Ellingson was part of a “Republican extremist group.” Many conservatives took to social media to decry the alleged motive in Ellingson’s death. But investigators have said that the case was not political in nature and that there is no evidence to support Brandt’s claim that Ellingson was a Republican extremist. Brandt’s attorney, Mark Friese, said Friday that he would not comment yet because the Ellingson family is grieving, the community is in mourning, and he hasn’t received all of the case background.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Medical marijuana patients are happier with the state’s program than they once were, but they continue to face high prices and a shortage of doctors who can recommend cannabis, according to a new study. The report from Ohio State University’s Drug Enforcement and Policy Center found more than half of survey respondents reported some level of satisfaction with the medical cannabis program, including 15.3% who were “extremely satisfied.” About 35% of people were dissatisfied with the program, an improvement from 55% last year. The center conducted its survey in April and March and received more than 2,500 responses. The high cost of medical marijuana in Ohio is the biggest problem, according to patients. While the price of plant product in the state declined 17% during the past year, costs in neighboring Michigan dropped even further, making a trip out of state more appealing than buying from an Ohio dispensary. During a 13-month period, an Ohio patient on average paid $4.08 more per gram than someone in Michigan. “They see a huge price difference between Michigan and Ohio, and I think that’s one of the things that might be driving dissatisfaction,” said Jana Hrdinova, the study’s author and administrative director of the Drug Enforcement and Policy Center.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A teenager was killed and another wounded in a shooting at a high school homecoming football game Friday night, police said. The victims, both 17, were shot during the event at McLain High School for Science and Technology shortly before 10 p.m., according to a statement by the Tulsa Police Department posted on Twitter and Facebook. “When Officers arrived, we found two victims amongst the crowd of hundreds. One 17-year-old male was pronounced dead at the scene,” the post said. The surviving victim was taken to a hospital in critical condition but has improved to stable condition, the statement said. Several officers and a K-9 unit searched nearby neighborhoods but were not immediately able to find the suspected shooter, who ran away from the scene, police said. Police said the suspect is believed to be another 17-year-old.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: State environmental regulators have issued a $2.7 million fine to an electric charging company over accusations it sold fraudulent credits through the agency’s clean fuels program. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality said Friday that it discovered Thompson Technical Services, or TTS Charging, sold more than $2 million in fraudulent credits, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. The program, implemented in 2016, is designed to help the state reduce its greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector by 37% by 2035. It provides credits as incentives to companies that produce transportation fuels like electricity or biofuels. Those companies can then sell credits to other companies in order for them to comply with state emissions rules. According to DEQ, TTS Charging falsely claimed more than 16,000 in credits in June, alleging it dispensed nearly 15 million kilowatt hours of electricity from three vehicle charging stations. “They hadn’t dispensed any electricity; they hadn’t even set up the charging stations,” said Harry Esteve, a spokesperson for the agency. The company then sold the credits for nearly $1.8 million to oil and natural gas transportation company, Elbow River Marketing, based in Canada. The state agency has revoked TTS Charging’s account with the clean fuels program.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Max Baer, the chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, has died only months before he was set to retire, the court confirmed Saturday. He was 74. Baer died overnight at his home near Pittsburgh, the court said in a news release. The court didn’t give a reason for his death but called his “sudden passing” a “tremendous loss for the court and all of Pennsylvania.” The court said Justice Debra Todd now becomes chief justice “as the justice of longest and continuous service on the court.” She is the first female chief justice in the commonwealth’s history, a court spokesperson confirmed. “Chief Justice Baer was an influential and intellectual jurist whose unwavering focus was on administering fair and balanced justice,” Todd said in the release. “He was a tireless champion for children, devoted to protecting and providing for our youngest and most vulnerable citizens.” Gov. Tom Wolf ordered state flags at commonwealth facilities, public buildings and grounds lowered to half-staff, saying he was “extremely saddened” by the death of such a “respected and esteemed jurist with decades of service to our courts and our commonwealth.” Baer, a Duquesne Law graduate, was an Allegheny County family court judge and an administrative judge in family court before he was elected to the high court in 2003 and became its chief justice last year. Baer also served as deputy attorney general for Pennsylvania from 1975 to 1980 and was in private practice before entering the judiciary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The most closely guarded secret entrusted to the governor may be knowing what happens on the NBC singing competition “The Voice.” For several weeks, it was rumored that Gov. Dan McKee’s daughter, Kara McKee, was lined up for an on-screen audition for the show, which airs on Monday and Tuesday nights. Last week, the governor’s office confirmed that she would be on the show but declined to say more. The Democrat sidestepped direct questions about how well his daughter fares to talk about how wonderful she is. “We’re very proud of our family, and Kara in particular right now – she’s taken over from my mom ... in terms of being the star of the family,” he said. “We’re very proud of Kara and her move to spend the time on a music career that she’s left the corporate world to pursue.” McKee’s 94-year-old mother, Willa McKee, who moved back in with her son’s family, stars in a popular campaign ad whose punchline says that her son isn’t doing too bad “for a governor that lives with his mother.” His daughter, 37, most recently worked in digital operations for TJX, the corporate parent of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods. Why won’t the proud papa talk about how she does on the competition? “We signed all these agreements,” he said, referring to nondisclosure agreements.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Gov. Henry McMaster has temporarily suspended campaign activities as he leads the state’s response to Hurricane Ian. McMaster’s campaign said the Republican incumbent canceled a fundraiser scheduled for Friday night in Clemson, as well as an appearance for tailgating before the Clemson Tigers’ football game Saturday. McMaster had been talking with officials across the state and holding daily briefings last week as the state made preparations for the storm, which ravaged Florida and barreled onward to South Carolina’s coast. Politics and hurricanes often collide in the state, where the final months before the November general elections can turn into busy storm seasons. In 2018, both McMaster and his Democratic opponent, then-Rep. James Smith, pulled down their campaign events as Hurricane Florence approached the state. Smith, who was a major in the South Carolina National Guard, was activated during that storm response, tasked with coordinating the distribution of resources across the state.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem indicated Friday during her reelection campaign’s lone debate with her Democratic challenger, state lawmaker Jamie Smith, that if reelected she will uphold the state’s abortion ban that provides no exceptions for rape or incest. The Republican governor explained her position simply as “pro-life,” while pledging to push for expanded parental leave in the state and alleviate the toll of inflation on people’s budgets. Smith called Noem’s stance extreme and said it was endangering women’s lives and causing concern among physicians for its lack of clarity on when an abortion is allowed – only to save the life of a pregnant woman. “It’s clear to me that South Dakotans overwhelmingly support a woman’s right to an abortion,” Smith said. “We talk about freedom all the time, except the freedom to make this choice.” The gubernatorial race’s lone head-to-head meeting of the two candidates featured Noem touting her record of a hands-off approach to the COVID-19 pandemic. Smith, who is facing an uphill election in the heavily Republican state, cast himself as a moderate. He was quick to point out that the grocery-tax repeal Noem suddenly embraced last week was an initiative he has been pushing for years, and when the state House passed the proposal in March, support from Noem was lacking.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Problems with rape kit evidence testing keep haunting Memphis. A city long plagued by a heavy backlog of untested sexual assault kits was shaken by Cleotha Henderson’s arrest in the killing of Eliza Fletcher after she was abducted during a morning jog last month. So when authorities said his DNA was linked to a rape that occurred nearly a year earlier – charging him separately days after he was arrested in Fletcher’s killing – an outraged city turned to the obvious question: Why was he still on the streets? The case of Henderson, who already has served 20 years in prison for a kidnapping he committed at 16, has reignited criticism of Tennessee’s sexual assault testing process. That has included calls for shorter delays from the testing agency, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and questions about why Memphis didn’t seek to fast-track a kit that could have been tested in days. Instead, it took nearly a year, unearthing key evidence too late to charge Henderson before Fletcher’s killing. The tragic outcome brings back memories from the early 2010s, when Memphis revealed a backlog of about 12,000 untested rape kits that took years to whittle down and led to a lawsuit that’s still ongoing. The new rape charges have spurred another lawsuit accusing the Memphis Police Department of negligence for the delay.\n\nTexas\n\nConroe: A deeply divided federal appeals court has ruled that a Texas judge may start the day with prayer, overturning a district court decision. Judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans split 2-1 in opinions handed down Thursday, reversing a ruling made without a trial by U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt. Montgomery County Justice of the Peace Wayne Mack doesn’t force anyone to attend the prayers before court formally opens, Judge Jerry E. Smith wrote for himself and Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt. Mack “takes great pains to convince attendees that they need not watch the ceremony – and that doing so will not affect their cases,” he wrote. Judge E. Grady Jolly responded: “For the majority to find that there is no evidence of coercion, suggests, in my opinion, willful blindness and indisputable error.” He noted that Mack is a Pentecostal minister who made a campaign promise to establish prayer in his courtroom. “He has previously criticized opponents of his prayer ceremony and has acted hostile following a litigant’s noncooperation in the prayer,” Jolly wrote. The Freedom From Religion Foundation sued Mack in 2017 for itself and an anonymous lawyer who said he attended the sessions out of fear that not doing so would hurt his clients.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Russell M. Nelson, the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told members of the faith Saturday that abuse was “a grievous sin” that shouldn’t be tolerated and would bring down the wrath of God on perpetrators. Though the leader of the nearly 17 million-member faith did not mention it directly, the remarks were the first on abuse from a senior church leader since the Associated Press published an investigation into how the church handles reports of sexual abuse when brought to its attention. “Let me be perfectly clear: Any kind of abuse of women, children or anyone is an abomination to the Lord,” Nelson, who members of the faith believe is a prophet, said in Salt Lake City at a church conference. The AP’s investigation found the hotline the church uses for abuse reporting can be misused by its leaders to divert accusations away from law enforcement and toward church attorneys. The story, based on sealed records and court cases filed in Arizona and West Virginia, uncovered a host of concerns, including how church officials have cited exemptions to mandatory reporting laws, known as clergy-penitent privilege, as a reason to not report abuse. Since its publication, the church has said the investigation mischaracterizes its policies.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Dispensaries began selling marijuana for legal recreational use over the weekend. FLORA Cannabis in Middlebury, Mountain Girl Cannabis in Rutland and CeresMED in Burlington were the only retailers ready to begin sales Saturday. A fourth business has been licensed to sell recreational pot but isn’t ready to do so yet. As happened with the rollout of recreational marijuana sales in other states and in Canada, Vermont’s inaugural weekend was “more of a soft opening,” as more product manufacturers and testing facilities come online and as more people harvest the plant, said James Pepper, chair of the state Cannabis Control Board. Vermont joins 14 other states with legal adult-use cannabis sales, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. Four others – Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island and Virginia – and Washington, D.C., have legalized the use of recreational marijuana, but sales haven’t started there yet. Vermont’s Cannabis Control Board prioritized review and waived licensing fees for social equity applicants. Such applicants are Black or Hispanic or from communities that historically have been disproportionately affected by cannabis being outlawed or who have been or had a family member who has been incarcerated for a cannabis-related offense.\n\nVirginia\n\nGala: He won in the dogfights of World War II, he won in the Olympic boxing ring, and he won in Virginia Supreme Court. Now a stretch of highway in Botetourt County is named in honor of Norvel LaFallette Ray Lee. Descendants of Lee recently traveled to his birthplace from as far as Alaska to unveil a placard along U.S. 220 that details his life and accomplishments, on what would have been his 98th birthday. “I hope this marker will inspire people to learn more about Norvel, his extraordinary achievements and his place in the history of our country,” said state Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt. “I want to acknowledge this man who overcame the adversities of segregation to become a Tuskegee Airmen and a gold medalist in the Olympics.” Born in Eagle Rock in 1924, Lee won fights by air and in the boxing ring, including Olympic gold in 1952, but is known also for taking a stand against segregation on his way home from the 1948 Olympics. “While returning from the 1948 Olympics, traveling by train, he was asked to give up his seat to a white person,” Austin said. “Mr. Lee declined to do so and was arrested. Eventually the Virginia Supreme Court did the right thing and ruled in Mr. Lee’s favor.” Undefeated in Virginia Supreme Court on what became a landmark civil rights case, Lee went on to retire from boxing with two Golden Glove titles and a 100-5 win-loss record, said the Rev. Nelson Harris of Heights Community Church in Roanoke.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A woman who was sexually assaulted by a police officer has filed a tort claim against the city. The woman is seeking $1 million in damages, alleging “red flags” related to now ex-police Officer Nathan Nash’s behavior were ignored, KREM-TV reports. Nash was convicted in August on one count of third-degree rape and one count of second-degree rape in two separate incidents in which he was on duty. The woman intending to sue says in the claim that the city’s hiring, training and supervision of Nash was inadequate and a proximate cause of her injuries. The city allowed Nash to use his power and police uniform to prey on women he encountered during the performance of his duties, according to the claim. The city has about two months to respond. Nash is in custody at the Spokane County Detention Center awaiting a mid-October sentencing for the rape convictions. Throughout his trial, Nash maintained his innocence. He was first charged in 2019 when a woman accused him of rape while investigating her case. Another woman in 2021 told police about a similar experience.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is getting a $13.8 million funding boost from the state to help finish construction of a baseball stadium. Gov. Jim Justice announced the contribution Thursday from the state Water Development Authority’s Economic Enhancement Grant program. “This has been a long time coming, and I am so proud to play a small part in getting this project across the finish line,” Justice said. “They’ve been talking about building a baseball stadium since I was a brown-haired kid playing golf at Marshall back in the ’70s. Finally, it’s going to happen, and this community can get the monkey off its back.” Marshall has never had an on-campus baseball stadium. The new facility will be built across the street from Marshall’s football stadium. The stadium is expected to cost about $23 million. The city of Huntington and Marshall are contributing nearly $10 million, the governor’s office said in a statement. Construction is scheduled to begin this month, with a tentative completion date of March 2024.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two lawsuits filed last week argue that election clerks should be allowed to accept absentee ballots that are missing portions of witness addresses – the next step in the ongoing legal battle that has pit conservatives against liberals in the battleground state. The lawsuits, filed three days apart on Tuesday and Friday, come after a judge in Waukesha County circuit court in September sided with Republicans and said election clerks are barred from filling in missing information on the form that serves as an envelope for absentee ballots. The judge struck down guidance issued by the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, in place for six years, saying that clerks could fill in missing information. The judge agreed with Republicans that there is nothing in law allowing clerks to do that. The practice, known as ballot curing, was unchallenged until after Donald Trump’s narrow loss in 2020, when nearly 1.4 million voters cast absentee ballots, and COVID-19 vaccines weren’t available yet. Absent any guidance, there is confusion among election officials about how much of an address must be provided by the witness to allow for the ballot to be counted. Those with partial witness addresses should be accepted, not rejected, according to a lawsuit filed Friday by the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state doubled its wind-power generating capacity from 2019 to 2021 and is looking to add more wind farms in the next five years. The Casper Star Tribune reports researchers at the University of Wyoming say that boost in power generation is like adding another coal-fired power plant. The increase has pushed Wyoming’s wind-power generating capacity from about 1,600 to about 3,200 megawatts and from 17th to 14th in the nation in wind-power capacity. Enough future wind farms have been proposed to the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council to nearly triple the state’s wind-power capacity. The University of Wyoming report released in June sought to measure the economic impacts of wind projects in the state. It found that building another 6,000 megawatts of wind capacity would support close to 1,600 long-term jobs. It would also inject $1.2 billion into the state economy during construction and add another estimated $210 million annually. Researchers said that includes $89 million in government revenue. Additionally, if the turbines were built in Wyoming, the revenue produced in the state could be even more.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/29/atari-hotel-wienermobile-warning-goat-mayors-rival-news-around-states/41104037/", "title": "Atari hotel, Wienermobile warning, goat mayor's K-9 rival: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nOpelika: The city is developing a new a system of pedestrian and bicycle paths. The Opelika City Council recently voted to hire a Birmingham firm to develop a master plan for the path system, The Opelika-Auburn News reports. The aim is to create a network of paths that get people where they want to go, City Planning Director Matt Mosley said. Sain Associates will be paid $150,000 by the city, which will recoup 80% of that cost through a state transportation grant, the newspaper reports. By using a map of the city, the firm will be able to identify potential paths, while also taking into account other infrastructure plans the city may have in mind for those areas, City Engineer Scott Parker said. The project is separate from the Creekline Trails multipurpose path plan, Parker said.\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: Two animal groups plan to help a small village clear out all its stray dogs, officials said. Bethel Friends of Canines and Alaskan Animal Rescue Friends hope to catch and remove the wandering animals from Tuntutuliak on Friday, Alaska’s Energy Desk reports. After volunteers vaccinate the dogs, some will be given to homes in Bethel, while most will be transported to animal rescues in Anchorage, officials said. Tuntutuliak residents should keep their pets inside during the sweep so they are not mistaken for strays, coordinator Jesslyn Elliott said. The organizations said the village’s traditional council contacted them with a request to help remove the dogs. Ravn Air Group, Grant Aviation Inc. and Northern Air Cargo LLC are expected to transport dog kennels to the area and donate space to fly the dogs to Anchorage, while a website has been set up to help collect funding for the effort.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Atari is bringing its virtual experience to life with video game-themed hotels, and the first location will be in the Valley of the Sun. The first Atari Hotel is slated to break ground this year. The gaming pioneer, known for classic arcade games such as Asteroids and Pong as well as the Atari 2600 console, plans to build in downtown Phoenix, says Shelly Murphy of GSD Group. Phoenix is ideal because it’s close to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Francisco, and it’s where the hotels’ developers, GSD Group and Truth North Studio, are located, Murphy says. Fans of gaming can sign up online to become Atari Hotel members and get discounts on hotel stays, apparel and events. The site will host national esports competitions and local tournaments and offer spaces for private parties. Local visitors won’t need to have a hotel reservation to play games there, Murphy says.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal appeals court on Monday ruled against Arkansas preventing candidates for state office from accepting campaign contributions more than two years before an election, blocking the restriction from being enforced. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a judge’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction against the state’s “blackout period.” A Pulaski County woman had sued over the restriction, and her attorneys argued it prevented her from exercising her First Amendment right to contribute money to candidates she wants to support in the 2022 election. The court questioned the state’s argument that the blackout period helps prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A billionaire who has been fighting for more than a decade to keep a secluded beach to himself has filed a new complaint in his lawsuit against the state and San Mateo County for allegedly harassing him and violating his property rights. In his new complaint filed Friday in San Francisco, Venture capitalist Vinod Khosla accuses top officials with the California Coastal Commission and State Lands Commission of trying to force the billionaire to let the public onto his property to use Martins Beach, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The complaint also names San Mateo County Sheriff Carlos Bolanos and Steve Monowitz, the director of the San Mateo County Planning and Building Department, alleging they all engaged in “a concerted effort … to single out, coerce, and harass one coastal property owner for refusing to cede its private property rights.”\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Wolves are officially back in the Centennial State. Though Colorado Parks and Wildlife recently announced that a likely wolf pack had been confirmed in the state following a late October sighting in Moffat County in northwestern Colorado, the agency now has further evidence bolstering wolves’ return. Wildlife officers spotted about six wolves Jan. 19 while investigating an animal carcass surrounded by large, wolflike tracks in the northwest corner of Moffat County, according to a news release. During the investigation, the officers “were surprised when they heard distinct howls within the area,” according to the release. Using binoculars, they spotted the wolves about 2 miles away from the carcass. By the time they got to the site, the animals were gone, but the officers found large tracks from what appeared to be at least six animals. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis called the officers’ sighting “historic.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nMontville: For decades the Montville High School athletic teams have competed as the “Indians” with the blessing of the Mohegans, the Native American tribe that traces its local history back centuries and today operates one of the world’s biggest casinos. But last week, the Mohegan Tribe announced it no longer supports the use of Indian-related team names. The reversal has unsettled many in the town, which has considered itself immune to controversies stirred by Native American mascots elsewhere because of its close ties to the federally recognized tribe. Not only is the tribe behind Mohegan Sun a major presence in town and a booster of its athletic programs, but many tribal members have been among the students to wear the black and orange of the Montville Indians. Mayor Ronald McDaniel said the school system will follow up with the tribe, but the name has never been a source of friction.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Frontier Airlines will soon end the state’s status as the only one in the country without commercial air service. Frontier announced Tuesday that it will begin offering nonstop flights from Wilmington-New Castle Airport to Orlando, Florida, starting May 14. The flights will be offered during the summer on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. Delaware has been the only state without commercial airline service since Frontier left in June 2015 after a two-year run. Denver-based Frontier, an ultra-low-cost airline, first began service in Delaware in July 2013. It once offered flights from Wilmington-New Castle to Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Houston and three Florida destinations. It later limited its Delaware flights to Orlando and Tampa before ceasing operations completely in June 2015.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Metropolitan Police Department has announced a new policy that will prohibit the arrest of children 12 and under as part of an effort to limit juvenile arrests in the city, WUSA-TV reports. The department says it has recognized that juveniles and adults are physically and psychologically different, and cases involving an interaction between an officer and a child can have a lasting impact. MPD officials say they want to make sure that juvenile encounters with police are respectful and that officers are aware of the developmental differences in young people. MPD plans to provide officer training such as de-escalation, adolescent brain development, and trauma-informed policing to better protect and serve the residents and young people in the district.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state could turn to the sky to fight Burmese pythons on the ground under a bill a Senate committee unanimously approved Monday to allow two state agencies to use drones in the effort to eradicate invasive plants and animals. The bill would create an exception to a current law that prohibits law enforcement from using drones to gather information and bans state agencies from using drones to gather images on private land. It would allow the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Florida Forest Service to fly drones to manage and eradicate invasion species on public lands. Sen. Ben Albritton said drones would also help the agencies spot lygodium, a fern native to Asia that’s destroying Florida’s natural vegetation. The wildlife agency’s website warns that lygodium spreads rapidly and is a “severe threat” to Everglades tree islands and puts other forests at greater risk for wildfires because it serves as a fire ladder.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: High school students would face a cap on the number of college courses the state would pay for under a bill that passed the state Senate on Tuesday. House Bill 444 passed on a 34-18 vote and now moves to the House for more debate. Gov. Brian Kemp and a number of lawmakers say the cost of Georgia’s dual enrollment program, which pays for college courses for high schoolers, is growing too quickly. Most students would be limited to 30 hours of college credit, what a student typically has to take to reach college sophomore status. Most Democrats opposed the bill, saying that there are better ways to control costs than an arbitrary cap and that reducing funding could burden students. The state would pay for only regular academic courses in English and language arts, mathematics, science, social studies and foreign languages. It also would pay for technical courses in one of 17 state-designated career pathways.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists will decide whether to establish a captive breeding program on the U.S. mainland in an attempt to prevent the extinction of a bird species only found on Maui, officials say. A decision about the plan to save the endangered kiwikiu is expected at a meeting of project partners Thursday, The Hawaii Star-Advertiser reports. A nonprofit bird facility on the mainland has expressed interest in a kiwikiu captive-breeding program, officials say. Also known as the Maui parrotbill, the population of yellow and olive-green forest birds has dwindled to fewer than 300. The Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project halted a program to establish a population on the windward slopes of Maui’s Haleakala volcano after mosquito-borne avian malaria killed 10 of 13 birds set to be released in October, including one that died before it was set free. The final three are missing and presumed dead.\n\nIdaho\n\nDonnelly: Authorities say 25 people were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning while staying at a vacation rental home in this mountain town. Donnelly Rural Fire Protection Chief Juan Bonilla says firefighters were called to the vacation home about 6:30 a.m. Monday and found the occupants complaining of headaches and nausea. Two adults and two children were initially taken by ambulance to a hospital in McCall. Once health care workers realized they had symptoms consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning, fire crews tested the air in the home and found above-normal levels, Bonilla said. That’s when the other 21 residents were taken to the hospital as well. Officials say 21 of the people staying at the home have since been treated and released. “We averted a horrific tragedy,” St. Luke’s Hospital spokeswoman Laura Crawford said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Underprivileged areas in the city will receive an estimated $20 million investment for revitalization efforts that prioritize affordable housing and economic development, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Monday. Fifth Third Bank is putting money into “Opportunity Zone” neighborhoods in the city’s South and West sides. The bank’s commitment is part of the federal program that uses tax incentives to encourage private investment in financially destitute communities. “It’s designed to help transform some of our nation’s most challenged communities,” Mitchell Feiger, chairman and CEO of Fifth Third, said at a news conference on the South Side. “I’m confident it will have that impact here.” Feiger said the funding is intended for projects that can “transform affordable housing, revitalize the local retail economy and create jobs.” Specific projects will be unveiled in the coming months, officials said.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: A man fishing from a northwestern Indiana bridge reeled in an apparent live grenade, prompting a road closure until the device was removed by a bomb squad. A Gary police officer who was called to the Little Calumet River bridge Monday evening to investigate learned that a man who had been fishing from the bridge pulled up what seemed to be a live grenade, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. The road that traverses the bridge was temporarily closed off, and the Porter County Bomb Squad was called for assistance. The bomb squad took possession of the grenade without incident, Gary Police Lt. Dawn Westerfield said. Authorities were investigating how and when the grenade ended up in the river in the city located about 30 miles southeast of Chicago.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Angered by a flag observing Transgender Day that briefly flew over the state Capitol, Republican lawmakers moved forward Monday with a bill that would limit the types of flags state and local governments can display. Republicans moved the bill from a subcommittee to a full committee for consideration. It would allow only the flag of the United States, the state flag, a prisoner of war/missing in action flag, and a flag of the city, county or school district from being flown at government buildings. A flag observing Transgender Day flew over the Capitol for less than five minutes in November at the request of Iowa Safe Schools, a group advocating for a safer environment for LGBTQ youth. Some Republican lawmakers objected and promised to introduce legislation. Republican Sen. Jake Chapman said there must be limits, raising the possibility of a KKK or Nazi flag being flown above the Capitol.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The University of Kansas Medical Center is testing a male contraceptive gel that men apply to their shoulders. The school’s research institution is conducting a clinical trial for the contraceptive and searching for couples to participate. Dr. Ajay Nangia, the center’s vice chair of urology, is a collaborating investigator of the study. “I think what we’re finding is in the big picture there’s a big need for a male contraceptive,” Nangia told the Lawrence Journal-World. The gel is a mixture of Nestorone and testosterone. Nestorone is a synthetic progestin that blocks the production of male hormones needed to generate sperm. The testosterone in the gel replaces testosterone usually produced in the male body. A nonprofit called The Population Council and the National Institute of Health are partnering to create the gel.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A bill that would require doctors and other health workers to provide life-sustaining care for an infant born alive after a failed abortion attempt was approved by the state Senate on Monday. The measure sailed through the Senate on a 32-0 vote and heads to the House next. It’s the latest in a series of abortion-related bills to surface in the Republican-dominated Legislature in recent years. The bill would require health care workers to give “medically appropriate and reasonable life-saving and life-sustaining medical care and treatment” to protect the lives of newborns, including any infant born after a failed abortion. Sen. Whitney Westerfield, the bill’s lead sponsor, said last week that he wasn’t aware of any instances in which an infant was born alive in Kentucky from a failed abortion. The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky has said the legislation is based on “false claims” and has “nothing to do with how abortion care actually works.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The Bayou Country Superfest is hanging up its cowboy boots and spurs. In a tweet Monday, organizers of the 10-year-old country music festival announced that the Memorial Day weekend event “will be on hiatus until further notice.” The festival began in Baton Rouge, briefly switched to New Orleans, then returned to Baton Rouge over its decadelong tenure. Last year’s event drew about 50,000 people to Tiger Stadium in Louisiana’s capital city – but that was a smaller crowd than in previous years. At its peak, 135,000 people attended Bayou Country Superfest in 2014. “We thank the fans who came for the party, and the event sponsors who helped make the Festival a Memorial Day Weekend tradition,” the organizers posted on Twitter. Some of the biggest names in country music played the festival over the years, such as George Strait, Tim McGraw, Miranda Lambert and Carrie Underwood.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: The University of Maine System board of trustees has voted for the University of Southern Maine to enter negotiations for a proposed $100 million career center and residence hall. The trustees on Monday unanimously approved “the largest single investment” in the University of Southern Maine’s history, university president Glenn Cummings said. The proposed 577-bed dormitory includes single-occupancy rooms, studios and larger apartments with multiple bedrooms. The proposal estimates students would pay $800 to $1,200 per room per month. Construction would begin at the university’s Portland campus this summer and be completed by the fall of 2022, the Portland Press Herald reports. The board of trustees also approved a $1.7 million project to expand the Wishcamper parking lot and help replace the approximately 160 parking spots that will be lost because of the construction.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Emergency operators in Anne Arundel County are switching to a 24-hour shift schedule in hopes the change will ease fatigue. Starting Thursday, operators will work 24 hours and then have 72 hours off, Fire Chief Trisha Wolford told the Capital Gazette. She said operators were looking for new shifts because working two 10-hour shifts during the day followed by two 14-hour shifts at night made it difficult to maintain proper sleep schedules. “The operators said (they) want to come off of 10s and 14s. They said they can’t get a sleep pattern and are exhausted,” Wolford said. Wolford said the move could help with operator retention. The change was put to a vote and was “passed overwhelmingly,” said Mike Akers, president of AFSCME Local 582. The new shift structure would give workers an hour break during the day and a five-hour break at night. In addition to a lounge area and a workout room, there are beds available for operators to take a nap.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Emerson College is investigating racist graffiti directed at Asian students that was found in a dormitory, administrators said. Employees at the Little Building found derogatory words written on multiple doors Friday, according to an email sent by Emerson’s president, Lee Pelton, on Sunday. He did not specify what words were written. Pelton said the graffiti is the second report of offensive language being directed at Asian students in that dorm. Four swastikas were found drawn in stairwells in another dormitory Tuesday. The students directly affected in the Little Building have been offered support, Pelton said. Other students in the residence hall are also receiving guidance on community standards and bias. “Such cowardly acts will not change who we are,” Pelton wrote in the email. “Emerson will remain a welcoming place for all, not only in theory but in practice.”\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: Volunteers and local groups plan to install a new monument at a cemetery that will carry the names of people who died in state asylums and whose graves are currently marked by small, numbered stones. The monument will include the names of 283 patients and be installed this spring at the historic Oak Hill Cemetery in the southeastern Michigan city of Pontiac, The Oakland Press reports. Volunteers and the Better Pontiac Community Development Corporation have spent four years raising the $5,000 needed for the monument. The Oakland County Pioneer and Historical Society also raised $2,650 during last year’s Oak Hill Cemetery Walk for the project. The graves date back to the late 1800s. The monument will have a decorative front, and the names of those buried there will be on the back. The original stone graves will remain in place as volunteers work on new landscaping for the area. The groups hope to install the monument before Memorial Day.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCloquet: The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa will now require permits for most people to access its lands. The band said Monday that the policy is a way to “better manage and conserve” resources on about 41,000 acres of land on the Fond du Lac Reservation in northeastern Minnesota. “Over the years, we have seen an enormous amount of stress placed on these fragile ecosystems,” Thomas Howes, the band’s natural resources program manager, said in a statement. “Issues such as illegal garbage dumping, ATV traffic and overall growth in population have the potential to take their toll on wildlife and vegetation.” Permits will cost $25 for 30-day access and $100 per year. Access was previously allowed without a permit, the Star Tribune reports. Band members, their spouses and descendants, and reservation allotment owners will be granted permits at no charge.\n\nMississippi\n\nFulton: For 32 hours, 10-year-old Mikylah Blackburn was held hostage over a year ago by the man who authorities said killed her father. She has now been recognized for using her cellphone to communicate with officials, which a sheriff’s office says saved the lives of two deputies. Blackburn, now 11, received a certificate of bravery, a police badge and other items Monday from the Itawamba County Sheriff’s Office, WTVA-TV reports. In December 2018, Nathan Shepard killed the girl’s father, Paul Blackburn, then held the girl hostage, the sheriff’s office said. The girl used her phone to tell authorities what was going on in the house, including that Shepard had a gun. “If you hadn’t have called dispatch and told the two people out there not to come in, he would have went in,” Itawamba County Sheriff Chris Dickinson said Monday, gesturing to a deputy. A SWAT team entered the home, and Shepard was killed, ending the standoff. Blackburn was rescued safely.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state plans to cut more than 1,700 beds at prisons as a result of a drop in inmates. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said the number of prisoners has dropped from more than 33,000 in 2017 to about 26,000 as of Friday. She attributed the drop to changes in Missouri criminal laws that led judges to sentence more people to probation instead of prison time. Beds are being eliminated at the Algoa, Boonville, Tipton, Farmington and Northeast correctional centers, as well as the Western Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center. Pojmann said the cuts mean the agency no longer needs to fill about 130 vacant full-time staff jobs. She said reducing beds is expected to save about $6.5 million and will allow the agency to avoid another $6.6 million in needed maintenance projects. Pojmann says the department wants to reinvest that money into building repairs and other projects aimed at increasing safety.\n\nMontana\n\nButte: Atlantic Richfield has scrapped a proposal to build a second water treatment plant to lower the level of acidic, metal-laden water that has collected in a former copper mining pit. There were concerns that reducing the water levels in Berkeley Pit could destabilize portions of the walls of the pit, Cameron Nazminia, director of state and local affairs for Atlantic Richfield, told The Montana Standard. Atlantic Richfield, which is owned by BP, suggested the additional water treatment last summer after after a tailings dam failed in Brazil in January 2019, killing 270 people. The idea was that if the tailings dam at Berkeley Pit failed, the pit would have enough room to hold the additional water. Berkeley Pit began filling with water after Atlantic Richfield turned off underground pumps in 1982. Atlantic Richfield/BP and Montana Resources are responsible to maintain the water level in the pit below the level at which it would enter Butte’s groundwater.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has scheduled workshops for youth fishing instructors. Instructors are part of the Youth Fishing Program, a statewide team of volunteers and Game and Parks staffers who host educational fishing events. The volunteers will have access to Game and Parks’ loaner fishing equipment and educational materials for events. They also will receive program incentives. Training will take place in Lincoln at the Nebraska Game and Parks Outdoor Education Center on Feb. 2, March 29 and April 26, from 2 to 6 p.m. A workshop is scheduled to run from 6 to 9 p.m. May 6 at the Fort Kearny State Historical Park Visitors Center. Contact Larry Pape online to register.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Airbnb says stays in and around the city increased 19% last year compared with a year earlier, even though residential short-term rentals are illegal in much of the area. The Las Vegas Sun reports company figures showed 882,000 guest arrivals in Clark County in 2019, with more than $138 million collected by Airbnb hosts. That was up from about $100 million in 2018. The most lucrative weekend was during the Electric Daisy Carnival music festival in mid-May. Residential short-term rentals are illegal in unincorporated Clark County and North Las Vegas, while Henderson and Las Vegas allow them with restrictions. The Sun said county officials investigated more than 1,000 short-term rental violation cases last year, levied nearly $900,000 in fines and placed liens on 68 properties deemed to be in violation county short-term rental rules.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNorth Woodstock: A woman says the operators of a seasonal attraction of ice structures failed to control runoff and flooded her basement with more than 15,000 gallons of water – and she worries it will happen again this spring. Kelly Trinkle alleges in a lawsuit against Ice Castles that last April, snow and ice melt from the attraction pooled in her backyard in North Woodstock and flooded her basement with 16 inches of water, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Trinkle is seeking $100,000 in damages but says her largest concern is not the lawsuit or the flooding but what will happen this spring. A lawyer for Ice Castles denied that the structures flooded Trinkle’s basement, writing to NHPR that they were “largely still in ice form” when the flooding happened. “Due to the topography of the land, the water that flooded the Trinkles’ basement came from a large watershed,” the lawyer wrote.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s residents could see their water bills go up under a plan advanced by lawmakers Monday that calls for replacing all underground lead pipes that taint water before it flows into schools, businesses and homes across the state. The legislation would require water providers to identify lead pipes in their systems and to share the cost of replacing the entire pipe, even the portion on private property, with customers. Who should fund the pipe replacement was debated in a Senate committee Monday, even among supporters of the bill who called it a solution to a public health crisis. Lead is an invisible metal that can leach from pipes, typically found in older homes, and cause permanent brain damage and developmental delays in children. Lawmakers have promised action to remove lead after water filters in Newark failed to remove it from water in three homes last summer and following a USA TODAY Network report that identified 250,000 children exposed to lead in their schools.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state is considering new funding for research into treating addiction with injectable opioids to help address long-term dependency on heroin and other opioids. A bill from Democratic state Rep. Miguel Garcia would provide $150,000 to the University of New Mexico for a demonstration project focused on injectable opioids including pharmaceutical-grade heroin or the drug hydromorphone that is routinely prescribed for pain. Opioid and heroin use has plagued some New Mexico communities for generations. The state has pioneered a series of policies aimed at combating opioid addiction, including becoming the first state to require law enforcement agencies to provide officers with overdose antidote kits. The state has a prescription monitoring database to prevent overlapping drug sales and has expanded access to naloxone, a drug that can reverse overdoses.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state could have one of the most lenient marijuana possession thresholds in the nation if an alternative legalization proposal is passed this session. The bill, sponsored by state Sen. Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Crystal Peoples-Stokes, both Democrats, would allow people over 21 years old to have 3 ounces of marijuana. Supporters of the proposal say higher possession thresholds would help prevent people from getting wrapped up in the criminal justice system. A competing proposal from Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, which lawmakers are debating, would only allow dispensaries to sell 1 ounce of marijuana per person on a daily basis. The governor’s office says the 1 ounce threshold is largely the status quo among other states that have legalized the drug. Under the plan included in Cuomo’s budget, people caught smoking marijuana in public could face a $125 fine.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A new book by the founding director of North Carolina African American Heritage Commission teaches children about the history of African Americans’ contributions to the state. “My N.C. from A to Z” was written by Michelle Lanier, who advocated for legislation that created the commission, according to a news release from the state Department of Natural and Cultural Releases. She then served as its founding executive director. In 2018 Lanier became the first African American director of North Carolina’s Division of State Historic Sites. Each letter of the alphabet represents African American people and places rooted in North Carolina. For example, “B” stands for Black Wall Street, which was a four-block area in Durham where African American enterprise thrived in the late 1800s and early 1900s. “T” stands for Thomas Day of Milton, a furniture maker in the 1800s whose pieces are still collected today.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The North Dakota State football team will be returning to the White House for a second year in a row after winning another FCS national championship. Sen. Kevin Cramer tweeted over the weekend that President Donald Trump invited the team for a return visit after its perfect 16-0 season. The Bison are the FCS national champion for a record eighth time after defeating James Madison 28-20 to close out the season earlier this month in Texas. It’s the team’s third straight national championship. Cramer says details of the visit are still being worked out.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Individuals convicted of trying to buy sex or trafficking women for sex would be placed on a publicly accessible database for five years, under legislation introduced in the state House. The legislation backed by Attorney General David Yost is aimed at the demand side of prostitution, according to supporters of the bill. “Under current law, it is not difficult for someone caught soliciting a prostitute to keep that information hidden from friends, family and their employer,” said Rep. Cindy Abrams, a Republican from Harrison in suburban Cincinnati. Co-sponsor Rep. Rick Carfagna, a Republican from Genoa Township in suburban Columbus, said the bill could provide the deterrent needed to stop people from soliciting sex. Individuals would automatically drop off the database if five years pass without another conviction.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Legislature will consider new rules that would raise the student performance standards for schools to operate on a four-day workweek. The Oklahoma State Board of Education voted Thursday in favor of adopting the new standards starting in the 2021-22 school year. The rules would still need the approval of the Legislature, which opens its session Monday, The Oklahoman reports. To qualify for a four-day week, elementary and middle schools would have to score at least a C in academic growth for math and English language arts on annual Oklahoma State Report Cards. The report cards measure school performance across several indicators that include academic achievement and growth, chronic absenteeism, progress in English language proficiency evaluations, post-secondary opportunities and graduation.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The City Council is reconsidering its homeless camping ban. Since the ban took effect in mid-December, the city has been scrambling to find options for where to put the roughly 300 homeless people who have been living on downtown sidewalks. Councilor Tom Anderson moved to have the council consider limiting its camping ban to downtown, city parks and residentially zoned neighborhoods at its Feb. 10 meeting. Anderson said he also isn’t opposed to looking at the tabled sit-lie ordinance, which would prohibit people from gathering on sidewalks in downtown as they have been. But altering the camping ban wouldn’t set up a tent city in Salem, either. The city looked at possible locations for a temporary shelter.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A monument honoring voting rights for African American men and women will soon be built on the state Capitol grounds. The monument will also commemorate former residents of the Old Eighth Ward, a black community in Harrisburg that was demolished to make way for the state Capitol Complex. The monument will be located on the Capitol grounds outside the K. Leroy Irvis Office Building, PennLive.com reports. The multipurpose monument, called “A Gathering at the Crossroads,” will feature four bronze, life-size statues of abolitionists and orators who fought for equal rights. The orators – William Howard Day, Thomas Morris Chester, Jacob T. Compton, and Francis Ellen Walker Harper – will be gathered around a pedestal inscribed with the names of 100 leaders of the Old Eighth Ward. Groundbreaking for the $400,000 monument will be held March 25, and the dedication is scheduled for June 15.\n\nRhode Island\n\nJamestown: A loop road that goes around a lighthouse at a state park has become so dangerously eroded that is it being closed to vehicular traffic, state environmental officials announced Tuesday. The road surrounding the lighthouse at Beavertail State Park in Jamestown will be closed to vehicles starting Monday, although it will remain accessible to pedestrians, the Department of Environmental Management said in a statement. “Residual damage from Superstorm Sandy along with erosion and storm surge intensified by climate change-driven sea level rise have caused dangerous washouts along the perimeter road and the surrounding pedestrian path” at the waterfront park at the southern tip of Jamestown, the department said. Posts and chains have been installed at the closure area, along with signs directing pedestrian traffic to continue to access the loop.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A bill allowing people to use a shopping service to buy beer and wine as well as groceries and have them delivered to their car is a step closer to being passed. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill Tuesday after agreeing to changes including prohibiting the sale of chilled beer or wine that might be more tempting to drink on the way home. The bill also requires employees to check the identification of the person picking up the alcohol and record the ID and the time and date of the purchase. Supporters of the bill said a number of other Southern states already allow beer and wine with online grocery buying, and it is inconvenient to force a customer to have all their food delivered but then go inside for beer and wine. The bill now heads to the full state Senate.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Officials say more than 14 million people visited the state last year, marking the tenth consecutive year of growth for its tourism industry. The Department of Tourism said 2019 saw a record level of visitors, spending and economic impact. The number of visitors increased by about 3% from the prior year. Visitors spent about $4 billion, accounting for 5.2% of the state’s economy, according to the department’s annual report. Officials say more than 55,000 jobs are supported by the tourism industry, or 8.8% of all South Dakota jobs. The majority of tourists, or 10.7 million, visited South Dakota’s state and national parks, which include the Black Hills National Forest.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Newly revealed police records show a white officer charged with fatally shooting an armed black man who was running away had been reprimanded by supervisors months earlier for not shooting another armed suspect in a similar case. Officer Andrew Delke, 25, had been on the city’s police force for about a year when he used a stun gun to arrest an armed suspect, Terry Crowell, who ran from him in November 2017, WPLN News reports. Sgt. Matthew Boguskie later held an “informal counseling session” with him, telling Delke he should have used his firearm, the records state. Delke told the sergeant he didn’t pull his service weapon because of what he called “the hostile climate towards police use of force throughout the country.” He also told Boguskie that at the time he was thinking of Officer Josh Lippert, the former Nashville officer who shot Jocques Clemmons, a black man, after a traffic stop.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A mother who says her 2-year-old son was seriously injured when a glass ketchup bottle fell on his head from a fifth-floor balcony of a hotel is suing the establishment for at least $1 million. Cassandra DeLa Cruz’s lawsuit says her son, Jacob Francisco, suffered serious injuries to his neck, brain and other parts of his body Aug. 18, 2018, when he was struck by the bottle as she pushed him past the Omni La Mansion Del Rio hotel in a stroller. The lawsuit names the hotel; its Dallas-based parent, Omni Hotels & Resorts; and its owner, TRT Holdings of Irving, as defendants. The suit says Jacob has received medical treatment since the bottle fell on him, and his “injuries may be permanent in nature.” The San Antonio Police Department says two people in a hotel room said they had been eating burgers on the balcony, and one of them said he may have accidentally knocked the 2.25-ounce Heinz ketchup bottle over the edge.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State leaders repealed a tax reform package Tuesday that had come under widespread criticism. The Legislature approved and Republican Gov. Gary Herbert signed the repeal shortly after state elections officials reported that enough voter signatures had been verified to put a citizen referendum seeking to repeal the tax reform on the November ballot, the Deseret News reports. The House voted 70-1 and the Senate voted 27-0 on the repeal bill sponsored by Republican House Majority Leader Francis Gibson. Herbert signed it soon after. The tax reform package included reducing income taxes while raising sales taxes on food, gas and some services. Gibson acknowledged that many residents opposed the move. More than 117,000 verified referendum signatures were published, surpassing the required amount by about 1,000, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nFair Haven: It’s Lincoln the goat versus Sammy the dog in the race for the town’s honorary mayor. The Nubian goat had won the post last year after the town manager came up with the pet mayor election to raise money to rehabilitate a community playground and get kids civically involved. “In Fair Haven, just like everywhere else, voter participation is not always as high as we want it,” Town Manager Joe Gunter says. Resident Cheryl Daviau says the race has gotten children involved in the election process. Her granddaughter got her picture taken with the goat mayor and loved it, she says. To up the ante, this year the police chief nominated K-9 Sammy, a German shepherd who visits local schools daily with a resource officer, attends concerts in the park and is beloved around town. Both Lincoln and Sammy are popular, so it could be a tight race. The election will be held March 3.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: A local commission is recommending that a Confederate monument in the city shouldn’t be removed but instead that historical context should be added in a new park and a second statue erected to honor African American heritage. The Virginia Beach Historic Preservation Commission planned to make its recommendation to the City Council on Tuesday, The Virginian-Pilot reports. The plan also suggests looking into whether a museum could be built nearby to tell a more “inclusive story” of the community’s history. The committee estimated the park and a second statue could cost up to $320,000, but the group will ask the council for an initial $50,000 for the project, the newspaper reports. Virginia prohibits local governments from removing memorials for war veterans, but Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring has questioned the law, and Gov. Ralph Northam also said he supports amending it.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Bills to allow sports betting at Indian casinos in the state, including events like the Super Bowl and the World Series, have been introduced in the Legislature. The bills would allow owners of the 29 Indian casinos in the state to open Las Vegas-style sports books. However, a company that operates 19 private card rooms in Washington is crying foul. Maverick Gaming owner Eric Persson says the company should also be allowed to provide sports betting, including electronic betting using cellphones or computers. “That’s what the consumer wants,” Persson told the House Commerce and Gaming Committee on Monday afternoon. The committee heard testimony about the proposal but did not take a vote. Another hearing on sports betting is scheduled for Thursday before a Senate committee.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: In what they acknowledged is a long-shot bid, Gov. Jim Justice and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. urged unhappy Virginia counties Tuesday to secede and join a neighboring state where Democrats aren’t in charge. Both Justice, a Republican in a state where the GOP dominates the Legislature, and Falwell, whose university is in Lynchburg, Virginia, said the invitation to join West Virginia sends a valid message. “If you’re not truly happy where you are, we stand with open arms to take you from Virginia or anywhere where you may be,” Justice said. “We stand strongly behind the Second Amendment, and we stand strongly for the unborn.” This month, the West Virginia House of Delegates and Senate introduced resolutions inviting parts of Virginia to join West Virginia.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Oscar Mayer’s iconic Wienermobile got a grilling from a sheriff’s deputy because the driver of the giant hot dog failed to give enough room to another car on the road with emergency lights. The deputy pulled over the Wienermobile and gave the driver a verbal warning for not following the law, the Waukesha Sheriff’s Office said in a tweet posted Monday. It showed a picture of the sheriff’s deputy’s SUV parked behind the Wienermobile with the hashtags #MoveOver #SlowDown #Wienermobile. Traffic laws require vehicles to move out of the lane closest to another car that is on the side of the road with emergency lights flashing. The first Weinermobile was created in 1936, and it has gone through several iterations since then.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The governor is reiterating his support for a statewide lodging tax to boost revenue. A lodging tax is the only new tax he would support, Gov. Mark Gordon said Friday. It would make Wyoming’s tourism promotion efforts more self-sufficient, Gordon told reporters at the Wyoming Press Association’s winter convention in Casper. A 5% statewide lodging tax passed the Wyoming House but failed in the Senate in 2019, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The tax would have generated about $20 million a year. A four-week legislative session devoted primarily to the state budget begins Feb. 10.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/18/cash-tower-leak-underwater-plaque-library-union-news-around-states/50247181/", "title": "Cash tower leak, underwater plaque: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nThomasville: The whole town celebrated in 2020 when, early in the coronavirus pandemic, Thomasville Regional Medical Center opened, offering state-of-the-art medicine that was previously unavailable in a poor, isolated part of the state. The timing for the ribbon-cutting seemed perfect: New treatment options would be available in an underserved area just as a global health crisis was unfolding. In the end, that same timing may be the reason for the hospital’s undoing. Now deep in the red two years into the pandemic, the 29-bed, $40 million hospital with a soaring, sun-drenched lobby and 110 employees is among three medical centers in the United States that say they are missing out on millions in federal pandemic relief money because the facilities are so new they lack full financial statements from before the crisis to prove how much it cost them. In Thomasville, located in timber country about 95 miles north of Mobile, hospital officials have worked more than a year to convince federal officials they should have gotten $8.2 million through the CARES Act, not just the $1 million they received. With a total debt of $35 million, the quest gets more urgent each day, said Curtis James, the chief executive officer. “No hospital can sustain itself without getting the CARES Act money that everybody else got,” James said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge has said a majority of members on the board tasked with redrawing Alaska’s political boundaries appeared to have adopted a map that splits the Eagle River area into two Senate districts for “political reasons,” and he ordered a new map to be used this year. Superior Court Judge Thomas Matthews in a decision made public late Monday ordered the Alaska Redistricting Board to adopt on an interim basis a map that in part pairs the Eagle River area House districts into a Senate district. The decision comes in a second round of redistricting challenges. The map that the judge ordered be adopted was the other option the board had considered when weighing a revised map. Matthews said he expected a quick review of his decision by the Alaska Supreme Court. The candidate filing deadline for the August primary is June 1. The Alaska Supreme Court in March found constitutional issues with elements of a map drawn by the board last fall. In one of the instances, the court ruled that a state Senate district pairing part of east Anchorage and the Eagle River area constituted an “unconstitutional political gerrymander.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state Senate on Monday opened an ethics investigation into a firebrand Republican member who tweeted inflammatory comments about last weekend’s racist attack at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that left 10 people dead. The referral of Sen. Wendy Rogers of Flagstaff to the Ethics Committee was in lieu of the immediate expulsion that Democratic lawmakers were planning, GOP Majority Leader Rick Gray said. Due process considerations require no less than an ethics investigation, he said. But Democrats were furious, noting that Rogers was just censured in March for a repeated series of tweets and statements that embraced white nationalism and called for violence. On Saturday, as news came out of the mass shooting by a white suspect who had posted a racist screed on the internet and driven about 200 miles to a primarily Black neighborhood in Buffalo, Rogers tweeted: “Fed boy summer has started in Buffalo.” Many in both parties took that tweet to mean that Rogers was blaming the attack on the federal government, especially in light of Rogers’ history of embracing conspiracy theories and posting of racist tropes. GOP Senate leaders tried to get in front of the controversy Monday, putting out a statement condemning the violence and “all hate speech that has served as an inspiration for these kinds of heinous crimes.”\n\nArkansas\n\nKingsland: The silhouette of “The Man in Black” is painted on the side of the town’s water tower. But someone shot the painting of Johnny Cash just to watch it leak. The tower was still leaking the town’s drinking water Tuesday. The gunshot hit the image of the iconic country singer in the crotch. The water tower in Kingsland, a small town of 400 about an hour south of Little Rock, features a mural of country music legend Johnny Cash, according to the Cleveland County Herald. The shooter fired the shot May 11, and repairs continued this week. The town had just spent $300,000 on the water tower. Cash was born in 1932 in Kingsland. The Cleveland County Sheriff’s Department is investigating the case of vandalism. Anyone with information can call the sheriff at 870-325-6222.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Homelessness increased nearly 9% in the San Francisco Bay Area over the past three years, despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent to keep people off the streets during the coronavirus pandemic, preliminary numbers released Monday show. San Francisco proper appeared to be the one bright spot, seeing homelessness decline slightly. Alameda County, which includes the city of Oakland, reported a 22% increase in this year’s point-in-time survey, while neighboring Contra Costa County saw a 35% jump in people spotted living in shelters, vehicles or outdoors. The largest county in the region, Santa Clara, reported a 3% increase from 2019, including an 11% increase in the city of San Jose. San Francisco reported a 3.5% decline to nearly 7,800 homeless residents, which housing advocates chalked up in part to a wealth tax approved by voters in 2018. In total, seven of the Bay Area’s nine counties reported counting more than 35,000 people experiencing homelessness in late February. The count is required every other year by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and helps determine funding. San Mateo and Solano counties did not report preliminary numbers Monday. Housing advocates said increases across the region would have been worse without strong and speedy intervention from the state and local government.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The partner of an embattled former police chief in suburban Denver is accused of falsely reporting that a vocal opponent of the chief was sexually abusing her son, authorities alleged in court documents filed Monday. Robin Niceta, a county social worker at the time, allegedly made an anonymous call to a child abuse hotline Jan. 28 alleging that she saw Aurora City Councilmember Danielle Jurinsky inappropriately touching Jurinsky’s son, an affidavit for an arrest warrant for Niceta said. The call came a day after Jurinsky called for police Chief Vanessa Wilson to resign, saying on a talk radio show that Wilson was “trash.” An investigation cleared Jurinsky of any wrongdoing, and she told investigators she thought the tip was retaliation for her comments about Wilson. According to an affidavit seeking Niceta’s arrest, the call came from Niceta’s personal cellphone on file with the county, and a search of her laptop showed a search for the hotline number and Jurinsky’s address just before the call was made. Niceta denied making the call. She said Wilson and her two children also had access to her phone, though she said her children would not have called. When pressed about who could have called, Niceta said that “it wasn’t me,” the affidavit said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: A fire official has been fired and seven other firefighters have been disciplined following an investigation into drug use at firehouses around the city, the mayor said. The investigation began after the apparent drug-related death of a 36-year-old off-duty firefighter in his home in January. A lieutenant in the department was fired in February after an investigation showed he was “knowingly supplying, giving, selling, sharing and using illegal drugs and (his) prescription Adderall pills,” according to a termination letter from Mayor Erin Stewart that was first obtained by The Hartford Courant. The other seven, including four with the rank of lieutenant or above, have been required to take 30 days of unpaid leave, demoted to the rank of private and placed on probation for three years, during which time they cannot seek promotion and will be subject to random drug testing, according to the mayor’s office. The drugs involved include prescription Adderall as well as fentanyl, heroin and marijuana, Stewart said. A criminal investigation is ongoing, but no charges have been filed. Several other firefighters have resigned since January’s death. The results of toxicology tests were pending, but officials have said it was an apparent drug overdose.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has refused to dismiss a criminal charge accusing the embattled state auditor of deliberately breaking up payments for a contract into which she entered with a former campaign consultant in order to avoid compliance with state procurement law. In a ruling dated Friday, Superior Court Judge William Carpenter Jr. ruled that an indictment against Kathleen McGuiness sufficiently alleged that she willfully fragmented or structured the payments to circumvent the state procurement code. Defense attorney Steve Wood argued that the indictment failed to charge an offense or provide fair notice of what McGuiness needed to defend against. He also argued that the indictment failed to allege that she structured two or more no-bid contracts and that it didn’t specify which section of the procurement code or state Budget and Accounting Policy Manual she intended to violate. McGuiness, a Democrat who was elected in 2018 and is responsible for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was indicted in October on felony counts of theft and witness intimidation, as well as misdemeanor charges of official misconduct, conflict of interest and noncompliance with procurement laws. A trial is scheduled to start later this month. McGuiness has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Karine Jean-Pierre held her first briefing as the new White House press secretary Monday, crediting “barrier-breaking people” who came before her for making it possible for a Black, gay, immigrant woman like herself to rise to one of the most high-profile jobs in American government. “I stand on their shoulders. If it were not for generations of barrier-breaking people before me, I would not be here,” Jean-Pierre said. “But I benefit from their sacrifices. I have learned from their excellence, and I am forever grateful to them.” President Joe Biden entrusted Jean-Pierre, 47, with the responsibility of being his chief spokesperson earlier this month. Jen Psaki, who had held the job since the start of the administration, stepped down last Friday. Jean-Pierre, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, is the first Black woman and the first openly LGBTQ person to serve as White House press secretary. She had been the principal deputy press secretary and led the briefing on several occasions, making history in May 2021 when she first subbed for Psaki. She also held regular off-camera “gaggles” with the much smaller group of reporters who travel aboard Air Force One with the president.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey Largo: The 20th anniversary of the storied intentional sinking of a former Naval ship to become an artificial reef in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary was celebrated Tuesday. The 510-foot-long Spiegel Grove earned international notoriety when it sank prematurely May 17, 2002, and landed with its upside-down bow protruding above the ocean’s surface about 6 miles off Key Largo. A massive remediation effort began, resulting in the former Landing Ship Dock being fully sunk on its starboard side June 10, 2002. Three years later, strong currents and waves generated from Hurricane Dennis when it was east of Cuba pushed the ship into the intended upright position on the ocean bottom about 130 feet below the surface. “Ultimately, the Spiegel Grove is a story that Hollywood would never have been able to script in a million years,” said Rob Bleser, a Key Largo dive operator and the vessel’s sinking project manager. Bleser and other key individuals planned to gather Tuesday evening at a local cultural center for a reception and panel discussion on the fascinating events surrounding the ship. On Sunday, divers affixed a commemorative plaque to the Spiegel Grove, sponsored by a group of Navy veterans who had served on it, recognizing the multimillion-dollar project’s supporters, as well as military personnel who were stationed on the ship commissioned in 1956.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Several Black students who were suspended for trying to protest Confederate flag displays at their school have filed a federal lawsuit against the school district and its board members, accusing them of allowing an extensive pattern of racism including “overt bigotry and animosity by some white students and teachers against African American students.” The students, joined by their mothers as plaintiffs, already made news when their protest at Coosa High School was stifled last fall. Now, in their lawsuit filed Tuesday against the Floyd County school district and its board members, they allege an extensive pattern of racism, including white students reenacting the murder of George Floyd and posting it on social media, as well as a student who carried what appeared to be a whip and told a Black student, “We used to whip you.” They also allege unfair punishment: Students are banned from wearing Black Lives Matter shirts, but Confederate flag apparel is acceptable under the school’s dress code, the lawsuit says. The suit faults administrators for “deliberate indifference to acts of racial animosity toward black students perpetrated by white students and teachers; as well as the school’s viewpoint discrimination in its dress code and the inconsistent administration of disciplinary policies to the detriment of Black students.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state is on course to receive $14 million in federal funding to help protect endangered forest birds and other species, officials said Monday. U.S. Rep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii, said the funding will help the state fight mosquitoes that threaten birds found nowhere else in the world. There are an estimated 45 akikiki left on Kauai and 135 kiwikiu remaining on Maui, said Lainie Berry, the wildlife program manager for the state Department of Land and Natural Resources. “This tremendous level of additional federal dollars will go a long way toward supplementing and increasing earnest efforts already in place to save these species, as well as the akekee and akohekohe, whose wild population numbers are slightly higher,” Berry said. Avian malaria carried by mosquitoes is wiping out Hawaii’s forest birds. Neither the disease nor the mosquitoes that carry them are native to Hawaii. An April report from federal and state conservation officials concluded the birds have grim prospects without intervention. There are fewer of these birds compared to the past two decades and even years. Their available range has been significantly reduced as species move higher into the mountains to escape mosquitoes.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A hospital that went on lockdown in March after far-right activists protested outside is suing Ammon Bundy, Diego Rodriguez and their various political organizations for defamation and “sustained online attacks.” St. Luke’s Health System filed the lawsuit Wednesday against Bundy, his gubernatorial campaign and his People’s Rights Network organization. The hospital system is also suing Rodriguez – the grandfather of the child involved in the protection case – as well as Rodriguez’s website Freedom Man Press and the Freedom Man political action committee. Rodriguez is an associate of Bundy who has been active in Bundy’s political campaign. The child protection case involved a 10-month-old baby who was temporarily removed from family custody in March after officials determined the infant was “suffering from severe malnourishment” and at risk of injury or death, the Meridian Police Department said at the time. The baby’s parents had refused to let officers check on the child’s welfare after the family canceled a medical appointment, the police statement said. Bundy, well-known for participating in armed standoffs with law enforcement, was arrested the following day on a misdemeanor trespassing charge after he protested at a different hospital where he believed the baby was being treated. He also asked his followers to protest at the hospital and the homes of child protection service workers, law enforcement officers and others involved in the child protection case.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Three women who were found dead at a senior living facility on Chicago’s North Side amid high heat have been identified, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office said Monday. The women found dead Saturday were 76-year-old Delores McNeely, 72-year-old Gwendolyn Osborne and 68-year-old Janice Reed, the office said. All three women were found unresponsive over a 12-hour span at the James Sneider Apartments, where residents started complaining of oppressively hot conditions days earlier. Alderwoman Maria Hadden said she believes a lack of air conditioning in the building likely caused the deaths. Paul Roldan, the president and chief executive of the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation, said his team was “deeply saddened” by the news of the deaths. “The safety and security of our residents has always been our highest priority at HHDC,” Roldan said. Hadden said she went to the building Thursday and learned no one had air conditioning. She said a facilities manager told her the company was still running heat to avoid potentially being cited by the city for shutting it off too early. A city ordinance requires rental properties to be at least 68 degrees during overnight hours between Sept. 15 and June 1.\n\nIndiana\n\nPalmyra: Two men were fatally shot after a police officer and two good Samaritans stopped along a southern Indiana highway to help a driver who was stopped in the roadway, police said. The shooting happened Monday night after an officer with the Palmyra Police Department stopped to assist the “apparent stranded motorist” on State Road 135, Indiana State Police said, but they didn’t say what precipitated the gunfire or who fired the shots. As the officer arrived, two good Samaritans also stopped in a pickup truck to help, but “within seconds of exiting their cars, shots were fired” at the scene just south of Palmyra, about 20 miles northwest of Louisville, Kentucky, police said in a statement. State police did not provide additional details, saying in the news release that investigators have not said how many weapons were involved, how many shots were fired or who fired them. The shooting killed the SUV’s driver, 31-year-old Justin Moore of Owensboro, Kentucky, and one of the good Samaritans, 24-year-old Jacob Tyler McClanahan, of Corydon, Indiana, police said. Autopsies were scheduled for Wednesday, according to Indiana State Police, who were investigating at the request of Harrison County authorities.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Elaine Bohling, of Creston, earned the title Iowan of the Day in 2015 for her volunteer work. Ralph Hodson, of Ackworth, never missed a fair since 1947, but it was his volunteer work that earned him the honor in 2018. Even former Gov. Robert Ray earned the honor – a first for an elected official – in 2014. With less than 100 days until the Fairgrounds open for the Iowa State Fair, the Blue Ribbon Foundation and Cookies Food Products are ready to find a new group of Iowans to select for the honor. The tradition, now in its 25th year, honors Iowans with a “strong work ethic, loyalty to helping others, and an exceptional sense of Iowa pride.” The Iowa State Fair Blue Ribbon Foundation founded the Iowan of the Day in 1997 to celebrate the dedication residents have for their communities all over the state. Every year, the foundation selects 10 Iowans, who are celebrated on 10 out of 11 days of the State Fair. Anyone can nominate someone to become Iowan of the Day by going to blueribbonfoundation.org/IOTD for the nomination form before July 1. Nominations must come with references attesting to the nominee’s efforts along with supplementary materials to showcase the nominee’s awards, photos, articles or documents that showcase their work. Even letters of recommendation can be part of the nomination.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: In a historic first, lawyers faced off before the Kansas Supreme Court on Monday over the constitutionality of a set of GOP-authored congressional maps struck down by a lower court judge last month. It was unclear from the arguments which way the justices are set to rule on the matter, which marks the first time they have been asked to adjudicate whether the Kansas Constitution can be interpreted to apply to redistricting. Attorneys defending the maps argued politically slanted lines were an inherent part of allowing legislators to handle redistricting, though this perspective earned pushback from some members of the high court. Meanwhile, lawyers representing three sets of challengers to the maps’ allowability argued they were produced from a clear intent to hamstring certain racial and political groups, clashing with one of the court’s conservative judges in the process. At issue is whether the district lines illicitly divide the Kansas City, Kansas, area or improperly place Lawrence in the sweeping 1st Congressional District dominated by western Kansas. The maps were enacted by the Legislature over the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly but were later struck down when Wyandotte County District Court Judge Bill Klapper ruled the maps to be racial and partisan gerrymandering in an April ruling.\n\nKentucky\n\nPineville: The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration has cited the owners of an eastern Kentucky surface mine where a worker was killed by a falling tree, according to a published report. Nally & Hamilton Enterprises was cited for not following a plan that required removing trees on top of the mine’s high wall and for failing to identify, report and correct a hazardous situation, the federal agency said, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. A tree fell from the high wall above the roadway at the Bell County mine in January and struck a vehicle with two workers as it passed. One worker died, and another was seriously injured. The federal agency said Nally & Hamilton did not make sure that trees were cleared a safe distance from the edge of the top of the high wall. In addition, inspections for possible hazardous conditions at the mine were inadequate and contributed to the accident, the mine safety agency concluded. Weather conditions also likely played a role, with heavy precipitation and cycles of freezing and thawing that caused conditions which loosened support for the tree, the report said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Now is the time to head off a COVID-19 surge like the one that swamped area hospitals last summer, the head of the New Orleans Health Department said Tuesday. Case counts average 155 a day, five times higher than a month ago, and wastewater tests show increased coronavirus concentrations in both residential and tourist areas, Dr. Jennifer Avegno said. She noted that many people use home tests, so the case count “is a big underrepresentation.” She asked residents and visitors to mask up in indoor public spaces, get tested if they have been exposed to someone with the disease and get treated if appropriate. “We’re not surprised at a summer surge. This is the third year in a row,” Avegno said in a livestreamed news conference. “But none of us want to have the surge we did last year” from the delta variant of the coronavirus. She said the city is not ordering masks and noted that many residents followed previous recommendations. “Short-term but widespread indoor masking can return to not needing masks much quicker,” she said. Wastewater testing for coronavirus concentration, new since last summer, let the city “see this coming and predict the rise in cases and mobilize resources more quickly than we have in the past,” Avegno said.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: Attorney General Aaron Frey said the state is preparing for a lawsuit against manufacturers of so-called forever chemicals. Frey said at the Democratic State Convention last weekend that steps are being taken to “hold these chemical manufacturers to account.” He said an announcement could be made within weeks. The Bangor Daily News reports that the attorney general is enlisting outside counsel to assist his office. In September, the state asked law firms to submit proposals for the work. The last time that happened was during negotiations on the multistate tobacco settlement of 1998, Frey said. The lawsuit is expected to target manufacturers of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and similar chemicals that have been used in a variety of products. PFAS-contaminated soil has been found in several locations around the state. Gov. Janet Mills and lawmakers set aside $60 million of a $1.2 billion spending package this year for PFAS relief.\n\nMaryland\n\nSnow Hill: The Black-Eyed Susan riverboat will undergo partial repairs. Town Council members voted 2-1 in favor of committing to repairs that would allow the stern-wheel paddleboat to stay in service at a reduced capacity while officials seek additional funding for a full restoration. The move will preserve the boat’s purpose “as a tourist attraction and economic driver for the Lower Eastern Shore,” according to a news release from Town Manager Rick Pollitt. Snow Hill purchased the riverboat in 2020 using a combination of grant money and loans from the county and state. The Black-Eyed Susan was then in the fourth year of a five-year mandated U.S. Coast Guard inspection routine, the release said. Voyages started in August 2021 with Washington’s Inc. as the operator responsible for catered cruises along the Pocomoke River. The Black-Eyed Susan was then taken in February to Colonna’s Shipyard in Norfolk for an extensive inspection that revealed multiple issues with the hull, hydraulics system and paddlewheel frame, according to the release. Repairs were estimated at more than $600,000, a price tag outside the town budgetary means. Consultation with legal counsel determined it would also be expensive for the town to try to sell the Black-Eyed Susan on the open market.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state has agreed to pay $56 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by the families of veterans who died or became sick after contracting COVID-19 at a state-run veterans’ care center during one of the deadliest outbreaks at a long-term care facility in the U.S., officials said Thursday. The families of 84 veterans who died during the outbreak at the Holyoke Soldiers’ Home will receive a minimum of $400,000 each, while 84 veterans who contracted the disease and survived will receive a minimum of $10,000 under terms of the settlement that requires a federal judge’s approval. “The suit contends that what happened at the Soldiers’ Home was so severe that it rose to the level of a deprivation of the veterans’ constitutional rights to be free from harms recklessly created by the government,” Tom Lesser, one of the families’ attorneys, said in a statement. “No amount of money can bring back the veterans who died or erase the pain and suffering that this tragedy needlessly caused those veterans and their families, but justice required that those wrongs not go unaddressed,” he said. “This settlement recognizes that the tragedy was preventable and never should have happened.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A judge on Tuesday suspended the state’s dormant, decades-old ban on abortion, which means the procedure would not be illegal in Michigan even if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its historic Roe v. Wade decision. The Michigan law, which makes it a crime to assist in an abortion, has been on the books since 1931. But it has had no practical effect since the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. The court, however, could throw out that landmark ruling before July, leaving abortion issues for each state to decide. Court of Claims Judge Elizabeth Gleicher granted a preliminary injunction sought by Planned Parenthood of Michigan, saying the abortion ban likely violates the state constitution. “After 50 years of legal abortion in Michigan, there can be no doubt but that the right of personal autonomy and bodily integrity enjoyed by our citizens includes the right of a woman, in consultation with her physician, to terminate a pregnancy,” the judge said. “From a constitutional standpoint, the right to obtain a safe medical treatment is indistinguishable from the right of a patient to refuse treatment.” Gleicher said other Michigan laws regulating abortion will remain in full effect.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Former broadcaster Cory Hepola, who’s running for governor with the upstart Forward Party of Minnesota, named school administrator Tamara Uselman as his running mate Tuesday. Uselman, who lives in Pelican Rapids, is director of equity and inclusion for Fargo Public Schools in North Dakota. Before that, she was assistant superintendent for Moorhead Public Schools in Minnesota. She has also been superintendent of Bismarck Public Schools in North Dakota and superintendent of Perham-Dent Public Schools in Minnesota. “I’m pretty passionate about creating an education system that is ready to deliver what kids need today,” Uselman said at a news conference. “I also believe strongly that taxpayers deserve an academic return on their investment for education.” Hepola said he will unveil an education platform next month that will include “streaming schooling” as an option so kids, no matter where they live, can choose to focus on things like science, technology, engineering, mathematics or language arts. He said it would be in addition to in-person classes, not like the distance learning that schools used earlier in the pandemic. Democrats have criticized Hepola as a spoiler because of the chance he could peel away votes from incumbent Gov. Tim Walz in what’s expected to be a close election.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Nearly 45 million gallons of untreated wastewater were released into the environment over a four-month period due to sewer failures in Jackson, according to the latest quarterly report the city submitted to federal regulators. The report, required under Jackson’s sewer consent decree, covers the period from Dec. 1 through March 21, WLBT-TV reports. It was submitted April 30. During the reporting period, 259 sewer overflows were reported in Jackson, which released more than 44.7 million gallons of sewage into the environment. An estimated 33.9 million gallons went into waters classified as “Waters of the U.S.” Under terms of its sewer decree, the city is fined for each overflow that reaches one of those waters. Jackson entered into the decree in 2012 with the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Justice to bring its sewer system into compliance with federal water quality laws. According to the city’s annual report, Jackson does not have the funding or the manpower to address overflows or other decree mandates. City officials said Jackson also has equipment issues. According to the report, two of the city’s four trucks used to clean grease and solids out of clogged lines were down for repairs.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Workers at a public library system based in the city are voting this week on whether to become the only active public librarians union in the state. If employees at the Daniel Boone Regional Library, which has branches in Columbia, Fulton, Ashland and Holts Summit, ratify the union, they would join a growing movement toward unionization across the country, sparked in part by the coronavirus pandemic. The issues supporters cite are typical of most union efforts: the need for better pay and benefits, career opportunities, and safety concerns, as well as a lack of communication with administrators. Union supporters say the pandemic produced a variety of issues and underscored some that already existed: high staff turnover, differing treatment of employees, abuse of staff by patrons over masking, and a lack of clear direction for pandemic-related work. Tori Patrick, a full-time circulation assistant at the library, said there was strong support for the union but acknowledged some employees do not think a union is necessary, particularly in the smaller branches outside Columbia. “That was a hard connection to make. We didn’t know who worked there and how to talk to them,” Patrick said. “We have made some strong inroads, but we’re still facing a difficult path to connection with some workers.”\n\nMontana\n\nWarm Springs: The state health department confirmed Tuesday that it is investigating an allegation of a patient-on-patient sexual assault that occurred at the Montana State Hospital over the weekend, the Daily Montanan reports. According to an employee who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution, the alleged assault happened about 11 p.m. Friday. When a nurse checked on patients at shift change, the nurse found two male patients in the unit’s TV room, where one patient was sexually assaulting the other, according to the employee, who spoke to the nurse about the incident and relayed the information to the Daily Montanan. The employee said police were called, and the hospital’s new administrator, Carter Anderson, was aware of the incident. While Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for the Department of Public Health and Human Services, would not comment on the specifics of the matter, he confirmed that the state was investigating and that police had been called to the facility, as reported to the Daily Montanan by two staff members. “Due to confidentiality, we cannot comment on the matter at this point in time,” Ebelt said in an email.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts said he would push to outlaw abortion, without exceptions for rape or incest, if the U.S. Supreme Court follows through with a draft opinion suggesting it plans to overturn Roe v. Wade. Ricketts told “State of the Union” host Dana Bash on CNN on Sunday that Roe was a “horrible constitutional decision” and, when pressed about the possibility of the exceptions, said that “they’re still babies,” according to the Omaha World-Herald.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A judge has vacated the murder conviction of a 78-year-old Las Vegas woman who spent 20 years in prison for the 1994 killing of her millionaire husband before she was paroled. Margaret Rudin was found guilty in 2001 of murder in the death of real estate mogul Ron Rudin. Prosecutors said he had been shot in the head as he slept and his body dumped in the desert. U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware ruled Sunday that Margaret Rudin had received ineffective assistance of counsel from her late defense attorney, Michael Amador, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The Clark County district attorney’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from the Associated Press about whether prosecutors were considering appealing or retrying her. Rudin, who maintained her innocence all along, was paroled in 2020. “I will be 79 years old at the end of this month, so I am very, very grateful,” she told the newspaper Monday. A socialite antiques shop owner the media later dubbed the “Black Widow,” she was indicted in 1997 in what authorities portrayed as a crime committed for financial gain. She vanished before she was indicted and spent two years as a fugitive until a tip generated by a “most wanted” TV show led to her arrest in 1999 in Massachusetts.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State House and Senate negotiators approved yet another congressional map Monday with time running out to meet both legislative and judicial deadlines. New Hampshire is one of a few states that have yet to complete the redistricting process required every 10 years to bring districts in line with population changes. Democrats hold both U.S. seats, but Republicans hold majorities in the Legislature and thus control the redistricting process. Lawmakers passed a plan in March that would have given the GOP an advantage in the 1st District, but Republican Gov. Chris Sununu promised to veto it. The House later passed a second plan that would clump together communities along the I-93 corridor, but the Senate rejected it, sending the matter to a committee of conference to come up with a compromise. Under the plan approved by the committee Monday, the 1st District would cover the southeast corner of the state, while the 2nd District would cover the western half of the state and the north country. Lawmakers said it would give Republicans an edge in the 1st District, though not as prominently as the previous plans. The only Democrat on the conference committee, Sen. Donna Soucy, of Manchester, said putting the state’s two largest cities in the same district was a disservice to rural communities.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: More than a century after its birth in North Jersey, the film industry is in the midst of a Garden State resurgence. Gov. Phil Murphy and local officials were in Newark on Tuesday to announce the latest project: a $125 million film and television studio to be built over the next two years at the site of a former public housing project in the South Ward. The facility, to be anchored by Lionsgate Studio, is expected to create more than 600 jobs for the region, with a priority given to Newark residents, as well as internships and educational opportunities to be overseen by the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, state officials said. “One of my administration’s priorities has been to enhance New Jersey’s film industry and create new revenue streams for our state,” Murphy said in a statement released Tuesday. “With the addition of the Lionsgate Newark Studio, New Jersey will cement its position as a hub for television and film production.” Set to open in 2024, the 300,000 square-foot facility will be a joint project by Lionsgate, the arts center and Great Points Studio, a studio management business that will own the site. The property has sat unoccupied since 2015, when the Seth Boyden Housing project was abandoned. The buildings were demolished in February.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: In a marked departure from his recent findings, the independent monitor overseeing the Albuquerque Police Department reforms wrote in his latest report that he saw – “perhaps for the first time” – a serious willingness to identify and correct behavior that is counter to the effort. Also for the first time, the chief and his top brass have articulated an end date to the process. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal, Police Chief Harold Medina said their goal is that the department will be in full compliance with the Court Approved Settlement Agreement in two years. The agreement made between the city of Albuquerque and the U.S. Department of Justice in 2014 lays out the requirements for reforming APD after federal investigators found officers had a pattern and practice of using excessive force. “We may not meet that goal, and we could get criticized later that we didn’t meet our goal,” Medina said. “But we’re going to set the goal. … We’re going to believe in ourselves, and we’re going to try our best. If, two years from now, we recognize we need one more period, well, you know what, it’s a whole lot better than anybody else has done.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A court-appointed expert has released a draft of new congressional maps for the state that are more favorable to Republicans than the original gerrymandered political maps drawn by Democrats. The draft maps released Monday would help the GOP by creating five districts that lean Republican and at least four other districts where Republicans would be competitive. Maps drawn by the Democratic-controlled Legislature as part of the redistricting process occurring every 10 years would have given Democrats a strong majority in 22 of 26 congressional districts, starting with this year’s election, but those maps were struck down by a court. Currently, the state has 27 congressional districts but is losing one as a result of the 2020 census. Republicans hold eight of those seats. The proposed maps could also pit several incumbents against each other or force them to run in new areas. The new maps are a blow to national Democrats’ plans draw favorable maps in New York in order to maximize the number of seats they could win in the U.S. House of Representatives. Last month, New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, ruled those maps and others for the state Senate were unconstitutional and failed to abide by an anti-gerrymandering process approved by voters.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Last fall, the General Assembly approved $30 million to address a lack of air conditioning in the state’s prison system. But with summer approaching, none of the actual construction has begun. WRAL-TV reports that although most prisons have at least some air conditioning, about 15,400 beds are in rooms without it, according to a breakdown provided by the state. Prison officials in Gov. Roy Cooper’s administration hope to have the first three projects complete around the start of next year. At the North Carolina Correctional Institute for Women in Raleigh – the system’s largest facility for women – three-quarters of the beds don’t have air conditioning. Kristie Puckett Williams, the North Carolina American Civil Liberties Union’s deputy director for engagement and mobilization, said the temperature can surpass 100 degrees inside the prison in the summer. The campus will be one of the first prisons retrofitted with air conditioning. Prisons spokesman John Bull said Dan River Prison Work Farm and Caswell Correctional Center are also top priorities. Bull said several things complicate the effort, including the high demand right now for construction crews across the economy, as well as supply chain issues.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Despite millions of dollars in promised subsidies, a unit of the state’s only Fortune 500 company says it won’t pursue plans to build a natural gas pipeline from western North Dakota’s oil patch to the eastern part of the state. WBI Energy, a subsidiary of Bismarck-based MDU Resources Group, said the project is not viable due to regulatory uncertainty, limited in-state demand, and rising construction, labor and land-acquisition costs. In a letter to North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad, the company said materials and construction costs have risen up to 50% in just the past nine months. “The recent and potential future inflationary pressure presents a significant challenge to a large-scale pipeline project from western to eastern North Dakota,” the company said. “This challenge is further compounded by the fact that the actual construction of a major pipeline project, if it were to proceed, would occur four to five years in the future, following an uncertain siting/regulatory process.” The Legislature in November set aside $150 million in federal coronavirus aid to help construct such a trans-state pipeline for natural gas, which is a byproduct of oil production. The idea, backed by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum, was to help cut down on the wasteful flaring at well sites and send the gas elsewhere to spur industrial development.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: High school principals in the state have overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to allow prep athletes to sign deals cashing in on their name, image and likeness, the Ohio High School Athletic Association said Tuesday. In voting that began May 1 and finished Monday, principals from OHSAA member schools voted 538-254 not to allow the marketing deals for high school athletes. Students would lose their athletic eligibility were they to sign such a deal. The principals could vote again on the deals at a later date. “If NIL is going to enter the Ohio interscholastic landscape, we want the schools to be the ones to make that determination,” said OHSAA Executive Director Doug Ute in a statement. “Whatever we do moving forward, it will include discussion on this issue with our school administrators, Board of Directors, staff and leaders of other state high school athletic associations.” OHSAA spokesperson Tim Stried previously said the organization opposed marketing deals for high school athletes. While there are exceptions, the amounts college athletes are earning from NIL deals are small. According to data gathered by Opendorse Deals, the average payout since July for large-school Division I athletes is $664. It’s just $59 for Division II athletes and $43 for Division III athletes.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The three known living survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre are receiving a $1 million donation from a New York philanthropic organization. Business for Good co-founders Ed and Lisa Mitzen say 108-year-old Viola Ford Fletcher, 107-year-old Lessie Benningfield Randle and 101-year-old Hughes Van Ellis will share the donation. Ed Mitzen, a businessman and philanthropist, told reporters in Tulsa that he was prompted to make the donation after reading news reports about the massacre. Business for Good did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment Tuesday. Fletcher, Randle and Ellis previously received $100,000 each from the Justice for Greenwood Foundation, a Tulsa-based nonprofit. The three and descendants of victims are currently suing the city of Tulsa and other entities for reparations for the destruction and lost wealth as a result of the massacre, in which a white mob attacked and killed hundreds of Black residents. The mob destroyed what had been the nation’s most prosperous Black business district in the northeastern Oklahoma city. A Tulsa judge earlier this month rejected a request to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state remains poised to see a potentially “challenging” wildfire season this summer, despite a wet and cool spring in much of western Oregon, one of the state’s top fire watchers said Monday. The rain and snow have helped to push back a fire season that threatened to start as early as this month, according to Mike Shaw, fire chief with the Oregon Department of Forestry. But he noted much of the precipitation on the coast and in the Willamette Valley hasn’t made it over the Cascade Mountains to central, southern and eastern Oregon, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Expanding drought conditions there have set the stage for fires to spread rapidly later this summer, Shaw said. “This will likely translate to a very challenging fire season,” Shaw said at a news conference. “The fires that start in these regions will be very hard to suppress.” Gov. Kate Brown said climate change has added complexity to the state’s wildfire response. She has declared drought in 15 counties – the earliest Oregon has seen that level of water scarcity in recent history. The state is preparing with help from Senate Bill 762, which Brown signed into law last year. The bill provided for additional firefighting aircraft and money to hire more wildland firefighters. Crews are expected to be strategically placed around the state.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLancaster: It will take several days for Lancaster County to count all its mail ballots because some of them will not scan, officials announced at a news conference Tuesday. Elections officials found Tuesday morning that many of the mail ballots would not scan because they contained the wrong identification code, according to a news release. The county faced a similar problem in the 2021 primary with a different mail ballot vendor, which the county fired. As of early Tuesday morning, the office had received more than 21,000 completed mail ballots, said Christa L. Miller, chief registrar/chief clerk of elections. To fix the issue, the elections staff will remark the affected mail ballots so they can be scanned into the scanner, but it will take longer than normal, Lancaster County Vice Chairman Commissioner Joshua G. Parsons said. The last time this happened, Miller said, it took about four days. “We’ll do it as fast as possible, but our main priority is accuracy and not how fast we can do something,” Miller said. A Pennsylvania Department of State spokesperson said it is not aware of any other counties reporting this problem. Lancaster County has the sixth-largest population in the state.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State lawmakers unveiled changes Tuesday to a bill to legalize and regulate recreational marijuana, aiming to ensure the legislation passes the General Assembly. The amended bill was released Tuesday in advance of committee votes scheduled for Wednesday. Both the House and Senate are expected to vote next week. The bill now provides for the automatic expungement of any prior conviction for possession of cannabis that would be decriminalized by the legislation, without requiring a person to file a request, pay a fee or have a hearing. The expungements would occur by July 1, 2024, with an expedited process offered for anyone who wants to have their record expunged sooner. In the original bill, an expungement had to be requested. The start date for recreational sales was pushed from Oct. 1 to Dec. 1. The amended bill would eliminate current fees charged to patients and caregivers for registration in the state’s medical marijuana program. Lawmakers also changed how people would be appointed to the commission that would oversee the industry, to address concerns raised by the governor about separation of powers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor has quietly signed into law a bill that would ban transgender students from playing girls’ or women’s sports in public schools and colleges as the state joins about a dozen others that have passed similar laws in the past two years. The bill was one of 43 acts Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law Monday with no fanfare or ceremony. McMaster posted on Twitter the next day that he was proud to enact the proposal to protect young men and women. Just before the Republican-dominated General Assembly passed the proposal earlier this month, McMaster said that “I think the girls ought to play girls, and the boys ought to play boys. That’s the way we’ve always done it.” When asked if he meant biological boys, the Republican governor responded: “Are there any other kind?” The law requires transgender students to compete with the “biological sex” listed on their birth certificates “filed at or near the time” of birth. Supporters of a ban warn that in a rapidly changing society, transgender girls would have an unfair biological advantage from having been born stronger males. Opponents of the bill said it is a cruel idea, singling out students who are not elite athletes but are just looking for a way to be a regular student, hang out with friends and learn life lessons through competition.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: In a private 2020 meeting, Republicans in the state Senate planned how to achieve an already-negotiated outcome to a committee investigating a pair of lawmakers for being intoxicated during legislative proceedings even before the committee had a chance to meet, according to a television report. A transcript of the April 2020 Republican caucus meeting obtained by KELO-TV showed how Republicans held a private caucus meeting to discuss how to quickly and quietly resolve a legislative investigation into the two most powerful senators at the time, Sens. Kris Langer and Brock Greenfield. The pair were accused of showing up intoxicated at a legislative session that had stretched into the early morning hours as lawmakers discussed the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For critics of Republican rule in South Dakota’s Statehouse, the revelation of the meeting’s details provided an egregious example of how the fate of bills and the workings of state government are often decided in closed-door GOP meetings. “It’s very closed, very secretive,” said Peggy Gibson, a former Democratic House member who spent years advocating, mostly without success, for ethics reforms in the Legislature. “Everything is decided ahead of time.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Tuesday struck down the state’s first-of-its-kind law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger makes permanent her previous decision from July 2021 that blocked enforcement of the law just days after it took effect. Businesses had sued over the law, arguing the signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. In her latest decision, the judge deemed the law “a brazen attempt to single out trans-inclusive establishments and force them to parrot a message that they reasonably believe would sow fear and misunderstanding about the very transgender Tennesseans whom those establishments are trying to provide with some semblance of a safe and welcoming environment.” The 2021 law was signed by Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who has approved a wide range of bills targeting the LGBTQ community with the support of the state’s GOP-controlled Legislature. In the past several years, Tennessee has enacted more anti-LGBTQ laws than almost any other state in the country, with five approved last year and more signed this year.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: With an unseasonably hot May giving the state’s strained power grid about all it can handle, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas says it’s ready for demand for electricity to hit anticipated record levels amid even hotter temperatures this summer. ERCOT, the state agency charged with operating the grid, said this week that generation capacity is expected to be sufficient to serve peak summer demand “under normal system conditions” and most of the scenarios it has modeled for moderately worse to extreme weather and grid conditions. But it remains to be seen if Texans will find the agency’s annual summer assessment of the grid reassuring. ERCOT issued a call for conservation Friday, urging people to turn up thermostats and avoid using big appliances during peak hours through Sunday. It attributed the need for conservation to high demand amid hotter-than-normal temperatures and unanticipated outages at six generation plants. In addition, ERCOT has spent much of May asking power generators to postpone taking their plants offline for scheduled maintenance. Power generators in Texas often perform maintenance in the spring to prepare for the hot summer months.\n\nUtah\n\nKanab: A teenager visiting Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park died Sunday after he was entrapped beneath a sand dune that had collapsed on him a day prior. Ian Spendlove, a 13-year-old from the St. George suburbs, was pronounced dead Sunday after not regaining brain activity lost in the incident, the Utah State Parks Department said Monday. After a family member alerted authorities, park rangers arrived at Spendlove’s location Saturday evening to dig him out from what they said was about 6.5 feet of sand. Rangers said they believed Spendlove had been digging a tunnel into the sand dune when it collapsed on him. After rangers and Kane County Sheriff’s deputies rescued him and found he had a pulse, Spendlove was transported to St. George Regional Hospital and then to Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City, where he was declared dead. The department said the incident remains under investigation and urged visitors to be safe, wear helmets or life jackets, and alert others of recreation plans when in state parks. “The Utah Division of State Parks extends our condolences to Ian Spendlove’s friends and family impacted by this tragedy,” it said in the press release.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he’s running for reelection. Scott said he is seeking a fourth two-year term in November because there’s much more work to do. The governor said in a campaign email that he has worked to bring people together at a time when the country seems more polarized than ever. “We’ve proven that when we put politics aside and pull together, we can successfully navigate a once-in-a-century pandemic better than most every other state across the country,” Scott said. He said his priority will be on doing his job as governor and not campaigning. “I’ve never run a negative campaign and never will, because Vermonters, and all Americans, deserve a better and more civil political space – if for no other reason than to be better role models for our children, because they’re watching us,” he said. No candidates have filed paperwork with the state yet, but activist Brenda Siegel, a Democrat, has announced she is running for the seat.\n\nVirginia\n\nOrange: The board that manages former President James Madison’s Montpelier estate has elected 11 new members representing descendants of people once enslaved there. Monday’s vote came two months after the board had retracted a commitment to share power with a group representing African Americans who trace their roots to the historic estate. New members were selected from 20 nominees submitted last month by the Montpelier Descendants Committee, a nationwide group drawn from the descendants’ community of the historic site in Orange County, Virginia, the Culpeper Star-Exponent reports. The new board members include scholars, historians, two university deans and former CNN anchor Soledad O’Brien. They will oversee management of the home of Madison, the fourth president known as the father of the Constitution; his wife, Dolley; and their enslaved workers. The committee and the foundation’s new appointees invited the candidates who were not chosen to join an advisory council so they all can help, said Cultural Heritage Partners, a law firm representing the descendants committee. All of the candidates agreed to serve. The board now has 25 members, including 14 endorsed by the committee, according to Greg Werkheiser of Cultural Heritage Partners, general counsel to the committee.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: State Supreme Court Justice Raquel Montoya-Lewis announced Monday that she will be on family medical leave for the court’s spring term to concentrate on her health, but officials with the court didn’t release additional details, citing the justice’s desire for privacy. The high court’s spring oral arguments began Tuesday and end June 28. “I look forward to returning to the Court as quickly as possible and would like to express my appreciation of the support of my staff and colleagues during this time,” Montoya-Lewis said in a statement released by the Administrative Office of the Courts. Wendy Ferrell, associate director of the Administrative Office of the Courts, said in an email that Montoya-Lewis has been meeting with her medical team “and appreciates privacy during this time while she concentrates on her well-being.” Montoya-Lewis, an enrolled member of the Pueblo of Isleta who is the court’s first Native American justice, was appointed by Gov. Jay Inslee in December 2019 and sworn in the following month to fulfill the remaining year of the late Chief Justice Mary Fairhurst, who had been battling cancer and stepped down to focus on her treatment. Fairhurst died in December at age 64.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A city has been ordered to stop opening its council meetings with the Lord’s Prayer. U.S. District Judge John T. Copenhaver Jr. ruled Tuesday that Parkersburg City Council’s practice of opening its meetings with the New Testament prayer violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which prohibits government from favoring one religion over others. The judge issued a permanent injunction against the prayer recitation and awarded $1 in damages to each plaintiff. Copenhaver ruled in a lawsuit filed by the Freedom from Religion Foundation. The Madison, Wisconsin-based group and two of its members sued the city in 2018. The judge issued a permanent injunction against the prayer recital and awarded $1 in damages to each plaintiff. The lawsuit said residents stood at each Parkersburg City Council meeting to recite the prayer with council members. Plaintiffs Daryl Cobranchi and Eric Engle of Parkersburg attended some meetings, remained seated and did not participate in the prayer’s recital.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two Democratic electors and a voter on Tuesday sued Republicans who attempted to cast electoral ballots for Donald Trump in 2020 despite Joe Biden’s victory in the battleground state. Their lawsuit filed in Dane County Circuit Court alleges a conspiracy by Trump and his allies to overturn his loss in the presidential race, calling it “as legally baseless as it was repugnant to democracy.” It seeks up to $2.4 million in damages as well as disqualifying the Republicans from ever serving as electors again. The plaintiffs say it’s the first such lawsuit in the seven swing states where GOP electors falsely declared Trump the winner and cast their votes for him in December 2020. “It’s essential to have accountability and to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” said Jeffrey Mandell, an attorney for the plaintiffs. “We have heard in the more than a year since the fraudulent electors met the excuse that what they did was not wrong, it was totally fine. We want a court to make clear that is not true.” Republican electors named in the lawsuit who have spoken publicly about what they did have long argued that they weren’t trying to change the Wisconsin result. Instead, they said, they were trying to preserve all their legal options in case a court ruled in favor of Trump.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The state has the nation’s worst rate of workplace fatalities, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Wyoming ranked worst in the U.S. in 2020 and consistently has one of the highest rates of occupational fatalities, according to U.S. Labor Department data cited by the newspaper. From 2008 to 2018, the state saw one worker die every 12 days, the News&Guide reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}]}

But he kept the faith in himself and his ability.\n\nNow, in his first season as a University of Delaware player after transferring, defending teams practically don’t have a prayer when Davis gets the basketball.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Sanford School graduate from Newark continued his stellar play Monday night at the Carpenter Center, contributing 14 points on 7-for-9 shooting and a game-high 14 rebounds to the Blue Hens’ 81-60 win over James Madison.\n\nBOX SCORE: Delaware 81, JMU 60\n\nA career-high 30 points from Jameer Nelson Jr. led the Blue Hens. But even Nelson marveled at Davis, who earned his third straight Colonial Athletic Association Rookie of the Week honor earlier Monday.\n\n“He might be Rookie of the Week for the rest of the season,” Nelson said, “but I feel like, you get a little recognition it’s like ‘Oh, I can do this all the time.’ . . . There’s no ceiling for him now.’’\n\nFive of Davis’s seven baskets Monday were dunks, much to the delight of the 1,298 in attendance and his teammates.\n\n“Man, look out,” Nelson said of Davis’ willingness, confidence and ferocity while going to the basket.\n\nCAA STANDINGS: Blue Hens try to stay in hunt for top spot\n\nDavis had been a regular contributor off the bench for the Blue Hens, scoring 11 points in a Dec. 5 win over UMBC before missing two games with an injury and two more with a non-COVID illness in December.\n\nBut he has been a force since stepping in for first-team All-CAA post Dylan Painter, who suffered an ankle injury at Towson Jan. 27 and has played only 10 minutes in Saturday’s loss to Hofstra since.\n\nDavis has shot 68 percent (34-for-50) and averaged 15.2 points in the last five games.\n\nDelaware improved to 17-9 overall and 8-5 in the CAA Monday in its last league contest against James Madison (14-11, 5-9), set for a summer move to the Sun Belt Conference driven by a desire to play Bowl Subdivision football.\n\n“Dylan got hurt and it’s just next man up and I’m just happy I can help my team win,” Davis said.\n\nSUPER FOR REEDER: Sallies grad, Ex-Hen part of winning Rams\n\nWhen Davis decided to transfer last year, Delaware, which had recruited him in high school and was close to home, was a comfortable option.\n\nBut Davis didn’t feel wounded by his Providence experience. He arrived at Delaware still confident in his abilities.\n\n“Throughout that whole process,” he said, “everybody was just telling me God has a plan for everybody. And that’s something I just lived by and something I made sure to take on during tough times.\n\n“I never really lost confidence in myself,” he added. “I definitely put the work in by spending time in the gym. A lot of those shots and a lot of the things I do out there in games and stuff are things I’ve done hundreds of times, every morning, every night.”\n\nRARE REUNION: Ex-Hens Pegues, Brey square off as coaches\n\nEven if players transfer from a Big East program such as Providence to mid-major Delaware, it’s still a high level of college basketball, Delaware coach Martin Ingelsby pointed out. There are plenty of challenges and adjustments, and they can take time.\n\nNow Davis is seeing the positive results of his diligence and a mindful approach,\n\n“He is a student of the game,” Ingelsby said. “He’s a hard worker. He’s got great instincts and just being back in the gym with a coaching staff that really has believed in him and given him confidence . . . It wasn’t always smooth sailing. There were some hard days. There were some tough days.\n\n“But he loves to compete and I think he’s very comfortable with who he is as a basketball player now and how he can make an impact for us.”\n\nHOT HAND: Hens can’t cool Hofstra shooters in loss\n\nDavis initially was straying more toward the perimeter than Delaware wanted. Ingelsby and his staff felt Davis could be most effective in the post, which has proven to be quite perceptive.\n\n“Make your mark around the basket,” Ingelsby said of the staff's message to Davis. “That’s where you have an advantage at this level. And I think he’s just comfortable with who he is. He had some success and all of a sudden you see the impact he can make. He’s scary talented with what he can do with his size and physicality.”\n\nAs an example, Ingelsby mentioned Davis rebounding his own miss in traffic late in the first half Monday and slam-dunking the putback.\n\n“When I first got here I settled for a lot jump shots,” Davis said, before coaches \"talked to me about making sure I go strong to the basket and just see if I can get the easy one. I’ve been doing that the last couple games.”\n\nThe results have often been prolific.\n\n“He’s a focal point of our offense now,” Ingelsby said. “ . . . He’s having fun playing basketball and that’s really I think what we’ve been able to pull out of him. Just get back to having fun.”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

He’d broken a bone on the outside of his hand, below his pinkie, when he tripped dashing up the steps at a friend’s apartment after a job interview earlier in the week.\n\nIn practice leading up to the Towson game, Torzsa had several opportunities for interceptions but dropped the football. The pad over his cast covers his fingers, making it look like a club.\n\n“I haven’t caught the ball at all in practice still this week,” Torzsa, a UD co-captain, said Thursday. “Have not caught anything. Dropped two more yesterday.’’\n\nAgainst Towson, Torzsa cradled the football on his first interception but it slipped through his grasp. He was able to hold onto it when he lifted his right leg to help secure the football against his chest and abdomen.\n\nHis second was a diving, one-armed grab — using his uncasted right hand — that made ESPN’s Top 10 plays.\n\n“It’s funny I caught the two in the game,” he said, “probably the hardest ones. But it doesn’t really affect me too much. I can’t wrap up and grab cloth when I’m tackling but I still have one hand to catch it and to tackle. But besides that, I’m doing all right. I’ll be just fine the last three games. Hopefully I can get a couple more.”\n\nThe interceptions were the fourth and fifth of Torzsa’s UD career but his first of this season.\n\nDelaware (3-5 overall, 1-4 CAA) visits Albany (5-3, 2-3) Saturday at 1 p.m. as it tries to finish the season strong, despite its FCS playoff hopes being extinguished. Games at Richmond and home against archrival Villanova close the season.\n\n“We’re still playing for a winning season, we can win out,” said Torzsa, who won’t get the cast off until after the season. “You know, 6-5 is not a bad record. Obviously, the ball hasn’t bounced our way this year but we have no one to blame but ourselves for the position that we’re in and only [we] can get us out of this position.”\n\nCAA honors Nauck\n\nDelaware sophomore Greta Nauck, the nation’s leading scorer with 24 goals, was named CAA Player of the Year in field hockey on Thursday.\n\nThe Blue Hens’ Rolf van de Kerkhof was named CAA coach of the year.\n\nDelaware's Nauck has been sensation in field hockey\n\nJoining Nauck on the All-CAA first team for Delaware were senior Esmee Peet and juniors Taylor Lister and Emmeline Oltmans. Second-team choices were sophomores Kiki Bink and Lisa Giezeman. Freshmen Sarah Horgan and Ally Pollak were All-Rookie picks and senior Marjelle Scheffers was an All-Academic choice.\n\nNo. 9-ranked Delaware (17-2 overall, 6-0 CAA) has won a school-record 13 straight going into Friday’s 3 p.m. CAA Tournament semifinal against Drexel (8-10, 3-3) at Rullo Stadium. William & Mary (9-9, 5-1) meets James Madison (12-6, 4-2) in the second semifinal at 6 p.m.\n\nWinners return for the 1 p.m. Sunday title game, with the CAA’s automatic NCAA Tournament berth at stake, though Delaware, the three-time defending champ, may have already done enough to warrant an at-large berth if it loses.\n\nSoccer awaits CAA foe\n\nDelaware (10-7-1 overall, 5-3 CAA) is the No. 2 seed for the CAA Men’s Soccer Tournament. The Hens will face the winner of Saturday’s first-round game between host No. 3 seed UNCW (8-5-3, 3-2-3 CAA) and No. 6 College of Charleston (5-8-3, 3-3-2 CAA) on Nov. 11 at 4:30 p.m. at Hofstra in the semifinals.\n\nTop-seeded Hofstra (9-7-1, 7-1) gets Saturday’s Elon-William & Mary winner that night. The title game is Nov. 13 at 2:30 p.m. at Hofstra and will be aired on the American Sports Network.\n\nWith a national RPI of 74, Delaware would likely have to win the CAA to reach the NCAA Tournament, despite its recent strong showing against top-ranked Maryland. Delaware led the Terps 2-1 late but fell 3-2 in overtime. Hofstra is 26th in the RPI.\n\nNine different teams have won the CAA Tournament title the last nine years, including Delaware in 2011 and Hofstra last year. Delaware lost in the finals the last two years.\n\nDelaware ranks 16th in NCAA Division I with 32 goals, with senior Guillermo Delgado’s 11 goals tied for No. 8 nationally. Delgado scored both goals against Maryland, giving him a UD career record 48 to surpass Mike Biggs, who scored 47 in just three seasons (1968-70).\n\nHen scratch\n\nAmong those prominently mentioned as top candidates for the permanent Delaware football coaching job is Matt Nagy, the record-setting quarterback who led the Hens to the NCAA semifinals as a senior in 2000. But Nagy, 38, is already on a potentially promising NFL career track. He’s in his fourth season on Andy Reid’s Kansas City Chiefs staff, having served as quarterbacks coach and now co-offensive coordinator with Brad Childress. Nagy had a successful Arena League career before joining Reid’s staff when he was Philadelphia Eagles coach.\n\nFormer UD wide receiver Joey Bleymaier is in his first year on the Chiefs’ staff as offensive quality control coach.\n\nUD volleyball has won five of six under interim coach Brian Toron but has tough home matches against CAA front-runner Northeastern on Friday and second-place Hofstra on Sunday.\n\nDelaware is a week away from the start of its basketball seasons with the men hosting Division II Goldey Beacom Nov. 11, one of just four home games before Christmas, and the women entertaining former CAA rival George Mason, now in the Atlantic 10, on Nov. 13.\n\nNew UD men’s basketball coach Martin Ingelsby and 21st-year women’s coach Tina Martin will be doing regular radio shows this season live from Klondike Kate’s on Main Street beginning Monday. They’ll air from 7 to 8 p.m. on WDSD 94.7 FM on Nov. 7, Dec. 12, Jan. 3, Jan. 16, Jan. 30, Feb. 13, Feb. 27 and March 13. Ingelsby will join UD men’s basketball play-by-play voice Scott Klatzkin for the first half hour with Martin then speaking with UD women’s play-by-play announcer Matt Janus.

That determination carries over to this season, said Jasmine Dickey, last year’s CAA Player of the Year.\n\n“Last year’s over,” she said. “We’ve had some accomplishments but it’s time to build on that and improve from that and just continue to work. We have a lot of things to fix, a lot of things to improve and we’re gonna have fun on the way there.”\n\nPart of that pleasure will be from having crowds back in the Carpenter Center for home games, which was not possible last year due to COVID-19 protocols.\n\nDickey is joined on the preseason All-CAA first team by teammate Ty Battle, Drexel guards Hannah Nihill and Keishana Washington and JMU guard Kiki Jefferson. Drexel was boosted by the addition of 6-1 Bucknell transfer Tessa Brugler, a first-team All-Patriot League player.\n\nDelaware was No. 5 in NCAA Division I last year with 46.6 rebounds per game, led by Battle’s 11.1 per game and Dickey’s 9.1.\n\nBut the Hens were 240th among 336 teams nationally with a 38.37 field-goal percentage, which played a role in their CAA title-game defeat.\n\nCOLLINS WAS CONFIDENT: Mount Pleasant grad shows DI talent with Hens\n\n“We talked about where we want to be better,” said Blue Hens fifth-year coach Natasha Adair. “But that’s just the maturation process of growth. We did a lot of amazing things [in 2020-21] but that was trusting the process to get us to that point. Now we just have to keep moving forward, and so I don’t think we have to do anything different. We just have to continue to grow and evolve.”\n\nDelaware, she added, will continue to run, rebound and defend but now be “more efficient” in its half-court execution after plenty of video analysis, discussion and practice.\n\nThat will take place with a roster that returns mostly intact from last year. It also features point guard Paris McBride, who is back from a postseason injury, CAA All-Rookie guard Tyi Skinner, post stalwart Lizzie Oleary and 3-point ace Jewel Smalls. Delaware also added transfers Makayla Pippin from Kansas State and Maddie Simms from Massachusetts.\n\nThe Blue Hens open Nov. 12 at home against Princeton. They begin CAA play against James Madison Dec. 31 at the Carpenter Center with a 1 p.m. tipoff.\n\nDelaware and Drexel collide in Philadelphia Jan. 11 and in Newark Feb. 5.\n\n“Leading up to two weeks away, I just can’t contain my energy and my excitement for what’s to come,” Adair said of the season’s start.\n\n2021-22 CAA women’s basketball\n\nPreseason coaches’ poll\n\n1 – DELAWARE (5 first-place votes), 71 points\n\n1 – Drexel (5), 71\n\n3 – James Madison, 64\n\n4 – Towson, 58\n\n5 – Hofstra, 47\n\n6 – Elon, 38\n\n7 – Charleston, 33\n\n8 – William & Mary, 29\n\n9 – UNCW, 15\n\n10 – Northeastern, 12\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

Delaware was among five Colonial Athletic Association teams chosen, along with automatic qualifier William & Mary, co-champion New Hampshire, Richmond and Elon.\n\nCURSE CONTINUES:With NCAA tourney berth available, Delaware again can't beat Villanova\n\nDelaware was selected despite losing Saturday’s regular-season finale 29-26 at Villanova, where a second straight blocked punt positioned the Wildcats for the winning touchdown with 1:11 left. That jeopardized Delaware's postseason hopes enough that the team did not gather to watch the selections. But players were at the Carpenter Center for a team meal and 1 p.m. meeting and did watch on their phones, leading to a spontaneous celebration.\n\n\"I felt bad that we couldn't go prove to the rest of the country how good we thought we were [at Villanova],\" said Carty, who didn't expect the Hens to be chosen. \"Now we get a chance to.\"\n\nDelaware has lost four of its last six and two in a row, falling last Saturday 21-13 to Richmond. The Spiders kicked the go-ahead field goal with four seconds left after Delaware was stopped on downs at the UR 7 with 1:23 left.\n\nBut Delaware was still considered playoff-worthy, as its other losses were to playoff-bound William & Mary, Elon and Richmond. The Hens also had a very valuable season-opening win at FBS-level Navy. The Mids (4-7) won 17-14 Saturday at 17th-ranked Central Florida, which likely buoyed Delaware’s candidacy.\n\nLosses by other bubble teams Saturday also aided Delaware's chances. FCS tournament committee chairman Jermaine Truax, the Bucknell athletic director, suggested on ESPNU that Montana (7-4) nabbed the last available spot with CAA member Rhode Island, which Delaware downed 42-21, among those nosed out.\n\n\"It's a new season,\" Carty said. \" … We were four or five plays from being 10-1, and we weren't, though, and that's football, that's sports. So if things didn't go our way today, there would have been reasons for that, and it would have been on us, and that's us taking responsibility for that.\n\nNCAA BRACKET: See where Hens are\n\n\"But the fact that the committee saw that we were probably one of the best 24 teams in the country is certainly something that we're happy about, and we are extremely excited about and prideful about. We're ready to show the committee and the country that they made the right decision.\"\n\nOnly the top eight playoff teams are seeded. They have first-round byes. The FCS title game is at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, on Jan. 8.\n\nThe other 16 teams are bracketed with consideration given to geographic proximity when possible. The field includes 11 automatic conference champion qualifiers and 13 at-large selections.\n\nDelaware finished in a tie for sixth place with Towson and Villanova in the 13-team CAA.\n\nThe NCAA instituted championship playoffs for its lower division schools beginning in 1973, when Delaware was in the brand-new Division II. The Blue Hens moved up to Division I-AA (now FCS) in 1980. From 1973-2010, Delaware reached the NCAA playoffs 20 times, their longest drought being three seasons from 1983 through 1985.\n\nDelaware didn’t return until 2018 when it lost a first-round game at former CAA rival James Madison. Delaware had also lost to Villanova in the regular-season finale that season to finish 7-4, imperiling its playoff chances.\n\nBEST OF THE BEST:Delaware's best 16 teams of all time\n\nBut in what certainly stirred up nostalgia for the program’s previous successes, Delaware advanced to the NCAA semifinals for the 11th time in the 2021 spring season, which replaced the 2020 fall schedule erased by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Hens were unbeaten until a 33-3 loss at South Dakota State, which a week later lost to Sam Houston, where Carty was offensive coordinator under former Hens coach K.C. Keeler, in the championship.\n\nDelaware did open the 2021 spring playoffs, which involved 16 teams, at Delaware Stadium by beating Sacred Heart 19-10. That’s the only home playoff game since Delaware downed Georgia Southern 27-10 on Dec. 18, 2010, in the semifinals.\n\nDelaware won the FCS championship in 2003, when Carty was backup quarterback, and lost in title games in 1982 to Eastern Kentucky, 2007 to Appalachian State and 2010 to Eastern Washington. Before that, Delaware reached three Division II finals, beating Youngstown State in 1979 after falling to Central Michigan in 1974 and Eastern Illinois in 1978.\n\nFour previous Delaware national football championships in what was then termed the College Division were earned via wire-service polls in 1946, 1963, 1971 and 1972.\n\n\"For sure that second season is not taken for granted,\" said Carty, who was also offensive coordinator on New Hampshire's 2013 and 2014 semifinal teams. \"When you get a chance to do it it's pretty special for the program and for the community and for this university.\"\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

This was historic. This was stunning.\n\nIt was also inexcusable, in the very accurate estimation of Delaware junior forward Eric Carter.\n\nOLYMPICS: Delaware still a top training ground for high-level skaters\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS: Brawl ends Cape-Smyrna game and prompts DIAA\n\nSurely, it was an embarrassing bit of national attention, considering the headlines it garnered, for a Blue Hens basketball program that, seemingly on the upswing, instead sustained a significant blemish Thursday night in an 85-83 loss to Drexel.\n\nDelaware led by as many 34 points in the first half and took a 56-29 advantage into halftime at the Daskalakis Center, had the Dragons reeling, but ended up being floored.\n\nNot long after Drexel’s victory was complete, keyed by improved shooting and pressure defense that forced eight second-half UD turnovers, information surfaced demonstrating exactly how remarkable a rally it was -- the biggest in NCAA Division I history.\n\nThat's the kind of acclaim Delaware can do without.\n\nThe previous biggest Division I comeback was the 32-point deficit Duke erased in a Dec. 30, 1950, win over Tulane, at the Dixie Classic at Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh, according to NCAA director of media coordination statistics David Worlock.\n\nDuke basketball tweeted its congratulations to Drexel for breaking its record.\n\n“We just kind of got complacent,” Carter said, “not moving, trying to go one-on-one, not playing team basketball and they were playing team ball, moving it and getting open shots.”\n\nDelaware coach Martin Ingelsby suggested inexperience and a lack of maturity and leadership were costly, even though four of the eight Blue Hens who saw action were fourth-year players.\n\n“We just needed somebody out there to calm us down and we didn’t get that,” he said.\n\nDelaware had built a 20-point lead in less than seven minutes, went ahead by 30 fewer than 13 minutes in, and took its biggest lead on Jacob Cushing’s 3-pointer that made it 53-19 with 2:36 left in the first half. The Hens shot 62 percent from the field in the first half.\n\nBut the Hens, knowing a Drexel rally was inevitable in the second half, couldn’t stem the tide once it began to engulf them, which is both curious and a tad alarming.\n\nThe Dragons took their first lead with 1:58 left when junior guard Tramaine Isabell, a Missouri transfer, banked in two of his game-high 29 points, to go along with 12 rebounds and nine assists. After Ryan Allen’s jumper tied it, a putback by Austin Williams gave Drexel an 83-81 edge with 1:14 to go.\n\nBoth teams missed shots before Ryan Daly scored for Delaware with 10 seconds left to make it 83-83.\n\nBut a week after Delaware didn’t get a late foul call in a close loss at Towson, Darian Bryant was called for a foul on Isabell’s 3-point try with :02.2 on the clock. He made the first and third shots. Video didn’t make clear that Bryant even actually touched Isabell.\n\nCarter’s 25-foot heave at the buzzer was off the mark for Delaware.\n\n“We needed to be better on the defensive end,” said Ingelsby. “ . . . We just got careless with the basketball and kind of gave them some easy opportunities and then the tide turned and the crowd got into it, the momentum swung.\n\n“We needed to slow down on the offensive end. Their pressure really got us playing fast. I thought we took some quick shots that really hurt us and then, with their perimeter, they can get down the floor quickly and Isabell’s a really talented player. He’s difficult to guard. I kind of kick myself, maybe we should have gotten out of zone a little earlier than we did. They spread you out and they made timely threes.”\n\nIt was just one game and comebacks happen. Delaware had actually overcome a 27-point deficit -- 37-10 late in the first half – and won 70-69 at James Madison on Feb. 2, 2005.\n\nBut this came in a match-up versus the Blue Hens’ most significant adversary – Delaware-Drexel is the oldest (1912) and most-played (158 games) rivalry in the CAA – with important stakes.\n\nDelaware (12-18 overall, 5-12 CAA) and Drexel began the night tied for last place in the CAA. But, with a win, the Blue Hens could have kept on pace to finish as high as sixth in the conference and avoid the play-in round of the March 3-6 CAA Tournament.\n\nThe defeat ensures a spot in that play-in round for the bottom-four finishers, no matter what happens in Saturday’s 4 p.m. regular-season finale at the Carpenter Center against James Madison (9-20, 5-11). Seniors Anthony Mosley and Skye Johnson will be honored in pregame ceremonies.\n\nDrexel (12-18, 6-11) had lost to the Hens in Newark 72-66 on Jan. 11. Delaware missed a chance to sweep the regular-season series with Drexel for just the second time in the last 18 seasons.\n\n“We knew as a team they were going to come out fired up,” Mosley said of the second half, “especially [down 56-29 at the half] on their homecourt. We just didn’t do a good job handling the pressure. We kind of got in our own way a little bit, had a lot of turnovers, weren’t really tough with the ball and being aggressive.”\n\nThe Dragons shot 56.8 percent in the second half and were 7-for-13 on 3-pointers.\n\n“Give Drexel a lot of credit,” Ingelsby said. “They played great in the second half. I think their pressure really bothered us. We got sloppy with the basketball. They sped us up.

That was an invitation neither could refuse.\n\nThe two joined soccer two-time state player of the year Jake Ross, bound for West Virginia, at an after-school celebration Wednesday.\n\n\"Better competition. I wanted to play at the highest level I could possibly play,\" said Ray, a Wilmington resident who was offered scholarships by FCS schools Wagner, Merrimack and St. Francis and Division II West Chester and Kutztown.\n\nBoth were recruited by Delaware assistant coach Andrew Pierce, who came from South Jersey and became one of the best walk-ons in UD history. He rushed for 4,459 career yards, No. 2 in school history.\n\n\"He told me if I go in and compete the same way I did at Sallies I'll do fine,\" Ray said.\n\nSalesianum coach Bill DiNardo has no doubt Ray, one of the rare four-year starters in Sallies history, can contribute at Delaware.\n\nSIGNING DAY HAUL:Ten transfers, high school duo join Delaware football\n\nAt 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, Ray may not be as tall as prototype edge rushers, \"but he's got the fast twitch,\" DiNardo said. \"He can put on weight. He can do a lot of things. He's a great defensive end.\"\n\nDiNardo also lauded the relentlessness and athleticism of Ray, the state Class 3A Defensive Player of the Year in 2022 who also made frequent tough catches on offense and is now on the Sals' basketball team.\n\nCollins joins a suddenly deep kicking crew at Delaware, which just added transfer Alex Schmoke, a two-time first-team All-Northeast Conference pick at St. Francis, and Nate Reed, who punted and kicked off for East Stroudsburg in 2021.\n\n\"I want to go down there and prove I'm a top guy,\" said Collins, a Newark resident who was also wooed by James Madison and Temple.\n\nOnly Rhode Island (four) had fewer field goals than Delaware's six among the CAA's 13 teams last season. Delaware made just two — on eight tries — the first 10 games before junior Brandon Ratcliffe kicked 32- and 25-yarders in the regular-season finale at Villanova and 27- and 39-yarders in the FCS round-of-16 playoff defeat at South Dakota State.\n\nRatcliffe, who went 4-for-7 on field goals in 2022, shared kicking duties with true freshmen Garrett Bennion and Andrew MacMillan. They each made one of three — Bennion a 24-yarder against Towson and MacMillan a 39-yarder versus Morgan State.\n\nThe trio also shared extra-point duties, going 23-for-25 (Bennion), 11-for-11 (Ratcliffe) and 10-for-10 (MacMillan). Ratcliffe and MacMillan are presumably returning but Bennion left UD in January for a two-year Church of Latter Day Saints mission.\n\nDelaware also averaged 53.6 yards on kickoffs with a 37.8-yard net, which includes return yardage, both of which ranked 12th in the CAA. The three also shared that job.\n\nCollins, Delaware’s top high school kicker, made all 27 of his extra-point tries in 2022 and 15 of 20 field-goal tries including a 46-yarder. He also had 31 touchbacks on kickoffs.\n\n\"He was money,\" DiNardo said.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

Candidates", "text": "SOUTH BEND — Who’s next? Who knows?\n\nLet's get this out of the way now — nobody has any idea who the next coach of the Notre Dame men’s basketball team will be after the Tribune learned Jan. 19 that Mike Brey will finish out his 23rd and final season at Notre Dame before leaving as the winningest coach in program history.\n\nNobody knows who’s next, maybe not even athletic director Jack Swarbrick, who has insisted countless times during interviews over the years that he does not keep any sort of working list in a desk drawer in case of emergency.\n\nWho might get a call? Here’s a few in alphabetical order. One question you have to ask yourself when perusing possible candidates is, how good of a job is the coach of Notre Dame men’s basketball?\n\nMore:Mike Brey decides that 23 seasons at Notre Dame is enough, will leave at end of year\n\nShort answer — probably not as good as you think it is. It’s a hard job. In a hard time for college athletics. In one of the hardest leagues in the country. But it’s the job, and somebody has to do it. Maybe one of these 15 guys will.\n\nJohn Beilein\n\nSpecial development assistant, Detroit Pistons\n\nHis dream job has long been to coach at Notre Dame. It didn’t take Beilein long to flip programs at West Virginia and Michigan into perennial national powers, and he did it by doing less with more. That the 70-year-old has been out of the college game since 2019 might be a concern. Has it passed him by? Would he have the necessary juice this program needs?\n\nMark Byington\n\nHead coach, James Madison\n\nAn assistant coach at four schools previously, Byington is in his second stop as a head coach after seven seasons at Georgia Southern, where his last three teams all won at least 20 games. Byington has roots in ACC country and his teams often play a fast and focused fan-friendly style.\n\nDarian DeVries\n\nHead coach, Drake\n\nCould the head coach of a private university in the Midwest be ready to make the jump to another private university in the Midwest? In DeVries’ first four seasons at Drake, the Bulldogs won a school record 95 games. He's a two-time Missouri Valley coach of the year. He’s been at Drake for five seasons. Might not be six.\n\nRyan Humphrey\n\nAssistant coach, Oklahoma\n\nHumphrey fits the profile of how Swarbrick has previously hired in football (Marcus Freeman) and women’s basketball (Niele Ivey) — a black coach with no previous head coaching experience who just fits.\n\nHumphrey fits. He definitely would have the personality for the position. He left Notre Dame last summer for Oklahoma, in part to get a different perspective of coaching in college basketball. He’s a future head coach somewhere. Is it at his alma mater?\n\nMartin Ingelsby\n\nHead coach, Delaware\n\nThe most successful former Brey player/assistant coach as a head coach, Ingelsby drove the Blue Hens to the NCAA tournament for the first time in his career last season. Does Swarbrick want to stay on the Brey coaching tree or branch out? If it’s the former, Ingelsby would be a solid choice. No coach in the country knows the place — and how to recruit to it — better.\n\nPat Kelsey\n\nHead coach, Charleston\n\nKelsey’s made quick work of his short time in Charleston, which won 17 games last year in his first season and was ranked in January this season for the first time since 2002-03. The 45-year-old entered 2022-23 with 203 career wins, one of only four active head coaches to win at least 203 games in 10 or fewer seasons.\n\nKeep a close eye on Kelsey.\n\nDusty May\n\nHead coach, Florida Atlantic\n\nA former assistant coach at Florida, who served as a student manager at Indiana during his college days, May has led FAU to four straight winning seasons in his first four seasons. He’s young. He’s energetic. He might be ready.\n\nSteve Pikiell\n\nHead coach, Rutgers\n\nIf you can win and get to the NCAA tournament multiple seasons at Rutgers the way Pikiell has done over the previous six seasons, you can probably win anywhere. He’s a really good in-game coach and a relentless recruiter. If you can get players to Piscataway, you can get them to South Bend. At $1.6 million, his salary would fit for Notre Dame.\n\nRick Pitino\n\nHead coach, Iona\n\nWant to prove that this program can stand annually alongside the likes of Duke and North Carolina and be a true national power player? Hire one of the best college coaches in the game. Ever. He and his previous (excessive) baggage aren’t for everybody, but his results are. Pitino will win. Watch.\n\nChris Quinn\n\nAssistant coach, Miami Heat\n\nThe former Irish point guard may believe he’s in line to become an NBA head coach, which is one reason why he turned down a chance several years ago to join Brey’s staff as an assistant. He’d establish a similar type of Heat/Pat Riley type of culture in South Bend as there is down in South Florida.\n\nBob Richey\n\nHead coach, Furman\n\nIn his sixth season as head coach and 12th overall, it might be time for a change for the 39-year-old, who’s led the Paladins to four-straight 20-win seasons for the first time in school history. He also graduated North Greenville (S.C.) University summa cum laude, so you’d have a smart coach coaching smart kids at Notre Dame.\n\nDarren Savino\n\nAssistant coach, UCLA\n\nHe’s been Mick Cronin’s right-hand man since their days together at Cincinnati, where he game-planned against Notre Dame. Savino also coached at Rutgers and is a New Jersey native, so he knows where to find prospects along the all-important I-95 corridor.\n\nMicah Shrewsberry\n\nHead coach, Penn State\n\nOnce upon a time, the former Butler and Boston Celtics assistant coach became the first full-time coach in the history of the IU South Bend men’s basketball program. He’s quickly turned that Penn State program from suspect to solid.\n\nSean Sweeney\n\nAssistant coach, Dallas Mavericks\n\nWord is that being the head coach at Notre Dame is a “dream job” for Sweeney, who has such an affinity for the campus — and the football program — that he has an offseason home in South Bend. Sweeney interviewed with Brey last summer for the spot on his coaching staff that eventually went to Hamlet Tibbs.\n\nJason Williford\n\nAssociate head coach, Virginia\n\nNow in his 22nd season as a college assistant, the Virginia native has spent the last 14 at Virginia alongside Tony Bennett. The Cavaliers have done a lot and won a lot during his time in Charlottesville. Williford hasn’t had any reason to leave his alma mater. Becoming a head coach in the ACC, where he’s generally regarded as the top assistant in the conference, might be one.\n\nMonty Williams\n\nHead coach, Phoenix Suns\n\nProbably the longest of the longshots given he makes about $3 million per year. It’s still worth a call to someone who’s considered among the elite of the elite at the game’s highest level. He may not have that strong an emotional pull from the alma mater that would make him give that up. But you’ve got to call him.\n\nHe’d be a home run hire. Just like the guy he would follow.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2023/03/22/delaware-sports-hall-of-fame-class-2023-former-nfl-players-kwame-harris/70028481007/", "title": "Two ex-NFL players among Delaware Sports Hall of Fame 2023 ...", "text": "Two former National Football League players from First State high schools will be among the nine 2023 inductees to the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nNewark High graduate Kwame Harris, who was later a first-round San Francisco 49ers draft pick, and Concord alum Paul Worrilow, an undrafted linebacker who became one of the NFL’s top tacklers, will be honored May 18.\n\nThey are joined by golfer Chris Anderson, NCAA champion shot-putter Christina Hillman, official and women’s sports advocate Ruth Lajoie, swimmer Ray Peden, sprinter and hurdler Ginger Smith, boxer Joe Tiberi and roller skating champion Charles Wahlig.\n\nThe Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame is located at Frawley Stadium in Wilmington.

Social hour, silent auction and memorabilia display begin at 5:30 p.m. followed by the dinner and ceremony at 6:45.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the 2023 inductees.\n\nCHRIS ANDERSON\n\nGolf Digest named Anderson one of Delaware’s top three all-time golfers along with Porky Oliver and Dave Douglas. As an A. I. du Pont High freshman, Anderson won the Delaware Junior championship in 1977. He then won the Delaware Open a record seven times from 1983 through 2004 and is the only Delawarean to win the Philadelphia Amateur in its 125-year history. He turned pro in 1984 after graduating from the University of Virginia. Anderson won the 1991 Founders Club Match Play Championship at PGA National Golf Club. He joined the Ben Hogan Tour in 1992 and won the Variety Club Tournament of Champions of Philadelphia and was second in a playoff in the Fort Wayne Open. He also played on the Canadian PGA Tour in 1988 and qualified for the 1996 PGA championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville. After resuming his amateur status, Anderson won the Delaware Amateur in 2005.\n\nKWAME HARRIS\n\nMajor college football coaches rarely visited Delaware until Harris emerged as a four-year, two-way standout on Newark’s teams from 1996-99, the last three being state Division I champions. He was first-team All-State three times and state Offensive Player of the Year as a senior, the first lineman so honored. Recruited by all of the country’s college football powers, the 6-foot-7, 320-pound Harris went to Stanford, where he was a three-year starter and Morris Trophy winner as the top Pac-10 offensive lineman as a junior, when he declared for the NFL draft. He was chosen 26th overall by the 49ers. Harris played in 86 NFL games with 55 starts in six seasons, the last with Oakland.\n\nCHRISTINA HILLMAN\n\nHillman won three discus and three shot put state outdoor titles at St. Thomas More, as well as Penn Relays and New Balance Indoor Nationals titles. At Iowa State, she was a seven-time All-American, highlighted by her 2014 indoor and outdoor NCAA championships in the shot put. She also won Big 12 indoor and outdoor shot put titles in 2014 and won indoors again in 2016. Hillman also placed second and fourth (indoors) and fourth and sixth twice (outdoors) at NCAAs. Her Iowa State shot put record (59 feet 6¾ inches) still stands, as does her 49-1 Delaware high school mark.\n\nRUTH LAJOIE\n\nLaJoie is a long-time official in field hockey and basketball who remains active in both sports and has advocated for women’s sports and those involved. She received the Delaware Pathfinder Award in 2006 from the National Association for Girls and Women in Sport and the DIAA State Award for Outstanding Service from the National Federation of High School Sports in 2017. The Penns Grove (New Jersey) High graduate played field hockey, basketball, lacrosse and tennis at West Chester and made the U.S. Reserve team in field hockey. She is a West Chester Athletic Hall of Fame inductee. LaJoie helped launch girls track and field as a high school sport in Delaware in 1971, created a pioneering sportsmanship award as head of the Delaware Board of Women’s Basketball Referees and, while coaching basketball at Conrad, successfully sought equal pay for coaches of boys and girls teams.\n\nRAY PEDEN\n\nThe captain of Salesianum’s first state championship swim team in 1973 went on to set 42 pool records at York College before becoming a champion open-water swimmer. With the Wilmington Aquatic Club as his base, Peden set the American record in the 26.2-mile marathon swim in 1984 and became only the second Delawarean, and 288th person, to swim the English Channel in 1986. In 2004, he was third (45-49 age group) in the U.S. Masters open water race. Peden was on the first relay team to swim from Cape Henlopen to Cape May across the Delaware Bay, was men's champ of the 12.5-mile Ocean Water Swim Around Key West, Florida, in 2010, and, five years later, was the 2.5-kilometer champion in the 60-64 age group in the U.S. Masters Open Water National Championships. The 29-year state police officer received the Order of the First State, Delaware’s highest civilian honor, in 1996.\n\nGINGER SMITH\n\nSmith, the first Delaware woman to run at the Penn Relays in 1964, then became Delaware’s first runner to qualify for the Olympic Trials that summer, doing so as a 16-year-old and making the finals in the 80-meter hurdles and 100-, 200- and 400-meter dashes. At the rain-soaked 1966 Penn Relays, she anchored Tower Hill to the high school championship in the 4 x 100-yard relay and won the 440-yard dash in 58.9 seconds. Later that summer, she led the Delaware Track and Field Club to the Middle Atlantic title by winning the 80 hurdles, 440 and 4 x 100 relay. Stanford University did not have a women’s track team when she was there so Smith competed for the Millbrae Lions Track Team and won the California 100-yard championship in 1967.\n\nJOE TIBERI\n\nTiberi had an amateur boxing record of 44-4-2 with 31 knockouts followed by a professional mark of 18-5-2 with 13 knockouts during the 1970s and ‘80s. He fought eight undefeated boxers, beating five. That included knocking out New England welterweight champion Fernando Fernandez at the Boston Garden and North Philadelphia's Mike “Youngblood” Williams on ESPN. After his competitive career, Tiberi became a successful trainer.\n\nCHARLES WAHLIG\n\nThe late Wahlig is the only triple USA Roller Sports Hall of Fame inductee, honored as an athlete, coach and for distinguished service. He began winning national competitions in the 1950s, taking USA National Senior Dance and National Speed Skating championships in 1957 and the Senior Dance title with a new partner in 1958. He was second in the World speed competition in New Zealand in 1959. He then coached over 1,000 state, regional, national and world champions after moving to Delaware in 1970 and was U.S. Pan American Games coach in 1979. He later served as president of USA Roller Sports, was on the USA Roller Skating Board of Directors and International Federation of Roller Skating Speed Skating Committee and owned three Delaware roller rinks.\n\nPAUL WORRILOW\n\nWorrilow was first-team All-State on both offense and defense, sparked Concord to the 2006 Division II state title and was state Defensive Player of the Year in 2007. But he received only Division II recruiting interest and, after one junior college season in which he red-shirted, walked on at the University of Delaware. Worrilow became a four-year starter and All-American linebacker for the Blue Hens, graduating fifth in UD history with 377 career tackles. Undrafted, he signed with the Atlanta Falcons in 2013 and made more tackles than all but four NFL players his first two seasons. Worrilow played in the Super Bowl for Atlanta and spent time with Detroit, Philadelphia and the Jets. In 76 career NFL games, including 52 starts, he made 415 tackles, forced four fumbles, recovered four and had two interceptions.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

They've been working with social scientists to come up with ways to help the public understand that hazards extend well beyond the cone, Rhome told USA TODAY on Monday.\n\nThe new experimental graphic – to be unveiled later this year – will use the same forecast cone, but layer inland areas under tropical storm and hurricane warnings with color to illustrate the total area.\n\nWeather and emergency professionals say they’re happy to see the hurricane center experimenting to try to help people more fully comprehend the threats they may face from a storm.\n\nWhat is the forecast cone?\n\nThe \"cone\" was added to the center’s official track map more than 20 years ago and has been the center’s most well-known graphic. Its roots – the forecast points – date back to the earliest days of forecasting, Rhome said.\n\nIt shows the probable path of the center of a storm over the next five days, with points every 12 hours for the first three days of the forecast, then at 24 hours for days four and five.\n\nThe cone has steadily been shrinking, as the center’s forecast skill continued to improve, reducing errors in both track and intensity. The cone does not illustrate the size of the storm or the area that could experience high winds, intense rainfall, or deadly storm surge.\n\nWhy change the cone?\n\nThe graphic has been misinterpreted for years, despite a black label at the top that states it does not show the size of the storm or the scope of impacts.\n\nThe misunderstandings of the graphic have been \"hotly debated,\" with no shortage of proposed solutions, Rhome said.\n\nThe debate reached a fever pitch in September 2022 as powerful Hurricane Ian approached Florida, and both public officials and private citizens misinterpreted the graphic. Barrier islands on the Southwest Florida coast in Lee County were always in or at the edge of the forecast cone, but residents and officials failed to comprehend that point, delaying critical decisions, experts said at the time.\n\nCraig Fugate, former chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the former chief of emergency management in Florida, was dismayed by the misunderstandings he saw. The hurricane center and NOAA correctly communicated the uncertainty but people weren’t getting it, Fugate said. Afterward, he was among those suggesting the emphasis move to impacts rather than track.\n\nThe center's latest effort is \"a good move\" to represent more of the potential impacts of a storm, Fugate told USA TODAY.\n\nPeople want easy answers to a very complicated phenomenon, Rhome said. They look to the forecast cone graphic because it’s the most familiar and has the longest history.\n\nBut over the years as track forecasting improved, the size of the cone depicting the potential path got smaller and smaller. The hazards spilled farther and farther \"outside the cone with greater and greater frequency,\" Rhome said. That created ever greater concerns.\n\nHow do hurricanes form?An inside look at the birth and power of ferocious storms\n\nIs the traditional cone graphic going away?\n\nNo. The experimental graphic will appear alongside it, starting around Aug. 15, after the center gets feedback from weather professionals and emergency managers and addresses any concerns, Rhome said.\n\nA mock-up of the new graphic shows just how much color (representing the wind warning) is outside the cone and well away from the center of circulation, he said. It \"helps to convey the totality of wind risk, which is exceedingly important because people were just so fixated on, not only where the center of the track might go, but whether they were in or out of these edges.\"\n\nWhen it comes to impacts, whether your area is in the cone or out of the cone is \"insignificant,\" Rhome said. It’s the watches or warnings that should prompt citizens to act and tell them what action to take.\n\nWhy not add all potential risks to the map?\n\nConcerns will linger because the new graphic won’t yet depict the two big killers: rainfall and storm surge.\n\nThe more information that's added to a graphic, the greater potential to clutter the message, Rhome said.\n\nSocial scientists told the center any changes to the traditional map \"would need to be very gradual\" over time, he said. Since the historical warnings shown were coastal wind warnings, \"it made sense to add the inland wind warnings\" first to provide the complete picture of wind threat.\n\nSeveral meteorologists and weather experts told USA TODAY they like adding threats to the map, but agreed the center needs to proceed carefully to strike a balance between conveying threats without making the graphic too confusing.\n\nIt’s \"a great idea to show the inland watches and warnings\" on the graphic since the hazards of hurricanes extend well away from the coast, said Jeff Masters, an author with Yale Climate Connections, former hurricane hunter meteorologist and Weather Underground founder. It would be \"great if the storm surge watches and warnings could also be included, but that would risk information overload.\"\n\nRetired television meteorologist Alan Sealls called the experimental graphic \"a good attempt.\" Any graphic attempt to depict all the threats in a tropical system will be messy, Sealls said, because each storm includes \"wind, flooding, rain, storm surge and tornadoes in a multitude of combinations.\"\n\nWhen does hurricane season start?\n\nHurricane season starts June 1 in the Atlantic and May 15 in the Pacific basin.\n\nWhat will the names be for the 2024 hurricane season:\n\nAlberto\n\nBeryl\n\nChris\n\nDebby\n\nErnesto\n\nFrancine\n\nGordon\n\nHelene\n\nIsaac\n\nJoyce\n\nKirk\n\nLeslie\n\nMilton\n\nNadine\n\nOscar\n\nPatty\n\nRafael\n\nSara\n\nTony\n\nValerie\n\nWilliam\n\nHurricane season 2023See how the 4th most active season went", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricane/2021/06/30/nhc-cone-uncertainty-concerned-explained-what-is-it-explanations-answers-common-questions/7383995002/", "title": "National Hurricane Center's cone of uncertainty explained", "text": "Every year, thousands of residents keep a wary eye open every time the National Hurricane Center issues a forecast that includes the \"cone of uncertainty.\"\n\nA shift in direction can bring either a sigh of relief (temporarily) or an increase in anxiety.\n\nBut what is the cone and what does it mean to residents, especially those along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts?\n\n► USAT storm tracker\n\nNeed to prepare for a hurricane? Here's what you should have in a disaster supply kit.\n\nHere's some answers to common questions about the cone.\n\nWhat is the cone of uncertainty?\n\nSometimes called the \"cone of concern\" or the \"cone of death,\" the cone represents the probable track of the center of a storm.\n\nThe cone is used to show the forecast for up to five days, at 12-hour intervals, out from the last recorded position of the storm. The size of the cone is based on the accuracy of National Hurricane Center forecasts over the past five years.\n\nThe center of the storm stays within the cone for roughly two out of every three forecasts, according to the NHC.\n\nWhat the cone does not do is take into account the size of the storm, and a hurricane's impacts often occur hundreds of miles from the center of the storm.\n\nThe cone also does not indicate other information, such as potential storm surge or rainfall. Some impacts from tropical storms and hurricanes can be experienced hundreds of miles from the center of the storm.\n\nWhat does the cone mean?\n\nThe NHC issues forecasts for all tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins, extending out for five days.\n\nA forecast time is indicated for each track point along a line. The line is solid for a three-day forecast and broken for the fourth and fifth days.\n\nThe forecasts are based on computer models, satellite data and trends of the particular storm. The forecasts can — and do — change rapidly.\n\nHow far off can the cone be wrong?\n\nThe farther out the forecast is projected, the greater the track error will be.\n\nIn some of the past 20 years the average forecast errors have departed from the long-term trend line by as much as 50 nautical miles. Such aberrations are expected to continue, according to the Hurricane Center.\n\n“The underlying thing is, it’s a chaotic system so there will always be a tiny bit of uncertainty. That’s the law of nature,” said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.\n\n“The cone will never shrink to be just a line.”\n\nImportant points about the hurricane cone\n\nThe National Weather Service lists five important points to better understand the \"forecast cone\":\n\nThe cone represents the probable track of the center of the tropical cyclone.\n\nThe size of the cone is drawn so that about two-thirds of the time, the center of the storm will remain in the cone.\n\nThe cone does not take the size of the storm into account.\n\nA hurricane is not a point; impacts often occur well outside of the core.\n\nThe cone indicates the forecast up to five days out from the last recorded position of the storm.\n\nDos and don'ts for using the NHC's forecast cone\n\nDon't use the cone to assess the risk of strong winds, storm surge, heavy rain or tornadoes in your area.\n\nDon't use the cone to decide whether you should evacuate or how you should prepare for the storm. Depend on your local emergency management agency.\n\nDo use the NHC forecast cone to see where the center of the storm may go.\n\nDo use the cone to see how big the storm is at that moment.\n\nDo use the cone to see where coastal wind watches and warnings have been issued.\n\nComputer models help determine where hurricanes will go\n\nFrom three to 10 days, it starts to be possible to predict the development and movement of individual storms. These predictions are dependent on “dynamical models,” complex computer simulations of the ocean and atmosphere, according to Dr. Ryan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger.\n\nNot all models are equal:Making sense of the hurricane 'model spaghetti.' WeatherTiger lesson one: Not all are equal\n\nDynamical models use information about current weather conditions and the equations that describe how fluids behave to estimate how the atmosphere will change with time.\n\nThese models are capable of simulating hurricanes, though they make only rough approximations of the storm's core, Truchelut said.\n\nThe output of the various computer models is often simplified into a herd of colorful lines showing possible hurricane tracks, colloquially known as spaghetti models.\n\nNo model consistently beats the forecasts issued by the National Hurricane Center. The average NHC five-day forecast track today is roughly as accurate as their two-day forecast was 30 years ago, Truchelut said.\n\nSupport local journalism and stay in the know.

Daily outlooks also begin on May 15, just six weeks away.\n\nRegardless of whether it's a busy or slow season, it takes only one hurricane to change your life.\n\nThink your home is safe from hurricanes?:Not so fast. New report predicts growing risks.\n\nHow will the tropical outlook change?\n\nThe hurricane center issues its tropical weather outlook every six hours throughout the day during the season, reviewing the potential for any tropical waves and areas of disturbed weather to develop into tropical cyclones.\n\nIn recent years, the outlook indicated the chance of tropical storm formation at two days and five days. Starting this season, it will show the chances of formation at two days and seven days.\n\nThe Hurricane Center has been internally testing the accuracy of a seven-day outlook for several years, said Robbie Berg, acting chief of the center's hurricane specialist branch. \"Our reliability of that seven-day forecast is just as good as our five-day forecast has been.\"\n\nHow does climate change affect you?: Subscribe to the weekly Climate Point newsletter\n\nREAD MORE: Latest climate change news from USA TODAY\n\nSuch a long-range forecast period might have been unthinkable even 20 years ago.\n\n\"When I started at the hurricane center in 2002, we were only doing a two-day formation forecast,\" Berg said. \"We've pushed it out to seven days, which is a pretty big leap.\"\n\nHe attributes that to several things:\n\nThe numerical models that simulate cyclone formation have improved.\n\nForecasters have gained more confidence in the models\n\nBetter satellite imagery has allowed forecasters to see weather patterns.\n\nBecause the range is extending to seven days, Berg said, the area where the map shows the storm may form could show up larger than in the past.\n\nWhat are the other new changes from the Hurricane Center?\n\nThe center is removing the \"experimental\" label from the peak storm surge forecast that gives people an idea of how much water could inundate their coastline in the Atlantic hurricane basin.\n\nThe potential storm surge flooding map – illustrating the areas where inundation could occur and how high it might be above ground – is being expanded to include Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nAdjustments also were made to another hurricane center product – the tropical cyclone track forecast error cone – for both the Atlantic and North Pacific basins. While the cone remains about the same in the Atlantic, the size of the track error was reduced slightly for days 3 to 5 for the Pacific.\n\nWhat is the track forecast error cone?\n\nThe often-misunderstood cone in a track forecast represents only the probable future location of the center of a tropical cyclone.\n\nIt's drawn by picturing imaginary circles that illustrate two-thirds of the forecast errors over the previous five years. The two-third probability circles for this year in the Atlantic include 26 nautical miles at 12 hours; 39 nautical miles at 24 hours; and 67 nautical miles at 48 hours.\n\nEffects of a hurricane, such as storm surge, rainfall and high winds, can take place far outside the cone of uncertainty, particularly with very large systems.\n\nCone of uncertainty:Many people misunderstand this famous hurricane forecast graphic. It can be a deadly mistake.\n\nWere forecasts for Hurricane Ian wrong? What experts say about the 'cone of uncertainty.'\n\nWhat will the forecast will be for this season?\n\nThe pioneering seasonal forecast from Colorado State University is expected April 13. The latest forecasts for El Niño, which show a 64% chance of an El Niño by the peak of hurricane season between August and October could be good news for the hurricane-battered Atlantic region. Colorado State lead forecaster Phil Klotzbach tweeted recently that the El Niño phenomenon typically reduces the number of potential hurricanes because it increases vertical wind shear, which tends to tear apart the cloud tops that build powerful hurricanes.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's seasonal outlook will be released later in the spring.\n\nAccuweather released its seasonal forecast this week, calling for a less busy season than in recent years, with 11 to 15 named storms. An average hurricane season is 14 named storms.\n\nWhat are this year's hurricane names in the Atlantic?\n\nArlene, Bret, Cindy, Don, Emily, Franklin, Gert, Harold, Idalia, Jose, Katia, Lee, Margot, Nigel, Ophelia, Philippe, Rina, Sean, Tammy, Vince and Whitney\n\nWhat remains outstanding from last hurricane season?\n\nThe final report on Hurricane Ian.\n\nIan is blamed for at least 151 deaths, primarily from its storm surge of up to 15 feet and historic rainfall across Florida. Ian caused more than $112 billion in damage, the costliest hurricane in Florida history and the third-costliest in U.S. history.\n\nIan was one of two names to be retired from the naming catalogue by the World Meteorological Organization this year. The other was Fiona.\n\nIs climate change fueling hurricanes:Here's what scientists say\n\nWhere can you see a Hurricane Hunter Aircraft?\n\nThe center's annual Hurricane Awareness Tour will take place in the first week of May along the hurricane-prone Gulf of Mexico coast during NOAA's annual hurricane preparedness week.

But on the day before landfall, it moved continually south, homing in on barrier islands off the Lee County coast.\n\nThe islands were always in or at the edge of the forecast cone, but experts say it appeared some residents and officials missed that key point, delaying critical decisions while focusing on a possible Tampa landfall.\n\nThat ignited controversy over the cone and prompted calls for a replacement. The hurricane center addressed that confusion and criticism this week.\n\nWATCH:After Ian, what will the rest of 2022's hurricane season look like?\n\nSTORM SURGE:The Gulf of Mexico rose 15 feet in part of Florida as Ian drowned residents, carried away cars and left a trail of rubble, analysis finds\n\nIan walloped the Southwest Florida coast on Sept. 28 with a storm surge of up to 15 feet, winds of 150 mph or more and up to 14 inches of rain. At least 109 people died. Where Ian made landfall in Lee County, at least 54 died, including at least 32 who drowned.\n\nThe many deaths and thousands of water rescues across the state prompted several experts to question whether it might be time to try something new. Too many people misunderstand the graphics, including local and state officials, they said. A Lee County official, Gov. Ron DeSantis and a Federal Emergency Management Agency official all were quoted saying Lee County wasn’t in the cone at 72 hours before landfall.\n\nIn a response Monday, Jamie Rhome, the hurricane center's acting director, said Ian's center stayed within or on the edge of the cone throughout the entire forecast.\n\nSo how can similar confusion be prevented?\n\nWhat is 'the cone of uncertainty'?\n\nThe cone communicates the most likely track of the center – or eye – of the storm. It is made up of a series of connecting circles, one for each time frame in the forecast.\n\nTogether, the circles become a cone – narrow at first and much wider as the forecast progresses.\n\nEach of the cone's circles use 67% of the center’s forecast errors over the previous five years. For this season, the resulting window is less than 39 nautical miles in any direction at 24 hours out, 67 nautical miles at 48 hours and 100 nautical miles at 72 hours.\n\nIt turns out the entire 5-day track stays within the cone about two-thirds of the time, said James Franklin, one of the center's retired hurricane specialists. But there’s always a chance the center of the storm could be outside the circles or even outside the cone, influenced by such factors as how slow or fast the storm is moving.\n\nThe circles are based on errors that can occur in any direction, something people often misunderstand, he said. Storms still make unexpected shifts in speed or track.\n\nFranklin finds it surprising people make decisions assuming the forecast is going to be pretty close to perfect, he said. “Haven’t people seen enough changes in the forecast, or storms that don’t do what’s expected to keep making that particular mistake?\"\n\nHe was one of several to say even though the cone will always be needed, it might be time to shift the focus to potential hazards.\n\nNational Hurricane Center responds to Ian forecast confusion\n\nPeople tend to rely on the cone because it’s simple and familiar, but also tend to make assumptions, “sometimes subconsciously, about what it means,\" Rhome said. His comments were released Monday as a question-and-answer conversation in response to questions about the use of the cone graphic in forecasts.\n\nThe center is “absolutely” open to evolving its communication to be more effective, he said. He pointed out they've worked with the National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and social scientists for more than a decade to improve graphics and messaging, including the forecast cone.\n\nIan's track forecast cone:Were forecasts for Hurricane Ian wrong? What experts say about the 'cone of uncertainty.'\n\nCommunicating a hurricane's potential impacts is more complex than just the cone, Rhome said. That’s why the center has added new products, such as graphics to convey the risks of storm surge and publishing key messages with the cone graphic.\n\nThe challenge is not everyone has the time, bandwidth or desire to sift through all the information the center provides, he said. Including all the hazards in one cone would be too \"cluttered\" to be useful, but he doesn't think the cone will ever go completely away.\n\nMany people misunderstand 'the cone of uncertainty'\n\nEarlier this year, the American Meteorological Society published a study by a group of University of Miami researchers who surveyed more than 2,800 people about their understanding of the cone.\n\nIts results suggest a “rethink” on how to communicate uncertainty, size and areas of likely damage, said the authors, who are working with the hurricane center. People had difficulty understanding the cone graphic and frequently misinterpreted the messaging. Only 18% of their respondents correctly answered all five of their questions about the forecast cone graphic.\n\nThe graphic is a valuable visualization, said author Barbara Millet, assistant professor in the university's school of communication. \"But it is not one size fits all.\"\n\nSome people mistakenly feel safer in locations just outside of the cone boundaries, for example, or believe there's no risk beyond the cone, she said. She added it may be that the cone graphic does not convey the information the public needs to make decisions about protective actions.\n\nHow can hurricane forecast confusion be lessened?\n\nMillet said moving toward a personalized approach, providing residents with tailored information, may reduce confusion.\n\nThe emphasis needs to be on impacts rather than storm tracks, said Craig Fugate, former chief of both FEMA and Florida’s state emergency management division.\n\nFugate heard the public and officials who mistakenly thought the storm was headed to Tampa Bay, he told USA TODAY in an email. “But if you read both the National Hurricane Center statements, storm surge watch and warn areas, and the local NWS Office in Tampa products, they were communicating uncertainty in the track, but that this was also a large storm with potentially deadly impacts along the SW Florida coast.”\n\nWATCH:Fort Myers resident tells how she and her husband survived flooding during Hurricane Ian\n\nVIDEO:How much was destroyed across Southwest Florida after Hurricane Ian\n\nBryan Norcross, a FOX Weather hurricane specialist, initially tweeted it might be time to consider \"ditching the forecast cone.\" But, he later told USA TODAY a simple solution may be widening the cone to encompass more of the potential errors.\n\nThe real problem is people look at the cone and nothing else, Norcross said. They need to “stop looking at the cone once watches and warnings come out and focus on those instead.”\n\n“The cone has acquired an outsized influence in modern hurricane communications,” he wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nPeople at all levels of government are trained by the hurricane center to interpret its forecast products, Norcross wrote. “It was and is shocking to hear leaders ranging from the Governor of Florida to the head of FEMA be misled by the cone,” he said.\n\nNOAA social scientist Gina Eosco said more research is needed into the cone and people’s perceptions of it before it's ditched. “Before we replace anything, it is important to reflect on why it exists at all,” she said. “The purpose of the cone is to convey the track uncertainty. When a storm is over the open Atlantic, the cone is a critical piece of information, as impacts to land are unknown at that time.\n\n“The truth is that we know very little about people's changing risk perceptions during an evolving hurricane. Until we know more about how people receive, perceive and take protective action on our forecasts, we don't know what to change about the forecast communication.”\n\nThe hurricane center will carefully analyze its forecast and the warning process in the coming weeks, as it does after every storm, Rhome said.\n\nWhatever shape the graphics ultimately take, something new needs to happen, Norcross wrote. “Scores of people died.

But there's good reason to believe Lee won't continue in a straight line: Some routine weather systems are expected to save much of the East Coast from catastrophe.\n\nAs of Saturday evening, Lee was moving west-northwest ‒ roughly in the direction of the United States ‒ at 10 mph as a Category 3 hurricane. The storm is still hundreds of miles out to sea and had weakened slightly, but forecasters said it was likely to strengthen again.\n\nA 5 p.m. forecast cone from the National Hurricane Center showed that forecasters expect Lee to begin to turn sometime around Wednesday, moving northward roughly parallel to the East Coast, still well off shore. The forecast cuts off as the storm is expected to make that turn.\n\nJamie Rhome, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center, understands the concern when a massive hurricane appears to be barreling toward the United States. \"People want a yes or no answer – Is it coming, is it not coming?\" Rhome said Friday. But this far ahead of a storm – Lee was still hundreds of miles east of the Leeward Islands – \"science doesn't let you directly answer that question.\"\n\nThe long-range forecast into next week hinges on the interactions between several key weather systems over the next few days: the hurricane, a high pressure ridge that expands and shrinks across the western Atlantic Ocean that often steers hurricanes and a southward dip in the jet stream that will push a low pressure area toward Lee.\n\nHighly advanced forecast models help meteorologists understand the potential interplay between these large atmospheric systems, but uncertainty remains, Rhome said. \"That's why we can’t say there will or won’t be direct impacts to the Northeast U.S. Coast and Canada.\"\n\n\"Right now, save the rip current risk, which is extreme, there’s no reason for people on the East Coast to be fearful,\" he said. \"We need them to be informed and aware and check back for details.\"\n\nWhat's the risk to the East Coast right now?\n\n\"Florida is in all likelihood out of the direct impacts of wind and rain, but still very much in the crosshairs of rip currents,\" Rhome said.\n\nMuch of the rest of the U.S. East Coast could be spared direct impacts beyond rip currents, rough surf and erosion, but it's too soon to say for sure.\n\nCoastal residents in the northeastern U.S. and Canada need to remain alert and regularly check the forecast. Direct impacts to those areas may be the biggest unknown at this early stage.\n\nVisualHow rip currents endanger swimmers\n\nWhere is Hurricane Lee?\n\nBy 5 p.m. Saturday, Lee was about 310 miles northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, moving west-northwest with maximum sustained winds of about 115 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nWill Lee turn to the north?\n\nEverything depends on these large-scale weather patterns that are constantly in motion in the upper atmosphere, said David Nolan, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School.\n\n“Right now, every computer model is showing there’s a big dip in the jet stream over the United States that seems very likely,” Nolan told USA TODAY on his way to catch a flight to St. Croix for a hurricane hunter flight on Saturday. If that occurs, Lee will be pulled northward.\n\nOne way to understand what happens is to think of Atlantic hurricanes as a storm river running north between two enormous mountain ranges. The ranges are the high pressure ridge in the mid-Atlantic and the trough of low pressure pushed by the jet stream.\n\n“It’s a squeeze play,” said Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. “These storms track along the path of least resistance.”\n\nThese otherwise routine weather systems are expected to save much of the East Coast from catastrophe.\n\nFor the next few days, the Atlantic high pressure will drive Lee along its southern edge, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alyson Hoegg told USA TODAY. By Wednesday and Thursday, the low pressure area moving across the eastern U.S. will come into play.\n\nBy week's end, Hoegg said, winds associated with the two systems will work together to drive Lee toward the north. The publicly available model plots indicate a north or northeastward turn is likely to take place somewhere east of the Bahamas.\n\nCould Hurricane Lee surprise forecasters and keep going straight?\n\nNot likely. Twenty years ago the influence of the jet stream and other atmospheric conditions might have led to last-minute surprises, but not today, Nolan said.\n\n“Once upon a time when the models were not as good, there could be surprises,” he said. “The capability of the computer models over periods of 5-10 days has just been increasing steadily for the last 20 years. We know with near certainty Hurricane Lee is going to turn to the north.\"\n\nA colleague of Nolan's also pointed that out in a post on X on Friday.\n\n\"This isn't 1990 anymore,\" said Andrew Hazelton, an associate scientist with the University of Miami and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies.\n\n\"Global models are solid,\" said Hazelton, who flew into Lee on Friday. Forecasters have added confidence because the models remain in consensus about Lee's northward turn, but it could be to the left or right a couple of degrees.\n\nToo soon to know impacts to New England\n\nWhile it’s too early to know how close Lee might come to the U.S. East Coast, New Englanders are keeping a wary eye on the storm as some models have projected it tracking perilously close to New England – particularly Maine. It has been 69 years since a major hurricane made landfall in New England, said Brian McNoldy, a scientist and hurricane researcher at the University of Miami.\n\nOn Sept. 8, 1869, a Category 3 hurricane known as “the September Gale of 1869” struck Rhode Island, the National Weather Service in Boston noted on Friday. The storm cut all telegraph lines between Boston and New York and capsized a schooner, killing 11 crew members.\n\n“If Lee actually does make landfall in New England, there’s no doubt the storm surge would be a huge threat,” he said.\n\nHurricane center's forecast track for Lee\n\nThe official forecast track cone shows the most likely path of the center of the storm, not the full width of the storm or its potential impacts.

Its waves are forecast to be choppy, lousy for surfing, and come with a high risk of rip currents. Any big, rough waves could rip away the little bit of sand that returned to the beaches near Ponce Inlet since Nicole.\n\nSimilar fears will ripple northward along the entire Atlantic coast this week. Lee is forecast to move northward parallel to shore a few hundred miles to the east, bringing huge waves and hazardous surf from Florida to Maine.\n\nAs of Monday evening, the hurricane maintained its \"major\" Category 3 status, with sustained winds of 115 mph. and its hurricane-force winds widened considerably, now up to 75 miles from the center.\n\nThough the significant winds are likely to stay offshore for most of the U.S. coast, rip currents and dangerous surf are expected, according to the National Hurricane Center and National Weather Service offices along the coast. Bigger waves and rip currents already have begun to reach East Coast beaches, the weather service said Monday, and that's only expected to increase.\n\n\"It’s going to produce a tremendous amount of energy in the ocean in the form of traditional ocean waves,\" Jamie Rhome, the hurricane center's deputy director, told USA TODAY. “When that energy strikes the coast, it produces this huge rip current risk.”\n\nWhere is Hurricane Lee right now?\n\nAt 11 p.m. Monday, Lee remained a major hurricane, with 115-mph winds.\n\nThe storm was about 580 miles south of Bermuda and 410 miles north-northwest of the northern Leeward Islands, moving west-northwest at 7 mph.\n\nA Saildrone – one of several deployed in the ocean along Lee's path – 40 miles south-southeast of Lee's center reported a sustained wind speed of 77 mph and a gust of 105 mph, the hurricane center said Monday at 11 p.m.\n\nA buoy between Lee and San Salvador Island in the Bahamas reported significant wave heights of 17.7 feet.\n\nLee is forecast to strengthen to 120 mph winds overnight Monday, then begin weakening as it's buffeted by wind shear later in the week and encounters areas of colder water left by hurricanes Idalia and Franklin.\n\nWhat is the hurricane's path? Will Lee hit the Northeast or Canada?\n\nIt's too soon to know how Lee might affect the northeastern U.S. and Canada's Atlantic coast, the hurricane center said Monday, especially because the hurricane is expected to slow considerably.\n\nHurricane Lee is forecast to make a gradual turn to the north by Wednesday and pass between the U.S. mid-Atlantic and Bermuda on Friday.\n\nLee could bring strong winds, rainfall, and high surf impacts to Bermuda later this week.\n\nIn Maine and along the coast of New England, the National Weather Service said Monday that the \"track, intensity, and impacts (if any) from Lee remain uncertain.\"\n\nThe hurricane center's track forecast cone calls for the center of Lee to be offshore somewhere between the coast of New England and southeast of Nova Scotia on Saturday night.\n\nAs of 11 p.m., much of eastern New England was in the \"cone of uncertainty\" in the hurricane center's forecast map for Lee. This includes a portion of the Boston metro area, along with Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket.\n\n\"Dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents\" continue to hit the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas and will affect most of the U.S. East Coast this week as Lee grows and moves northward.\n\nWhat's the rip current concern?\n\nRip currents are particularly worrisome for weather officials because 2023 has already been a deadly year: At least 75 deaths are thought to be attributed to rip currents and hazardous surf conditions, the third-highest year since record-keeping started in 2002.\n\nA report published by the American Meteorological Society in August concluded the percentage of direct fatalities attributed to tropical-cyclone-related rip currents has doubled. The authors found:\n\nDirect fatalities during tropical cyclone landfalls rose from 6% from 1963-2012 to 15% from 2013-2022.\n\nFatalities often occur one or two at a time from distant storms hundreds of miles offshore.\n\nFlorida, North Carolina and New Jersey experienced the highest number of tropical-cyclone-related surf and rip current deaths.\n\n“The reason rip currents are so deadly is because all the other hazards in a hurricane have a visual cue,” Rhome said. “Even if you don’t believe the forecasters, you’ll believe your own eyes.\n\n\"The air surrounding a hurricane sinks, and that sinking air creates cloud-free conditions and warm days,” he said. “That’s near-perfect beach weather. People flock to the beach and there’s no visual clue that anything is wrong. There’s nothing to see that may tell you you need to be cautious.\"\n\nWagner said rip currents seem to be more prevalent in the soft sand offshore since the hurricanes. He advises people enter the water near lifeguards.\n\n\"People think this beautiful beach is safe, and it’s not,\" Wagner said. \"People don’t respect Mother Nature. You’re in the ocean, you’re not in a pool.\"\n\nWhat's the forecast for Lee along the coast?\n\nSwells from Hurricane Lee already are arriving between Florida and North Carolina.\n\nMelbourne, Florida: \"Surf will become increasingly rough as larger breaking waves arrive later this week.\"\n\nWilmington, North Carolina: Surf heights could reach 5 feet by Monday afternoon and will \"continue increasing the next several days.\"\n\nOuter Banks, North Carolina: Seas will be \"a very dangerous 10-15 feet during the day Friday,\" gradually subsiding through the weekend. There is a potential for \"significant beach erosion, ocean overwash and coastal flooding.\"\n\nWhat to do if you’re caught in a rip current:\n\n\"These rip currents grab and your first primal reaction to that is to swim back to shore. That’s hard-wired to your brain,” Rhome said. “Unfortunately the rip current is harder than people can swim. Most people can swim and swim and swim and can't overpower the rip current.\n\n\"Your only option is to swim parallel to the shore and try to get out of it,” he said. The other option is to relax and float until you're out of the current.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nIt’s not just this storm that worries Wagner. It’s the other storm the hurricane center is watching off the west coast of Africa, which already has surf forecasts calling for 20-foot swells in about two weeks.\n\n“If we get hit by another storm, we’ve got no defense,” said Wagner, an attorney and former county councilman. Communities along the beach between Daytona Beach and Ponce Inlet were hit hard by Hurricane Ian and then by Hurricane Nicole.\n\nWagner’s family lost their backyard and a sea wall, which they've since been able to replace. Because the sand loss revealed his property had a coquina rock revetment, he was able to get a state permit to add rock to the wall.\n\nThey have not been able to replace the 11-foot elevation of sand and dune behind their home they lost during the two hurricanes. Others along the stretch of beach haven't been able to replace sea walls or add rock and some lost homes.\n\n“Up until November I used to look at storms and get excited … for people like me that experienced this for the first time ever, it really changes you.”\n\nHis entire beachfront community is at risk if they get a slow-moving storm or a couple of storms, he said. \"This storm could be really, really catastrophic.\"\n\nWhatever storm hits, we're going to be punched \"like Mike Tyson fighting Evander Holyfield,\" he said.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/29/hurricane-idalia-path-tracker-live-updates-florida/70706031007/", "title": "Hurricane Idalia path live updates: Storm powers to a Category 4", "text": "Editor's note: This page recaps news related to Hurricane Idalia from Tuesday, Aug. 29. For the latest news on Hurricane Idalia landfall, please read our live updates page for Wednesday, Aug. 30.\n\nCEDAR KEY, Fla. − Hurricane Idalia, a Category 4 storm with sustained winds at 130 mph, was on a collision course with Florida's Big Bend and only 90 miles from the state's capital, Tallahassee early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned of a \"life-threatening, dangerous situation,\" saying the storm could make landfall as a major hurricane. The treacherous tropical cyclone is driving a potentially deadly storm surge toward the Big Bend area of Florida's west coast.\n\n\"To put this system into the historical context, there are no major hurricanes in the historical dataset going back to 1851 that have tracked into Apalachee Bay. None,\" the advisory said. \"Don't mess around with this.\"\n\nA hurricane warning was in place along hundreds of miles of Florida coastline as the storm headed toward an apparent landfall along Florida's Big Bend.\n\nNearly all of Florida's western coastline is under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The watch is in effect for over seven million people in 22 counties until 6 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a news briefing that highway tolls were being waived, shelters were opening and hotels were prepared to take evacuees. More than 30,000 utility workers were getting ready to repair outages when the storm passes.\n\nDeSantis said landfall appeared to be headed toward Taylor County, southeast of Tallahassee and one of the most rural and economically challenged areas of the state. But he said it was too early to know exactly where the storm would hit.\n\n\"Everybody on the Gulf Coast from Tampa Bay to northwest Florida must be vigilant,\" he said. \"You're going to see some nasty weather.\"\n\nAt a self-serve sandbag site in Spring Hill, well within Hernando County's mandatory evacuation zone, Jeff Manor and Judy Hodder were preparing bags to place along the doors and garage of their coastal home. They already brought in their outdoor furniture, towed their pontoon boat out of a nearby canal and tied it down on the side of their home.\n\n\"We're staying here,\" Hodder, 67, said as she wiped sweat from her forehead. \"But if it starts coming at us, we're gone.\"\n\nWhat is rapid intensification?How Idalia could quickly become a major hurricane before landfall\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ DeSantis said 5,000 National Guard members were activated, 580 search and rescue workers in eight teams were mobilized, 1,100 generators were prepped for deployment, and 200 ambulances were ready to sweep into the area.\n\n∎ Idalia was expected to remain a hurricane as it crosses into Georgia before moving over the Carolina coastline on Thursday, then out into the Atlantic, where its path remained uncertain.\n\nFlorida is on storm surge watch:Here's what that means\n\nFollow the path of Idalia as storm heads for Florida\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm but does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nParts of Tampa Bay Area under flood warning as heavy rain batters region\n\nTAMPA —The National Weather Service is warning that the Alafia River will likely breach its banks in the Hillsborough County community of Riverview on Wednesday, as Idalia batters Florida's west coast.\n\nA flood warning is in effect from Wednesday morning through the late evening near the bridge where U.S. 301 crosses the river. The Alafia is forecast to exceed its flood stage by 1.5 feet, according to the weather service.\n\n\"Major flooding is forecast,\" the agency said in a weather advisory. \"This approaches the flood of record.\"\n\nThe previous record water level for the Alafia in Riverview was 6.2 feet following Hurricane Frances in 2004, according to weather service data. Wednesday's forecast calls for a peak of 5.7 feet in the early afternoon.\n\nRiverview is an unincorporated community in Hillsborough County of about 100,000 people that lies ten miles southeast of downtown Tampa.\n\nIdalia's impacts were felt across the region as waves along the coast rose and crashed ashore. The city of Tampa was experiencing heavy rain as numerous showers and thunderstorms moved over the area. Wind gusts up to 65 mph are expected overnight.\n\n— Dan Glaun, Florida Today\n\nIdalia expected to 'become a major hurricane'\n\nDeSantis announced that 30 of Florida’s 67 counties had some kind of evacuation order in place. Schools have also closed in many counties as residents prepare for high winds and potential flash flooding.\n\n\"Now's the time to do it,\" DeSantis said during a Tuesday night news conference. \"If you wait much longer . . . the weather's going to start getting nastier and nastier.\"\n\nThe governor warned that first responders will not be able to provide aid or respond to emergency calls until after the storm has passed. He noted the state has also set aside resources to help restore power and interruption to fuel supplies, including 30,000 to 40,000 electricity workers on standby and 1.1 million gallons of fuel.\n\n'We're solid here': Business owners prepare for impact\n\nCEDAR KEY, Fla. − In the mid-afternoon, Cedar Key's quaint downtown and Dock Street area, its streets lined with restaurants and local shops on stilts firm in the Gulf of Mexico, were deserted. Metal and wood boards were nailed over windows and doors of beloved eateries, clashing with the pastel signage of restaurants bearing the names Tipsy Cow, Steamers and Duncan's on the Gulf.\n\nIt's one of a cluster of islands in the Gulf Coast known for its wildlife with about 800 residents and only one road going in or out.\n\nJordan Keeton, 39, owns 83 West, the largest restaurant on the island. It juts out over the Gulf of Mexico and both floors are surrounded by windows. He and his family and friends were moving out the last of the most valuable items, including a wooden bench shaped like a boat, which has been with the restaurant for over 50 years, he said.\n\nKeeton, who is also the chef, has owned the restaurant since 2015. Soon after purchasing it, he renovated the place. The next year, however, Hurricane Hermine's storm surge caused about $750,000 in damages. He and his brother James were upstairs when the storm hit. The downstairs was destroyed, and he found pieces of the deck at a fire station miles away.\n\nAfterward, he made sure the new floors and walls could withstand flooding.\n\nOn Monday and Tuesday morning, they cleared the downstairs and lugged most of the furniture, kitchen supplies and alcohol upstairs.\n\n\"The plan is for the stuff to stay dry up here as the surge pushes through the downstairs and onto the island,\" he said.\n\nKeeton is going to stay through the storm at his nearby home, 16 feet above sea level.\n\n\"We should be fine at a Cat 3. Our house is rated at a 5. I'm not worried about it there,\" he said, placing his hand on the second-floor dock of his restaurant, overlooking the overcast sky over the Gulf. \"This one, not so much. So we'll see what happens.\"\n\nOn a country road, a few miles short of downtown, Lee Bryan and some of his friends were strapping down a large walk-in cooler he uses for his clam farming business, Bryan Farms.\n\n\"He's worried the water will bring it off its pilings,\" said Lee's wife Leanna Bryan, a co-owner of the business.\n\nThe couple's operation delivers clams to restaurants on three separate routes up and down the Nature Coast and Big Bend. They live off the Suwannee river and plan to stay there through the hurricane.\n\n\"When you live here, you know they're going to come so you have to work with mother nature as much as you can,\" she said. \"Can't control it so you got to just try and help yourself.\"\n\nLeanna Bryan said no matter the damage, Cedar Key and its residents will persevere.\n\n\"It's a resilient community, we all come together and help each other,\" she said. \"We're solid here.\"\n\nHurricane Center chief: Be ready to survive several days on your own\n\nNational Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan warned there are \"likely going to be some devastated areas\" in counties from the Florida coast into southern Georgia. The storm surge will be “difficult to survive” along a long stretch of the coast, including Citrus, Levy, Taylor and Franklin counties, Brennan said. Residents should have several days' worth of food, medicine and emergency supplies on hand, he said.\n\n“There may not be water, power and other amenities you’re used to having,” Brennan said. “You’re going to want to be prepared to survive several days on your own, without any support from anybody else.”\n\n'Gloom and doom ... (or) everything is going to be fine'\n\nDozens of Hernando Beach and Weeki Wachee locals looking to fortify their homes on Tuesday took shovels to large sand mounds, packed bags full and lugged them to their cars and trucks within eyeshot of the Gulf of Mexico where several feet of storm surge is expected.\n\nAt a self-service sandbag site at Linda Pedersen Park in Spring Hill, Alan Covington, 63, and Vreli Covington, 63, stuffed the truck bed of their Ford F-150 with sandbags. For the past seven years, they have lived in a single-story home within 100 yards of the Gulf.\n\n\"They're for us but mostly for our neighbor, who has been in New Hampshire the last few days,\" Alan Covington said, pointing to the bags. \"I told him: 'We're gonna put sandbags up for you' − not that it's gonna do any good.\"\n\nThe couple took in all the furniture, packed their important papers and stored their boat at a nearby marina. Once they set up the sandbags, they planned to take refuge at a friend's two-story inland home.\n\n\"We're going to push away with positivity,\" Vreli Cunningham said. \"We're the two ends of the spectrum. Mister Doom and Gloom and me, Miss 'Everything Is Going to be Fine.'\"\n\nIdalia in context: Previous storms have devastated Apalachee Bay\n\nOther storms have set a precedent for devastating storm surge in communities along Apalachee Bay. In 2005, Hurricane Dennis, passing 120 miles to the west, produced a surprising storm surge of 6-9 feet higher than normal tide levels, inundating the community of St. Marks just south of Tallahassee.\n\nDennis obliterated Posey's Oyster Grill and Bar, a highly popular restaurant known for its local seafood.\n\nIn an after-storm report by the hurricane center, hurricane specialist Jack Beven wrote the surge was “likely triggered by an oceanic trapped shelf wave that propagated northward along the Florida west coast.”\n\nDennis approached at the right angle to trap a bulge of water between itself and the shore, Mark Wool, a meteorologist with the weather service, once told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\nIdalia could thrive on warm waters of Gulf\n\nHurricane Idalia's path toward Florida's coast takes it through a steamy hot tub otherwise known as the Gulf of Mexico. That's worrisome because hurricanes thrive on warm water. It fuels the heat and water vapor that make them stronger and capable of dumping more extreme rainfall. And unseasonably warm water temperatures have lingered in the Gulf for weeks, making it even hotter than normal.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario Tuesday, the tropical cyclone will be moving along the coast in water temperatures among the hottest on record in the Gulf as it spins toward a landfall overnight or Wednesday morning.\n\nEvacuation urged ahead of potential wall of water\n\nCatastrophic impacts from a storm surge of up to 15 feet above ground level topped by large, destructive waves are possible along a stretch of more than 100 miles of coastline from the Aucilla River to Yankeetown in the Big Bend region, the hurricane center said. A storm surge of 3 feet or more is possible, depending on the timing of high tides, to the north and the south from west of Apalachicola to Everglades City. Residents were urged to heed evacuation orders.\n\nFor context, the maximum water level measured after Hurricane Ian in Fort Myers Beach last fall was 15 feet. The hurricane center concluded in its post-Ian report that storm surge killed 41 people, more than any other single cause. The U.S. Geological Survey, university researchers and professional storm chasers were out placing specialty equipment along the coast Tuesday to measure the expected surge.The geological survey said Idalia’s surge could cause changes all along the state’s west coast, washing over sandy beaches and cutting into dunes.\n\nOld nuclear power plant braces for Idalia\n\nAbout 85 miles north of Tampa along the Gulf of Mexico, the retired Crystal River Nuclear Plant sits near Idalia’s forecasted path. Part of Duke Energy’s 5,100-acre complex that also includes active fossil fuel-powered plants in Citrus County, the old nuclear plant began decontamination and dismantling in 2020. In an email, federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesperson Neil Sheehan said there is no operating reactor that would cause concern. Officials remain in contact with plant personnel who must complete storm preparation, including ensuring radioactive materials are secured, he said.\n\nHurricane preparations for the site were completed Monday, Duke Energy spokesperson Mary Kathryn Green said in an email. Radioactive materials are permanently placed in shielded containers that withstand the effects of extreme weather, she said. Used nuclear fuel also remains sealed in on-site storage.\n\nKeith Richardson, a spokesperson for Duke Energy, said the company was securing anything that could become airborne, storing equipment and ensuring generators are supplied should power be lost. Afterward, staff plan to do walkthroughs and inspections, he said.\n\n“In terms of the process, that’s all accounted for,” Richardson said.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nBig Bend is mostly rural, thinly populated\n\nThe Big Bend, the region where the Florida Panhandle transitions into the peninsula, is tree-packed and rural. Taylor County, the southernmost county in the Big Bend, is home to only about 22,000 people, ranking it 54th in population out of the state's 67 counties. To the western side, Franklin county ranks 64th, with a population of about 12,500. In 2021, about 19% of the residents in Franklin County lived below the poverty line, one of the poorest counties in the state.\n\nMost of the population lives along the Apalachee Bay, a swampy swath of Florida where parts o the coastline remain undeveloped. Inland, three state forests connect the panhandle to the peninsula, and the tall pines that line the Big Bend Scenic Byway are very sensitive to wind damage and pose a threat to homes in high-speed winds.\n\n− Ana Goni-Lessan, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nSmall wobble could drastically alter storm's impact\n\nFloridians were anxiously waiting to see whether Idalia follows the forecast track or makes any kind of last-minute wobble to the east that could bring worse-than-expected damage from wind and water. Hurricane Ian last year and Hurricane Charley in 2004 curved toward a landfall a little earlier than expected. Any movement closer to land could increase the effects of storm surge, rain and higher winds closer to the center of the hurricane.\n\nOne neighborhood near Tampa Bay on Tuesday morning illustrated the gamut of emotions among residents on the west coast, but outside the forecast cone. One was putting up shutters while another was laying sod. Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, stressed that everyone should prepare for the worst.\n\n“The storm is going to be here soon,” Guthrie said. “I implore you to finalize your disaster preparedness actions right now.”\n\nStorm surge as high as 15 feet\n\nIdalia is forecast to make landfall overnight Tuesday or early Wednesday as a major hurricane with sustained winds near 120 mph. Storm surge − a sudden rise in water levels along beaches and into inland waterways − as high as 15 feet could slam the coast south of Florida’s Big Bend near the eventual point of landfall. Storm surge of at least 2 to 3 feet was possible along the state's entire west coast, depending on how Idalia's landfall coincides with full moon high tides. A storm surge of 4 to 7 feet could occur in Tampa Bay, the hurricane center warned.\n\nRyan Truchelut, chief meteorologist at Florida-based WeatherTiger, said Idalia will likely bring \"catastrophic surge\" to much of the west-central Florida and Big Bend coastline and a core of destructive winds to parts of North Florida. Idalia could become just the second Category 3 or higher hurricane − winds exceeding 110 mph − to make landfall there in the past 170 years, he said.\n\nWhat is storm surge?:Explaining a hurricane's deadliest and most destructive threat\n\nEvacuation orders:Hurricane Idalia rapidly intensifying; 22 Florida counties under evacuation orders\n\nA foot of rain, tornadoes possible\n\nRainfall of 4 to 8 inches is forecast along portions of the state's west coast and Panhandle, as well as along the path of the storm through Southeast Georgia and the eastern Carolinas, with isolated amounts up to 12 inches near where Idalia makes landfall, the National Weather Service said.\n\nTropical storm warnings were posted along all of Georgia's coast and much of the Florida and South Carolina coasts. Cities such as Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, are likely to see a few inches of rain as Idalia moves along the Carolina coasts before curving northeastward over the Atlantic Ocean, AccuWeather said.\n\n\"Tornadoes can also occur to the east of the center of the circulation as it moves across Florida,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said.\n\nWeather Channel meteorologist Jim Cantore seen on Cedar Key\n\nSunday posts on X, formerly Twitter, that indicated The Weather Channel meteorologist Jim Cantore would show up in Florida were confirmed Monday. Cantore is long known for being in the middle of major storm events. An X user whose handle is Lt. Col. William Reid tweeted a photo from a Cedar Key restaurant, presumably Steamers: \"Ran into the Jim Cantore while having dinner.\"\n\nPhotos of the restaurant's page on Facebook show a \"dollar bill wall,\" similar to the dollar bill wall in Reid's tweet. Cantore has quite a history in Florida storms.

But you mention snow or ice, and you see real fear.\"\n\nMore than 400 miles south of the Mason-Dixon Line and as close to Orlando, Florida, as New York City, Southeastern North Carolina doesn't see snow or ice that often. And when it does, it can be a challenge for residents and emergency officials.\n\nThat doesn't mean, however, that some folks don't mind the occasional sprinkling of white − especially around the holiday season.\n\nBut officials warn snow, already a rare event in the Cape Fear region, could soon become even rarer thanks to our changing environment.\n\n\"The most recent 30-year period used for climate normals (1991 through 2020) has the smallest average snowfall for any time in Wilmington's climate record, only 0.9 inches per year,\" states the 2023-24 Winter Outlook prepared by the National Weather Service's Wilmington office. \"This is likely related to ongoing climate change which has led to warmer temperatures.\"\n\nSnow in Wilmington:A look back at when we saw measurable snowfall since 1870\n\nSnow outage in ILM\n\nSo just how uncommon is a white Christmas along the Cape Fear coast?\n\nSince 1952, the Port City has had snow on the ground just once for the big day, and that was in 1989 when 15 inches of snow fell in the 36 hours before Dec. 25, making it the biggest snowstorm in Wilmington since the National Weather Service started keeping records in 1870.\n\nAnnually, the Port City averages around 1 inch of snow per year, with January followed by February the two snowiest months, according to the weather service. The earliest recorded measurable snowfall was on Nov. 20, 1879, while the latest was March 31, 1915.\n\nBut the appearance of snow any time, never mind on Christmas, in Wilmington is getting rarer.\n\nAccording to the weather service, the Port City has seen 241 inches of snow since 1870. The snowiest decade was the 1980s which dumped 35.4 inches on Wilmington, largely thanks to the monster storm of 1989. The next top decade was the 1910s, which brought 33.7 inches of snow to the Port City.\n\nWhile the 2000s and 2010s saw some substantial storms, with 12.1 inches and 14 inches of snow falling each decade, the white stuff has largely disappeared from Wilmington's landscape in recent years. So far a paltry 0.5 inches of snow has fallen in the Port City in the 2020s, with only one measurable snow event since January 2018 − the aforementioned 0.5 inches that fell on Jan. 29, 2022.\n\nMore:6 interesting facts about snow in Wilmington\n\nWarming weather\n\nThe latest National Climate Assessment, the fifth iteration of the report required by Congress every four years, paints a worrisome picture of what's going to happen in Wilmington and across the Southeast in the coming years and decades.\n\nReleased Nov. 14, the report says temperatures worldwide have risen by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the mid-19th century. The warming \"is unequivocally caused by greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, with only very small effects from natural sources,\" and \"about three-quarters of total emissions and warming (1.7 degrees) have occurred since 1970,\" the assessment states.\n\nThe report predicts the overall warming of the planet will likely peak in mid- to late century with temperatures rising between 4.5 and 7.2 degrees compared to pre-industrial times, with U.S. temperatures increasing a maximum of 5.6 degrees − outpacing the projections of climatologists and blowing past the United Nations' goal of keeping the increase of global average temperatures to 2.7 degrees or less to avoid the worst impacts from climate change.\n\nFor the Southeast, the report states that nearly 1.7 million football fields have changed from forested to developed land areas between 1985 and 2019. That trend is expected to continue as more and more people crowd into the South, especially in coastal and urban areas.\n\nThat rapid population growth coupled with an increase in climate-related risks, including sea-level rise and warming temperatures, poses health issues and challenges to get communities and residents climate ready and adapted to their changing environment.\n\nPrecipitation yo-yo\n\nWhile climatologists predict temperatures to only head in one direction in the coming decades, precipitation could have a more complicated path.\n\nWhile the climate assessment states that “precipitation from extreme events is projected to increase with warming” − think more powerful hurricanes dumping record amounts of rain on Southeastern North Carolina, the report also projects that overall precipitation totals could decrease. That means longer periods of dry weather − North Carolina is currently experiencing its third fall drought in three years, with some parts of the state in extreme drought − pocketed with a few events that may cause flooding over a day or two.\n\nWith tropical storms largely giving Wilmington a pass this hurricane season, the region's rainfall amounts have dropped off significantly. In October, the Port City saw less than 1 inch of rain versus a normal monthly amount of nearly 4.7 inches. That trend continued into November, with the weather service recording just over 1 inch of measurable rain at Wilmington International Airport through Nov. 20 versus a normal amount of 2.4 inches.\n\nRising temperatures also means any snow that does fall will stick around for a shorter period of time once it hits the ground. That could mean problems in the ski areas of Western North Carolina and states like Colorado, California and Nevada that rely on snowpack for much of their drinking water. Projections by federal climatologists show that in areas in the West where snow is the dominant source of runoff, total seasonal snow water volume could decrease by up to 24% by 2050.\n\nHotter and wetter:New data shows Wilmington's climate is changing\n\n'Just surreal'\n\nSo what does this all mean for Wilmington and the chance of a white Christmas?\n\nWell, let's just say the odds aren't in the city's favor, and officials say they likely will get worse over time as impacts from climate change increase.\n\nSome signs of the region's warming weather is already being felt. The three longest strings for consecutive nighttime low temperatures in Wilmington of 70 degrees or more have all been recorded since 2012, and five of the top nine have occurred this century, according to the weather service.\n\nAnd it's not just the summers that are getting hotter.\n\n\"Winter average temperatures have generally been above average since 1990, with the 2015–2020 period exceeding the levels of the early 1930s and early 1950s,\" states the North Carolina 2022 state climate summary published by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Mirroring the statewide trend, the warmest temperatures recorded in December in the Port City have been creeping up in recent years. From 2000 to 2012, the highs never topped 80 degrees. But between 2013 and 2022, four years showed temperatures reaching 80 degrees or hotter. That trend was reinforced this month by research from science and news organization Climate Central, which reported that Earth in 2023 was on track to record its warmest year on record with global temperatures averaging more than 2.3 degrees above pre-industrial levels. In the Carolinas, Raleigh's average over the past 12 months was 1.6 degrees above the 30-year normal.\n\nWalking the Loop at Wrightsville Beach in late November as temperatures hovered in the low 70s, Michael Lewis only remembers seeing snow once while living in Wilmington. That was five years ago in January 2018 just after New Years when a \"meteorological bomb\" brought sustained freezing temperatures and dumped 3.8 inches of wintry mix on the region.\n\nLewis remembers running through the snow in January 2018 to hit the beach to go surfing after biking to the coast − narrowly avoiding a few cars struggling in the slick weather.\n\n\"That was just surreal, especially for someone who had just moved here from Florida,\" he said. \"But honestly, I'm not going to miss it if we don't see it again.\"\n\nReporter Gareth McGrath can be reached at GMcGrath@Gannett.com or @GarethMcGrathSN on Twitter.

Any more lead time and it gets tricky.\n\nSo where did the trouble start?\n\nThe weather service typically does seven-day forecasts but produces weather maps using models that take a longer view, Szatkowski said. The model is helpful to look at trends in the region.\n\nSomeone took one of the maps from the model, a map that showed feet of snow for the Middle Atlantic, and posted it on social media.\n\n\"People now have taken off and run with it,\" Szatkowski said. \"We can't forecast this 10 days out. The people who did this were really irresponsible.\"\n\nNo one is sure who started the snow frenzy.\n\nSzatkowski said people quickly bought into the hype because emergency planners are paid to pay attention to dramatic weather events and other folks are really fed up with this winter's weather are are fretting about more snow and cold.\n\nAt the Delaware Department of Transportation, where officials are no strangers to what happens when wrong information gets out on social media, the key is giving people answers, spokesman James Westhoff said.\n\nDuring Superstorm Sandy, a Facebook post said the new, multimillion dollar, Indian River Inlet Bridge had collapsed.\n\nIt hadn't.\n\nOfficials didn't address it right away and the rumor grew, Westhoff said.

The previous record was set on January 27, 2015, when the city received 22.1 inches of snow.\n\nBoston could also soon beat its all-time one-day snowfall record of 23.6 inches, which was set on February 17, 2003.\n\n“This is coming down hard and fast, and so it’s been historic,” Boston Mayor Michelle Wu told CNN Saturday evening.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN reporter shows what storm is like in one of the worst hit areas 02:22 - Source: CNN\n\nStrong winds pushed seawater ashore in parts of coastal Massachusetts and elsewhere earlier in the day, causing some street flooding.\n\nSome governments in the Northeast banned vehicle travel for parts of the day, including Rhode Island through midnight, with a tractor-trailer ban in place until midnight.\n\n“Hunker down for 24 hours, and sometime tomorrow, you’ll be able to go back out and resume some of your normal activities,” Tom Guthlein, Rhode Island’s acting director of emergency management, said early Saturday.\n\nSome areas crush snowfall records\n\nIn New Jersey’s Atlantic City, howling wind whipped snow sideways earlier Saturday, and a CNN crew there could barely see anything a block away. The city crushed its all-time January snowfall record by Saturday, reaching a staggering monthly total of 33.2 inches of snow. It had received about 19.2 inches prior to the storm and added another 14 inches Saturday, CNN meteorologist Gene Norman said Saturday afternoon. The prior monthly record of 20.3 inches was set in January 1987.\n\nThe city’s 14 inches of snow Saturday also beat its previous record for the calendar date, which was set in 2014 at 7.3 inches.\n\nAs the storm pummeled through, several other areas crushed previous January 29 snowfall records, including New York’s Central Park, which recorded 7.3 inches, beating the previous record of 4.7 inches set in 1904, and Philadelphia, which saw 5.8 inches of snow Saturday, beating the previous record of 5 inches, also set in 1904.\n\nUp to 2 feet of snow could fall by Sunday morning from Long Island through Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, CNN forecasters said.\n\nSign up for weather email alerts\n\nThe storm became a “bomb cyclone” Saturday morning, meaning the storm strengthened rapidly and had the barometric pressure drop more than 24 millibars within 24 hours, the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nMore than 3,580 flights within, into or out of the US were canceled Saturday, according to FlightAware, and more than a thousand are already canceled for Sunday.\n\nMajor airlines offered waivers to passengers impacted by the storm, including Delta, which offered travel waivers to passengers planning to fly out of 28 airports across the East Coast this weekend and United, which said it will waive change fees and any difference in fare for flights departing on or before February 2, involving 26 locations along the coast.\n\nAmerican Airlines and Southwest also announced options for passengers whose plans were spoiled by the severe weather conditions.\n\nXavier Martinez scrapes snow off his windshield in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday, January 29.

Several roadways were also closed because of flooding, the chief said.\n\n“We do have coastal flooding when we get these kinds of storms, but today was pretty intense,” Jason Graziadei, an editor at the local newsletter Nantucket Current, told CNN on Saturday afternoon. “People (are) kind of just hunkering down out here.”\n\nScituate, a coastal Massachusetts town southeast of Boston, had some mild to moderate flooding at high tide Saturday morning, with water splashing over seawalls, town administrator Jim Boudreau told CNN.\n\nHigh winds reached more than 70 mph, Boudreau said Saturday afternoon.\n\n“When you have wind like that with the snow, the snow is almost like needles coming down hitting people,” he said. “Visibility has been near zero, we’re plowing the roads as quickly as we can, as fast as we get the snow off the roads the wind is blowing it back in.”\n\nIn Marshfield, another coastal Massachusetts town, about 4 feet of water came over the seawall at high tide, town administrator Michael A. Maresco told CNN.\n\nMore coastal flooding is possible, forecasters warned. Parts of Massachusetts and Long Island were under coastal flood advisories.\n\nIn Quincy, a city just south of Boston, the mayor warned people to stay indoors, saying even snowplow operators wouldn’t be able to drive when the snowfall is heaviest.\n\n“There’s no way plows are going to operate when they can’t see in front of their face,” Mayor Thomas Koch told CNN Saturday. “Even after the storm is done, we’ll be plowing for many hours afterward, to keep up with the wind blowing it.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Transportation issued a travel ban for large trucks on interstate highways for Saturday because of the severe winter weather forecast.\n\nThe travel ban took effect Saturday morning and will go through midnight for tractor trailer trucks, tandems and special permit haulers,” MassDOT said.\n\nRhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee declared a state of emergency ahead of the storm and told CNN Saturday afternoon the state is expecting to record some of its highest snow accumulation totals through the storm.\n\nThe blizzard-like conditions led Amtrak to cancel train service on Saturday for various lines, including Acela service between Washington, DC, and Boston as well as regional service between Boston and New York, the company said Friday.\n\nSnow piles up fast on Long Island and in New Jersey\n\nThe governors of New York and New Jersey also declared states of emergency.\n\nAs a precaution, all Long Island Rail Road service was suspended Saturday morning, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said.\n\nSnow was accumulating fast Saturday on Long Island. More than 24 inches were reported near Long Island MacArthur Airport by Saturday night.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How strong a blizzard's impact may be 01:20 - Source: CNN\n\nSnowplow crews will work throughout Saturday night in Suffolk County on Long Island, but freezing temperatures and lingering snowfall will complicate efforts to clear the roads into Sunday, County Executive Steve Bellone said.\n\nIn Nassau County, where officials said snowfall totals ranged from 10 to 18 inches, County Executive Bruce Blakeman said Saturday strong wind gusts were expected later in the evening, and urged residents to stay home.\n\n“Snow is dangerous, but wind is more dangerous,” Blakeman said, adding there had been more than 50 car accidents by Saturday morning but roads later in the day remained virtually empty besides snowplows.\n\n“If everybody stays off the roads, lets our workers do their job, by noon tomorrow I think we’ll have this under control, and I think the roads will be a lot safer,” he said.\n\nIn New Jersey, the Jersey Shore was “getting clobbered,” Gov. Phil Murphy said late Saturday morning. About 21 inches were reported in coastal Bayville by Saturday night.\n\nHe asked residents to be patient and stay off covered roads.\n\n“It’ll take us a few days to dig out of this one, and that’s probably what’s the realistic scenario,” Murphy said.\n\nA man walks on a snow-covered street in Boston on Saturday morning. Michael Dwyer/AP\n\nMaryland, Virginia, the Carolinas and elsewhere\n\nThe governors of Maryland and Virginia issued states of emergency in their states.\n\nBy Saturday evening, parts of coastal Virginia received at least nine inches, and coastal parts of Maryland and Delaware received more than 12 inches.\n\nParts of interior North Carolina and South Carolina got more than 2 inches of snow, with higher amounts in North Carolina’s mountains.\n\nPortions of Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia also have received more than 4 inches of snow.", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Aya Elamroussi Christina Maxouris", "Jason Hanna", "Aya Elamroussi", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2014/01/22/storm-northeast-snow-weather/4767567/", "title": "Northeast digging out from massive snowstorm", "text": "John Bacon and Doyle Rice\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMore than a foot of snow fell in some areas\n\nA cold front rolled in behind the snow%2C dropping temperatures in some places to single digits\n\nHundreds of flights were canceled again Wednesday\n\nMuch of the Northeast awoke Wednesday to single-digit temperatures, below-zero wind chills and a deep blanket of snow a day after a snowstorm dumped more than a foot of snow in some areas along the I-95 corridor.\n\nFor the second day in a row, traffic was squeezed, airlines were challenged and government offices, schools and businesses were struggling to function.\n\nAnd, although the snowfall was over, the near-record low temperatures promised to plague tens of millions of people from the Southeast to New England.\n\nAbout a foot and a half of snow fell in parts of New Jersey and Massachusetts. Philadelphia saw a little over a foot, the National Weather Service reported, which was a daily record. New York City received a record 11.5 inches, while parts of Maryland had 9 inches.\n\nHanover, Mass., received 18 inches while Manalapan, N.J., recorded 16 inches of snow.\n\nAirlines canceled more than 1,600 flights Wednesday morning, with more than 500 others delayed, Flightstats.com reported. Nearly 3,500 flights were canceled Tuesday, with thousands more delayed.\n\nTraffic flow was improving Wednesday. But the bar wasn't too high -- In Delaware on Tuesday, it took one driver an hour and 45 minutes to make a normal 20-minute drive from Wilmington to the New Castle area.\n\nParts of the Midwest were not exempt from the weather woes. The Weather Channel reported that heavy lake-effect snow near Gary, Ind., had stopped traffic on a section of I-80/94. Close to 20 inches of snow had been reported in Gary, none of which was associated with the big storm along the East Coast.\n\nJust as commuters were digging out from the day-long snowstorm Wednesday morning, bitterly cold air will spread across the East. High temperatures will be at least 10 to 20 degrees below average, even as far south as Miami, according to AccuWeather.\n\nMost of the state of Florida was under a freeze watch overnight, with the exception of far southern Florida. Miami could still see temperatures in the mid-40s tonight.\n\nMany schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky were closed Wednesday.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the 40th annual March for Life was still a go Wednesday, although many bus trips had to be canceled due to the storm.\n\nWhile the East digs out, barely a flake or a drop was to be found anywhere in the parched West: \"Over the West Coast and into the Intermountain West, it's like a broken record with very dry weather and above normal temperatures expected to continue,\" wrote National Weather Service meteorologist David Hamrick in an online forecast.\n\nContributing: Doug Stanglin; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2016/01/23/storm-latest-66-mph-gusts-thousands-lose-power/79163080/", "title": "Record flooding, blizzard conditions batter Delaware", "text": "James Fisher, and Jessica Masulli Reyes\n\nThe News Journal\n\nMarkell imposes level 2 driving ban in Kent, NCCo\n\nRecord coastal flooding at shore; IR Bridge closed\n\nSussex Central opened as a shelter\n\nHurricane-force wind warning issued for shore\n\nAfter a mild winter, a powerful blizzard paralyzed much of the East Coast – bringing with it 1½ feet of snow in northern Delaware and high winds that caused historic flooding in the state's beach communities.\n\nThe massive storm, stretching from the Carolinas to Maine, moved up the coast late Friday before settling over our area Saturday. It caused dozens of crashes and left nearly a thousand homes without power in Delaware. As night fell, the storm continued to move north and east over the ocean but not before trapped vehicles littered the state's arteries, snowplows hummed along empty streets, and Delawareans hunkered down for another evening of menacing winter weather.\n\nSnow and gusty winds in Kent and New Castle counties were expected to finally end by midnight Saturday, more than 24 hours after the storm blanketed the region. But the storm's imminent passing did little to quell fears about incoming high tides that could bring even more flooding to Sussex County.\n\nSaturday morning's high tide at Lewes Breakwater Harbor was, according to preliminary data, the second highest on record and was expected to worsen after Saturday night's high tide.\n\nState House Speaker Peter C. Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, said, \"I don't know that I've ever seen it that high\" on Rehoboth Bay.\n\nA half dozen roads in Sussex and Kent counties were lost under water and forced to close. Some compared the unprecedented flooding to Superstorm Sandy in 2012.\n\nMeanwhile, upstate Delaware saw major road closures for a different reason. Heavy snow and drifting made driving nearly impossible.\n\nSnow accumulation was difficult to accurately measure because of the high winds, but totals ranged from almost 16 inches in Woodside, just outside Dover, to 14.2 inches in Talleyville to just 2.4 inches in Lewes.\n\nAbandoned vehicles and winds blowing snow back onto roadways made it difficult for plows to make much progress.\n\n\"This is the biggest snowstorm I've ever been in,\" said Randy Meisinger, a Delaware Department of Transportation driver.\n\nDelaware State Police reported that by 8 p.m. Saturday troopers had responded to 150 vehicle accidents – plus another 16 in which someone was hurt – 260 disabled vehicles and 70 traffic hazards statewide. These collisions came even as the Delaware State Police and Gov. Jack Markell told people to get off the roads.\n\nDelaware winter storms\n\nDelaware was placed under a state of emergency for the weekend, per Markell's directive. He then issued a level two driving restriction Saturday morning – indefinitely banning motor vehicle travel on Delaware roadways except for those designated as \"essential personnel\" or who had received a waiver from the Delaware Emergency Management Agency.\n\nOther than that, Markell said in a news conference, people \"should not be out on the road. And law enforcement certainly knows they should not be out on the road.\"\n\nNeighboring states enacted similar travel restrictions. Port Authority bridges and tunnels into New York City closed at 2:30 p.m. Saturday, and Philadelphia International Airport canceled all flights Saturday.\n\nThe National Guard increased its deployment in the state this morning, Markell said, to 266 troops. Guardsmen had conducted 30 missions by mid-morning, mostly to transport doctors and nurses from their homes to hospitals, he said. They also rescued people who were stranded because of flooding.\n\nThe travel ban did not extend to Sussex County, where only a level one driving warning was in place. However, part of Del. 1 and the Indian River Inlet Bridge were closed and the National Weather Service issued a hurricane-force wind warning for coastal New Jersey and the Sussex coast south of Cape Henlopen, in effect until 10 p.m. Saturday. The warning meant forecasters expected wind speeds of more than 73 miles per hour in the ocean and along the shoreline.\n\nThe National Weather Service's blizzard warning was to remain in effect until 6 a.m. Sunday. The warning noted that snow accumulations could reach 15 to 20 inches south and east of Philadelphia and 20 to 25 inches from Philadelphia north and west. Locally, higher amounts were possible.\n\nData gathered by the University of Delaware's snow monitoring network showed snowfall totals nearing 1½ feet near New Castle, Newark and Dover. About half a foot fell at other locations in Sussex County.\n\nPower failure at Delaware City Refinery\n\nAccuWeather meteorologist Brian Edwards said wind gusts were consistently 30 to 45 mph near Wilmington on Saturday. In coastal areas, they were nearly double that.\n\nThose winds caused power outages around the state – leaving some cold and in the dark. By nightfall 1,400 Delmarva Power customers were without electricity in Delaware. About 800 of the reported outages were in Sussex County, according to online outage maps.\n\nAt one point Saturday morning, 12 percent of the company's customers in Sussex County were in the dark.\n\nA power failure around 11:40 a.m. at the Delaware City Refinery caused the plant to shut down, which was accompanied by flaring and a chemical release, according to the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.\n\nRefinery officials were still investigating the cause and working to get the plant back online on Saturday, said Barbara Roehl, a manager at the refinery.\n\nA DNREC notification following the power failure said there was a release of pollutants including hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen cyanide in unspecified amounts.\n\nOfficials said harmful levels of the pollutants were not detected at the fenceline and downwind from the facility. Several neighboring residents complained of burning eyes, throats and a bad odor.\n\nOutages also led Sussex County's Emergency Operations Center to open a shelter for people \"in critical need\" at Sussex Central High School near Georgetown. Anyone needing assistance relocating to the shelter, staffed by the American Red Cross, should contact the Sussex County Emergency Operations Center’s storm hotline at (302) 856-7366.\n\nCode Purple was in effect statewide starting Friday night.\n\nBob Reese, senior warden at Christ Church in Dover, said that their women’s shelter will be open 24/7 through Monday. So far, seven women have been at the shelter since Friday night.\n\nVolunteers have been shuttled back and forth to the church in the snow since then. The women have board games and DVDs to keep them busy at the shelter as the storm continued.\n\nHe estimates Christ Church has about 20 boxes of clothes and food for the women. Shoes by far are the greatest need, he said.\n\n“We are doing well. We have a sincere outpouring of food and clothing at all the shelters,” Reese said. “The community has been overwhelmingly generous.”\n\nRoad crews hard at work\n\nFor Delaware Department of Transportation plow crews, the high winds were making it hard to keep primary roads like Del. 1 and U.S. 13 clear, said Jim Westhoff, a DelDOT spokesman.\n\n\"In all three counties, our crews are really struggling to keep the primary roads passable,\" Westhoff said. \"We're spending a lot of time on the same roads over and over again. That's really set us back.\"\n\nGary Laing, a DEMA spokesman, said the speed limit in I-495 had been reduced to 45 miles per hour.\n\n\"Drifting snow is beginning to be a problem in some areas, with a few roads in the Dagsboro and Millsboro areas reported to be impassable,\" Laing said. \"Abandoned vehicles are making it difficult for plows to open an area of Gravel Hill Road south of Millsboro.\"\n\nDelaware snowfall totals\n\nNYC under travel ban from deadly East Coast snowstorm\n\nCrews in Dover were also challenged by the high winds, said Kay Sass, the city’s emergency management coordinator. Sass said that gusts had registered 55 to 60 miles per hour.\n\nDowntown traffic lights bobbed up and down in the wind as snow flurries whooshed around city snow clearing crews around 1:30 p.m. Saturday. Street corners were packed high with snowdrifts.\n\nState Street, which runs through downtown Dover from U.S. 13 and into Magnolia, was a top priority to clear because it leads to Kent General Hospital, Sass said.\n\nDover High Drive, off of Division Street, which leads to Dover High School has also been consistently plowed because it will be used as a shelter in the event of an emergency.\n\nStarting Sunday into Monday, crews will start cleaning the snow banks from surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n“Once our winds die down it will be much easier to get snow removed. Instead of just moving it,” she said.\n\n'We love the snow'\n\nThe blizzard wasn't all bad news, though. Some children ventured outdoors after being cooped up inside all morning.\n\nReilly and Brianne Miller went out during a short break in the snowfall around noon near New Castle.\n\n\"We've been begging to come outside,\" 7-year-old Reilly said.\n\nHer 5-year-old sister added, \"We love the snow.\"\n\nThe sisters, wearing matching pink snow pants and goggles, walked to the back of William Penn High School, at times falling into the deep snow that came up to their waists. They then slid down the hill, screaming for more speed.\n\nCourtney Daniell, 37, braved the gusts to take a trek to see if the Family Dollar store on Governor’s Avenue in Dover was open before heading to a friend’s house.\n\nShe and her roommates picked up storm essentials, such as water, before the weekend, so they were ready for a cozy couple days in the warmth.\n\n“I love it,” Daniell said of the snow. “Most of the time.”\n\nAlso in Dover, Cameron Calvert, 27, and Heather Bollinger, 22, couldn't have been more excited for the first flurries late Friday afternoon.\n\nAs soon as the forecast came true, the lovebirds hit the road from Bridgeville to Dover's historic Green to take engagement photos with the old Kent County Courthouse as their backdrop.\n\nThough their wedding is planned for June 18, they wanted snowy photos to showcase their engagement.\n\nOriginally they thought they'd have to wait until February to get the photos, Calvert said.\n\nBut it only took three days, Bollinger added.\n\n\"We got lucky,\" the couple said as their photographer Tom Feaser adjusted his lens.\n\nIf Feaser considers the snow good luck, more could be on the way. Meteorologist Edwards said there is another storm system forming over the Gulf of Mexico now.\n\nMeteorologists will be watching it closely to see if it will next week venture out to sea or take a turn right toward the East Coast.\n\n\"It's something to watch,\" he said.\n\nContact James Fisher at (302) 983-6772, on Twitter @JamesFisherTNJ or jfisher@delawareonline.com.

Then at 18th and Bainbridge, the place was falling apart; and an Eagles organization that formed after a teammate’s child was diagnosed with leukemia was helping to cover the costs.\n\nAnd after Evans accepted that check in 1974, she said five words that Murray, now 77, will never forget: “You know what else we need?”\n\nThat need was a refuge, a place where families could stay while their children are in the hospital being treated for cancer — where parents could support each other emotionally through the turmoil of a child with a deadly disease.\n\nMore:$7M in cost increases push back Yorktowne Hotel re-opening\n\nMore:Photos: The Great Backyard Bird Count, National Audubon Society, at Nixon Park\n\nMurray and the Eagles were on board, but they needed to find a way to pay for it. So he worked it out with a buddy at a local advertising agency that proceeds from McDonalds’ next promotion — the Shamrock Shake near St. Patrick’s Day, which had been created just a few years prior — would go toward the establishment of the first Ronald McDonald House later built in West Philly near 40th and Spruce streets.\n\n“It’s changed my life forever,” Murray, who lives in the Philly ‘burbs and is still involved with the Ronald McDonald House today, said. “You can’t underestimate the power of people’s goodness.”\n\nThis is the story of how a minty green milkshake that started out flavored as an unpopular lemon-lime drink became the basis for one of the most recognized charities in America.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW VIDEO.\n\nIt began with a selfless act\n\nFormer Eagles owner Leonard Tose was a charitable guy. The owner of a multi-million dollar trucking business, Tose bought the Eagles in 1969 (he later sold them off to cover millions in gambling debts) and, while there, raised millions to fight leukemia and gave thousands to help fund local high school sports programs.\n\nDuring his tenure, Eagles tight end Fred Hill had a daughter named Kim. In 1969, after Kim turned 5, she was diagnosed with acute lymphatic leukemia. Doctors told her parents she likely had just six months to live. In those days, pediatric leukemia oftentimes meant imminent death.\n\nMore:Pa. Fact Finder: Did 0 cases get thrown out because of speedy-trial issues in York County?\n\nSo Fred and his wife Fran spent the better part of the next three years driving back and forth from South Jersey, where they lived, to St. Christopher’s in North Philly for her treatment. She was exceeding the six-month prognosis doctor’s had given her years before.\n\nThat’s when the Eagles got involved. Hill and his neighbor Stan Lane, with the support of Tose, started a group called Eagles Fly for Leukemia with the goal of using their considerable platform in the region to raise funds to help families who didn’t have enough money to pay for their children’s treatment. The Eagles held a fundraising dinner, but Tose wanted his GM at the time — Jimmy Murray — to do more. He told him to go up to St. Christopher’s and ask doctors treating Kim exactly what they needed to improve their facilities and help families.\n\nMurray went to the hospital and found a small side room, not even the size of a normal chapel in a hospital. He prayed to God: “Please don’t let me say the wrong thing.”\n\nDr. Lawrence Namain met with Murray and, when the Eagles GM asked the cancer doctor what he needed to do his job more effectively, the physician told him: “Look at this place. It’s 100 years old. We need everything.” He paused for a moment. “But there’s somebody with a greater need.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW GALLERY.\n\nA doctor's vision\n\nMurray was a rowhome Philly guy, through and through. Grew up in West Philly, had friends in every which way, used his charm and his deep Irish Catholic roots to talk to almost anyone.\n\nIt didn’t really work with the oncologist who Namain referred him to: Dr. Audrey Evans at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nEvans was matter-of-fact. She didn’t care about the Eagles, didn’t even own a television to watch them. When Murray suggested they meet at the Spectrum for a check presentation, she had no idea where he was talking about. Her life was dedicated to the kids she cared for. So Murray told Evans that his boss, Leonard Tose, was a practical type of guy. They should meet with him, Murray told her, and get right to the point about what the hospital needed financially to better treat children.\n\nMore:Watch this woman struggle to steal from a McDonald's at 1 a.m.\n\nEvans asked Tose for $50,000 to fund two new rooms. When Tose said, “how much for a whole floor?” Evans didn’t hesitate. It would be a million dollars.\n\n“Then we’ll put in a million dollars,” Tose told her. “And Jimmy will raise it.\"\n\nAfter a series of dinners and phone drives, Murray and the Eagles had raised $125,000; that was the first check toward what CHOP would receive to upgrade its facilities. Evans was happy — but that’s when she told Murray about her real vision.\n\n“You know what happens when I tell a family their child has this disease? They don’t hear anything else after,” Murray recalls her saying. “What I would like to get is a YMCA… a place where the families could lean on each other emotionally and have a place to stay while the child is in the hospital.”\n\nMurray responded: “Look, I’m from Philly. We were poorer than poor. Everybody took care of everybody. Not only did America start here, we’re all neighborhood people. What you need is a house.”\n\n“OK, fine,” she said. “Help get us a house.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW VIDEO.\n\nA ‘McMiracle’\n\nThe Shamrock Shake wasn’t really a thing in 1974. It had been invented in 1970 as a green drink made with lemon-lime sherbet, but hadn’t done big sales. Still, when Murray called his buddy Don Tuckerman at a local ad agency that worked with McDonald’s, the Shamrock Shake was the next upcoming promotion.\n\nAnd it was perfect. Green shake. Green money. Green Eagles. Murray asked that 25 cents per shake go to help fund Evans’ vision for a home for families. But that ask had to go through the higher-ups.\n\nRegional manager of McDonalds Ed Rensi called Murray about the 25-cent-per-shake going rate. Murray wondered if maybe he’d asked for too much. Rensi said to him over the phone: “If we just give you all the money, can we call it the Ronald McDonald House?” Murray said that if they gave all the proceeds over, McDonalds could name it the Hamburgler House for all he cared.\n\nThe milkshake was changed to just a vanilla milkshake with green food coloring (it wasn’t made minty until 1983) and regional sales went well. Just a few months later, Murray and the Eagles were able to buy an old, seven-bedroom fraternity house near 40th and Spruce Streets that they fixed up. And on Oct. 15, 1974, with Mayor Frank Rizzo by their side, the first Ronald McDonald House was dedicated.\n\nToday, there are more than 350 houses serving 60 countries. Ronald McDonald House Charities helps more than five million families a year.

Now, the bulbous Grimace has returned too.\n\nIt's all part of a Grimace birthday celebration, beginning Monday, which includes a limited-edition Grimace Birthday Meal, which comes with either a Big Mac or 10-piece Chicken McNuggets, fries – and the new purple berry-flavored shake. The meal is available at participating restaurants, while supplies last. Most restaurants will also sell you the shake separately.\n\nBirthdays have been a part of McDonald's for decades – some may remember redeeming their free McDonald's birthday meal postcard as kids.\n\n\"We're using that heritage that the brand has with people, but also want to connect with youth of today,\" said JJ Healan, vice president, U.S. marketing, brand, content & culture for McDonald's.\n\nActivities on tap for McDonald's Grimace birthday celebration\n\nThe Grimace birthday celebration goes beyond the restaurant:\n\n◾ Merchandise. Customers can buy Grimace merchandise including T-shirts and socks at McDonald's online merchandise site.\n\n◾ Games. A Grimace video game arrives June 12 on desktop and mobile. \"It's reminiscent of games from the '90s,\" Healan said. \"Grimace actually goes on this journey with his McDonaldland friends.\"\n\n◾ Social media and charity. When McDonald's fans post a birthday memory June 13-14 on McDonald’s Instagram story (use the \"add yours\" sticker), the company will donate $5 to the Ronald McDonald House Charities, up to $200,000 total.\n\n\"There's a lot of really cool layers to the campaign overall\" in the effort to \"connect with our fans to drive the brand in culture, as we are on our journey to make McDonald's a cultural icon,\" Healan said. \"What better way to celebrate birthdays and actually give one of our favorite McDonaldland characters a spotlight for June.\"\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

That was a perfect combination of nostalgia and putting the brand in culture with a partner who connects with Gen Z.\"\n\nMore new McDonald's menu items? A Cheesy Jalapeño Bacon Quarter Pounder coming next month?\n\nMcDonald's is already in the process of improving its burgers with a saucier Big Mac, softer sandwich buns, toasted golden brown, \"perfectly melted cheese,\" and caramelized onions.\n\nIt apparently has a new burger coming to the menu soon, with two sites reporting a Cheesy Jalapeño Bacon Quarter Pounder could hit menus this summer. The food site Chew Boom said the burger would be available as a single or double, with three strips of bacon, pickled jalapeños and cheese sauce, along with two slices of cheese on a sesame seed bun. The menu item has been tested at some locations in Texas, the site reports.\n\nAnother site, The Krazy Coupon Lady, reports that when the burger arrives you will be able to order cheesy sauce and jalapeño slices on the side with any order.\n\nMcDonald's declined to comment about the new burger to USA TODAY, but we will stay vigilant on the burger beat in the days ahead.\n\nMore from USA TODAY\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/06"}]}

And on a recent episode, the Kelces found time to discuss not only football, but also aliens.\n\nTravis: “They’re definitely here.’’\n\nJason: “They’re here?’’\n\nTravis: “They’re here, for sure. I think they’re either underwater or on Antarctica.’’\n\nJason: “Why would they be on Antarctica?’’\n\nTravis: “Because nobody’s there.’’\n\nWhat separates the brothers\n\nTwo years aren’t the only thing that separate Jason, 35, and Travis, 33.\n\nSince making it to the NFL, Travis sports eye-catching clothes that include an $18,600 monogrammed Louis Vuitton coat, a yellow zebra-print Celine coat and multicolored dancer faux coat designed by KidSuper.\n\nJason prefers T-shirts and sweatshirts. He has a lumberjack-bushy beard. Travis keeps his beard fashionably trimmed.\n\nTravis sometimes drips with gaudy jewelry. Jason only drips with sweat.\n\n“I think they’re very similar in a lot of ways,’’ Donna Kelce said. “But Jason’s very pensive and he cares about what people think of him out in the public. So he’ll maybe dial it back a couple of notches, but give him a few beers or put him in front of a crowd in a Mummers outfit and they’re pretty much the same.’’\n\nDonna Kelce was referring to Jason’s epic speech during a team celebration in front of thousands of fans the week after the Eagles won Super Bowl 52. Travis had his own memorable ‘’jabroni’’ rant after the Chiefs beat the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship game Jan. 29.\n\nMeet the parents\n\nBy now you probably know about Donna, who wears a custom split jersey, half Eagles and half Chiefs. Less visible has been Ed Kelce, although he got equal billing on the brothers’ 26th podcast episode, which published Monday.\n\nThe parents, who divorced about a decade ago, both said they believe in the existence of aliens. Ed, who worked in the steel business, matched his sons’ f-bomb for f-bomb on another podcast filled with laughter.\n\nOPINION:Fathers of Super Bowl 57 quarterbacks wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nMORE:Big Charlie's, iconic Chiefs bar in Philly, will be closed Super Bowl Sunday. Here's why.\n\n“What you see on the podcast is what we lived through,’’ Ed Kelce said. “Cohorts in any kind of trouble they could get into.’’\n\nDuring Monday's opening night of Super Bowl week, Jason described growing up with Travis as “chaos.’’\n\n“But enjoyable chaos,’’ he told reporters. \"Yeah, I think it was a lot of fun, a lot of broken windows, a lot of shattered things around the house that my parents had to deal with. But man, it was one thing after the other.\"\n\nTravis addressed the fights the brothers had with each other growing up.\n\n“Jason won all the fights but one, and that was the last fight,'' Travis told reporters on Opening Night. \" … I’d be silly to say that I won. But I definitely gave it my all and he stopped fighting me after that.’’\n\nBig brother to the rescue\n\nIn high school, Travis did not spring out of bed.\n\n“It was you had to set a bomb off in Travis’ room to get his attention,’’ Ed Kelce said.\n\nThe job of ensuring Travis made it to school on time, especially when football players had to report by 5:45 a.m. for two-a-days, belonged to Jason.\n\n“Jason would be dragging Travis in here,’’ said Mike Jones, who coached the brothers in high school. “I just always remember Jason making sure Travis was where he was supposed to be and doing what he was supposed to be doing.’’\n\nThat became more challenging in college after the brothers joined the football team at Cincinnati.\n\n'Don't give up on him, Coach'\n\nBoth Kelce brothers got college scholarships to play at Cincinnati. After his second season, Travis had tested positive twice for marijuana, was suspended for a year and lost his scholarship.\n\nHe moved into the same room with Jason in hopes his older brother could help him stay out of trouble.\n\nButch Jones, who took over as the program’s head coach, allowed Travis to practice that year with the scout team. Travis was reinstated before his junior year and suspended again after that season.\n\n“I called Jason and told him that (Travis) was done and that he wasn’t living up to the expectations, he was underachieving,’’ Jones said. “And I still remember to this day, Jason’s like, ‘Coach, you can’t give up on him. Do not give up on him, Coach.\n\n“So Jason and I kind of worked together.’’\n\nThat next semester, Jones said, Travis Kelce joked it was the first time in his life he’d posted a 3.0 grade point average. Reinstated to the team, he had a breakout senior year with 45 catches for 722 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nJason Kelce, then playing for the Philadelphia Eagles, vouched for his younger brother when the Chiefs selected Travis in the third round of the 2013 draft.\n\n“Everybody talks about brotherly love and all that,’’ Jones said. “I have never been a part of a closeness and a bond like two brothers have like them.’’", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/university-of-cincinnati/2023/02/02/jason-travis-kelce-are-first-nfl-brothers-to-play-in-super-bowl/69856727007/", "title": "Who are the Kelce brothers?

It's the second Super Bowl for both, games both their teams won.\n\nThe brothers graduated from Cleveland Heights High School in Cuyahoga County in 2006 (Jason) and 2008 (Travis). While their football careers eventually converged at the University of Cincinnati, their roads to success had twists and turns.\n\nFormer UC football coaches Mark Dantonio, Brian Kelly and Butch Jones remember Jason and Travis Kelce\n\nTo those who witnessed their time around Nippert Stadium, the Kelces were always entertaining and somewhat mischievous.\n\nWatching Jason Kelce dress up as a Mummer's Parade member when the Eagles won Super Bowl 52 in 2018 or watching Travis Kelce, a 2019 Super Bowl champ, do the UC cheer after touchdowns, surprised no one who followed their time as Bearcats.\n\n\"I was just trying to make sure they made it to the next game,\" current LSU coach Brian Kelly said of his UC time with the brothers (December 2006-December 2009). \"They were great personalities. Jason was an emotional leader. He loved his teammates. He loved playing for Cincinnati.\"\n\nHow Jason Kelce went from Cincinnati walk-on to NFL All-Pro\n\nNow 35, Jason Kelce came to UC's campus as a walk-on linebacker. A few pounds and practice scuffles later, he was an offensive lineman and eventually a sixth-round pick of the Eagles in 2011.\n\nIn 2006, as a Bearcat redshirt for Mark Dantonio, Jason was Scout Team Defensive Player of the Year. At one point mid-year, Dantonio needed a scout team offensive lineman. He approached Jason even though at 240 pounds, he was some 50 pounds lighter than his current playing weight.\n\nJason Kelce sings national anthem:Former Cincinnati Bearcat sings prior to 76ers game\n\n\"We asked him to move over for just one week,\" Dantonio said. \"He did and played center. We got into a situation where we had to keep him there because of injuries. It's pretty crazy how his career sort of changed when he became an offensive center. He was so much more athletic than the guys that were around him.\"\n\nThat said, Dantonio admits he didn't see him as an All-Pro offensive lineman for all of these years. He credits Jason's hard work and toughness, something he preached relentlessly throughout his coaching career.\n\nJason Kelce wasn't the first diamond-in-the-rough Dantonio recruited at UC who became a Philadelphia Eagle. Dantonio also happened upon a two-star recruit playing basketball at Detroit Jesuit, Connor Barwin. He became a tight end for Dantonio then shifted to defensive line under Brian Kelly.\n\nAfter Michigan State hired Dantonio in November 2006, Jason Kelce continued the transition to center and guard under new coach Kelly. Kelly's offense at the time needed more athleticism from the linemen to be able to roll out. They had to drop weight to fit Kelly's scheme, but Kelce's build and attitude fit fine.\n\n\"We were going to a spread offense,\" Kelly said. \"His ability to move and pull and do the things we wanted to do, it was a great fit.\"\n\n'He's one of the smartest football players I've ever coached': Butch Jones on Travis Kelce\n\nBy 2010, Kelly was gone and Butch Jones was at the helm. Concerned about his size in terms of pro ball, Bearcat No. 60 lobbied Jones to switch him back to linebacker. Jones instead had him stay with the O-line and had him focus on his abilities at center.\n\nHe's been a mainstay at the position ever since as a six-time Pro Bowl selection, even though the Patriots did work him out as a fullback before he was drafted. At the 2011 NFL Combine, Jason Kelce had the fastest 40-yard dash of any offensive lineman at 4.89.\n\n\"He's one of the smartest football players I've ever coached,\" Jones said. \"It gets back to his competitiveness and his toughness. It's second to none. When you put the smarts and toughness together, that's what you get in Jason Kelce.\"\n\n'That is an NFL tight end!': Younger brother Travis Kelce makes impression on Brian Kelly\n\nTravis Kelce, 33, was a two-star recruit out of Cleveland Heights as a quarterback. Still, he was 6-foot-5 with athletic ability and an attitude. Kelly famously pointed out the lanky lad taking reps with the quarterbacks in 2008.\n\nTo all within earshot, he proclaimed, \"That is an NFL tight end!\"\n\nDantonio knew about the younger Kelce while recruiting for Michigan State but the Spartans stopped short of offering him at quarterback.\n\n'I'm not eating it':Travis Kelce discusses Skyline Chili\n\n\"You had to sort of project him to tight end or defensive end,\" Dantonio said. \"I know he went to Cincinnati and excelled and the rest is history.\"\n\nKelly would keep Kelce at quarterback using him as an occasional \"Wildcat\" option near the goal line, something the Chiefs have done every now and then.\n\n\"We saw him as an athlete that could do a lot of things for us,\" Kelly said. \"I think in his first game against Rutgers he had a couple touchdowns.\"\n\nKelly was careful not to immediately move the younger Kelce to tight end, instead making it gradual.\n\nHow Travis Kelce went from suspension to team leader at Cincinnati\n\nAhead of the Bearcats' 2009 Sugar Bowl against Florida, Kelly left to coach Notre Dame. Before that game, UC announced Travis Kelce's suspension for the upcoming season for violating team rules, which was later determined to be a positive marijuana test.\n\nWhen Travis returned in 2011, Jones was at the helm of the Bearcats, his older brother was keeping him on the straight and narrow and he was a full-time tight end. The former three-sport Cleveland Heights standout caught 11 balls in 2011, then 45 in 2022 with eight touchdowns.\n\n\"In all of my years of coaching, I've never had an individual change his ways, change his outlook, change his lifestyle, change anything like Travis has,\" Jones said.\n\nJones had a group of retired military trainers come in to assess his team and pick out leaders. The current Arkansas State and former Tennessee coach said they've never failed in their recommendations of leaders through shared adversity. Jones remembered looking at the trainers in shock as they rated Travis Kelce as his team leader.\n\n\"They try to expose you,\" Jones said. \"The leader said, 'He's got influence, coach. They go how he goes.' They were 100% right. His senior year was remarkable.\"\n\nTravis Kelce's Chiefs have never lost against Jason Kelce's Eagles\n\nThe blue-collar toughness of the family shows as neither Kelce was a celebrated first-round pick. Both overcame odds in college and in the pros to become among the all-time best at their positions. Since the brothers have been in the league, their teams have met three times, with the Chiefs winning each game. The latest gathering was Oct. 3, 2021, a 42-30 Kansas City win at Lincoln Financial Field and the last duel between Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes at quarterback.\n\nHurts threw for 387 yards and ran for 47 behind Jason Kelce's line but Mahomes was 24-of-30 for five touchdowns in the Chiefs' victory with four completions to Travis Kelce.\n\nTravis Kelce's eight Pro Bowl selections give the family 14 Pro Bowls, a pair of Super Bowl championships and likely a triumphant 58-mile drive from Cleveland Heights to Canton someday to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nBoth have returned to Cincinnati periodically to take in Bearcat games. Travis Kelce was in Dallas for UC's College Football Playoff semifinal in the 2021 Cotton Bowl vs. Alabama, along with teammate Mahomes.\n\nDue to their personalities, their careers will go on long past the playing field. Recently, they've started a podcast called \"New Heights,\" a once-a-week offering on Apple podcasts where they're labeled \"football's funniest family duo.\" Their topics have varied between Buffalo's Damar Hamlin, retired tight end Rob Gronkowski, Waffle House and alien conspiracies.\n\nSpirited combat between the Kelce brothers\n\nThere's rarely been a dull moment between the two brothers. If a scuffle broke out at a Bearcat practice, odds are Jason Kelce was involved. Media would sometimes try to guess at which point in practice the melee would begin. The Eagles center was one of UC's most prolific helmet throwers.\n\nTravis Kelce was also known for his ferocious play as coach Jones could attest. All know his talents as a receiver but he was also pretty good at taking his 250 pounds to move the opposition forcefully out of the way. Referees would often pre-warn Jones to keep a handle on his tight end.\n\n\"I would have officials come up to me before the game and say, 'You need to help us control No. 18 today,'\" Jones said. \"'He's borderline on every play. We're going to need your help.' I would just look at them and smile at them because the opposing coach must have said something. That was Travis.\"\n\nDonna Kelce supporting Philadelphia Eagles, Kansas City Chiefs in 2023 Super Bowl\n\nOn Feb. 12, Donna Kelce will again be supporting two sons in her custom-made double jersey. It's a combination of Jason's No. 62 for the Eagles and No. 87 for Travis. The jersey could accompany Ed and Donna's boys to Canton someday.\n\nRather than pick a squad, Mrs. Kelce has said she pulls for both offenses. Her competitive sons typically give her a reason to cheer.\n\n\"Even when they were at Cincinnati, there was a competitiveness that was there,\" Kelly said. \"They love each other, don't get me wrong. But, these two were as competitive as any two guys that I've had. As brothers, they didn't hide it. They're going to be pulling for each other in only one fashion: that they get to beat each other. It'll be quite a matchup.\"\n\nDonna Kelce:Mom delivers homemade cookies to sons Jason and Travis at Super Bowl Opening Night\n\nSaid Jones, \"What's kept their longevity is obviously they work very hard in the offseason. But, that internal drive, that competitive drive, they're always competing with each other to be better than they were the previous year. They're just gritty, tough, hard-nosed good teammates that play with a lot of energy and passion. It's fun to watch. They're the personalities of their team.

She also runs the fitness brand Strong is Sexy.\n\nNicole and Kelce initially met through Instagram in 2017, after the NFL star slid into the influencer’s DMs. The couple reportedly had an on-again, off-again relationship for several years before officially splitting in May 2022.\n\nEras Tour review:Why Taylor Swift's Eras Tour took me back to the darkest moment of my life", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/09/25/swiftie-guide-travis-kelce/70960958007/", "title": "Who is Travis Kelce?

But during the game, Donna Kelce sat next to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell at the commissioner’s invitation.\n\nDonna Kelce was scheduled to be involved with a Bud Light giveaway Wednesday at the Chiefs victory parade.\n\n\"It was just so cool, man, to get to see her celebrate in that in with us,\" Jason Kelce said of the weeklong festivities. \"And it was an awesome moment. Just so happy for her and happy that she got her moment, Dad got his. So ironically, you lose a Super Bowl and you’re crying after the game and they’re not tears of sadness.

Here are the people in the storyline.", "text": "If Taylor Swift indeed graces Lambeau Field with her superstar presence on Sunday night for the Green Bay Packers' game against the Kansas City Chiefs, she won't be the only face you're likely to see on the NBC cameras.\n\nHere's a rundown of all the key names and faces involved in this season-long story:\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nYou've heard of her? The most famous entertainment personality of the moment turns 34 just 10 days after the Packers game and hails from West Reading, Pennsylvania. She began her recording career as a teenager in Nashville, starting in earnest with her debut album \"Taylor Swift\" in 2006. That was merely the beginning.\n\nThough her celebrity has gradually built over the ensuing years, nothing has been able to match the spectacle of \"The Eras Tour,\" which began in 2023 five years after her last tour — and with four new albums since her last tour. The tour, which will continue in 2024, sells out stadiums immediately after tickets go on sale and has spawned a hit concert movie that will finish among the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box office in 2023.\n\nSUPER BOWL CENTRAL: Latest Super Bowl 58 news, stats, odds, matchups and more.\n\nShe's won 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year awards, among numerous other accolades. She's become a figure of cultural prominence even beyond her music, though she also happens to be the highest-grossing female music producer ever and crossed into billionaire status this year.\n\nAnd now, she's dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Her dating history, often an object of fascination for her fans, has occasionally led to a hit song or two over the years.\n\nTravis Kelce\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs star, 34, is one of the greatest tight ends of all time. He's made the past eight Pro Bowls and been named first-team All-Pro four times. He was named to the NFL's all-decade team for the 2010s, usually a marker that indicates he'll eventually get inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nKelce has said he first got to know Swift over the summer, and rumors of their relationship picked up considerable steam in September, particularly when she showed up at the Chiefs game Sept. 24, watching from the Kelce family suite in a win over the Bears. Swift has been to three other Chiefs games (all wins), and the relationship was essentially confirmed in mid-October when the couple was seen holding hands.\n\nDonna Kelce\n\nKelce's mother was already a bit of a media star after last season, when the Chiefs advanced to the Super Bowl against the Eagles — a team featuring Travis' brother, Jason Kelce — and Donna regularly wore a custom jersey that demonstrated support to both sides of the divide. She's been interviewed about the Taylor-Travis relationship on the \"Today\" show.\n\nSomewhat lesser-known is father Ed Kelce, who has said he had a strongly favorable first impression of Swift and complimented her for casually picking up empty bottles and other garbage in the suite when she went to get a drink herself.\n\nDonna and Ed were married for 20 years before getting a divorce, but the couple remain friends.\n\nBrittany Mahomes\n\nAnother person you're likely to see in the suite is Brittany Mahomes, the wife of Chiefs quarterback Patrick. Fans of the Netflix series \"Quarterback\" will recognize her after she played a prominent role in the series, taking viewers behind the scenes of her family's life.\n\nBrittany seems to have hit it off with Swift, even crafting a special handshake after a touchdown and seemingly exchanging texts on a regular basis.\n\nPatrick Mahomes\n\nHe's the man responsible for getting the ball to Kelce and is almost certainly on the same path as his tight end to Canton as a future Pro Football Hall of Famer. The two-time Super Bowl champion has made the past five Pro Bowls and has twice been named the league's Most Valuable Player. With the 28-year-old at the helm, the Chiefs have made the past five conference title games and three Super Bowls in that stretch.\n\nJason Kelce\n\nNo pair of brothers have ever been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but that's not going to remain true forever. Wisconsin natives J.J. Watt and T.J. Watt are both on course. Former Packers receiver Sterling Sharpe could eventually get the call to join his brother Shannon. You can't rule out Eli Manning one day joining his brother Peyton.\n\nBut if all else fails, the Kelces are going to make it happen.\n\nJason Kelce, 36, is dominant in his position as center for the Philadelphia Eagles, earning first-team All-Pro a staggering five times in the last six years. Much has been made this year about Philadelphia's ability to successfully gain short yardage with quarterback sneaks — the \"Tush Push\" has become a phenomenon — and Kelce is a big reason why.\n\nJason and Travis have their own podcast together, and it was (as previously mentioned) quite the occasion when the two faced off in last year's Super Bowl. It's interesting that Jason plays for the team emerging from near Taylor's hometown, and Swift has previously pledged her love for the Eagles. But now she has a new rooting interest, as well.\n\nBoth brothers played college football at Cincinnati, with Travis getting selected in the third round of the 2013 draft and Jason in the sixth round of the 2011 draft.\n\nSimone Biles\n\nThe Packers have their own famous extended family, as we know.\n\nSimone Biles, herself internationally famous and the most decorated gymnast of all time, has four Olympic gold medals and 23 World Championships golds to her name. She happens to be married to Packers safety Jonathan Owens, who had a monster day in Detroit last week.\n\nCan we expect Biles and Swift to cross paths on Sunday at Lambeau Field? Biles has said she'd love to see it happen.\n\nAndy Reid\n\nThe Chiefs coach (and former Packers assistant) has had kind words for the Kelce-Swift romance, and it turns out Reid has known Swift for years.\n\nReid, who led the Eagles to a Super Bowl during a 14-year tenure as the franchise's head coach — including Jason Kelce's first two seasons — said he got to know Taylor's father, Scott Swift, during his days in Philly.\n\n\"I knew her from Philadelphia. Her dad was a big NFL fan,\" Reid said on former Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb's podcast. \"So I had met her when she was real young, and her dad. I joked about setting Kelce up, and, you know, I'm just saying!\"\n\nReid, who was on the staff of the Packers teams that went to the Super Bowl after the 1996 and 1997 season, is in his 10th year as Chiefs coach.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/01"}]}
