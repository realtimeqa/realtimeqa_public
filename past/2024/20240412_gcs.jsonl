The two had a meeting in Kabul on Friday morning and later held a joint press conference.\n\n\"Britain has paid a heavy price for helping to bring stability to this country,\" Cameron said, paying tribute to the 453 British servicemen and women who died while serving in Afghanistan.\n\n\"An Afghanistan free from al-Qaeda is in our national interest — as well as Afghanistan's,\" he said. \"And now, 13 long years later, Afghanistan can — and must — deliver its own security.\"\n\nBut, \"we are not leaving this country alone,\" he added. \"In Britain you will always have a strong partner and a friend.\"\n\nCameron arrived a day after visiting British pilots in Cyprus who are taking part in airstrikes on Islamic State group targets in Iraq. British warplanes have been conducting combat missions over Iraq since Saturday, after Britain joined the U.S.-led coalition of nations that are launching airstrikes against the militants.\n\n\"The work of defeating Islamist extremist terror goes on elsewhere in the world,\" Cameron said in Kabul. \"And because this threatens us at home, we must continue to play our part.\"\n\nGhani Ahmadzai thanked the British for their sacrifices in Afghanistan, especially the families who lost loved ones in the war. \"They stood shoulder to shoulder with us and we will remember,\" he said.\n\nGhani Ahmadzai's inauguration this week marked the start of a new era for his country, with a national unity government poised to confront a resilient Taliban insurgency.\n\nA day after he was sworn in, his administration signed a security agreement allowing the United States to keep about 9,800 troops in the country to train and assist Afghan national security forces. A separate agreement was signed with NATO, outlining parameters for 4,000 to 5,000 additional international troops — mostly from Britain, Germany, Italy and Turkey — to stay in a noncombat role after NATO's combat mission ends on Dec. 31.\n\nFormer President Hamid Karzai had refused to approve the deal, and the results of a June presidential runoff to replace Karzai took months to resolve, finally coming to a conclusion with Ghani Ahmadzai's swearing-in and the establishment of a national unity government.\n\nGhani Ahmadzai's former rival for the presidency, Abdullah Abdullah, was appointed the country's new chief executive, a post akin to prime minister.\n\nCameron lauded both Afghan men, saying they put national interests ahead of \"personal power\" when they struck a power-sharing deal. \"I look forward to working with both of you in the years ahead,\" he said.\n\nGhani Ahmadzai also praised his former rival, saying the two of them \"have managed a first, which is really rare in the Muslim world — a democratic transfer of authority, not power.\"\n\nCameron also added a warning to the insurgents. \"If the Taliban want to secure a role in the future of Afghanistan, then they must accept that they have to give up violence and engage in the political process,\" he said.\n\nThe British premier, who was to visit British troops in Helmand province later on Friday, insisted there was no prospect of the U.K. going back to fight in Afghanistan.\n\n\"We are not going to send combat troops back to Afghanistan, because we have trained up an effective Afghan army and Afghan police force. It has been hard, patient work,\" he said.\n\nBut more than a decade after U.S. forces helped topple the Taliban in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, Afghanistan is still at war with the Islamic militant group, which regularly carries out attacks, mainly targeting security forces.\n\nOnly this week, Taliban suicide bombers staged attacks on Afghan forces in Kabul, killing at least 10 soldiers. Even with residual foreign forces in the country, there remain serious questions about the ability of the Afghan troops to take on the militants on their own.\n\nBritain is one of the largest financial donors to the Afghan government and Cameron said he and Ghani Ahmadzai would jointly host a conference on future aid to Afghanistan in November in London.\n\nIn addition, Cameron pledged 178 million pounds ($287 million) a year until 2017 to support education, health and other public services in Afghanistan.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2012/12/18/queen-elizabeth-cabinet/1776935/", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II attends U.K. Cabinet meeting", "text": "Maria Puente, USA TODAY\n\nAnother surprise from Queen Elizabeth II\n\nShe attends Cabinet meeting for first time in 60-year reign\n\nA piece of Antarctica is named for her in honor of Diamond Jubilee\n\nThe queen keeps surprising all.\n\nToday, Queen Elizabeth II sat in on a Cabinet meeting for the first time in her 60-year reign — and the first monarch to do so since 1781 — taking a seat between British Prime Minister David Cameron and Foreign Secretary William Hague to observe the weekly discussion of government business.\n\nShe said little but looked interested during the visit, which also included gifts of 60 elaborate placemats and the announcement that a piece of frozen Antarctica would be named after her as Queen Elizabeth Land, in honor of her Diamond Jubilee.\n\nThe visit was Cameron's idea to celebrate her 60 years on the throne, according to The Guardian. Wearing a royal blue wool dress and coat and a sapphire-and-diamond broach, the queen got a quick tour of 10 Downing Street, then entered the Cabinet Room where more than two dozen government ministers and politicians were waiting.\n\nCameron opened the session by saying it was the first time a monarch had attended a full Cabinet meeting since George III in 1781, when Anglo-American relations were were considerably more fraught. Things have improved since then, he said, in characteristic British understatement.\n\nThe queen listened to a discussion of the political and military situation in Afghanistan, but the only thing she is reported to have said (besides Merry Christmas) came during a brief talk about the annual speech she gives for the government to Parliament. She said it should be shorter rather than longer.\n\nThe queen attended the meeting as an observer, not to meddle in government business. But the visit raised some eyebrows for appearing to blur the constitutional line between government and crown. As head of state, the monarch performs ceremonial duties related to government but must remain above politics.\n\nBut the queen, 86, has been sending eyebrows soaring and stiff upper lips smiling all year, most memorably when she participated in a filmed skit with actor Daniel Craig as James Bond for the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London this summer.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2015/06/16/prince-harry-meets-flotus-and-daughters-at-palace/28809093/", "title": "Prince Harry meets Obama girls at palace", "text": "Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFirst daughters Sasha and Malia Obama, traveling this week with their mother and grandmother, had tea with the world's most eligible bachelor, Prince Harry, at his London palace Tuesday.\n\nWe know this happened because the palace said so, but there's no picture of the presumably charming moment when the Obama girls met Harry.\n\nIt happened in private, without the pesky paparazzi or press photographers buzzing around.\n\nInstead, there was just one photographer, from the White House, present for the tea party, according to the palace, and her picture is of first lady Michelle Obama and Harry.\n\nWhich is just the way Mrs. Obama likes it when it comes to media coverage of Malia, 16, and Sasha, 14.\n\nThe first lady took her daughters and her mother, Marian Robinson, to Kensington Palace in the morning to meet Harry, reciprocating Harry's surprise drop-in at the White House two years ago.\n\n\"Prince Harry was also delighted to meet Malia and Sasha Obama and The First Lady's mother Mrs Marian Robinson,\" the palace statement said.\n\nThe tea party was one of the first lady's first stops in her visit to the U.K. and Italy this week to promote her causes, including Let's Move!, support for military families, and promoting girls' education.

He has left a very personal signature as a thinker at the head of the Church, and also as a shepherd.

No pope before him made more strides to improve the relationship with the Jews - on so many levels.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, an observant Catholic, praised Pope Benedict XVI in a statement and thanked him for his 2008 visit to the U.S. \"The Holy Father's decision displays extraordinary humility and love for the Church, two things that have been hallmarks of his service,\" he said, \"People of all nations have been blessed by the sacrifices he has made to sow the seeds of hope, justice, and compassion throughout the world in the name of Our Lord and Savior.\"\n\nIn Russia, Dimitriy Sizonenko, spokesman for the Russian Orthodox Church, said there is no reason to expect any drastic changes in the Vatican's policies.\n\n\"In its relations with Orthodox Churches, the Roman Catholic Church has always ensured continuity between popes,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for Philippines President Benigno Aquino said in a statement, \"Not only the Catholic world, but all peoples and nations of goodwill are filled with great regret.\"\n\n\"We recall, in particular, with fond gratitude, the many prayers and comforting words Pope Benedict XVI has dedicated to Filipinos in times of calamity and challenge,\" the statement said.\n\nThe British newspaper The Guardian says Pope Benedict's abrupt resignation \"heralds the end of a sad and storm-tossed seven-year papacy.\"\n\n\"The former Joseph Ratzinger came to the highest office in the Roman Catholic church with a reputation as a challenging, conservative intellectual,\" writes the Guardian's Rome correspondent. \"But the messages that he sought to convey were all but drowned out, first by a string of controversies that were largely of his own making, and subsequently by the outcry — particularly in Europe — over sexual abuse of young people by Catholic clerics.\".\n\n\"On the one hand, he was intellectually remorseless. Not for nothing had he attracted the nickname of 'God's Rotweiler.' Yet, like many scholars, Benedict was personally timid — wholly lacking in that desk-thumping vigor needed to foist reforms on clerics whose resistance to change is the stuff of legend.\"\n\nIn a particularly sharp reaction, Terry Sanderson, longtime president of Britain's 147-year-old National Secular Society, said that Joseph Ratzinger, who became Pope Benedict XVI, \"played a major role in reducing the Catholic Church's popularity and its authority,\" and said that under his rule, \"the Vatican has become despised and resented throughout the world.\"\n\n\"Joseph Ratzinger will now disappear from the scene,\" Sanderson wrote in his blog on the society's website. \"Many will sigh with relief at his departure. But we shouldn't celebrate too soon. He has put in place a college of Cardinals that are as reactionary as he is – or even more so. Whoever they elect as the next Pope, there is unlikely to be much improvement.\"\n\nHans Kueng, a theologian who was an early colleague and friend of Ratzinger but later fell afoul of the Vatican for challenging church doctrine and became a vocal critic, told news agency DPA that he respected Benedict's decision — \"but it has to be hoped that Ratzinger will not exert influence on the election of his successor.\"\n\nHe asserted that, given that Benedict has named many conservative cardinals, it would be hard to find someone \"who could lead the church out of its many-layered crisis.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/06/26/british-politics-disarray-brexit-fallout-continues/86401974/", "title": "British politics in disarray as 'Brexit' fallout continues", "text": "Jane Onyanga-Omara, and Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLONDON — Parliament meets Monday for the first time since the United Kingdom's surprise vote to exit the European Union, as the shockwaves leave British politics in disarray.\n\nNo clear candidate has emerged to replace Prime Minister David Cameron, who announced he will resign by October, after the \"leave\" supporters of the controversial referendum won by a vote of 52% to 48%.\n\nScotland's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, indicated Sunday she may try to block the U.K's exit from the 28-nation EU or, failing that, hold a second Scottish independence referendum.

He faces a confidence vote amid party members who say he failed to adequately back the \"remain\" side.\n\nCorbyn said in a statement Sunday that he will not resign and will not \"betray the trust\" of those who elected him Labour leader.\n\nHe did fire his well-respected \"shadow\" foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, on Sunday after Benn said he did not think Corbyn was the right one to lead the party.

Here are some of the most bitter disputes over honours in recent UK political history:\n\nLloyd George’s ‘cash for patronage’ scandal\n\nDavid Lloyd George enjoyed an illustrious political career, including serving as prime minister from 1916 to 1922.\n\nBut the Liberal PM found himself embroiled in a major “cash for patronage” scandal over his resignation honours list in 1922. Although the purchase of peerages was not illegal, Lloyd George was accused of raising funds for his party through the sale of peerages, as well as using the honours system to (unsuccessfully) avoid criticism from newspapers.\n\nIt was the brazenness of Lloyd George’s “price list for peerages” that caused a scandal. They were arranged through political fixer Maundy Gregory, who sold peerages “ranging from £10,000 (more than £400,000 today) for a knighthood up to £40,000 for a baronetcy”, according to The Guardian.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFrom 1917 to 1922, more than “120 hereditary peers alone were created”, said The Spectator. So many knighthoods were given out in Cardiff – Lloyd George had grown up in Wales and spoke Welsh as his first language – that “it became known as the ‘city of dreadful knights’”, said the magazine.\n\nThe scandal led to the passing of the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act in 1925, and Gregory would eventually become the only person to be convicted under the act, continuing to falsely offer honours to the wealthy and connected into the 1930s.\n\nWilson’s Lavender List\n\nAllegedly handwritten on pastel-hued paper by Harold Wilson’s closest aide Marcia Williams, later Lady Falkender, the so-called “Lavender List” has become an infamous document in modern political history.\n\nThe list named businessmen Wilson had chosen to honour to mark his 1976 resignation, making way for James Callaghan as the next prime minister. The list was controversial as many felt it “sanctioned the ennobling and knighting of crooked and dubious businessmen”, according to The Times – many of whom held views antithetical to the values of the Labour Party.\n\nNames included a knighthood for Joseph Kagan, later convicted of false accounting, and businessman Eric Miller, who committed suicide while his firm was being investigated.\n\nBut further controversy was fuelled by the suggestion that Lady Falkender was either the principal author of the list or had sought to add to the list in order to reward her friends and financially benefit from the list herself. The list was seen as “an indication of the sway she held over Wilson, her alleged lover”, reported the paper.\n\nLady Falkender denied any involvement in compiling the list, maintaining she had “merely copied it from another list, on pink”, said the Financial Times in her 2019 obituary. And in 2007, the BBC was forced to pay her £75,000 in libel damages after a BBC Four docu-drama claimed she had conducted an affair with Wilson and had undue influence over the list.\n\nBlair’s ‘cash-for-honours’ scandal\n\nIn 2006, Tony Blair became the first prime minister to be questioned by police as part of a political corruption inquiry that would drag on for 16 months, and overshadow the last days of his premiership.\n\nAn investigation was launched after SNP MP Angus MacNeil complained that four wealthy businessmen were nominated by Tony Blair for peerages after lending the party a total of £5m.\n\nAll four of the peerages were blocked by the House of Lords appointments commission, and MacNeil’s complaint launched a police investigation into whether laws banning the sale of honours had been broken.\n\nThe police inquiries would lead to 136 people being interviewed, according to the BBC, and Blair himself would be questioned three times, although not under caution and “as a witness rather than a suspect”.\n\nLabour’s chief fundraiser Lord Levy – nicknamed “Lord Cashpoint” by the tabloid press – was arrested twice on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.\n\nIn 2007, the police would hand a 216-page report on the scandal to the Crown Prosecution Service – which later announced it had insufficient evidence to bring charges against anyone.\n\nCameron accused of cronyism\n\nDavid Cameron was accused of cronyism when he nominated almost 50 close aides, political allies and Conservative donors for honours as part of his resignation honours list.\n\nIn an unusual move, four serving cabinet members were honoured in Cameron’s list: Philip Hammond, who had recently taken on the role of chancellor; Michael Fallon, the defence secretary; David Lidington, the leader of the House of ­Commons; and Patrick McLoughlin, the Tory party chairman.\n\n“Normally politicians can expect to be honoured at the end of their time in office, not in mid-career or when they have just taken on a new cabinet job,” The Sunday Times noted in a critical leader.\n\nKnighthoods were also given to two Tory Party donors who gave significant contributions to the “Remain” campaign, and a CBE was awarded to Will Straw, the campaign’s director, leading the newspaper to accuse Cameron of handing out honours as “consolation prizes” and “rewards for failure”.\n\nNewspapers also balked at the award of an OBE to Samantha Cameron’s stylist, Isabel Spearman, as well as to other close aides and assistants who worked with cabinet members. One Whitehall source remarked to The Sunday Times: “They must have gone through the No. 10 staff list when they were compiling the nominations. I’m surprised Larry [the Downing Street cat] is not in there.”\n\nCBE fixed by Prince Charles' aides\n\nIn another scandal over honours, The Sunday Times said billionaire businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz was given a CBE by Prince Charles in a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace in 2016 after he paid “tens of thousands of pounds to fixers with links to the prince who had told him they could secure the honour.”\n\nMahfouz donated millions to restoration projects of interest to Charles, including Dumfries House and the Castle of Mey in Scotland. The Saudi national was keen to secure British citizenship or residency through a so-called “golden visa” for investment, and “had been advised that securing as many honorary roles and awards as possible would help his cause”, said the paper.\n\nIt is alleged that Michael Fawcett, a former valet to the prince and an indispensable aide, helped to co-ordinate Mahfouz’s application for British citizenship and even helped to “upgrade” the proposed honour from OBE to CBE.\n\nThe Sunday Times claimed that leaked correspondence shows that Mahfouz’s aides were “explicit about the transactional nature of the arrangement”, and that large sums of money were being given to Charles’s charities to secure the honour.\n\nAccording to leaked emails from William Bortrick, the owner of Burke’s Peerage and a paid adviser to Mahfouz, he told colleagues that once Mahfouz was honoured, “then more money will flow”.\n\nThe allegations pose “serious questions about the conduct of those close to the prince”, said the newspaper, and will also prompt a “renewed scrutiny of the honours system and whether it is open to monetary influence”.\n\nArise, Sir Gavin\n\nThe decision to honour Williamson, who was “responsible for the Covid exams fiasco” in 2020, has been described “as an insult to parents, teachers and children”, The Times said.\n\nThe former education secretary “played an integral role in [Boris] Johnson’s successful leadership campaign and was regarded by some as a potentially dangerous opponent on the Tory back benches”.\n\nBut the knighthood is also “controversial” as Williamson was sacked as defence secretary by Theresa May in 2019 after a Whitehall probe “concluded that he had leaked sensitive information from a meeting of the national security council”.\n\nSome Tory MPs were also “scathing about the knighthood”, the Daily Mail reported, “suggesting it was a reward for remaining loyal” to the prime minister. “It will do nothing to enhance the public’s view of our discredited honours system,” one MP said. “He knows where the bodies are buried, and Boris has locked his shovel away.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Harold Maass", "Peter Weber", "Justin Klawans", "Arion Mcnicoll"], "publish_date": "2021/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/02/03/taliban-peace-talks-flounder/1887579/", "title": "Taliban peace talks flounder", "text": "Kathy Gannon, Associated Press\n\nThe peace effort began nearly two years ago\n\nKabul and Washington frustrated that Pakistan isn%27t watching recently released prisoners\n\nU.S. and western allies working together to expedite peace process\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The Afghan peace effort is floundering, fraught with mistrust and confusion among key players even though the hard-line Taliban militants show signs of softening and their reclusive, one-eyed leader made a surprise offer to share power in a post-war Afghanistan.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies hope the peace process, which began nearly two years ago, will gain traction before most international forces withdraw from the country in fewer than 23 months. But although the Taliban appear more ready to talk than ever before, peace talks remain elusive because of infighting among a rising number of interlocutors — all trying to get some kind of negotiations started.\n\nMembers of the Taliban are in contact with representatives from 30 to 40 different countries, according to senior U.S., Afghan and other officials the Associated Press interviewed in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Moreover, the relationship among the key players — the U.S., Afghanistan and Pakistan — is marked by distrust that keeps tugging momentum away from the peace process.\n\nMany of the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the sensitive contacts with the Taliban.\n\nFinding a path to the negotiating table will be a topic when Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistan President Asif Zardari hold a series of meetings beginning Monday with British Prime Minister David Cameron. The meetings in London come amid fresh tensions between Kabul and its western allies.\n\nKarzai recently warned the West not to use peace talks as a lever against his government. As well, both Kabul and Washington are frustrated that Pakistan is not monitoring the whereabouts and activities of Taliban prisoners it released in recent months. Miffed by the criticism, Pakistan says it freed the prisoners at the request of the Afghan government and doesn't have the resources to keep tabs on them.\n\nNo one in either Pakistan or Afghanistan seems to know where the dozens of released prisoners have gone. Last week, the Taliban issued a statement by freed former Taliban Justice Minister Mullah Nooruddin Turabi on behalf of all the prisoners — an indication that at least some might have rejoined the ranks of the insurgency.\n\n\"There were no preconditions to their release and we are getting criticism from our own people inside Afghanistan about that and it is valid criticism,\" said Ismail Qasemyar, a senior member of the Afghan High Peace Council.\n\nThe peace council, which Karzai set up to carry out peace negotiations, handed Pakistan the list of prisoners, including Turabi, that it wanted freed. They have also asked for the release of the Taliban's former second in command, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, but Washington has urged Pakistan not to release him, U.S. and Afghan officials said.\n\nFor its part, the United States has tried to accelerate the peace process by working with Britain, Norway and Germany to reach out to the Taliban, said a senior Western diplomat familiar with the negotiations. Both France and Tokyo have hosted meetings that have been attended by Afghan officials, opposition leaders and the Taliban, although the Taliban insist their participation should not be misinterpreted as negotiations.\n\nOne senior U.S. official said the process is so nascent and egos so fragile that it's like negotiating a minefield. A European diplomat told the AP that there are so many backdoor talks going on that it's hard to keep track of who is talking to whom.\n\nThis week, Karzai said he wanted an end to all these talks. Speaking at a water management conference in the Afghan capital, Karzai expressed suspicion that the peace process was being hijacked by the West to strengthen his opponents and undermine his government.\n\nHis spokesman, Aimal Faizi, told the AP in an interview on the sprawling palace grounds in Kabul that the president was frustrated by what he perceives are attempts by his political opponents and the West, including the United States, to use the peace process to lay the groundwork for a post-2014 Afghanistan led by those hand-picked by them.\n\nThis latest flap between Karzai and the West could halt or at least delay the official opening of a Taliban office in the Middle Eastern state of Qatar. The office is intended to give the Taliban an address from which they can conduct peace talks. Faizi said Karzai supports the office \"in principle,\" with some conditions.\n\n\"This office should be used only as an address for talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban,\" Faizi said. \"This office should not be used for any other purpose.\"\n\nFaizi also said the president wants the Taliban to publicly announce that they will negotiate peace only with the Afghan High Peace Council. So far, the Taliban have resisted, although officials close to the president say privately that they appear to be softening their hard-line stance.\n\nTaliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, seemed uncompromising when he spoke to the AP.\n\n\"There is no change in the policy of the Islamic Emirate of not talking to the Karzai government,\" he said \"The Karzai regime is powerless and installed by others. Real parties to the conflict are those who have committed aggression.\"\n\nBut still the Taliban have shown signs of moderating their positions in recent months.\n\nAccording to several Western officials, who are involved or knowledgeable about the process, the most telling sign of flexibility came in a statement issued late last year by Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. In the statement marking the Islamic holy holiday of Eid al-Adha, Omar for the first time offered to share power. He also said he had no interest in starting a civil war.\n\n\"As to the future political destiny of the country, I would like to repeat that we are neither thinking of monopolizing power nor intend to spark off domestic war,\" he said.\n\nWhile still firm on his demand for Sharia or Islamic law, in Afghanistan, the Taliban leader, who rarely speaks and has a $10 million bounty on his head, did seem to take a few steps back from the harsh and regressive edicts and interpretations of Islamic law that characterized the Taliban's five-year rule. Many of those edicts were directed at women, denying them education and the right to work. He also seemed to extend an olive branch to Afghanistan's other ethnic groups.\n\n\"We will guarantee rights of both male and female of the country, build economic structures and strengthen social foundations and facilities of education for all people of the country,\" he said.\n\nBut Omar's flexibility only went so far. He still insisted on an Islamic education system. While the West has been pressing for secular education, many of Afghanistan's current leaders support a Quran-based education system.\n\nA senior member of the High Peace Council, who met with Taliban on the sidelines of the two conferences in France and Tokyo, said they also vowed to make child marriages illegal and outlaw a common practice among ethnic Pashtuns to use their daughters as barter to settle disputes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/football/2014/07/16/snapple-bowl-preview/12758987/", "title": "Middlesex and Union all-stars to battle in Snapple Bowl", "text": "Greg Tufaro\n\n@GregTufaro\n\nThe axiom suggesting individual talent does not always translate into team success is not exclusive to all-star games.\n\nLast year, for the first time since the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association football playoffs began in 1974, Middlesex County did not have a postseason representative in the sectional finals.\n\nConsidering the county's wealth of individual talent, the statistical anomaly came as a surprise to Marcus Borden, founder and director of the MyCentralJersey.com Snapple Bowl.\n\n\"That's stunning,\" Borden said. \"I think football in Middlesex County is very competitive, but football is cyclical and it's a team game. You can have a lot of great individual athletes, but it's how well a team performs.\"\n\nThe top recently graduated high school seniors from Middlesex County will get one final chance to prove their collective worth against a team of all-stars from Union County in MyCentralJersey.com Snapple Bowl XXI at Sayreville High School today at 7 p.m.\n\nUnlike Middlesex County, which was completely shut out of the sectional finals and did not crown a champion for only the fifth time in the NJSIAA's 40-year playoff history, two Union County representatives reached title games last year.\n\nWill Union County's 2013 championship experience give it a competitive edge tonight?\n\n\"When you look at them individually, they put up some good numbers, and there are teams that have had some success,\" Union County coach Scott Miller said of his players, who had just four practices and one walk through to prepare for the Snapple Bowl. \"We're hoping their natural ability can (generate) success.\"\n\nMiddlesex County, which held on for a thrilling 30-28 victory in last summer's meeting, leads the all-time series 12-8 and has won seven of the last eight bowls.\n\nPlayers and cheerleaders from both sides, who met for the first time during the May 19 Snapple Bowl press conference at North Brunswick High School, broke bread again on Wednesday night at the Pines Manor in Edison for the annual pre-game banquet.\n\nAll proceeds from the contest, which has raised more than $447,000 since its inception, benefit Children's Specialized Hospital and the Lakeview School, a program of the Edison-based New Jersey Institute for Disabilities.\n\nThe game culminates 11 days of practices and activities, the most important of which was the annual visit of players and cheerleaders to the charities.\n\n\"The visit is something that is good for the kids to be involved in,\" said Miller, whose charges visited Children's Specialized Hospital on Monday while the Middlesex County all-stars spent time at the Lakeview School.\n\n\"It gives them a real sense of what this game is about. It opens their eyes and lets them know how fortunate they are to be able to run around and play football and do some of the things that they do in their everyday lives. It gives them a sense of the big picture and what life is about, that you should be thankful every day that you are healthy.\"\n\nTwo players from Union County — defensive linemen Anthony Amatucci of Governor Livingston and Stephan Watkis-Davis of Rahway — are giving back to Children's Specialized Hospital through their participation in the game.\n\nWatkis-Davis underwent major corrective surgery on his fibula, causing him to miss an entire year of middle school and to spend more than three months at Children's Specialized Hospital. Amatucci was diagnosed with Auditory Processing Disorder and speech delay at Children's Specialized Hospital 13 years ago, at which time the hospital connected him with a speech therapist.\n\nThe hospital was integral in helping the linemen, both of who will play in college, enjoy successful scholastic careers in the classroom and on the field.\n\nThe Snapple Bowl, which is contested in four 15-minute quarters, making it 12 minutes or essentially one full quarter longer than a high school game, is unique from some other all-star events because it has no rules against blitzing or the use of specific offensive formations.\n\n\"When you get into this game, it becomes a little bit more of a coaching game, because you are not handcuffed by rules,\" Miller said of the chess match between the Middlesex and Union staffs. \"You are allowed to put kids in position, especially defensively, to make plays. Offensively, it allows you to kind of highlight some things, maybe spread it out and get kids the ball.\"\n\nAs has been the game's tradition, Union County will sport the silver and black of the Oakland Raiders, while Middlesex County will wear the blue and orange of the Miami Dolphins. The game jerseys are provided by Sports Paradise.\n\nCheerleaders from the two counties will dedicate their performance to the memory of Nicole Surace, a former Spotswood captain who cheered in the Snapple Bowl after graduating from high school last summer. Cheerleaders will wear hair ribbons and T-shirts bearing Surace's initials.\n\nSurace died along with sweetheart Jeff Szatkowski, who had just completed his senior season as a football star at Spotswood, in a car accident seven months ago.\n\nFormer Spotswood teammates Jack Dalrymple and Gerard Reichardt will honor Szatkowski with their play and by wearing lime green helmet stickers with a black No. 7, emblematic of Szatkowski's favorite color and jersey number.\n\nUnion County players will take the field inspired following a surprise meeting they had on Monday with former New York Giants offensive guard Bill Ard, a Watchung Hills graduate who won a Super Bowl in 1987.\n\nCapturing the Snapple Bowl's spirit, Ard encouraged the players to seize the moment and live life to the fullest.\n\n\n\nStaff Writer Greg Tufaro: gtufaro@mycentraljersey.com\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat:MyCentralJersey.com Snapple Bowl XXI, New Jersey's most successful charity all-star football game.\n\nWhere: Sayreville High School, 820 Washington Road, Parlin.\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Thursday, July 17\n\nParticipants: Recently graduated high school senior players and cheerleaders from Middlesex and Union counties.\n\nBeneficiaries: All proceeds from the game, which has raised more than $447,000 since its inception, benefit Children's Specialized Hospital and the Lakeview School, a program of the New Jersey Institute for Disabilities.\n\nTickets: Can be purchased at the gate for $10.\n\nTraffic advisory: Avoid Main Street in South River, which will be closed from 5 p.m. through 9 p.m. on Thursday night to accommodate the borough's \"Cruise Night\" classic car show.\n\nSocial media: Follow us via Twitter @MyCJ_Sports and @SnappleBowl for updates and to interact with reporters and Snapple Bowl XXI game director Marcus Borden.\n\nMyCentralJersey.com\n\nSnapple Bowl XXI official web site:\n\nCan be found at\n\nhttps://worknotes.com/NJ/SouthRiver/SnappleBowl/\n\n2014 Middlesex County All-Stars\n\nPLAYERS: Rafieu Alharazim (CB, North Brunswick); Rui Almeida (DT, South River); Christian Appia (LB, Edison); Rashaan Baker (NG, South Brunswick); Tyrell Best (CB, Edison); David Betancur (WR, Monroe); Kyle Boyer-Tucker (RB, 170); Cameron Capers (G, Woodbridge); Russell Clayton (T, Monroe); Andrew Cunningham (LB, St. Joseph); Jack Dalrymple (FB, Spotswood); Elijah Davis (LB, Monroe); Peter Domenick (TE, Middlesex); Charles Faulkner (LB, Carteret); Raekwon Fletcher (G, Dunellen); Dahrae Ford (FB, South Brunswick); Tim Francisco (LB, Dunellen); Jon Gerhartz (FS, East Brunswick); Dan Grecco (G, Sayreville); Justin Greene (DB, Bishop Ahr); Dan Grillo (WR, Old Bridge) Cory Guzman (DE, Carteret); Juwan Haney (SS, New Brunswick); Tyler Hill (DE, South River); Mike Hunt (DE, Old Bridge); Nick LaVecchia (QB, Old Bridge); Nick Marinelli (DE, Monroe); Brian McDonaugh (C, Sayreville); Roemello Monroe (TB, South Plainfield); Kyle Moroney (QB, South Plainfield); Matt Olivo (RB, St. Joseph); Malik Pressley (SS, Sayreville); Michael Quintin (DT, East Brunswick); Gerard Reichardt (T, Spotswood); Justin Rodriguez (T, Carteret); Jake Stolzenberg (G, St. Joseph); Dennis Sutton (WR, Perth Amboy); Ryan Verlaque (LB, Metuchen); Michael Viggiano (WR, Bishop Ahr); Elijah Williams (CB, Colonia); Matt Williams (WR, J.F.

While European markets were stable Monday after last week's brutal sell-off, oil continued to fall as Iran prepares to dump 500,000, sanction-free barrels a day on world markets.\n\nExpectations are low for Tuesday on Wall Street. Perhaps even lower than in 2008, when Davos week started with a surprise 0.75% rate cut by the Federal Reserve, to stem the subprime loan markets crisis developing at the time. It failed to work. Two months later, Bear Stearns would collapse, a scenario few in Davos were prepared for. Six months after that, Lehman Brothers would collapse, which nobody predicted.\n\nInvestors wonder: When will the pain end?\n\nAsian markets fall again over oil price concerns\n\nNow, as in January 2008, few are willing to forecast anything beyond a market correction. Yet there is little sign of positive evidence for a rebound. China's GDP numbers Tuesday are expected to be the worst in a quarter-century. U.S. earnings season is off to a bad start. And oil's free fall has kickstarted a selling spree by Middle Eastern sovereign funds, which hold more than $2 trillion in Western securities that could be redeemed to prop up ailing oil economies.\n\nIf all of this gloom seems like a screaming buying opportunity to you, then you're thinking what I'm thinking. But for the moment, the money worries of the 1% will only distract this year's attendees from the world's more serious migrants crisis and battle against Islamist terrorism.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel wisely bowed out of the mountain panel and party circuit this year to deal with the mounting turmoil in her country, but almost everyone else will be here. British Prime Minister David Cameron, facing an historic referendum on Britain's membership in the European Union this summer, will make the rounds.\n\nSo will Alexis Tsipras, prime minister of Greece. And Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu is always a threat to show up. Davos regulars Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Europe Central Bank President Mario Draghi will lead a beleaguered and bedraggled corps of central bankers.\n\nVice President Biden will make an appearance, as will Secretary of State John Kerry, another regular. Even Leonardo DiCaprio is supposed to show, though he might be upstaged by the arrival of this year's new superstar on the world stage, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nA shimmering cast of thousands, to be sure. No doubt the champagne will flow and the fiddlers fiddle as deals are dashed off amid the snowy chaos. Each year there is usually a surprise news event that hijacks the proceedings — something nobody expected when they boarded the plane.\n\nThis week: Housing recovery could calm nerves\n\nIn 2008, it was the steep rate cut. Last year, it was the sudden decision by the Swiss National Bank to let the Swiss franc rise, resulting in an immediate 20% increase in the cost of everything in the country. Not that anybody in Davos noticed.\n\nOne could argue the Iranian hostage deal qualifies, but the world was expecting the lifting of sanctions, so I'm holding out for something else. Maybe it will be good news. General Motors CEO Mary Barra, perhaps, could announce a flying driverless car. Or, in keeping with this year's theme of the fourth industrial revolution, maybe one of the tech companies will announce a breakthrough in virtual reality.\n\nBecause in actual reality, it's looking to be a pretty rough start to the year.\n\nCallaway is USA TODAY's editor in chief.\n\nDavid Callaway on Twitter: @dcallaway.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/technology/960516/pros-and-cons-of-the-emergency-alert", "title": "Pros and cons of the emergency alert | The Week", "text": "Tens of millions of mobile phones are set to go off simultaneously at 3pm on Sunday, as the UK prepares to test its first nationwide emergency alert system.\n\nMessages will be accompanied by a siren sound and vibration that will stop automatically after ten seconds. The alert will make a sound even if a phone is on silent and people will need to tap “OK” or swipe away the notification.\n\nAlready operational in countries around the world such as the US, Greece and Japan, alerts are expected to be sent “very rarely, only when there is an immediate threat to life, so it may be months or years before anybody receives one”, reported Sky News.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Pro: helps save lives\n\nCabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden stated the most obvious benefit when he suggested the alert could one day “be the sound that saves your life”. The government has said it would be used in “life-threatening emergencies” to broadcast urgent messages in the event of a disaster such as severe flooding, fires or extreme weather. However, the use of targeted alerts in countries such as the Netherlands and South Korea to control the spread of Covid point to other life-saving applications, especially after the UK government “was criticised during the pandemic for lagging behind other countries on the technology and repeatedly ignoring its own findings that an emergency messaging system could help Britain at a time of crisis”, The Guardian reported.\n\n2. Con: risk for abuse victims\n\nThe government has admitted the emergency test on Sunday could put those in abusive relationships at risk by exposing concealed phones. “Monitoring a partner’s phone or depriving them of it is a common factor in many abusive relationships”, said the i news site, while those in abusive relationships “can often rely on concealed phones to communicate with their loved ones or support services”. Acknowledging the threat posed by the alert to people subject to domestic abuse, the government has issued new advice for people with concealed phones to “opt out of the national test either by turning off Emergency Alerts in their phone settings or by switching their phone off”.\n\n3. Pro: free and easy to receive\n\nCrucial to the success of any alert system is that is free of charge to everyone. The government’s official website stresses that every compatible mobile phone or tablet in range of a mast will receive the alert. “Your mobile phone or tablet does not have to be connected to mobile data or Wi-Fi to get alerts. Emergency alerts are free. You do not need to sign up for them or download an app”. The only reasons you will not receive an alert is if a device is turned off or in airplane mode, connected to a 2G or 3G network, Wi-Fi only or not compatible.\n\n4. Con: distraction for drivers\n\nA major concern is that a sudden unexpected siren sound could distract drivers caught unawares, increasing the chance of crashing. The Telegraph reported that “officials are concerned that the potential consequences have not been fully thought through”, with officials meeting the RAC to discuss how any risk to drivers can be reduced. As well as “some form of panic”, president of the AA, Edmund King, also warned “the odd sound could mean they reach for the phone”, increasing the risk of drivers receiving a fine for checking their phone while driving.\n\n5. Pro: can be used at a local level\n\nWhile the test on Sunday will target every phone in the country, more often than not alerts will be localised. With notifications having already been successfully tested in East Suffolk and Reading, Sky News said they “could be sent to specific areas, however big or small”. For example, everybody in a village where a river was about to burst its banks could be sent a warning alert. The broadcaster said it is unlikely to be used during an active terror attack, however, “as the attackers would then receive a notification as well, but decisions would be taken when and as needed”.\n\n6. Con: danger of going wrong\n\nWhile similar systems have been credited with saving lives in other countries “botched tests have also been the source of mass panic”, said the i news site. In 2018, a message was mistakenly sent across Hawaii, warning of an incoming ballistic missile attack, and a second message explaining the error not sent for another 38 minutes. Something similar happened in Canada in 2020, when an emergency alert warning millions of people of an “incident” at a nuclear power plant near Toronto was sent in error.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Uk", "Catherine Garcia", "The Week Us", "Becca Stanek", "Justin Klawans", "Theara Coleman", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/04/19"}]}

Fears as food bank demand soars\n\nFood banks fear they may have to turn people away as more people are depending on them than ever before in Britain. NHS staff and teachers are among those seeking the help of food banks, as new research by the Independent Food Aid Network found that almost 90% reported increased demand in December 2022 and January 2023 compared with a year earlier. The Trussell Trust, which operates more than 1,300 food banks, warned last year that food banks were at “breaking point”.\n\n2. Johnson ‘a nuisance’ to Sunak\n\nBoris Johnson has told Rishi Sunak not to abandon legislation he introduced on how Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trade will work in the long-term. As Sunak meets EU leaders to agree a new deal, a source close to Johnson said the former PM thought it would be a “great mistake” to change his plan. Senior Tories have accused Johnson of being a “nuisance” and “mischievous” by encouraging the Democratic Unionist Party to resist a compromise. Since 2021, certain trade checks cover some goods crossing the Irish Sea.\n\n3. Two declare on Sturgeon succession\n\nScottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf and former minister Ash Regan have become the first two politicians to declare that they will stand to succeed Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader and Scotland’s first minister. Regan told the Sunday Mail the SNP “need to bring back unity, draw a line under certain things and move past them”. Announcing his leadership bid in the Daily Record, Yousaf said: “This is the top job in the country, and it needs somebody who has experience.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Syria blames Israel for missile strike\n\nSyria said five people died after Israeli missiles hit the capital Damascus and surrounding areas on Sunday. Military officials said a building was hit in the densely populated Kafr Sousa neighbourhood, killing four civilians and one soldier as the nation is reeling from two earthquakes. Israel has conducted raids against military targets in Syria in the past, said the Jerusalem Post, but Israel’s military declined to comment on the latest strike when approached by Reuters.\n\n5. NHS ‘prioritises adults over children’\n\nHundreds of thousands of children are waiting for surgery as NHS leaders and doctors warned that adult care is being prioritised over children’s. Data which “lays bare the parlous state of paediatric medicine”, showed the backlog has “spiralled” by almost 50% in two years, said The Independent. In December 2022, 364,000 children were waiting for treatment, from neurosurgery to ear, nose and throat operations, and 200,000 more needed services such as speech and language therapy.\n\n6. Macron doesn’t want to ‘crush’ Putin\n\nThe French president said he does not want to see Russia crushed by a defeat in Ukraine. “I want Russia to be defeated in Ukraine, and I want Ukraine to be able to defend its position,” said Emmanuel Macron, but the West should not “aim for total defeat of Russia, attacking Russia on its own soil”. Speaking to Le Journal du Dimanche, he said the desire of some to “crush” Russia “will never be our position”.\n\n7. ‘Vigilante’ cyclists target cabbies\n\nCab drivers have been warned to beware of cyclists with helmet cameras after several motorists were caught using mobile phones at the wheel. The general secretary of Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, Steve McNamara, said there have been a series of cases where “vigilante cyclists” filmed cab drivers looking at their phones while in traffic. Any drivers caught this way could face losing their licences. “Vigilante cyclists” are increasingly patrolling the streets with mounted helmet cameras looking into cars to catch out law breakers, said the Sunday Telegraph.\n\n8. Carter set for home care\n\nThe former US president Jimmy Carter is set to receive home hospice care after a series of hospital stays. The Carter Centre charity said the 98-year-old “decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention”. Carter has suffered from several “health woes”, said CNN, including a melanoma that spread to his liver and brain.\n\n9. Andrew fears King plot\n\nPrince Andrew believes the King is trying to force him out of his £30m Windsor home, reported the Mail on Sunday. The paper said the “furious” prince is telling friends that his older brother wants to slash his annual grant, which is worth hundreds of thousands of pounds a year. Without it, he would be unable to maintain Royal Lodge and would have to move out by September. The Duke of York stopped receiving public money when he stepped down from Royal duties following accusations of sexual assault, which he denies.\n\n10. Telescopes could view Big Bang\n\nAstronomers believe that telescopes placed on the dark side of the Moon could pick up the first signs of intelligent alien life. The scientists consider the Moon a perfect spot to search for faint techno-signatures from advanced civilisations.

Francis recently quipped that a wheelchair was not an issue for a pope – “one governs with the head, not the knee” – but “also revealed that he had a signed resignation letter, deposited with the Vatican’s secretary of state, that could be accepted if he became incapacitated”, said the newspaper.\n\nWhile some, such as Robert Mickens, editor-in-chief of Catholic newspaper La Croix International, said he expected Francis to resign as early as this year, most Vatican watchers do not believe his retirement is imminent, even if “there are some in the Roman Catholic church who would dearly love another pope to be elected very soon,” said The Guardian.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWho is in the running?\n\n“Whoever the next Pope is will say a great deal about the direction of a Church being pulled in different directions and threatened by schism”, said the Catholic Herald.\n\nThe paper suggested it could come down to a straight fight between Hungary’s Cardinal Peter Erdő, “a conservative canon law expert coming from a country on the frontline of the European culture war” whose “appointment would send a powerful message about the direction the Church would be taking” and “a Pope from the developing world – such as the Philippines’ Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle – who would be hailed by liberals, given the changing demographic of the Church”.\n\nThe latest odds from bookmakers OLBG have Cardinal Tagle as favourite to succeed Francis on 7/1, along with Canada’s Cardinal Marc Ouellet, with Cardinal Erdő just behind on 8/1.\n\nSuch a contest “would show a Church at a crossroads”, said the Catholic Herald, between “the forces of traditionalism in Europe – the original heart of Catholicism – and the changing face of the faith, focused more in the developing world, yet still largely conservative in outlook, not least on LGBT issues”. If symbolism matters, then Erdő vs. Tagle would be a contest “not just of ideas but of perception and identity”, added the paper.\n\n“As the conversation stands today, perhaps the hardest question to answer is who the ‘opposition’ candidates are,” said Crux Now, an off-shoot of The Boston Globe focusing on the Vatican and Catholic Church.\n\n“We know there’s a conservative wing of the Catholic Church disenchanted with some aspects of the Pope Francis agenda,” it added. More up in the air is who the “discontinuity voters might rally around, since most of the identifiable conservatives among the current crop of cardinals are either considered too extreme, or simply lacking the proper gravitas, to be pope”, said the paper.\n\nHow does the process work?\n\n“While the conservatives look for a new standard-bearer to form a consensus ahead of the election of the next pope, Francis is forging ahead with his vision of a more inclusive and forward-looking Church,” said Reuters.\n\nCrucially, of the 132 cardinals aged under 80 who would be eligible to vote in a conclave to elect a new pope, 83 were appointed by Francis. Furthermore, about a dozen, mainly senior conservative cardinals, will also lose the right to vote this year.\n\nIn a sign of the growing influence Francis has on the make-up of the body who chooses his successor, bookmakers forecast a high probability the next pope will assume his papal name, as Francis II.\n\n“If Francis’s health holds out, even for a few more years, he can appoint more electors, increasing the chances his successor will be someone who agrees with his vision,” said Reuters.\n\nTraditionalists may worry about “whether Pope Francis has changed the complexion of the College of Cardinals sufficiently to elect a clone”, said Dr Jeff Mirus on the conservative Catholic Culture website. “But on that score, at least, you needn’t worry. Papal elections have never been predictable in the same way that political elections are.”", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Harold Maass", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Justin Klawans", "Rebekah Evans", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/04/midterm-elections-disinformation-voters-guide/9652014002/", "title": "Disinformation could keep millions of midterm election voters at home", "text": "Disinformation could keep millions of voters of color out of the midterms.\n\nDisinformation is \"becoming endemic.

Our democracy is so fragile we can’t afford to have anyone stay home.”\n\nMcKinley isn’t just another Black pastor trying to turn out the Black vote. He is on the front lines of a bigger fight to save democracy – and one of the only defenses the country has – against disinformation, which is hard to trace yet powerful enough to swing U.S. elections.\n\nDisinformation is spreading rapidly through America, disseminating intentional lies disguised as truth. Sometimes the lies are designed to prevent people from voting by confusing them on how, when and where to vote. Sometimes the lies play on fears to try to make them vote a certain way.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"It’s becoming endemic,\" said Sam Woolley, program director of the Propaganda Research Team at the University of Texas. \"It’s becoming something that we’re just accepting in our society. It’s becoming part of day-to-day life. That we’re inured to it almost.\"\n\nWho is spreading disinformation?\n\nMcKinley doesn’t know who is behind the efforts to spread false information about poll closings or changed locations and hours in Anacostia and other areas around the country. Community members there have received fliers through the years containing lies about how, when and where to vote.\n\nSeveral researchers across the country studying the issue say it’s hard to trace.\n\nMidterms:China targeting US voters with anti-democracy narratives in election, analysts warn\n\nInga Trauthig, a research manager at the University of Texas who studies disinformation, has tried to trace disinformation throughout various communities, including communities of color that use WhatsApp.\n\n“The disinfo spreads via their small family and community groups, and I cannot tell you with certainty where it is coming from,” she said.\n\nSome disinformation has been linked to Russian operatives and other foreign enemies.\n\nSome has been linked to groups in the U.S. who undermine elections, using various online accounts.\n\n\"The ability to propagandize has kind of been democratized because of social media,\" Woolley said. \"If you know a little bit about how to build fake accounts online and pull the right levers,\" creating and spreading disinformation is no problem, he said.\n\nAnd sometimes it’s spread by politicians like Laura Loomer, who repeatedly claims her failure to win a GOP House primary this year in Florida was because her election was stolen, Trauthig said. “She keeps calling for people to contest the legitimacy of current candidates and the midterms overall – and is partially successful.”\n\nHer campaign did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement issued Aug. 24, Loomer said she would not concede because there was \"theft involved.\" She accused the Republican Party of being \"an active participant in the voter fraud machine here in American.\"\n\nDisinformation received this year on WhatsApp involved an Indian American community receiving messages that said the midterms are unconstitutional due to an unsettled dispute over the previous presidential election.\n\nMexican Americans in San Antonio received WhatsApp messages ahead of the primary saying they should not vote because it would mean supporting a corrupt U.S. election system where elections are rigged.\n\nDisinformation turns into misinformation\n\nDisinformation – lies told intentionally to deceive – often turns into misinformation, which are lies people believe to be true and spread to others. That's when it becomes most dangerous.\n\nOn elections, that disinformation ranges from telling voters they can cast ballots on their phones to \"skip the lines at the polls\" to sending lies that their polling place has closed. Some messages have told voters the election would be held on Wednesday instead of Tuesday, according to researchers.\n\nFor example, a polling place hoax in 2016 used edited photos across social media platforms that claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were arresting voters at the polls. The same false information resurfaced in 2018 and 2020. Researchers believe the effort was designed to intimidate Latino voters.\n\nICE does not patrol or conduct enforcement operations at polling locations, the agency said.\n\nWhile voters can cast ballots by mail in many states, they cannot vote on their phones. Federal law ensures the general election is always held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. And though polling places can change or move, it's best to find that information through a county or state website rather than through a text or social media post, according to experts who study disinformation.\n\nThese kinds of lies show up on social media, in text messages, encrypted chat rooms, on billboards and telephone polls, and in the mail. They are often targeted at people of color.\n\n\"The research shows that, psychologically, lies that come from people they care about are much more potent than lies that come from random politicians or news outlets or whatever,\" Woolley said.\n\nDisinformation campaign:China targeting US voters with anti-democracy narratives in election, analysts warn\n\nPartisanship rising:Political tensions are growing. What is the state of American democracy?\n\nVoices muted by disinformation\n\nThe tweet sent on Nov. 1, 2016, a week before Election Day, looked official.\n\n“African Americans for Hillary” read a sign held by a Black woman. The message said to “Avoid the Line. Vote from Home. Text ‘Hillary’ to 59925. Vote for Hillary and be part of history.” The tweeted image, which said in the fine print that it was paid for by Hillary for President 2016, included the hashtags #GoHillary and #ImWithHer.\n\nVoters cannot cast ballots by phone, but at least 4,900 phone numbers texted “Hillary” to the 59925 tweet sent by a pro-Trump activist named Douglass Mackey, who used the social media name Ricky Vaughn. He was arrested and charged in late January 2021 with election interference stemming from a voter disinformation campaign, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nOn Nov. 2, 2016, Mackey tweeted, “Obviously, we (Republicans) can win Pennsylvania,” according to federal prosecutors. “The key is to drive up turnout with non-college whites, and limit black turnout.”\n\nLast week, Mackey asked a federal judge to toss his charges and consider the texts to be an exercise in free speech.\n\nWhat Mackey did was “nothing short of vote theft,” said William F. Sweeney Jr., assistant director in charge of the FBI’s New York Field Office.\n\nAt the time of the 2016 election, Mackey had 58,000 followers on Twitter and was listed by the MIT Media Lab as the 107th most important influencer, ranking higher at the time than the Democratic Party, CNN, NBC News, NYT Politics, Stephen Colbert, CBS News and others, because his posts generated high levels of engagement such as likes and retweets.\n\nPropaganda of the digital age:How memes are weaponized to spread disinformation\n\nHe wasn’t alone. Dozens of other pieces of disinformation like the one Mackey sent circulated on social media leading up to the 2016 election.\n\n\"It's so much easier to lie to someone than to convince someone they've been lied to,\" said Al Schmidt, a former Republican Philadelphia commissioner who is now president and CEO of the Committee of Seventy, a nonprofit that fights political corruption.\n\nThe same social media tools and chat apps used to organize the violent attack on Jan. 6 are being used to target communities of color with disinformation, according to university researchers studying the impact of propaganda on democracy.\n\nNon-English speaking and immigrant communities are perfect targets because they have a tendency to mainly seek information from close friends and family, he said.\n\nThe goal isn’t necessarily to make communities of color vote one way or another. It’s to keep them from voting at all.\n\n\"Because elections seem to turn on a dime now, the margins are so so slim and it matters so much who turns up and obviously who they vote for,\" Woolley said.\n\nTo put numbers in greater context, the 2016 presidential election in Pennsylvania was decided by about 40,000 votes. The U.S. Senate race there that year was decided by less than 87,000 votes.\n\nThe 2020 presidential election was decided by about 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania, which clinched the election for Joe Biden. If even 4 or 8 percent of the 1 million targeted voters of color in Pennsylvania were swayed by disinformation, it could have impacted the outcome of those elections.\n\nOne of the reasons communities of color are more susceptible to disinformation is because \"it's always playing towards people's fears\" and through repetition, said Trauthig, one of the disinformation researchers at the University of Texas. In immigrant communities, people who receive disinformation are more likely to believe a lie when it's in their native language, she said.\n\n\"The most interesting thing for me was actually that they would often say that they don’t think it’s entirely true, but also they wouldn’t dismiss it completely,\" she said. \"So the danger in that is just by repetition, they came to believe stuff more and more that’s definitely not true.\"\n\nBy stoking fears and creating confusion, disinformation keeps voters at home.\n\n“If you’re just not used to living in American democracy, you’re more vulnerable and more easily deterred to just not go vote,\" Trauthig said. \"I’ve heard a lot from the older interviewees that they said, ‘Well I didn’t want do it wrong.’”\n\nThere are no clear stats, however, that show how many votes have been impacted by disinformation, partially because most victims of disinformation don't realize they have been swayed by lies, researchers said.\n\nConservative movement:Republicans made inroads with South Texas Latinos last election. Now, they’re hoping for a red wave\n\nA problem in search of a solution\n\nNew disinformation campaigns target voters of color in four main ways: create confusion, tell lies to stoke ideological divisions, use religion to sow doubt about candidates’ views; and oversimplify complex policies to alter voting decisions.\n\nWhen effective, these disinformation campaigns can change the outcome of U.S. elections.\n\nThat is what Russian operatives tried to do in 2016. A Senate Intelligence Committee report shows Russian operatives working for the troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency focused on communities of color. \"No single group of Americans was targeted by IRA information operatives more than African Americans,\" the report said.\n\nCongress could pass new laws to change this – to make it illegal to lie on any platform about the verifiable truths of how, where and when to vote – but lawmakers are split along party lines.\n\nThat’s confounding to Jenny Liu, disinformation policy analyst at Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a Washington-based nonprofit that fights for civil rights. She thinks it should be a no-brainer for everyone to agree it should be illegal to confuse voters on how, when and where to vote.\n\n\"It’s almost as if we live in a reality where there is no longer an objective truth,\" she said.\n\nVoters are less likely to take steps to verify information when it comes from someone they know or trust, she said.\n\nDemocrats say there are laws and regulations to prevent campaigns from pushing the type of disinformation that keeps people from voting, but no laws apply to memes or bad actors who use online platforms.\n\nPresident Joe Biden in the spring launched the Disinformation Governance Board within the Department of Homeland Security, but it dissolved in three weeks. Republicans called it an attack on free speech and threatened to defund it.\n\nAlso, while disinformation can be flagged online, researchers say only about half of what gets flagged is actually taken down by YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Discord. It's even less likely that disinformation in Spanish and other languages will be taken down, according to researchers.\n\nFacebook, Twitter and TikTok have all shared plans to combat election disinformation this year that are similar to 2020.\n\nTruth or fiction? 5 steps to avoid getting duped by election season misinformation\n\nFor example, Facebook’s approach will be “largely consistent with the policies and safeguards” from the last presidential election year, according to Nick Clegg, Meta president of global affairs. Posts that get flagged as false or partly false will get a warning label and the company will moderate content that could lead to violence like the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack.\n\nUSA TODAY is a partner in Facebook's global fact-checking program whose work is supported in part by a grant from Facebook.\n\nTikTok will also offer fact-checking and block paid political posts and political advertising. Twitter, before Elon Musk purchased it, said it would use warning labels and mark false or misleading tweets.\n\nIt’s even harder, if not impossible, to flag disinformation in a text.\n\nSome Republicans also oppose things being removed as censorship and an attack on free speech.\n\n“That’s the issue,\" said Ellen Goodman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers University law school who specializes in information policy law. \"The First Amendment protects most of this speech.”\n\nThe only two GOP members of Congress who attended an April 28 House hearing on the issue argued that even the hearing on disinformation violated free speech.\n\nRep. Rodney Davis, R-Illinois, said the government does not have the power to decide what is truth.\n\n“Personally, I don’t think anyone is qualified to be the ultimate authority on truth except for God himself,\" he said during the hearing.\n\nDavis did not respond to a request for an interview.\n\nUCLA law professor Rick Hasen said there are empirical, verifiable truths that should require no debate. There are steps that could be taken to protect democracy and the right to vote without infringing on free speech.\n\nHe's the author of \"Cheap Speech: How Disinformation Poisons Our Politics―and How to Cure It.\"\n\n“I do think we could pass laws and make it a crime to lie about when, where or how people vote,\" he said. \"There is a truth right? Election day is Tuesday. It’s not Wednesday.”\n\nElection deniers:Hundreds of elections deniers running for office nationwide in 2022 pose 'major threat' to U.S. democracy\n\nHow a thousand pastors are fighting disinformation\n\nOn Tuesday, a week before the midterms, McKinley and numerous other pastors were in a virtual Faiths United to Save Democracy training, learning how to be poll chaplains – faith leaders who serve as a calming presence at the polls and ensure voters are able to exercise their constitutional right.\n\nHe is one of four coordinators working with Faiths United and will be stationed at a Washington, D.C. command center while more than a thousand pastors work at polls in battleground states.\n\nIn the absence of congressional action, they are among thousands of individuals who are fighting disinformation one sermon at a time.\n\n\"Lots of folks, they may not trust what they see on social media, or they may not trust what they see on a news outlet, but who they trust is a pastor who was preaching to them every Sunday morning,\" McKinley said.\n\nMore:'LET'S CHAT,' State Department tells foreign election hackers, offering $10M bounty\n\nAs of Tuesday, he was still asking through prayer for the right words to say this Sunday, hoping to communicate to millennials, Gen Z and other young voters that they’re not next. They’re now.\n\n“I have not done a whole sermon to discuss the election, but in every sermon I’ve been talking about the importance of the vote, how it’s under threat and that it’s a blood-bought right,” McKinley said.\n\nDespite headwinds, McKinley said he remains a \"prisoner of hope,\" referencing the words of the late Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"If people rise to the occasion and make certain their voice is heard through their vote, I think that we have a chance at preserving the principles of our democracy,\" he said.\n\nGuide to midterms:What are the midterm elections?

Households on the pay-as-you-go meters, are typically low income, but they currently pay more on average than direct debit customers because firms managing the meters pass on costs to users. A recent investigation by The Times found that vulnerable customers were being forced by British Gas on to the pay-as-you-go meters.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

It was the latest demonstration against government plans for a radical overhaul of the judicial system, which opponents say will undermine democracy. Around 200,000 are believed to have taken to the streets in Tel Aviv, with protests in other cities, such as Haifa, too. Organisers believe half a million protested in total against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “constitutional coup”, said Haaretz.\n\n5. Pence turns fire on Trump\n\nMike Pence said that history will hold Donald Trump accountable for his role in the January 6 2021 attack on the US Capitol, adding that his former boss was mistaken to criticise him for certifying the 2020 election result. “President Trump was wrong,” Pence told the Gridiron dinner, an annual white-tie event in Washington DC. “I had no right to overturn the election, and his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know that history will hold Donald Trump accountable.” These were his “most blistering comments yet”, said CNN.\n\n6. Labour would give Wales more power\n\nSir Keir Starmer said that Wales would “take back control” of its economy under a Labour government. The opposition leader told the Welsh Labour conference he wanted to use the “spirit of devolution” to “transform Britain” and “give the communities and great nations of this country the powers they need to control their destiny”. He pledged that he would give power over funds that replaced EU aid to the Welsh government. However, noted Wales Online, he refused to commit to Wales getting a share of HS2 funding.\n\n7. Sunak to finalise Aukus details\n\nThe prime minister will fly to California later to finalise the new defence agreement with his Australian and US counterparts. The 2021 Aukus pact aims to counter what the three nations see as China’s threat in the Indo-Pacific region. Top of the agenda will be the next phase of the AUKUS nuclear submarine programme. Speaking ahead of the talks in San Diego, Rishi Sunak said the UK’s global alliances were “our greatest source of strength and security”. Aukus is “looking like a Nato for the Pacific”, said The Spectator.\n\n8. Has Hunt undermined Brexit?\n\nThe chancellor has been accused of undermining Brexit by agreeing to international corporation tax rules, reported The Telegraph. Leading Conservative MPs, including former prime minister Liz Truss and ex-home secretary Priti Patel, have urged Jeremy Hunt not to “rush ahead and surrender sovereign tax rights”. They added that “as a party elected to ensure Britain ‘Takes Back Control’ from the EU”, it is “remarkable” the Tories are considering the move. However, Hunt has “brushed aside” the criticism, said the paper.\n\n9. Black solicitor quizzed by police\n\nA black trainee solicitor said he was stopped by five police officers for “looking suspicious” on his way to visit a client in prison. Eldred Taylor-Camara, 26, of MTC Solicitors, was travelling to HMP Lewes, East Sussex, when he was questioned by British Transport Police officers at Lewes railway station. He said he was questioned closely, leaving him “stressed and physically shaken”. The police said they had received “intelligence” about an “extremely violent” drug dealer in the area and he matched the description.\n\n10. Chinese city mulls flu lockdown\n\nA city in China has caused uproar after saying it would consider the use of lockdowns in the event of a flu outbreak. The city of Xi’an has announced an emergency response plan that would allow it to close schools, businesses and “other crowded places” in a severe flu epidemic. This “prompted a mixture of anxiety and anger” on social media in China, said CNN. “Vaccinate the public rather than using such time to create a sense of panic,” one user wrote on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Harold Maass", "Justin Klawans", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/958707/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-2-december-2022", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 2 December 2022 | The Week", "text": "1.

The ruling “removes a major obstacle” to the Justice Department’s investigation into the mishandling of government records from Trump’s time in the White House, said CNN, and represents a “major defeat” for the former president. The justice department is now set to regain access to the entirety of the materials for use in the criminal investigation surrounding the former president.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Kanye West praises Hitler\n\nKanye West has praised Adolf Hitler and questioned the Holocaust during an appearance on a conspiracy theory TV show. “Well, I see good things about Hitler also,” he said on InfoWars, a programme hosted by the far-right broadcaster Alex Jones. The rapper - who has courted considerable controversy in recent months - said that Hitler “invented highways, invented the very microphone that I use as a musician”, adding that “you can’t say out loud that this person ever did anything good and I am done with that”. West also said of Hitler that “he didn’t kill six million Jews”.\n\nKanye West’s White Lives Matter controversy\n\n4. Sunak pressed over Mone whip\n\nThe prime minister is under pressure from main opposition parties to withdraw the Tory whip from Michelle Mone in the House of Lords after she was accused of gaining millions from the profits of a PPE company. Labour and the Liberal Democrats said Rishi Sunak’s core pledge to lead a government that acts with “integrity and professionalism” has become an “empty promise”. Labour chair Anneliese Dodds said it is “staggering” that Baroness Mone still has the Conservative whip.\n\nNOV 2020: Secret PPE scheme saw government hand billions to political ‘cronies’\n\n5. Labour enjoys big Chester swing\n\nLabour has won the Chester by-election - the first electoral test of Rishi Sunak’s reign. Samantha Dixon comfortably retained the seat for her party with 17,309 votes - a 61% share and nearly 11,000 more than the Conservative candidate. Although Labour was widely tipped to win, the margin was bigger than in 2019 when the gap was 6,164 votes. Election officials said that turnout was 41.2%, with a total of 28,541 votes cast.\n\n6. Hancock reveals ‘bonkers’ plan\n\nMinisters considered releasing prisoners at the start of the Covid pandemic, claimed Matt Hancock. The former health secretary said there was a “bonkers proposal from the Ministry of Justice to let prisoners out, as they’d be easier to manage if they’re not in prison”. In his book, Pandemic Diaries, serialised in the Daily Mail he continued: “Yes, really: they actually thought this might be a goer. I was emphasising [my opposition] so hard that all of a sudden my chair could take the strain no longer and ripped, tipping me unceremoniously on to the floor.”\n\nMatt Hancock: the former health secretary turned reality-show contestant\n\n7. Hussey asked lawyer about heritage\n\nFormer chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal says royal aide Lady Susan Hussey, who resigned after a racism row, also asked him about his “heritage” at Buckingham Palace. Writing on Twitter, the leading lawyer said: “I was at the Buckingham Palace reception at which Lady Hussey questioned the heritage of a brilliant DV [domestic violence] expert Ngozi Fulani. She only asked me my heritage once & seemed to accept my answer - Manchester currently! Racism is never far away tho.” Meanwhile, the late monarch’s lady-in-waiting has offered to meet Fulani, said The Mirror.\n\nLady-in-waiting Susan Hussey resigns over racist ‘abuse’ row\n\n8. Ukraine death figure claimed\n\nUp to 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since the start of the conflict, said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “It is rare for Ukraine to give figures for casualties”, said the BBC, noting that Podolyak’s figures have not been confirmed by the country’s military. Meanwhile, France has become the first major western state to officially back a special tribunal to try senior Russian officials – potentially including Vladimir Putin – for the crime of aggression in Ukraine.\n\nThe real Ukraine war death toll\n\n9. ‘Dangerous’ to reappoint Braverman\n\nThe reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary sets “a dangerous precedent”, said a committee of MPs. The home secretary, who was fired from her role after leaking restricted material, was handed back her job just six days later, when Rishi Sunak became prime minister. William Wragg, chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, said a “robust” system for upholding standards was necessary, “with proper sanctions for those who break the rules”.\n\nSuella Braverman - and five of the other most divisive politicians since Brexit\n\n10.

Seven high-tech production trucks, the same tractor trailers you see at Monday Night Football games. A separate editing truck. More than 400 people on site in Bristol, Conn., working from headquarters and in Charlotte, N.C. for the Sue Bird-Diana Taurasi show. Analysts who appeared on pretty much every property the networks have, from Good Morning America to First Take to Sports Center.\n\nNo expense was spared, no shortcuts taken, no corners cut.\n\n“I think we brought a lot of gravitas,” Kate Jackson, vice president of production at ESPN. “I was here in 2016. And the tournament didn’t look like this. Play didn’t look like this. Our coverage didn’t look like this. It’s amazing.\n\n“But I do feel like this is a sport that’s been building for a very long time, and this is just the coming-out party. Last year was an amuse bouche.”\n\nWomen’s basketball, and women’s sports, have been gaining momentum over the last few years. When an average of 12.3 million people watched last year’s title game between LSU and Iowa, shattering the previous record, it put everyone on notice that the event needed to be treated like a blue-chip event.\n\nThat was reinforced during the regular season, when there seemed to be a new ratings record set each week as Caitlin Clark chased first the women’s and then the all-time scoring records.\n\nESPN was already invested — literally and figuratively, having signed a new eight-year deal with the NCAA in January worth a reported $115 million a year that includes championships in 40 sports (21 women's events and 19 men's). So the question became how could ESPN elevate what it was already doing?\n\nRead more about women's basketball:Iowa-South Carolina game smashes TV ratings record\n\nIt struck, as Jackson described it, “lightning in a bottle,” with its studio show featuring Elle Duncan, Andraya Carter and Chiney Ogwumike. The three drew rave reviews for their chemistry, insightful analysis and humor, with many comparing them to the “Inside the NBA” crew that has set the standard for studio shows.\n\nA change in ESPN's coverage, offering more studio shows\n\nA decision was made to add more studio programming in the early rounds, recognizing there would be a need for more analysis, more “big picture” conversations because there were going to be new fans and people who hadn’t paid close attention during the season.\n\n“We were trying to find ways to serve that better,” Jackson said.\n\nESPN and ABC were also intentional with how games the first two weekends of the tournament were programmed. It wasn’t happenstance that Clark and Iowa’s first-round game was showcased on ABC on a Saturday afternoon. Or that the Iowa-LSU rematch, along with the UConn-USC game featuring one of the game’s established stars and one of its up-and-comers in Paige Bueckers and JuJu Watkins, were on Monday night, when there were no games in the men’s tournament.\n\n“You’re going to have the day and night to yourself,” said Nick Dawson, senior vice president of college sports programming and acquisitions for ESPN. “That was intentional and additive to the (existing) storylines.”\n\nThe networks’ efforts paid off — and then some.\n\nAn average of 18.7 million people tuned in for Sunday afternoon’s title game between Clark’s Iowa and undefeated South Carolina, with the audience peaking at a whopping 24 million. That made it the most-watched basketball game, men’s or women’s, college or pro, since 2019.\n\nIt also was an 89% increase from last year, and a 285% — yes, you read that right — increase since 2022.\n\n“Anyone would be lying if they said they expected this,” Dawson said. “I think we certainly expected that, if the storylines played out, that we would do very well and probably surpass last year, just based on what we saw in the regular season, what we saw with the Caitlin story, amongst all the others.”\n\nBut this went beyond the Clark effect.\n\nWill the interest continue to build?\n\nBonkers as the numbers were for Friday night’s game between Clark’s Iowa and Bueckers’ UConn — an average of 14.2 million people watched — Dawson said he was even more encouraged by the ratings for the first semifinal, between South Carolina and N.C. State. It was the lead-in game and it wound up being a blowout. Despite that, more than 7 million tuned in.\n\nThat bodes well for the game’s future post-Clark, who is all-but-certain of being the No. 1 pick in Monday’s WNBA draft.\n\n“The biggest question we’re trying to answer is, what is lasting?” Dawson said. “That’s encouraging and suggests there is a meaningful increase in interest and awareness for the game overall that we believe can continue on.”\n\nThe challenge now is how can ESPN continue elevating the tournament within the constraints it has.\n\nUnlike the men’s tournament, or Monday Night Football, the women’s tournament is mostly played in basketball arenas, where there is less space. The truck bay at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse was completely full, and every outlet was spoken for.\n\n“Think about it like you have plugged every single outlet in your whole house and you're like, `I feel like I want another Christmas tree.’ OK, how do we do that?” Jackson said. “This is clearly bigger than it's ever been before. What do we need to just think differently about? And that can be anything. That can be the staffing that you bring from a production, behind-the-scenes standpoint. Are we thinking about it in the right way? Are we scheduling people in the right way?”\n\nPutting the title game on ABC has benefitted ratings. And while some have complained that it should also be in prime time, Dawson said the NFL has been instructive.\n\nEvery year, he said, the NFL’s most-viewed window is Sunday afternoon, around 4:30 p.m. The Super Bowl usually kicks off around 6:30 p.m.\n\n“We don’t feel like we’re limiting the audience by where it is now,” Dawson said. “But if there's an opportunity in the future, and the conversation makes sense for us internally to look at a later start time, we’re certainly willing to evaluate that.\n\n“I think there’s a sweet spot somewhere between where we are now and five, six o'clock.”\n\nWhile women’s basketball is commanding most of the attention, there’s also been an increase in interest for gymnastics. Softball. Volleyball. ESPN is looking to see not only what it learned from this tournament, but whether any of it can be applied to other sports it broadcasts.\n\nBecause this season didn’t happen in a vacuum, Jackson said. Women’s sports are finally getting the attention they deserve, and that spotlight isn’t going to fade.\n\n“Women’s sports is at an arrival right now. I don't think that this is a peak that's going to have a fall,” Jackson said. “This is the time for women's sports. I think people are now just sort of like, `Wow, they’re pretty awesome.’”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2016/01/24/nas-arena-top-ten/78987618/", "title": "Top 10 sports events at Bridgestone Arena", "text": "Mike Organ\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee\n\nBridgestone Arena has served as host to many sports events since first opening its doors on Dec. 18, 1996, but perhaps the biggest of all will be the NHL All-Star Game on Jan. 31.\n\nThe game will bring thousands of fans to downtown and to the home of the Nashville Predators. The facility has also served as home to the Arena Football League Nashville Kats as well as host to figure skating, gymnastics, basketball, boxing, mixed martial arts and other events.\n\nHere are our picks for the top 10 sports events that have taken place in the arena:\n\n10. Don King’s Night of Boxing\n\nJan. 11, 1997: The bombastic promoter Don King put together an impressive card, which was televised live on Showtime and drew a crowd of 8,777 to the arena. In the main event, World Boxing Organization champ Henry Akinwande defended his heavyweight title with a 12-round unanimous decision over fellow Englishman and No. 1 WBO contender Scott Welch. Nashville boxer Terrance Churchwell brought the crowd to its feet with a first-round knockout of Charles Sims. Deirdre Gogarty, who replaced Christy Martin, one of the world's top female boxers at the time, knocked out Deborah Stroman in 43 seconds.\n\n9. UFC Fight Night\n\nApril 1, 2009: There were 11 bouts on the card, which was televised on Spike TV and was the first Ultimate Fighting Championship event at the arena since Tennessee began regulating mixed martial arts fighting in 2008. A crowd of 10,267 watched Martin \"The Hitman\" Kampmann win a narrow split decision over Carlos \"Natural Born Killer\" Condit in the featured bout.\n\n8. Nashville Kats playoff game\n\nJuly 29, 2000: The largest crowd of the season (14,781) turned out to see the Arena Football League franchise claim a 57-14 win over Grand Rapids in the first round of the playoffs. The Kats included former Tennessee Vols quarterback Andy Kelly and receiver Cory Fleming, and former Tennessee State receiver Jarrick HIllery. The Kats went on to win their next two playoff games on the road and advanced to the Arena Bowl where they lost to Orlando, 41-38.\n\n7. U.S. Gymnastics Championships\n\nJune 2-4, 2004: With the 2004 Olympics in Athens starting just a few weeks later, national and international attention was focused on the U.S. Gymnastics Championships at the arena. Carly Patterson emerged as the women’s champion and Paul Hamm as the men’s champion. Both went on to win Olympic gold medals.\n\n6. SEC women’s basketball tournament\n\nMarch 1-4, 2012: Legendary Tennessee coach Pat Summitt’s final SEC Tournament championship came at the arena. Diagnosed earlier in the year with early onset dementia, Alzheimer’s type, Summitt continued to coach the Lady Vols. In the SEC Tournament she led UT to wins over Vanderbilt in the quarterfinals, South Carolina in the semifinals and LSU in the final. The average attendance for Tennessee's three games was 10,688. Summitt retired in April 2012.\n\n5. NCAA men’s basketball tournament first and second round\n\nMarch 17-19, 2000: Local college basketball fans had clamored for the return of the NCAA men's tournament to Nashville since it was last played at Vanderbilt's Memorial Gym in 1993. It finally did when the first two rounds were awarded to the arena in 2000. First rounds results: Miami, Fla. 75, Arkansas 71; Ohio State 87, Appalachian State 61; Tulsa 89, UNLV 62 and Cincinnati 64, UNC-Wilmington 47. Tulsa eventually advanced to the regional finals, where it lost to North Carolina 59-55.\n\n4. SEC men’s basketball tournament\n\nMarch 8-11, 2001: During the construction of the arena the most anticipated event was the SEC men’s basketball tournament. It first came to the arena in 2001, when Kentucky beat Ole Miss 77-55 in the finals before a capacity crowd — mostly Wildcats fans. That first impression must have been a good one because the SEC selected Nashville again in 2006, 2010 and 2013 before awarding a 12-year agreement that began in 2015.\n\n3. NCAA women’s basketball Final Four\n\nApril 6-8, 2014: The arena’s first opportunity to serve as host for an NCAA national championship brought Connecticut, Notre Dame, Stanford and Maryland to the Music City. Connecticut and Notre Dame advanced to the championship game, marking the first time two undefeated teams had ever met in the final. The Huskies won 79-58 to earn their ninth national title.\n\n2. U.S. Figure Skating Championships\n\nFeb. 8-16, 1997: The first sports event in the arena was the weeklong U.S. Figure Skating Championships before a prime time national television audience and several sellout sessions. Tara Lipinski, who was 14 at the time, performed a triple-loop, triple-loop jump and beat heavily favored Michelle Kwan.\n\n1. Predators inaugural game\n\nOct. 10, 1998: The Predators faced the Florida Panthers before a sellout crowd of 17,298. Ray Whitney scored the only goal and Kirk McLean earned the shutout in a 1-0 game. Starters for the Predators were Andrew Brunette, Greg Johnson, Sergei Krivokrasov, Joel Bouchard, Bob Boughner and goaltender Mike Dunham.\n\nReach Mike Organ at 615-259-802 and on Twitter @MikeOrganWriter.\n\nNHL All-Star Weekend in Nashville schedule\n\nVince Gill to sing anthem at NHL All-Star Game\n\nPredators' Weber, Josi, Rinne named to NHL All-Star Game\n\nNHL unveils Nashville All-Star Game jerseys\n\nNHL All-Star Game in Nashville to be 3-on-3 tournament\n\nBarry Trotz to coach Metropolitan Division All-Stars", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2024/04/04/caitlin-clark-larry-bird-magic-johnson-womens-basketball/73191329007/", "title": "Caitlin Clark's surge draws comparisons to Magic-Bird in 1979", "text": "The culminating moments of this year’s NCAA women’s basketball tournament might go down in history as the time that changed the sport forever.\n\nAt least that’s how some prominent observers see it, 45 years after they saw the men’s game change forever with a different Final Four in 1979.\n\nConsider the similarities.\n\nBack then, it was Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Their rising superstardom captivated the nation in the NCAA Tournament, breaking a record for television viewership and setting the stage for explosive growth in the men’s game before moving on to save the NBA.\n\nThis year, it’s Caitlin Clark of Iowa. She is also helping set new viewership records in the women’s game and could similarly bring new life to the WNBA this year after this weekend’s Final Four in Cleveland.\n\nWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert has noticed.\n\n“This is our Magic-Bird moment,” she told USA TODAY Sports Wednesday.\n\nFormer CBS Sports president Neal Pilson attended that game in '79 and sees parallels, too.\n\n“Larry Bird and Magic − can that be replicated?” Pilson told USA TODAY Sports. “I’m not at all concerned that there won’t be a positive continuation of this type of attention… All this feeds on itself. It grows. It doesn’t just go away.”\n\nCaitlin Clark and exposure\n\nIt’s not a perfect comparison. Magic vs. Bird exploded into a two-star college rivalry that culminated in the championship game. This year, Clark and Iowa beat defending champion LSU and rival star Angel Reese in the Elite Eight, drawing the biggest television audience in women’s college basketball history (12.3 million). Four days later, Clark plays in the Final Four Friday against Connecticut and Paige Bueckers, a guard her coach has described as “the best player in America.”\n\nBut the high-wattage appeal is similarly stirring to viewers, advertisers and even gamblers, helping the popularity “feed off itself” by raising the tide of exposure for all boats that benefit from it.\n\nIn 1979, Magic vs. Bird set a record with 35 million viewers. Now evidence shows a similar sort of national awakening in women’s basketball.\n\n“I’ve been analogizing that to say this is our transformational moment like that was, which led to big media deals, with led to big marketing, i.e. Michael Jordan and Nike, the ultimate marketer,” Engelbert said.\n\nYet the women’s college game has had big audiences and stars before, in the 1980s and ‘90s, including Cheryl Miller and Sheryl Swoopes. Their tournament games also drew audiences of seven to 12 million on CBS when there were far fewer media channels and no social media. Huge growth didn’t follow.\n\n“The question for me more is, `How sustainable is this?’” said Cheryl Cooky, a professor at Purdue who has co-authored a study on media coverage of women’s sports. “Is this another peak that’s going to be followed by a valley? Or is this truly sort of an upward trajectory where we see increases happening over time?”\n\nThis time might be different\n\nFor example:\n\n◾ Two of the top four most-watched women’s college basketball games of all time featured Clark against Reese – last year in the final game (nearly 10 million on average) and Monday in the Elite Eight (12.3 million).\n\n◾ Forty new advertisers are buying time in the women’s Final Four this weekend with ABC or ESPN. The Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC and ESPN, confirmed to USA TODAY Sports that inventory for those games sold out earlier than ever before. Disney also confirmed that revenue from those sales more than doubled from last year and has more than tripled over the past three years.\n\n◾ GroupM, a prominent media investment group, announced last week a commitment to double investment in annual women’s sports advertising. It plans to do it with clients such as Adidas, Ally, Coinbase, Discover, Google, Mars, Nationwide, Unilever and Universal Pictures.\n\nThe company cited peaks in viewership and said it would collaborate with media partners to help “drive the discovery, promotion and monetization of women’s sports.“\n\n◾ Gambling, which helps drive sports viewership, is also skyrocketing for women’s basketball and wasn't even legal in most of the nation until after May 2018. The betting handle on women’s college basketball is up 14 times more than last year as of March, according to DraftKings. The LSU-Iowa game Monday was the most bet-on women’s college basketball game in DraftKings Sportsbook history and was on par with many NFL games from last season in terms of betting handle.\n\n“When you treat us like a sport, you will get a return on your investment,” said South Carolina coach Dawn Staley, whose undefeated team faces North Carolina State in the other national semifinal Friday. “Women's basketball is in high demand. People want to see it. People want to see it live, and people want to see it across the airways.”\n\n'50 years in the making'\n\nIn other words, exposure and investment are peaking for women’s college basketball after decades of under-investment, neglect and occasional fits and starts.\n\nBy comparison, the men’s game has reaped the benefits of exposure and investment for decades longer. And it wasn’t until 1972 that Title IX banned sex discrimination in schools.\n\nThe first NCAA Tournament for the men came in 1939, compared to 1982 for the women, who previously competed for championships in the now-defunct Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. By 1954, the men got their first national championship game on national TV, compared to 1982 for the women.\n\n“Remember, we just celebrated the 50th anniversary of Title IX,” said former Georgia Tech coach Bernadette McGlade, now the commissioner of the Atlantic 10 Conference. “This has been 50 years in the making. It hasn’t been a flash in the pan just overnight.”\n\nIt still might seem like it sometimes. In 2019, the proportion of airtime devoted to women’s sports on sports news shows and ESPN’s SportsCenter was less than 6%, according to a study by the University of Southern California and Purdue. In 2021, a report commissioned by the NCAA found that the governing body of college sports “prioritizes men’s basketball” and it was \"significantly undervaluing women’s basketball as an asset.\"\n\nThe NCAA didn’t even use the popular marketing term “March Madness” to promote the women’s game until 2022.\n\nSo what’s changing?\n\nFor starters, it helps to not keep under-promoting half of the potential marketplace by gender.\n\n“Their superstars were not getting the kind of promotion they are getting today,” Pilson told USA TODAY Sports. “They and the industry have learned a lot from the NBA and NFL (which have been around longer). They’ve learned that the public responds to the athletes. They learned that the athletes are the shooting stars in their sport.”\n\nThe rise of social media and online streaming services also allowed women’s basketball to reach more people, as opposed to 30 years ago, when newspaper and TV companies essentially acted as gatekeepers of what sports got covered and what didn’t.\n\nSports editors and TV executives back then had limited space and time for coverage, forcing them to make choices. And they would try to justify the coverage disparity between men's and women’s basketball by pointing to the attendance figures. For example, in 1994, the Division I men’s game drew an average of about 5,500 compared to about 1,100 for the women, according to NCAA records.\n\nBut the reverse also could be true: Attendance lagged because the game wasn’t promoted like the men. Similarly, players on the great Tennessee and UConn teams of the 1990s and early 2000s might have gotten more national traction if TikTok, Instagram and other social media were around to connect them with more fans back then.\n\nEndorsement deals help, too. They weren’t allowed for college players until 2021, but now they help brighten the spotlight for some star players, such as Clark with Nike and State Farm insurance.\n\nBut will it last?\n\nThis is where the Magic-Bird comparison faces its moment of truth. After Clark, will the women’s college game sustain this level of interest?\n\nThe men’s game exploded in popularity after Magic and Bird in the 1980s, especially after CBS won the television rights to the men’s tournament in 1982. Other stars and storylines came along to drive interest, pumping up the men’s postseason into the commercial behemoth it is now.\n\nWith Clark on the way to the WNBA, Bueckers and others are left to help carry it, including Southern California’s JuJu Watkins, a freshman who ranked second nationally in scoring this season behind Clark with 27.1 points per game.\n\nThe NCAA also has invested more but still needs to do more, according to supporters of the women’s game.\n\nIn the last three years, the NCAA has increased the investment in just some of the major championship areas for women’s basketball by more than $14 million annually, said Lynn Holzman, the NCAA’s vice president of women’s basketball.\n\nThe Final Four starts Friday in prime time on ESPN, starting with South Carolina (36-0) against North Carolina State (31-6). Iowa (33-4) vs. UConn (33-5) follows.\n\n“It is an event and a place that people want to be because of the historic performances that we are seeing by these individuals and these teams,” Holzman said. “So it's awesome. It's wonderful.”\n\nContributing: Steve Berkowitz\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

They’ll play South Carolina, who defeated NC State earlier in the night.\n\nClark and Iowa lost to LSU in the national championship game last year, and college basketball’s all-time leading scorer has talked often this season of the job not being done and wanting more. Well, now she’s going to get the chance to end her illustrious career in perfect fashion.\n\nClark has already said she’s foregoing her fifth COVID year and is expected to be the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft. She doesn’t need a title to cement her legacy, but it sure would be a perfect sendoff.\n\nIowa’s win ends a remarkable run by UConn, which reached the Final Four despite having just eight available players after a rash of injuries.\n\nSTREAM: March Madness on ESPN+ and Fubo\n\nReactions to offensive foul call on Aaliyah Edwards in final seconds\n\nWhen Aaliyah Edwards was called for an offensive foul in the final seconds of the game, UConn coach Geno Auriemma looked as if he'd been punched in the gut.\n\nESPN’s Scott Van Pelt and Andraya Carter didn’t agree with the ref’s call either.\n\n“I hated the call. You’ve got to give Gabbie Marshall credit for trying to fight over the screen. That’s what drew the refs' attention in,\" Carter said on the postgame show.\n\n“But to me, now that final play, it’s not about Iowa's defense. It’s about the call the referee made. There was a slight lean, maybe Aaliyah Edwards’ elbow was slightly out. But to be honest, the calls were even for both sides. There were missed calls for Iowa. There was missed contact for UConn. To make that call at the very end of the game – to me, it took away the opportunity for players to make plays. … To be honest, that call sucked.”\n\nIowa coach Lisa Bluder said she didn't see the offensive foul. \"Caitlin Clark really didn’t have freedom of movement. But you know at this point, they're not going to call a lot. Especially after last year, when Caitlin and Angel were on the bench. I just think you’re not going to see a lot of calls.\"\n\nMORE:Where's accountability, transparency in women's officiating? Coaches want to know\n\nLater, Edwards said she thought the play was \"clean.\" Teammate Paige Bueckers then weighed in: \"Everybody can make a big deal out of one single play, but one single play doesn’t win or lose a basketball game. ... You can look at one play and say, oh that killed us or that hurt us. We should have done a better job, I should have done a better job making sure I didn’t leave the game up to that.\"\n\nOpinion: Hannah Stuelke, not Caitlin Clark, lifts Iowa to title game\n\nCLEVELAND — Caitlin Clark tried to tell you. All year, she told you exactly what to watch for with Iowa.\n\nNo, not her.\n\nHannah Stuelke.\n\nClark suggested earlier this year that the soft-spoken sophomore might break all her records one day and, after a night like this, it’s easy to believe it. Clark and Iowa are in the national championship game for a second consecutive year, and it’s Stuelke who got them there.\n\nShe scored a team-high 23 on 9-of-12 shooting, and carried Iowa until Clark and the rest of the Hawkeyes found their groove late in the game. She got her fingers on the ball after Clark missed a second free throw, tipping it to Sydney Affolter and giving Iowa possession with three seconds left. Read Nancy Armour's entire column here.\n\nCaitlin Clark after win: 'Takes all five of us'\n\nClark, who had 21 points but was held in check for much of the night, praised her teammates after Iowa’s 71-69 victory over UConn in a semifinal game at the Final Four.\n\n“Our offense wasn’t great tonight but we played great defense,’’ Clark told ESPN’s Holly Rowe. “And sometimes that’s what you need to win, so I’m just proud of our girls to find a way to win.’’\n\nClark, asked how she avoided getting frustrated while being shadowed by UConn’s Nika Muhl, replied, “I thought my teammates stepped up and did a really good job. Made some big baskets when we needed it, so I couldn’t be more proud of them. It takes all five of us.\"\n\nIowa survives UConn, 71-69\n\nCaitlin Clark and Iowa outlasted UConn 71-69 Friday in a semifinal matchup at the Final Four, advancing to the national championship. The Hawkeyes will play undefeated South Carolina (37-0) for the national championship Sunday at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse.\n\nDespite a slow start, Clark finished with 21 points, nine rebounds and seven assists. Hannah Stuelke led Iowa in scoring with 23 points.\n\nUConn had a chance to take the lead in the final seconds, but the Huskies' Aaliyah Edwards was called for an offensive foul in the frontcourt. Edwards and Paige Bueckers had 17 points apiece for UConn.\n\nClark had only six points in the first half after shooting 3-for-11 from the floor and missing all six of her 3-point attempts. It was the first time Clark failed to make a 3-pointer in an NCAA Tournament game during her four-year career, according to the ESPN telecast.\n\nClark was stymied by UConn’s Nika Muhl, a two-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year. But Clark bounced back in the second half.\n\nYes, down to the wire\n\nUConn’s Nika Muhl drained a 3-pointer with just under 40 seconds left to play, cutting Iowa’s lead to 70-69. Hold on tight.\n\nDown to the wire?\n\nBack claws UConn, with the Huskies pulling within 68-64 with 2:38 left to play. UConn coach Geno Auriemma promptly called a timeout. Nail-biting time commences.\n\nHawkeyes surging in fourth quarter\n\nIowa opened the fourth quarter with a 15-6 surge. The Hawkeyes took a 66-57 lead on Gabbie Marshall’s jumper with 5:42 left to play.\n\nCaitlin Clark starts cooking, Iowa leads\n\nCaitlin Clark now has 20 points, and Iowa leads UConn 60-57 with 7½ minutes left in the game.\n\nAfter going 0-for-6 from 3-point range in the first half, Clark is 3-for-5 from long range in the second half. She also has eight rebounds and six assists.\n\nThird quarter: Iowa 51, UConn 51\n\nYes, Caitlin Clark finally hit a 3-pointer. Two of them, in fact. The bigger deal: The Hawkeyes looked far better than in the first half. A lot of that has to do with Clark, who has a relatively modest 13 points on 5-for-14 shooting but also has seven rebounds and six assists.\n\nIowa had almost as many points in the third quarter (25) as they did in the entire first half (26),\n\nPaige Bueckers is also heating up for UConn and now leads the Huskies with 14 points. Freshman KK Arnold has 12 points but she’s saddled with four fouls.\n\nUConn's Nika Muhl hurts knee\n\nShort-handed UConn can't afford to lose anyone. And this one would be big.\n\nNika Muhl went back to the locker room after hurting her knee with about 3 minutes left in the third quarter. She and Edwards got tangled up with an Iowa player under the Hawkeyes' basket, and Muhl appeared to bang her knee on the floor. She grimaced as she sat on the floor and play continued before getting up and limping to the other end of the floor. She was subbed out -- despite KK Arnold picking up her fourth foul -- and ran back to the locker room. She returned after about 2 minutes but is clearly hobbled.\n\nFour-point play for Caitlin Clark\n\nNow that’s the Caitlin Clark we know. She converted a four-point play after getting fouled while making a 3-pointer and making the bonus free throw. That pulled Iowa to within one point of UConn at 44-43 with 3:49 left in the third quarter.\n\nIowa hanging tough vs. UConn in third quarter\n\nDespite Clark’s shooting struggles, Iowa’s very much in this game. The Hawkeyes trailed throughout the first half but tied the game earlier in the third quarter before UConn edged ahead again.\n\nUConn leads 41-39 with about five minutes left in the quarter.\n\nA key: the Hawkeyes have taken far better control of the basketball in the second half.\n\nCaitlin Clark finally hits from three\n\nThe drought is over. Clark made her first 3-pointer of the game with 8:09 left in the third quarter after six consecutive misses from 3-point range. The basket cut UConn’s lead to 36-34.\n\nHalftime: UConn 32, Iowa 26\n\nCaitlin Clark has only six points at the half after shooting 3-for-11 from the floor and missing all six of her 3-point attempts. It’s the first time Clark has failed to make a 3-pointer in an NCAA Tournament game during her four-year career, according to the ESPN telecast.\n\nClark has been stymied by UConn’s Nika Muhl, a two-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year. While Clark struggled to find open shots, she did have six rebounds and four assists.\n\nBut Clark also has three turnovers and collectively, Iowa has 12 against UConn’s tough defense.\n\nFreshman KK Arnold leads UConn with 10 points, and Paige Bueckers has six points on 3-of-9 shooting.\n\nThree UConn players already have two fouls apiece\n\nUConn is losing the numbers game.\n\nThe Huskies only have eight players after a rash of injuries this season. And with more than three minutes left in the first half, Nika Muhl, Aaliyah Edwards and KK Arnold all have two fouls.\n\nCaitlin Clark struggling as Iowa trails\n\nUConn has opened up a 25-16 lead with just under seven minutes left in the second quarter while Iowa’s Caitlin Clark continues to struggle. She is 1-for-6 shooting and has missed all four of her 3-point attempts.\n\nClark does have three assists, but she’s also committed three turnovers. As a team, the Hawkeyes already have committed 10 turnovers.\n\nUConn leads at start of second quarter\n\nCaitlin Clark is off to a slow start, shooting 1-for-5 from the floor. She missed all three of her 3-point attempts and has struggled to find open shots while being defended by UConn’s Nika Muhl. Her only points came on a layup.\n\nNot only has Muhl contained Clark, but she’s also made 3-pointers while sparking the Huskies, who led by as many as eight points in the quarter.\n\nUConn leads as Caitlin Clark off to mortal start\n\nIowa’s Caitlin Clark is off to a mortal start as the Hawkeyes have fallen behind UConn 16-11 with about two minutes left in the first quarter. Clark is 1-for-4 shooting and has missed both of her 3-point attempts.\n\nKK Arnold has six points for the Huskies, who pulled ahead with an 8-0 run.\n\nBrent Clark, Caitlin's dad, sneaks his own snacks into arena\n\nBrent Clark is such a dad.\n\nHe was spotted by TV cameras before Friday's game, munching on snacks that were hidden in the front pocket of his jacket. No word on what those snacks were.\n\nSpecial Caitlin Clark gear created by Kristin Juszczyk\n\nClothing designer Kristin Juszczyk, who has made a name for herself designing one-of-a-kind sports jackets and coats, of course completed a Caitlin Clark coat for the Final Four.\n\nKristin modeled the coat and posed with her husband, San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk, in an Instagram post Friday to show off a couple of her Clark designs.\n\nWhat makes Caitlin Clark so good?\n\nWe asked some hoops legends for their thoughts on the generational talent. Steph Curry, Maya Moore, Kelsey Mitchell and others broke down her game, explaining what makes her so good.\n\nCaitlin Clark and the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nCould Clark make the 2024 Olympic roster for the Paris Games? It’s complicated.\n\nCaitlin Clark: Complete guide to Iowa superstar's career\n\nCaitlin Clark is the reigning national player of the year, a sharpshooting supernova with a penchant for launching 3-pointers from the logo, flicking no-look passes through defenders' arms and talking trash to any and all who stand in her way.\n\nThe postseason for Clark and Iowa starts next week, with the Hawkeyes playing in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten conference tournament. No matter what happens in the next few days, Iowa is expected to earn a top four seed in the NCAA tournament, and host the first two rounds. A year after leading Iowa to the national championship game, Clark is trying to get back to her second consecutive Final Four, an accomplishment few players have achieved. USA TODAY Sports has been tracking her game closely. In case you need to brush up on your Clark trivia, we’ve got you covered with our complete guide to all things Clark.\n\nPaige Bueckers' stats\n\nPaige Bueckers' tournament stats this time around are nothing short of sensational: Through four games she’s averaging 28.0 points, 9.0 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 3.3 steals and shooting 51.5% from the field. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nCaitlin Clark vs. Paige Bueckers history\n\nThe two first faced off during the 2021 season. Clark was a freshman just starting to turn heads, and Bueckers was already the best player in the country after coming in as the most highly touted freshman. The first matchup went something like this: 21 points, three rebounds, five assists and five turnovers for Clark vs. 18 points, nine rebounds, eight assists and two turnovers for Bueckers. UConn won 92-72.\n\nBut that was three years ago, before Clark became Clark (aka the all-time leading scorer in college hoops, men or women) and Bueckers suffered through two season-ending injuries. She went a staggering 720 days between NCAA Tournament games. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nHow many national championships has Iowa won?\n\nThe Hawkeyes have yet to win a national championship in women's college basketball, so they have zero titles. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nHow many national championships has Iowa been to?\n\nIowa has been to one national championship game. With Caitlin Clark dominating the entire season, they faced LSU in last year's title game and lost, 102-85. If the Hawkeyes defeat No. 3 UConn in this year's Final Four, they will make a second consecutive national championship game appearance. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nHow many times has Iowa been to the Final Four?\n\nThis is the third time the Iowa Hawkeyes will be in the Final Four. They are returning to the national semifinal where they beat South Carolina, 77-73, last year to advance to the championship game. They then lost the title game to LSU. The Hawkeyes' first Final Four appearance was in 1993 when C. Vivian Stringer was the coach. The Hawkeyes lost to Ohio State, 73-72, in overtime in the national semifinal. Stringer was the first coach in college basketball history to take three different schools to the Final Four when she did so with Cheyney State in 1982, Iowa in 1993, and Rutgers in 2000 and 2007. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nAre you ready for Paige vs. Caitlin, Round 2?\n\nYou better be. Because Friday at the Women’s Final Four, we’re getting that rematch. Her full name, of course, is Paige Bueckers. But like Caitlin Clark, she is so good, so famous and so transcendent beyond basketball that she goes by only one name.\n\nIf only we all had that kind of star power. Read Lindsay Schnell’s full story.\n\nWhen does Caitlin Clark play next?\n\nCaitlin Clark and top-seeded Iowa take to the court tonight in Cleveland against No. 3 UConn. They tip off at about 9:30 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat time is the Iowa vs. UConn game?\n\nThe top-seeded Hawkeyes tip off against the No. 3 Huskies at 9:30 p.m.\n\nIowa vs. UConn prediction\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Lindsay Schnell is picking Paige Bueckers and the UConn to win while Nancy Armour is picking Caitlin Clark and Iowa to win.\n\nHow to watch Iowa vs. UConn\n\nESPN is airing and streaming Iowa vs. UConn.\n\nHow many national championships has UConn been to?\n\nConnecticut has been to the national championship 12 times. The Huskies have won the title all but once, in 2022 when they lost to South Carolina, 64-49.\n\nThere is a possibility of a rematch of that game this year if the Huskies and Gamecocks each win their Final Four semifinal. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nHow many national championships has UConn won?\n\nThe Huskies have won 11 national championships, tied with the UCLA men's team for the most of any program in Division I college basketball, and all under head coach Geno Auriemma. Connecticut won the title in 1995, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Six of those seasons (1995, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2014 and 2016) were undefeated. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nHow many times has UConn been to the Final Four?\n\nUConn has been to the Final Four 23 times, all under head coach Geno Auriemma. This is the record for most Final Four appearances of any team in Division I college basketball − men's or women's. The Huskies' first trip to the Final Four was in 1991 when they lost in the semifinal to Virginia, 61-55. They've since gone back to the Final Four in 1995, 1996, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2024. The tournament was not held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTheir streak of 14 consecutive Final Four appearances from 2008 to 2022 was broken when Ohio State beat UConn, 73-61, in the Sweet 16 last season. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nGetting tipsy before tip-off?\n\nIs it too early for adult beverages? Apparently not when you’re hosting an alternate ESPN telecast during the women’s Final Four.\n\nHey, Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi, what’s in those red Solo cups?\n\nUConn coach Geno Auriemma, who was asked after their first show in 2022 if he would watch it later, drew laughter when he said: \"I didn't record it, and the chances of me watching it are less than zero. When you've been around those two as long as I have, I really truly have no interest in hearing anything they have to say. On any topic, especially me. But I'm sure they were funny as hell, and I'm sure whatever I see they were drinking didn't come from the store.\"\n\nFormer UConn stars Diana Taurasi and Sue Bird give viewers their take\n\nWondering what Sue Bird thinks? Curious about Diana Taurasi’s thoughts? Well, you’re in luck.\n\nFor the third year in a row, the former UConn stars are teaming up on ESPN’s alternate broadcast during the Final Four.

Now it's our turn!\n\nAll of Chiefs Kingdom is rooting for you tonight, @CaitlinClark22\"\n\nOpinion: Caitlin Clark got people's attention. There's talent to make them stay\n\nThese are heady times for women’s basketball and, by extension, women’s sports.\n\nCaitlin Clark is a household name. Iowa and LSU’s rematch of last year’s title game drew more than 12 million viewers, such a bonkers number it beat all but one college football game this season. The best seats for Friday night’s Final Four games will set you back more than $7,000, each, and it’s around $400 just to get in the door.\n\n\"This is exactly what we wanted for women's basketball,\" Clark said Thursday. \"But also I feel like it could have been a thing a long time ago.\"\n\nRead Nancy Armour’s full column.\n\nCaitlin Clark stats\n\nAs Iowa’s Caitlin Clark continues to rewrite the record books, USA TODAY Sports is tracking all her stats during the NCAA Tournament. Here’s everything you need to know about the superstar guard. Here is an in-depth, illustrated look at the Iowa star and her race to the all-time NCAA Division I scoring record.\n\nWhy Paige Bueckers, UConn will beat Caitlin Clark, Iowa in the Final Four\n\nYou’ve heard of Paige Bueckers, right? Iowa coach Lisa Bluder certainly has, praising her the day before the Hawkeyes take on Bueckers and UConn in Friday’s Final Four. Bueckers, Bluder said, separates herself because she can “stop on a dime and elevate with her shot.”\n\nBluder’s right. And Bueckers’ skill and athleticism, coupled with her size (she’s a strong 6-feet) will be the difference in Paige vs. Caitlin Clark, Round 2, and the reason UConn advances. (UConn won Round 1, a Sweet 16 matchup in 2001).\n\nThe biggest reason that UConn will win: They’ve been here before. A lot. More specifically coach Geno Auriemma has been here a lot — he's won 11 of these. As one of the best strategists in the game, he’ll have a good plan against Clark. And don’t forget that in March and April, no one in women’s college basketball knows more about winning than Auriemma. Read Lindsay Schnell’s full story.\n\nWhy Caitlin Clark, Iowa will beat Paige Bueckers, UConn in the Final Four\n\nIowa doesn’t want to make the NCAA Tournament into its 2024 Revenge Tour. Nor does coach Lisa Bluder want the Hawkeyes games turning into a showdown between Caitlin Clark and, in this case, Paige Bueckers. OK, then how about Survival of the Fittest?\n\nGiven the pace with which Iowa likes to play and the need to, if not contain Clark try to limit her damage, this matchup might be too much for UConn’s limited resources.\n\nClark is going to Clark. She’s averaging a little over 32 points in the NCAA Tournament after dropping 41 on LSU in the Elite Eight on Monday night, when she also had 12 assists and seven rebounds. After a rough start to the tournament, she appears to have fully settled in and good luck to anyone when that happens. Read Nancy Armour’s full story.\n\nIs Caitlin Clark or Paige Bueckers college basketball's best player? What the stats say\n\nCaitlin Clark will almost certainly be the No. 1 overall pick by the Indiana Fever in the WNBA draft on April 15, while Paige Bueckers will return to UConn next season as the early favorite for 2024-25 national player of the year honors. But how do the superstar guards stack up on the court? And what do the stats say? USA TODAY dove into the numbers of their freshman seasons in 2020-21, their current seasons, their play so far in the 2024 NCAA Tournament and their one head-to-head meeting. Read it in full.\n\nUConn's Geno Auriemma on facing Caitlin Clark: 'I don’t need her dropping 50 on us'\n\nGeno Auriemma knows Caitlin Clark is coming for the UConn Huskies. And with that in mind, he wants to get one thing out of the way before Clark and Iowa match up with UConn in the second national semifinal on Friday in Cleveland: He has nothing against her. Nothing at all.\n\n“Yeah, I hope Caitlin Clark had a personal agenda against LSU,” Auriemma said after Clark dropped 41 and Iowa exacted some revenge on the defending champion Tigers in a 94-87 win in their regional final, booking a trip to their second consecutive Final Four.\n\n“I know there's nothing personal between me and her. I don't need to be seeing her drop 50 on us next weekend,” Auriemma deadpanned before laughing along with reporters. “I love her. I think she's the best player. Forget I ever said Paige (Bueckers) is the best player in the country. I think (Caitlin's) the best player of all time. I don't know whoever said Paige is the best player.” — Lindsay Schnell\n\nCaitlin Clark scoring record: How Iowa's superstar did it\n\nIowa superstar Caitlin Clark broke the NCAA all-time scoring record this season. Here's an illustrated breakdown of every one of her points.\n\nWe also asked some hoops legends for their thoughts on the generational talent.

But the Des Moines edition of the tournament has already entered uncharted territory.\n\nThe week of activities, culminating with three days of match play competition Friday through Sunday, will be the biggest international athletic event ever held in Iowa.\n\nMore than 120,000 tickets have been sold, a record for any Solheim Cup.

But Solheim has an international reach, attracting tourists and a media audience around the globe.\n\n\"It's going to have a huge worldwide impact for Des Moines,\" Edwards said.\n\nThe overlap of the event and the Iowa State Fair, which is expected to draw more than a million visitors over Aug. 10-20, will create a multi-million dollar impact for the state, Edwards said.\n\nHalf of the Cup proceeds will be awarded to local charities that support women, Radia said.\n\nPeople from 27 countries and all 50 states have plotted their travels to the West Des Moines golf course. Fans from Thailand, Australia and Dubai will attend. Europe alone is expected to send 3,000 to 5,000 visitors.\n\nSome of the sport's biggest names will be here, like American competitors Lexi Thompson and Michelle Wie and Team Europe captain Annika Sorenstam.\n\nA golf-loving crowd has devoured an entire block of more than 8,000 hotel rooms contracted for the Solheim Cup, according to tournament director Chris Garrett, who moved his family to central Iowa when he was hired.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity for the community to parlay that into more events and bigger events,\" Garrett said.\n\nVIEWER'S GUIDE: Where to watch, what to visit at/near Solheim Cup\n\nLaying the groundwork\n\nGreg Edwards delivers the cliche with a wince.\n\n\"I hate expressing it as 'build it and they will come,' but a lot of times that does help,\" Edwards said.\n\nThe time-worn \"Field of Dreams\" movie line refers to an inspired Iowa farmer who creates a baseball diamond from a corn field and attracts ghost players from yesteryear. But it offers a template for luring national and international athletic events to Iowa: Build the facilities and the know-how, and the events will come.\n\nThe Drake Relays have attracted Olympic track and field performers to the heartland for more than a century. Sprint Car Nationals found a home in Knoxville. In 1962, the United States Bowling Congress Open came to Des Moines' Veterans Memorial Auditorium. Occasionally NCAA sporting events have landed in Des Moines and Ames.\n\n.\n\nDes Moines' overall top crowd-luring events have been high school state basketball and wrestling tournaments. The biggest-selling boys' tournament, in 1977, drew 95,504 fans over the course of a week.\n\nThe highest attendance for any athletic event in state history is another tournament held at the Des Moines Golf and Country Club, the 1999 men's U.S. Senior Open, according to Register research covering high school, college, amateur and professional sports history. The seven-day tournament, including practice rounds, drew 252,800 fans.\n\nFor the most part, however, Des Moines has been overlooked.But in the 1990s, several important factors began to emerge to change that.\n\nWells Fargo Arena, a 16,000-plus-seat venue, opened in 2005, replacing venerable Vets. In the mid-2000s, Drake Stadium underwent a $15 million renovation that expanded and enhanced its track facilities.\n\nThe metropolitan area grew, adding consumer-driven attractions, lodging, restaurants and shopping. The combined population of Polk and Dallas counties increased 25 percent, from 417,033 to 558,561, from 2000 to 2016, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.\n\nOrganizations and volunteers stepped forward to prepare bids to host major athletic events.\n\nIn 2000, Catch Des Moines, the area's visitor and convention bureau, hired its first full-time employee tasked with attracting sports traffic to central Iowa.\n\nFifteen years ago, 80 percent of the bureau's bookings consisted of convention business, and the remaining 20 percent was sports-related. Today, the sports portion has doubled.\n\nThe U.S. Senior Open came to town in 1999. The Principal Charity Classic followed. That tournament drew 81,550 fans and deposited $23 million in economic impact in June.\n\nDrake Stadium became a home for national track events, including the NCAA outdoor championships and USA Track and Field meets.\n\nWells Fargo Arena, meanwhile, became a stopping place for NCAA basketball and wrestling tournaments. Franchises moved in for the NBA G-League (formerly the D-League), Arena Football and the American Hockey League.\n\nThe Iowa Speedway opened in Newton in 2005, making the state a destination for some of the biggest names in auto racing.\n\nWells Fargo Arena hosted national powers Kentucky, Kansas, Indiana and UConn in NCAA men's basketball regional games in 2016. There's more ahead: Des Moines won a bid to host first- and second-round games again in 2019.\n\nMore athletic facilities are coming, too. In 2018, the Wellmark YMCA in Des Moines is scheduled to open two pools and stadium seating that could entice national swimming events.\n\nMaking the sale\n\nIn 2013, Radia flew to visit LPGA offices in Daytona Beach, Fla., tasked with convincing the organization to choose Iowa for the Solheim Cup.\n\nAlthough Des Moines was no Los Angeles or New York City, it had a market that Radia described as \"hungry.\"\n\nThe LPGA asked bidders for 10 letters from area corporations offering support for their communities.\n\nRadia, CEO at Bankers Trust and a member of the Des Moines Golf and Country Club for more than 40 years, found lots of local support.\n\nHe delivered 20 letters, a move that seemed to baffle LPGA officials, he said.\n\n\"They said, 'You don't understand the question,' and I said, 'No, you don't understand the answer,'\" Radia said.\n\nHe offered to provide another 30 letters of support, if given two days to gather them.\n\nA financial commitment helped seal the deal. DuPont Pioneer pledged $1 million, serving as a required global corporate partner.\n\nSo what's left for the city to attract? USA Swimming competition is one possibility. U.S. Olympic trials in track, wrestling and gymnastics could arrive soon, as well.\n\nAnd Drake hopes to reel in the crown jewel of American track — the U.S. Olympic trials.\n\nDes Moines could bid for the 2024 trials. But one of the requirements to wrestle them away from Oregon or California tracks would be to build a warm-up track adjacent to Drake Stadium.\n\n\"We will try to be well-positioned for 2024,\" Drake Relays director Blake Boldon said.\n\nA rising profile\n\nWhile golf has a reputation for hushed dignity at many professional events, the match play tournament is ready to rock 'n' roll.\n\nFans are encouraged to wear American color schemes during the competition: red for Friday, white for Saturday and blue for Sunday.\n\nTwo concerts will be held in conjunction with the Solheim Cup: country music act Jake Owen will perform on Friday, and Rascal Flatts takes the stage Saturday. That will add an extra dimension to the entertainment offered at the Iowa State Fair.\n\n\"The live music scene is going to be rocking,\" said Jay Byers, CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership.\n\nIn a nod to the two events' shared spot on the calendar, there's even a Solheim Cup butter sculpture at the fair.\n\nSome visitors will attend both the fair and the Cup. Edwards said he received a request for State Fair tickets from a Scotland contingent who represent that nation's golf events.\n\nThere's a big TV audience at stake, too. NBC and the Golf Channel will air more than 30 hours of live coverage.\n\nThe economic impact of the Solheim Cup won't be tallied until after the event. But a few early signs hint at the scale: The combination of Solheim and State Fair crowds have gobbled up most of the Des Moines metro's 12,000 hotel rooms and eaten into the additional 2,000 to 3,000 in a central Iowa region that includes Ames.\n\nIn September, Airbnb lodging has 118 available properties to rent in the vicinity, but from Aug. 14-20, just 28 are listed.\n\nEdwards said his organization would have liked to have seen the Solheim arrive in a time period that didn't coincide with the State Fair, but the LPGA was firm on its dates.\n\nLocal leaders hope — just as with the NCAA Tournament in 2016 — that the metro area receives rave reviews from athletes and fans.\n\n\"It won't take long that the secret gets out,\" Garrett said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2024/03/14/march-madness-2024-dates-tv-schedule-locations-ncaa-womens-tournament-basketball-south-carolina-lsu/72957710007/", "title": "March Madness 2024: Dates, TV schedule, locations for NCAA ...", "text": "The 2023-24 women’s college basketball season has been a banner one for a sport that has watched its popularity skyrocket in recent years.\n\nOver the past four months, there has been no shortage of compelling storylines that have captivated fans nationally.\n\nMORE:Watch the 2024 NCAA Women's Tournament live with Fubo (free trial)\n\nSouth Carolina and coach Dawn Staley wrapped up their second-consecutive undefeated regular season and, in the weeks to come, they will look to bolster their reputation as the sport’s modern-day dynasty.

brackets\n\nWhen is the First Four?\n\nFor just the third year in its existence, the NCAA women's basketball tournament will feature a First Four after the field expanded from 64 teams to 68 for the 2022 tournament. Unlike the men's First Four, which is held every year at UD Arena in Dayton, Ohio, the women's First Four will take place at campus sites of the team hosting first-round games. Last season, for example, the First Four games were held in South Bend, Indiana (Notre Dame); Bloomington, Indiana; Columbus, Ohio; and Stanford, California.\n\nThe First Four will match up the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers against each other in two separate games while the same format will hold for the four lowest-seeded at-large teams. The winner of each game advances to the Round of 64, which will begin Friday, March 22.\n\nWednesday, March 20\n\nGame 1: (16) Presbyterian vs. (16) Scared Heart | 7 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo)\n\n(16) Presbyterian vs. (16) Scared Heart | 7 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo) Game 2: (12) Columbia vs. (12) Vanderbilt | 9 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo)\n\nThursday, March 21\n\nGame 3: (11) Arizona vs. (11) Auburn | 7 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo)\n\n(11) Arizona vs. (11) Auburn | 7 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo) Game 4: (16) UT Martin vs. (16) Holy Cross | 9 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo)\n\nWhen is the Final Four?\n\nThe 2024 Final Four will take place at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, the home arena of the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. The two national semifinal games will be played on Friday, April 5, followed by the national championship game on Sunday, April 7.\n\nIt's the second time the venue has hosted the women's Final Four. The previous instance came in 2007, when it was then known as Quicken Loans Arena. That year, Tennessee defeated Rutgers in the national championship game.\n\nFriday, April 5\n\nGame 65: TBD vs. TBD | 7 p.m. | ESPN (Fubo)\n\nTBD vs. TBD | 7 p.m. | ESPN (Fubo) Game 66: TBD vs. TBD | 9:30 p.m. | ESPN (Fubo)\n\nHow to watch March Madness games in 2024\n\nChannels: ABC | ESPN | ESPN2 | ESPNU | ESPNews\n\nABC | ESPN | ESPN2 | ESPNU | ESPNews Streamingn: NCAA March Madness Live app | Fubo (free trial)\n\nEvery game of the 2024 NCAA women's basketball tournament will air on ESPN's family of networks. Just like last season, each game will be broadcast on one of ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPNews.\n\nYou can also stream select NCAA Tournament games on Fubo (free trial for new users) and the NCAA March Madness Live app.\n\nWhere is March Madness 2024?\n\nThe NCAA women's tournament is formatted slightly differently from its male counterpart, in which every game is staged at a neutral site.\n\nThe First Four games are held at a campus site of one of the tournament's top 16 overall seeds. From there, the first- and second-round games will take place at the home arena of the highest-rated team in a given four-team pod. For example, South Carolina, as a certain No. 1 seed, will host a yet-to-be-determined No. 16 seed before, barring a seismic upset, playing against the winner of the No. 8 seed's matchup against the No. 9 seed, with all those games taking place at Colonial Life Arena in Columbia.\n\nOnce in the Sweet 16, neutral sites are introduced, though the women's tournament has just two regions, compared to four for the men's. This year, those Sweet 16 and Elite Eight games will be held in Albany, New York and Portland, Oregon. The Final Four and national championship will be hosted at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland.\n\nHere is a full breakdown of which sites and locations will be a part of the NCAA Tournament this year:\n\nFirst Four:\n\nNote: First Four games held at campus sites among top 16 seeds\n\nAlbany Regional 1: Colonial Life Arena (Columbia, S.C.)\n\nColonial Life Arena (Columbia, S.C.)

Wake Forest came to town earlier in the week feeling good about its tourney future and left with a loss. Can the Irish make it a sweep?\n\nNoie:When Markus Burton is good against the ACC, so too is Notre Dame men's basketball\n\nWhen does the game between Notre Dame and Clemson start? Is it on TV? Are tickets available?\n\n☘ WHO: Notre Dame (11-17 overall; 6-11 ACC, two-way tie for 11th place) vs. Clemson (20-8; 10-7, two-way tie for fourth)\n\n☘ WHERE: Purcell Pavilion (9,149)\n\n☘ WHEN: Saturday at 7:45 p.m. (note odd start time).\n\n☘ TV: The CW Network\n\n☘ RADIO: WSBT (960 AM).\n\n☘ TICKETS: Available.\n\n☘ ONLINE: Follow every Notre Dame game with live updates from Tribune beat writer Tom Noie at X (formerly Twitter) at twitter.com/tnoieNDI\n\nScouting the Clemson Tigers\n\nForward Ian Schieffelin had 15 points and 12 rebounds while fellow forward PJ Hall added 12 points and 10 rebounds in Tuesday’s 69-62 home win over Pittsburgh. In a game that featured five ties and 13 lead changes, Clemson trailed by four at the half, then scored 42 points in the final 20 minutes. The Tigers shot .560 percent from the field, .500 percent from 3 and .761 percent from the foul line. ... Clemson has won three straight and six of seven. ... The Tigers are 5-3 on the road in ACC play, have won three straight (at Georgia Tech, at Syracuse at North Carolina) and four of their last five. ... Clemson returned three starters off last year’s team that finished 23-11 overall, 14-6 and tied for third in the ACC. The Tigers did not make the NCAA tournament despite a school record for conference wins. ... Clemson was picked this preseason to finish fifth.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n9: The Tigers opened the year with nine straight wins for the first time since 2002-03. They won 11 of their first 12 to start.\n\n10: This season marks the first time in school history that Clemson (which joined the ACC in 1953-54) has won at least 10 ACC games for a second straight season.\n\n28: Four Tigers – Joseph Girard, Hall, Schieffelin and guard Chase Hunter – have each started all 28 games.\n\n1,561: Forward PJ Hall ranks 10th in school history with 1,561 points.\n\n2,094: Career points (and counting) for guard Joseph Girard, who spent his previous four seasons at Syracuse. Girard topped the 2,000-point mark in the February 10 win at ... Syracuse.\n\nWho's hot\n\nForward Ian Schieffelin is making a serious run at ACC most improved player. Averaging career highs for points (9.6), rebounds (9.4), assists (2.2) and minutes (26.4), Schieffelin is shooting .580 percent from the floor, .531 percent from 3 and .750 percent from the foul line, all also career highs. He has seven double-doubles for points and rebounds. His 17 rebounds earlier in the season were the most for a Tiger since Trevor Booker grabbed 17 in 2007. The junior from Loganville, Georgia became the first player in the nation this season and the second player in the ACC since 2013 with at least 16 points, 11 rebounds, five steals and four blocks in a game.\n\nWho's not\n\nAfter averaging 6.8 points and 1.8 rebounds while shooting .471 percent from 3 in 20 games with 12 starts last season, graduate student guard Alex Hemenway was expected to expand his role this season. He’s been limited to 5.2 points, 0.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists in five games this season because of a lingering lower leg injury. Tied for fifth in school history for 3-point percentage (.429), Hemenway also missed time last season with plantar fasciitis and an appendectomy. He has not played since Nov. 24.\n\nQuoting the Tigers\n\n“I think our older guys know what it’s like to finish in the top four. Your job as a coach is to get your guys ready for the next week, the next game. We talk about that every Sunday − here’s our week, here’s our plan, here’s where we are.”\n\n-Head coach Brad Brownell on pushing toward a possible top-four ACC finish\n\nSeries history\n\nNotre Dame leads 8-3, 4-1 at home and 8-3 as conference colleagues. Clemson won last year’s lone meeting, 87-64, at Littlejohn Coliseum after Notre Dame had won three straight and four of six. The Tigers’ win in South Bend (64-62) was March 6, 2019. This is the only regular-season meeting.\n\nScouting the Notre Dame Fighting Irish\n\nFreshman guard Markus Burton scored a career-high 31 points with three rebounds, three assists and four steals and fellow freshman Carey Booth added 15 points and five rebounds in a 70-65 victory Tuesday over Wake Forest. The Irish trailed for 24:44 but limited the Demon Deacons to 22 second-half points. The game featured two ties and nine lead changes. ... Notre Dame ranks second in the ACC and 30th nationally in scoring defense (65.6 ppg.) It has held 16 of 17 league opponents under its season scoring averages. .... Burton has scored double figures in 21 consecutive games and has scored at least 16 in eight straight. ... The Irish are 2-9 on Saturdays this season. Their last Saturday win was February 10 at home over Virginia Tech. ... Notre Dame is 8-8 overall and 4-5 in ACC play at home after going 11-8 and 3-7 last season.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n4: The Irish look to win a fourth-straight home game for the first time since five in a row in 2021-22. Notre Dame has not lost at Purcell Pavilion since Jan. 27 (Boston College).\n\n6: Rebounds grabbed in 13 minutes Tuesday by Irish senior Matt Zona, which set a season high and tied his career best.\n\n24: With 481 points, Burton is 24 points shy of moving past Blake Wesley and into fourth for most points by a freshman in program history. On Tuesday, Burton passed David Rivers (474).\n\n46: Average number of points Notre Dame has allowed in its last two first halves – 43 on Tuesday to Wake Forest after allowing its league season high of 49 at Syracuse.\n\n52: With a pair of 3-pointers against Wake Forest, freshman guard Braeden Shrewsberry holds the school record for 3-pointers made in a season in ACC play with 52.\n\nWho's hot\n\nWho else? Burton is still on a heater toward ACC rookie of the year. He leads all league newcomers in scoring (17.2 ppg.), steals (2.0) and minutes (33.5). He’s second in assists (4.2). He’s averaging 29.5 points over the last two games. Burton also turned it over only once against pressure in the Wake Forest game.\n\nWho's not\n\nAn arctic-like Notre Dame fan base. After averaging 7,283 fans in 2021-22, then 6,118 in 2022-23, Notre Dame ranks 13th in the 15-team ACC for average home attendance (6,020), ahead of only Boston College (5,357) and Georgia Tech (4,929). Notre Dame has played 36 straight home games since its last sellout. Since drawing a season-high 8,066 for the Duke game on Jan. 6, Notre Dame has not had at least 8,000 fans in any of its last six home games. The last two – Wake Forest and Georgia Tech – had fewer than 5,000 fans. Since the start of the 2021-22 season, Notre Dame has drawn 7,000 or fewer fans for 32 of its last 50 home games.\n\nQuoting the Irish\n\n“This point in time, there are a lot of teams that would’ve quit, a lot of teams with our record that have quit. These dudes are having fun. I love every day at practice. They’re having fun competing with each other and for each other. That’s the biggest thing. Nothing seems insurmountable to this group.”\n\nNotre Dame coach Micah Shrewsberry\n\nLooking ahead\n\nNotre Dame wraps the final week of the 2023-24 regular season with two ACC road games, starting Tuesday (7 p.m., ACC Network) at No. 9 North Carolina (21-6; 14-3, first place).\n\nFollow South Bend Tribune and NDInsider columnist Tom Noie on X (formerly Twitter): @tnoieNDI.

One location. Regional semifinals and finals. How quickly can we get this done?\n\nWomen’s basketball needs an influx of energy, juice or a mix of Red Bull and Mountain Dew to kick start the sport. The regional portion of the tournament is stagnant. Small crowds in big arenas with the exception of when Connecticut plays near its campus.\n\nAfter the selection committee ruined another bracket in March, Antonelli’s idea removes most of the controversy from the process.\n\nNFL DRAFT HUB: Latest NFL Draft mock drafts, news, live picks, grades and analysis.\n\nIt doesn’t protect the committee from putting California and its woeful 6-12 Pac-12 record into the field. It’s no longer relevant if South Carolina travels three time zones for the third time in the last four years as a No. 1 seed, despite a higher ranking on the committee’s S-curve.\n\nThe 16 teams, their fans and supporters are heading to the same city, the right spot to stage a college basketball tournament in the middle of March Madness.\n\nTake it another step. Play the Final Four in Las Vegas every year. In a 10-day span, you whittle the field from 16 to eight to four to one champion. Turn on the fountains at Mandalay Bay.\n\nOmaha has the College World Series. Oklahoma City hosts the Women’s College World Series. Why can’t Las Vegas become the home of women’s basketball?\n\nAntonelli’s plan has been tweaked, changed and improved over the last six years. Las Vegas Events, an event management company is on board. There's no shortage of locations. The T-Mobile Arena is open and will soon host an NHL expansion franchise. Orleans Arena seats nearly 10,000.\n\nThe NFL is headed to Vegas. The league voted 31-1 to allow the Oakland Raiders to move by the end of the decade.\n\n****\n\nIf it was this easy, we would already be in Las Vegas watching UConn win a fifth straight national title.\n\nThe NCAA is standing in the way. The organization doesn’t permit its championships in states where there is legalized gambling. Yes, that’s Nevada. This policy, which can be quickly changed by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors, is archaic and hypocritical.\n\nThe NCAA opposes all forms of legal and illegal sports wagering, which has the potential to undermine the integrity of sports contests and jeopardizes the welfare of student-athletes and the intercollegiate athletics community.\n\nThe Pac-12, Mountain West, Western Athletic and West Coast Conferences are playing a combined seven men's and women's postseason tournaments in Las Vegas. Championship Week is filled with games from the city. The NCAA has no control where conferences hold their championships, but it’s already happening. Why wait?\n\nIn December, 2015 NCAA President Mark Emmert said he attended conference tournaments in Las Vegas earlier that year.\n\n\"I think the membership is trying to figure out what's the right way to approach this issue again,\" Emmert said at the Intercollegiate Athlete Forum in New York 15 months ago. \"Where does the membership want to be in this space? How do you manage what often seems to be a hypocritical stance? Let's talk about it.\"\n\nDespite Emmert's desire to hold a conversation, he told reporters at the men's Final Four in Phoenix that Las Vegas will not eligible to host championships from 2019 through 2022.\n\nIn regards to women’s basketball, Antonelli’s idea touches on about everything that is wrong with the current format. Condense the four regionals into one location; rebrand, repackage the tournament and separate from the NCAA’s corporate sponsorship program, which is designed for one championship — men’s basketball.\n\nSell and market the women’s tournament on its own merits, but it only happens if new ideas are brought to the forefront.\n\n“We want to create new inventory, new synergies around the Sweet 16 to Vegas so we can have something we can actually sell,” Antonelli said. “It’s my instincts that nobody is even trying. It’s all bonus inventory on the networks, nothing that is being sold. No one is trying to sell it.”\n\nEmbrace what Las Vegas has to offer. Ride the knowledge of the city to create student-athlete and fan experiences beyond gaming. Las Vegas is a destination city. Stay for all the games or just a couple of days.\n\nThe consensus is the sport needs a fresh look.\n\n“I think it’s a great idea. Get everybody at one spot,” Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw said. “The problem isn’t the first and second rounds — it’s the regionals. They play in arenas that are way too big and we don’t get any kind of crowd. It’s embarrassing how small the crowds have been. They need to find a solution.\n\n“We need to do something different and that’s a really good thing we could do. Let’s try it.”\n\nNeed more evidence?\n\nAttendance at the regional round was its lowest in 20 years. The Associated Press reported attendance dropped 27 percent from last year and almost 50 percent from 2014. Even two sold-out sessions at Bridgeport, Connecticut — where UConn played — couldn’t prevent a substantial decline.\n\n****\n\nDanielle Donehew is the executive director of the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association.\n\nDonehew wants to be clear — the organization doesn’t make decisions regarding the sport’s championship format. Its role is to support the tournament in whatever form the NCAA decides.\n\nBut Donehew had the opportunity to travel to Las Vegas in December. She met with leaders from Las Vegas Events, the group looking to bring this idea to reality. She toured venues, hotels and discovered there’s plenty of space to hold the WBCA convention, which coincides with the Final Four. The leadership in Las Vegas impressed Donehew with their vision, passion, energy and enthusiasm to host the women’s basketball championship.\n\n“They want our sport,” she said.\n\nRECRUITING: Homestead's McLaughlin still considering Purdue women\n\nDonehew said the WBCA did offer a recommendation for consideration of Las Vegas as a possible location for a regional, potential super-regional or Final Four, if the NCAA alters its policy.\n\nUntil then, it’s a moot point.\n\n“From a WBCA perspective, we respect and abide by NCAA policies,” Donehew said. “That’s it. We’re in a time period where it’s exciting to have ideas talked out and considered and brought forward for consideration.”\n\n****\n\nJim Livengood, who is part of Las Vegas Events, called Antonelli’s plan a “game-changer” for the sport.\n\nLivengood was a Division I athletic director at Southern Illinois, Washington State, Arizona and UNLV for nearly three decades. He’s a former chair of the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament Selection Committee.\n\nHis experience and background allows Livengood to quickly identify what works and what doesn’t. The Sweet 16 to Vegas plan works.\n\nThe group is eager to bring the women’s basketball championship to the city. But time has run out for the upcoming bid cycle. Women's basketball - and other sports - are left on outside until the 2023-26 cycle.\n\nCan the sport wait nearly another decade to try a new format? No choice now.\n\nLivengood said there’s another obstacle. The NCAA and the four professional leagues sued New Jersey in 2012, attempting to stop the state’s plan to allow sports betting, saying it violates the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act. The NCAA is unlikely to budge on its Nevada stance until the lawsuit is settled.\n\nAlthough the NFL was part of the suit, it didn’t stop the league from allowing the Raiders to make the move to Las Vegas.\n\n“The key thing — the lawsuit has nothing to do with Nevada,” Livengood said. “It doesn’t make any sense.”\n\nLivengood and his group has worked the last two years and is ready when the NCAA finally moves forward.\n\n“It'a sad and tragic to lose out on this next cycle,” he said. “It’s not an if, but when the NCAA will open up Nevada for championships.”\n\n****\n\nWhen it happens — and it will — there will be a flood of sports eager to take advantage of what Vegas has to offer. The Mountain West Conference has a proposal to host a men's basketball regional, wrestling and men's ice hockey championships in Las Vegas. Changing the women's basketball format requires approval from the sport's Oversight Committee and the Selection Committee.\n\nHard to tell what the sport will look like in the next decade.\n\nInterest, at least from a participation level, is dwindling.\n\nBASKETBALL: Purdue women look ahead to next season\n\nBased on the five-year trends from the National Federation of State High School Associations, women’s basketball participation is down 1.5 percent from 2011-12 through 2015-16.\n\nVolleyball (plus 4.2 percent) and soccer (plus 2.8 percent) are trending in the right direction.\n\n“I think they’re kicking our butt,” Antonelli said. “We have to step up. They’re gaining on us. The little girls in our neighborhood aren’t dribbling a basketball. They’re playing volleyball and kicking the soccer ball.”\n\nAlthough the stakeholders of women’s basketball will tell you the sport has a promising future, it’s lagging behind. Yes, this weekend's Final Four in Dallas is sold out, a positive sign. Remember the regional attendance numbers? The NCAA surveyed schools over the summer and a majority supported keeping the tournament the same. So much for growth potential.\n\nPlaying the championships in Las Vegas won’t solve all the issues, but it will create a fresh and exciting approach.\n\nAntonelli’s Sweet 16 to Vegas idea is fantastic, but playing the final two rounds of the championship should be part of the master plan.\n\nTake South Carolina’s travel itinerary.\n\nAfter winning Monday’s regional in Stockton, California, the Gamecocks flew directly to Dallas, the site of the Final Four. The team left campus March 23 and might not return to Columbia until April 3. The timeline wouldn’t be any different if the Sweet 16 and Final Four were held in Las Vegas.\n\nWhat about missed class time?\n\n“Distant learning center,” she said. “That seems to be the growing trend. Partner with IBM and Intel to set it up. We need a room and computers. They can Skype into their classes.”\n\nGambling?\n\nThe sport hasn’t attracted the 18-35 year old male demographic, and likely won’t. Nothing may work. At least Antonelli is willing to try.\n\n“Let’s take our event to them,” she said. “The great male bastion of March is Vegas. And everybody knows it. It doesn’t make any sense to me to stick our head in the sand, ‘Oh, there’s gambling going on,’ ”\n\nShe has a counter to every question. She’s spent her own money to meet with the right people on both sides. She’s presented her plan in front of the coaches, who prefer neutral sites at the regional round. You don’t get more neutral than Las Vegas.\n\nAntonelli is waiting for the NCAA to make its move but it's not happening now. She has some background. Antonelli lives in South Carolina. The Confederate Flag eventually came down and now South Carolina is allowed to host championships.\n\n\"As soon as it opens for a vote, the men are going to jump all over it,\" she said. “If we sit around twiddling our thumbs and we don’t make a move and understand the relevance and value of what this could do for our game … we need a wow and a pop. We need some sizzle. This would do it.”\n\nYes it would.\n\nContact Journal & Courier sports reporter Mike Carmin at mcarmin@jconline.com.

One source said there were multiple planning calls between Trump campaign officials and GOP state operatives, and that Giuliani participated in at least one call. The source also said the Trump campaign lined up supporters to fill elector slots, secured meeting rooms in statehouses for the fake electors to meet on December 14, 2020, and circulated drafts of fake certificates that were ultimately sent to the National Archives.\n\nTrump and some of his top advisers publicly encouraged the “alternate electors” scheme in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Wisconsin, Nevada and New Mexico. But behind the scenes, Giuliani and Trump campaign officials actively choreographed the process, the sources said.\n\nOne fake elector from Michigan boasted at a recent event hosted by a local Republican organization that the Trump campaign directed the entire operation.\n\n“We fought to seat the electors. The Trump campaign asked us to do that,” Meshawn Maddock, co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party, said at a public event last week that was organized by the conservative group Stand Up Michigan, according to a recording obtained by CNN.\n\nListen to Meshawn Maddock describe the Trump campaign’s involvement in the fake elector plot at a recent speech in Michigan “[Matt Maddock] fought for investigations into every part of the election we could. He fought for a team of people to come and testify in front of the committee. We fought to seat the electors. Um, the Trump campaign asked us to do that – under a lot of scrutiny for that today. My husband has, he’s suffered for that a little bit in Lansing because it’s not very popular, but you know when you represent the whole state of Michigan and that’s what I see it now. I realize that even though you’re going to vote for somebody to be your next state representative, your next state senator, the truth is, this body of people, they represent all of us.\n\nMaddock was also one of the 16 Trump supporters from Michigan who served as fake electors and signed the illegitimate certificate that was sent to the National Archives.\n\n“It was Rudy and these misfit characters who started calling the shots,” a former Trump campaign staffer said. “The campaign was throwing enough sh*t at the wall to see what would stick.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Extraordinary rebuke of the former President': Toobin weighs in on SCOTUS decision 02:48 - Source: CNN\n\nIntegral to the Jan 6 plan\n\nThe scheme was integral to Trump’s plan to get then-Vice President Mike Pence to throw out Biden’s electors and replace them with the GOP electors on January 6 when Congress counted the electoral votes. It has also come under renewed scrutiny by the January 6 select committee and state attorneys general, raising questions about the involvement of Trump’s campaign and whether any laws were broken.\n\nCommittee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi told reporters Thursday the panel is looking into whether there was a broader conspiracy or involvement from the Trump White House in the creation or submission of these fake electors.\n\n“That’s a concern” Thompson said.\n\nIn its subpoena letter sent to Giuliani on Tuesday, the House committee specifically references his efforts to convince state legislatures to overturn election results. The document cites Giuliani’s comments from December 2020 in which he publicly urged lawmakers in Michigan to award the state’s electoral votes to Trump.\n\nOne of the pro-Trump electors from Pennsylvania, Sam DeMarco, told CNN there was a last-minute dispute, where the state’s GOP electors pushed Trump campaign officials to add legal caveats to the fake certificate to say they were only electors-in-waiting, if Trump’s legal challenges prevailed.\n\nThe fake documents from Pennsylvania and New Mexico ultimately contained these caveats, but the documents from the other five states explicitly claimed, falsely, that the pro-Trump electors were the rightful electors.\n\nIt’s not clear that any of the fake electors themselves participated in strategy sessions with top Trump campaign brass. But both Maddock from Michigan and DeMarco from Pennsylvania have said they were in direct contact with members of the Trump campaign.\n\nMany of the players involved in the scheme, including Maddock, stand by their actions and are still pushing the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Giuliani, a Trump spokesperson and a representative from Stand Up Michigan did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nAdvancing the lie that the election was stolen\n\nAfter Trump failed to stop battleground states from certifying Biden’s victory, Trump campaign officials, led by Giuliani, launched its parallel effort to disrupt and undermine the Electoral College process. This included publicly promoting false claims of fraud, while quietly exploring the fast-diminishing avenues to overturn the results.\n\nTrump hoped Republican legislators from the seven battleground states would replace Biden’s authentic electors with the rogue GOP slate, and that Pence would seat those electors during the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi preside over a Joint session of Congress to certify the 2020 Electoral College results after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol earlier in the day on January 6, 2021. J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE/AFP/POOL/Getty Images\n\nA source familiar with the situation told CNN that Pence was concerned about the possibility of “alternate electors,” and his team carefully worded what he said that day during the Electoral College certification to recognize only the legitimate electors.\n\nOne of the sources with direct knowledge of the scheme, a former Trump campaign staffer, told CNN that Giuliani worked closely on the seven-state stunt with Christina Bobb, a correspondent for the pro-Trump propaganda network One America News.\n\nMany of Giuliani’s unhinged conspiracies about the 2020 election found a home at OAN. And in a deposition last year as part of a civil lawsuit, Giuliani said Bobb was “very active in gathering evidence” as “part of the legal team” working for Trump’s campaign during the presidential transition.\n\nBobb reached out to a top Arizona legislator about supposed voter fraud, according to emails obtained by the government oversight group American Oversight through a public records request. In the December 4, 2020, email Bobb said she was sending the message on Giuliani’s behalf. The emails flesh out how Trump’s team was trying to press state legislatures to overturn the results.\n\nBobb didn’t respond to messages seeking comment about the pro-Trump electors.\n\n“They were all working together. Rudy, John Eastman, and Christina Bobb, in tandem, to create this coverage for OAN, to advance the Big Lie,” the former Trump campaign staffer told CNN.\n\nWhile mainstream news outlets covered the Electoral College proceedings, which cemented Biden’s position as President-elect, OAN focused on the rogue electors and voter fraud myths.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported new details about the role of Giuliani and Bobb.\n\nBattleground Michigan\n\nRepublicans in Michigan were central to the effort to try and overturn the election results and Meshawn Maddock – along with her husband State Rep. Matt Maddock – were instrumental to the effort inside the state.\n\nThe Maddocks have deep ties to Trump. The former president has endorsed Matt Maddock in his bid to be Michigan House leader. Maddock tweeted a photo last year of an article written about his campaign that Trump had signed, and added, “Matt, I am with you all the way.”\n\nIn the months leading up to January 6, Matt Maddock consistently pushed Trump’s lie about the election. In early December 2020, Matt Maddock and other state GOP lawmakers in Michigan held a series of hearings seeking to validate unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud – prompting a personal visit from Giuliani.\n\nWhen the effort to convince state legislators in Michigan to block Biden’s electors ultimately failed, Maddock was among the GOP lawmakers from five states who sent a letter to Pence on January 5, urging him to delay certification of the electoral votes. Pence refused to go along with the plan.\n\nMeshawn Maddock is equally close to Trump and is still peddling the lie that the election was stolen.\n\nAlong with being an elector, she also helped organize buses to take GOP activists to Washington for protests around January 6 and took part in the march to the US Capitol. She later disavowed the violence that came after the march.\n\nMaddock was named co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party one month after January 6. But as she is gaining prominence, her role as a fake elector is also attracting legal scrutiny.\n\nAttorney General of Michigan Dana Nessel, center, is escorted to the entrance of the Michigan State Capitol on December 14, 2020 in Lansing, Michigan, on the day electors would meet to certify the electoral college vote. Elaine Cromie/Getty Images\n\n“Under state law, I think clearly you have forgery of a public record, which is a 14-year offense, and election law forgery, which is a five-year offense,” Michigan Attorney general Dana Nessel, a Democrat, told MSNBC last week, about the fake certificates signed by pro-Trump electors.\n\n\n\nNo one, including Meshawn Maddock, has been charged with any crimes related to the scheme.\n\n“This is nothing more than political prosecution of convenience led by Dana Nessel,” said Gustavo Portela, MIGOP Communications Director, when asked about Maddock’s comments and role as a fake elector.\n\nHedged language in Pennsylvania\n\nThe documents from Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nevada explicitly stated, falsely, that the GOP electors were the rightful electors, representing 59 electoral votes.\n\nBut the documents from Pennsylvania and New Mexico contained clauses saying that the Trump supporters were electors-in-waiting, in case a court or some other proceeding later ruled that they were the “duly elected and qualified electors.”\n\nIf anything, this provided a veneer of legal protection for Trump supporters who were trying to exploit the Electoral College process to overturn an election.\n\nDemarco, who was one of the state’s pro-Trump electors, and is the chairman of the Allegheny County Republican Committee, told CNN he and other alternate electors signed the certificate at the Trump campaign’s request but first demanded the language be changed to make clear it was not intended to contest the will of voters in that state who voted for Biden.\n\nThe hedging language was included at the last moment as the Trump campaign had concerns, and questioned whether the change was appropriate in the immediate lead-up to December 14, according to a Trump campaign staffer with knowledge of the matter.\n\nUltimately the Trump campaign acquiesced. But the internal debate shows that even some of Trump’s strongest allies were concerned about the attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro speaks with people as he awaits a speech from U.S. President Joe Biden at Mack Truck Lehigh Valley Operations on July 28, 2021 in Macungie, Pennsylvania. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nThe office of Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said in a statement that they looked into the matter but concluded that the fake certificate was not an illegal forgery.\n\n“These ‘fake ballots’ included a conditional clause that they were only to be used if a court overturned the results in Pennsylvania, which did not happen,” the statement said. “Though their rhetoric and policy were intentionally misleading and purposefully damaging to our democracy, based on our initial review, our office does not believe this meets the legal standards for forgery.”\n\nConcerns about democracy\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, state officials, and Biden himself have roundly condemned the fake electors plot. Biden brought it up at a news conference Wednesday when asked about his stalled voting-rights bills in Congress.\n\n“I never thought we would get into a place where we were talking about… what they tried to do this last time out – Send different electors to the state legislative bodies to represent who won the election, saying that I didn’t win but the Republican candidate won,” Biden said. “I doubt that anyone thought that would happen in America in the 21st century, but it is happening.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden answers questions during a news conference in the East Room of the White House on January 19, 2022. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe coordinated nature of these fake elector efforts and the rising power of Big Lie-promoters in Republican circles has concerned voting rights organizations across the country.\n\nNancy Wang, executive director of the Michigan-based Voters Not Politicians, said her group was founded in 2016 to address redistricting and voting access, but Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election spurred her group to focus on countering anti-democratic efforts at large.\n\n“This is existential. This about the very fundamental institutions of our government - whether we can vote at all, whether we have any power whatsoever,” Wang said. “It is a completely different time that we are facing in 2020 and 2022. It really feels urgent. It is a battle of a completely different kind. It is massive, it is coordinated at a national level. It is much more threatening.”", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen Zachary Cohen Dan Merica", "Marshall Cohen", "Zachary Cohen", "Dan Merica"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/politics/surveillance-video-voting-machine-breach-coffee-county-georgia/index.html", "title": "Newly obtained surveillance video shows fake Trump elector ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Republican county official in Georgia escorted two operatives working with an attorney for former President Donald Trump into the county’s election offices on the same day a voting system there was breached, newly obtained video shows.\n\nThe breach is now under investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and is of interest to the Fulton County District Attorney, who is conducting a wider criminal probe of interference in the 2020 election.\n\nThe video sheds more light on how an effort spearheaded by lawyers and others around Trump to seek evidence of voter fraud was executed on the ground from Georgia to Michigan to Colorado, often with the assistance of sympathetic local officials.\n\nIn the surveillance video, which was obtained by CNN, Cathy Latham, a former GOP chairwoman of Coffee County who is under criminal investigation for posing as a fake elector in 2020, escorts a team of pro-Trump operatives to the county’s elections office on January 7, 2021, the same day a voting system there is known to have been breached.\n\nThe two men seen in the video with Latham, Scott Hall and Paul Maggio, have acknowledged that they successfully gained access to a voting machine in Coffee County at the behest of Trump lawyer Sidney Powell.\n\nText messages, emails and witness testimony filed as part of a long-running civil suit into the security of Georgia’s voting systems show Latham communicated directly with the then-Coffee County elections supervisor about getting access to the office, both before and after the breach. One text message, according to the court document, shows Latham coordinating the arrival and whereabouts of a team “led by Paul Maggio” that traveled to Coffee County at the direction of Powell.\n\nThree days after the breach, Latham texted the Coffee County elections supervisor, “Did you all finish with the scanner?” According to court documents, Latham testified she did not know what Hall was doing in Coffee County. But when confronted with her texts about the scanner, she asserted her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nMaggio did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Instead, the data firm he works for, SullivanStrickler, which court documents show was hired by Powell, said in a statement to CNN that it was “directed by attorneys to contact county election officials to obtain access to certain data” in Georgia and also “directed by attorneys to distribute that data to certain individuals.”\n\nIn an August 29, 2022, email, an attorney for SullivanStrickler acknowledges that Latham was the “primary point of contact” in coordinating the team’s visit to Coffee County.\n\nThe firm said it had no reason to believe these attorneys would ask or direct it to “do anything either improper or illegal.”\n\nHall, an Atlanta bail bondsman and Fulton County Republican poll watcher, did not reply to repeated requests for comment from CNN.\n\nConflicting answers\n\nThe newly obtained surveillance video and text messages in the civil lawsuit suggest the fake elector plot and the effort to breach voting machines in Georgia were part of a larger, coordinated plan to subvert the 2020 election. Some of the same Trump lawyers and allies who helped orchestrate the effort to seat fake electors in states Trump lost in 2020 were also involved in attempts to gain unauthorized access to voting machines in numerous counties in states around the country seen as friendly toward the former president.\n\n“The video reveals that Cathy Latham had a more significant role with the SullivanStrickler team’s work in Coffee County than she claimed,” said David Cross, an attorney representing election integrity groups suing Georgia over its voting systems and who has reviewed the video. “We can see her escort the team into the office that morning, for example. And she’s an important connection to the effort to create a slate of Georgia electors who would have wrongly voted for Trump for the 2020 election, which now looks to be the subject of a grand jury investigation in Fulton County.”\n\nAccording to court documents, Latham has provided conflicting answers during depositions when asked about her involvement in the breach and whether she was at the Coffee County elections office on the day it occurred. The video confirms she was there when it took place and literally held the door open for those who breached the voting systems. Previously, the Justice Department had warned elections officials not to allow outside access of this kind.\n\nLatham did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. A lawyer representing Latham did not dispute the facts of the story and said that Latham did not have the authority to “authorize anyone to do anything with the ballots.”\n\nThe lawyer said Latham did not “participate personally in anything that the elections board and/or its employee … may have decided to do under their own authority (or at least their perceived authority) with the ballots.”\n\n“So, regardless of whether she correctly remembers the details of what time she spent there on January 7, it doesn’t change the fact that she had no authority to do any of this and was not personally involved in whatever was done,” the lawyer added.\n\nA second lawyer representing Latham, Bob Cheeley, told CNN, “Cathy Latham has dedicated significant time and effort over many years protecting the integrity of elections in Coffee County, Georgia. She would not and has not knowingly been involved in any impropriety in any election.”\n\n“Latham did not authorize or participate in any ballot scanning efforts, computer imaging, or any similar activity in Coffee County in January 2021.”\n\nOperatives connected to Trump’s campaign and legal team worked with local GOP officials to gain access to voting systems in counties across several states following the 2020 election, including Coffee County. The goal was to produce evidence to back up Trump’s baseless claims and ultimately upend Joe Biden’s victory – even after it was certified on January 6.\n\nAmong them was Cyber Ninjas CEO Doug Logan, who oversaw the partisan election audit in Maricopa County, Arizona, and was recently named by the Michigan attorney general as a target in the state-level criminal investigation into unauthorized voting machine breaches in that state.\n\nThe newly obtained surveillance video shows Logan also visited the Coffee County elections office more than once in January 2021, roughly two weeks after the breach took place. CNN has reached out to attorneys for Logan.\n\nSeparately, federal investigators have issued subpoenas seeking information about Latham’s communication with Rudy Giuliani and other members of Trump’s legal team as part of a DOJ probe, sources said.\n\nOn December 30, 2020, eight days before the January 7 voting machine breach, Latham testified along with Giuliani before Georgia state lawmakers about supposed voter machine irregularities in Coffee County.\n\nAt the time, Latham and the Giuliani legal team were represented by the same attorney, according to the minutes from that hearing. When asked during a recent deposition in the Georgia civil case whether she knew or ever had any communication with Giuliani, Latham asserted her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nLatham is a target of two criminal investigations into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, one by the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office, and a parallel probe by the Justice Department, according to multiple sources and documents obtained by CNN. Both of those investigations are looking specifically at the fake electors plot. State investigators in Georgia are also examining the Coffee County voting machine breach.\n\nTrump allies target rural GOP stronghold in Georgia\n\nIn the weeks after the election, Coffee County quickly emerged as a central part of the Trump team’s push to overturn the election. The reliably Republican stronghold of about 43,000 residents was the only county in Georgia that refused to certify its results after the election, even though Trump won nearly 70% of the vote.\n\nTrump and his lawyers had an ally in Latham, who was open to helping push their claims of fraud and was a leading voice among those raising concerns about the Dominion voting systems used in Coffee County.\n\nIt was one of two counties referenced in draft executive orders that, if signed by Trump, would have ordered the military or Department of Homeland Security to seize voting machines across the country. They would have also installed a special counsel with the power to investigate voter fraud.\n\nWhile those documents were never signed, the draft orders were presented to Trump during a now-infamous Oval Office meeting on December 18, 2020, which was attended by election deniers, including Powell and Michael Flynn, according to previous CNN reporting and testimony before the House Select Committee investigating January 6.\n\nIn the weeks after that meeting, gaining access to voting machines became a top priority for Trump allies seeking to overturn the election, as those closest to the former President thought it was the only way to actually prove there was widespread fraud, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nTrump’s inner circle was warned by several Republican lawmakers that without evidence of fraud, their plan to subvert the Electoral College would almost certainly fail, text messages obtained by the House Select Committee investigating the US Capitol attack show.\n\nPowell was among those who took the lead in the hunt for evidence of voter fraud, turning her attention to Coffee County in the days before January 6, emails produced as part of the civil suit and obtained by CNN show. Like Latham, Powell was in direct contact with members of the team that travelled to Coffee County and Powell appears to have hired them for the task, the emails show.\n\nAccording to the civil lawsuit, members of the team included Hall, the Atlanta bail bondsman who is seen on the surveillance footage being escorted into the Coffee County elections office by Latham.\n\nIn an audio recording obtained by CNN, Hall claims that he “chartered the jet to go down to Coffee County to have them inspect all of those computers.”\n\n“I went down there, we scanned every freaking ballot,” Hall says in the recording. Hall also suggests that the same group of people who orchestrated the breach in Coffee County also gained access to voting machines in Antrim County, Michigan weeks before.\n\n“The same people that went up to Michigan, OK, and did all that forensic stuff on the computers. And they sent their team down to Coffee County, Georgia, and they scanned all the equipment, imaged all the hard drives, and scanned every single ballot,” Hall says in the recording.\n\nMaggio was among those who was involved in both efforts, according to previously reported documents related to the inspection of voting systems in Antrim County and his own testimony in a civil court case related to the Coffee County breach.\n\nHall also claims that he and the team of individuals who traveled to Coffee County had permission from local elections officials to access the voting systems.\n\nEvidence of a coordinated plot\n\nIt’s unclear if federal authorities are investigating whether attempts to gain access to voting machines after the 2020 election were part of a coordinated, multi-state effort carried out by Trump allies. But state investigators in Georgia are examining the possibility of a broader plot.\n\nAnd investigators in Colorado and Michigan are sharing evidence they have collected about unauthorized breaches in those states with the FBI, according to multiple sources familiar with those investigations.\n\nEarlier this year, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson shared information with members of the House Select Committee, as well as Attorney General Merrick Garland, to assist in the investigation of whether pro-Trump operatives gained access to voting machines in Antrim County as part of a coordinated plot overseen by the former President’s legal team.\n\nSince then, evidence has emerged linking several people who gained access to voting systems in Antrim County to the breach in Coffee County – including Powell and Maggio.\n\nIn a recent court filing, Phil Waldron, a retired Army colonel who was deeply involved in efforts to overturn the election, claimed that a federal grand jury has been empaneled and that a team of federal prosecutors and FBI agents are “conducting a sweeping criminal investigation into those, among others, who have ‘worked in the cybersecurity space on election- and voting-related issues.”’\n\nThe filing came as part of Waldron’s months-long court fight with the House Select Committee investigating January 6, which has subpoenaed Waldron’s phone records. Waldron has argued that if the House Committee gets his phone records, they could end up in the hands of federal prosecutors that he says are also investigating efforts to obtain election data by seizing and tampering with voting machines.\n\nCNN previously reported that Waldron was part of the team that reviewed election data obtained from Antrim County, helped craft the draft executive orders for seizing voting machines and coordinated efforts to access voting systems in several states to bolster Trump’s claims about widespread election fraud.\n\nHe also testified during a December 2020 hearing on election fraud held by state lawmakers in Georgia and was introduced by Giuliani.\n\nA source familiar with Trump’s legal defense strategy expressed concern about the prospect of federal prosecutors targeting cyber investigators like Waldron, because they may attempt to flip them in order to bolster their potential case against the former President.\n\nOn August 25, Waldron and Powell were ordered to testify as part of the Fulton County District Attorney’s probe.\n\nIn a court filling, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis specifically notes that Powell can likely provide information about the breach in Coffee County as well as similar efforts in Michigan and Nevada related to voting machines.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Jason Morris", "Zachary Cohen", "Jason Morris"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/04/2020-election-deniers-on-the-ballot-in-michigan-in-their-words/65468417007/", "title": "2020 election denial is on the ballot in Michigan this year.

Knocked on doors in the projects at all hours looking for witnesses, followed a story subject into a crack house in the Bronx where guns were drawn, and in just the past couple of years took two reporting trips to South Sudan, the country where the most humanitarian workers are being killed in a very stupid war, not that there are any smart ones.\n\nSo does it bother me that I'm suddenly seen as a house cat by some of my friends because I'm taking no chances with this coronavirus pandemic? Of course it does. And after someone dear to me recently suggested that I'm choosing fear over love because I'm still not going out right now, I realized that we are definitely not “all in this together.” On the contrary, we are divided in some new ways by this virus.\n\nTensions of the pandemic\n\nA lot has been written about the political split in our reactions to the deaths, the masks and even hydroxychloroquine. And, yes, my friend who thinks I should just have faith that God will decide who dies is a political conservative.\n\nBut I’m a COVID-19 conservative, and we are from all over the political map, boomers and Generation Z, black and white, highly educated and not. (You think those oblivious partiers in the Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, over Memorial Day were all young and foolish? No, some were old, foolish and own their own boats.) We are not rich and poor, though, because the ability to stay home is a luxury many can’t afford.\n\nA friend from my hometown in Illinois says he hasn’t felt this much peer pressure to relax since high school. And among those who want him to loosen up is his adult daughter, who keeps asking when the grandkids can visit. \"Wanna smoke?\" was nothing next to that.\n\nMy liberal neighbor has also been annoyed with my caution, though she’s not exactly in the Lake of the Ozarks mode herself. “Be brave!” she urged, by which she meant that surely we could take a little bike ride together. Another so-left-she’s-right friend used the word “wimp” because I’m waiting for a vaccine, and she doesn’t believe in it.\n\nSafety first:With coronavirus still rocking, reopening states are rolling blindly\n\nEven my husband isn't quite where I am. He won't wear the snappy COVID-19 shield I bought him and has registered some surprise that I've turned out to be the kind of person who would have made an excellent air warden during World War II.\n\nI want to live to choose my next risks\n\nThese tensions between friends and loved ones are really only beginning, too, and with lives other than our own at stake, respecting one another’s choices seems like a fantasy. No judgments, my friend keeps saying, the one who thinks God wants us to walk through the world unmasked. But of course she was judging me. And I was judging her right back, even if I also get that in her rural area with almost no cases, the risk-and-reward calculus is different than where I live in Kansas City, where COVID-19 cases have been spiking.\n\nI want to live to decide what risks to take, though on my next trip to South Sudan I will break out the hand sanitizer I brought with me last time and didn’t touch.\n\nCoronavirus lockdown:I was in the stay-home-until-it's-safe camp. But I just can't take it anymore.\n\nBut I also have learned something from my previously COVID-careful 24-year-old son, who texted me to say he was going to join a protest against police brutality after the killing of George Floyd. At first, I was furious, because he has had pulmonary problems all his life and really can’t get this virus. That is a risk, he said, but this is important.\n\nAnd like everybody else, he also gets to decide what risks are worth it. Because how can I argue with a straight face that standing up against institutional racism is a less valid reason than filing an earthquake story nobody remembers, myself included?\n\nMelinda Henneberger is an editorial writer and columnist for The Kansas City Star and a member of the USA TODAY Board of Contributors.

Notice that wonderful is in quotes, because I’m not talking about Christmas this time, but tax season! Monday, April 15th is the day allocated by the IRS for filing our taxes. And I don’t know about you, but I sort of dread this day every year. It looms large and hovers over me like a dark cloud. Okay, that is a slight exaggeration! However, I don’t like thinking about it and typically am guilty of procrastinating till the very last minute, or—worse yet—filing an extension. Truthfully, the latter scenario is generally more accurate in my case.\n\nI suppose we could say that in any society taxes are a necessary evil. After all, who would pay for the politicians’ big salaries, fantastic perks and amazing benefits if we didn’t (tongue in cheek!). Irrespective of my sarcastic tone, taxes are necessary for a state and/or nation to remain viable. We have countless needs that require significant funding: public education, social services, governmental leadership, law enforcement and justice system, healthcare and medical services, retirement and social security, national security, power-grid maintenance, city and state infrastructure including roads, bridges, and water supply and sewage system, trash disposal, etc. All of these items are essential for our functioning in a modern society.\n\nHowever, let’s be honest – none of us enjoys handing over a large chunk of our hard-earned dollars to Uncle Sam. We often feel that “he” takes advantage of us and that we are expected to give “him” more than our fair share, definitely more than “he” deserves. Right? On the other side, though, I think I can safely say we all enjoy the creature comforts and conveniences of living in a prosperous and secure nation that holds promise for fulfilling “the American Dream.” Why would so many illegal immigrants be trying to cross over our borders otherwise?\n\nTaxes have been around forever. Most ancient civilizations were built and expanded primarily by means of taxing the citizens to supply the funding and resources necessary to provide for growth and protection. In ancient Israel, during his peaceful reign, Solomon imposed heavy taxes and forced labor upon the people to facilitate his massive, ambitious building projects (see 1 Kings 9-10, 12). In fact, “Following his death, the ten northern tribes appealed for relief from the heavy tax burden, but Rehoboam refused. The Israelites returned home in rebellious anger. Rehoboam sent the head of that day's Internal Revenue Service to either collect some overdue revenues or negotiate. The Israelites assassinated him” (quote from John W. Ritenbaugh, Forerunner Commentary, https://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Topical.show/RTD/cgg/ID/12650/Solomons-Taxation.htm).\n\nSo, we can clearly see that taxation of the people by those in power has been a sore spot and source of great contention for a long time. This tension and conflict was also very much alive in Jesus’ day, during an era of oppressive Roman rule. For the Jews, the question of the sheer morality and religious-theological appropriateness of paying taxes to a pagan Caesar was a big debate.\n\nMatthew 22:15-22 (ESV) provides us with Jesus’ divine perspective on the matter as follows:\n\nThen the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his words. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? Show me the coin for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” They said, “Caesar's.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away.”\n\nEvidently, his inquisitors were in no way expecting the reply Jesus gave to them. The Lord promoted good, legally responsible citizenship. He expected those who would be members of His kingdom to comply with the laws of the land and not evade taxes imposed by the ruling governmental authorities. They were commanded by Christ to give to “Caesar” (or to the local, state and federal government) what is due, whether considered fair or not. When it comes to our money, “In God We [Must] Trust!”\n\nThe apostle Paul further clarifies this concept for us in Romans 13:5-7 (ESV), when he asserts, “5 Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience. 6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. 7 Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.”\n\nThere we have it very clearly spelled out for us, no matter how much we try as believers (and sometimes disgruntle citizens) to rationalize our own position and behavior related to the issue. It all comes down to this: God has put the government in place for our own benefit (albeit an imperfect system of rulership). Therefore, when it comes to taxes, God expects us to pay up. Therefore, let’s do our very best to set the right type of Christian example by being good and law-abiding citizens!\n\nDr. Ryan Fraser is an associate professor of clinical mental health counseling at Freed-Hardeman University.

The latest milestone arrived this week as developers celebrated the \"topping out\" of the final phase of construction at the M Station project in the downtown area.\n\nA lynchpin of Morristown's ongoing redevelopment plan − which brought a new Valley National Bank headquarters to town last year − M Station consists of two buildings on Morris Street, about a block from the Morristown Green and near the New Jersey Transit station.\n\nProfessional services company Deloitte currently occupies the 6-story M Station East, which was completed in July 2022. The accounting firm brought almost 1,500 employees from its previous location in Parsippany. Pharma giant Sanofi, meanwhile, has signed a lease to occupy the seven-story M Station West and move 1,900 employees from its Bridgewater offices when construction is completed in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nOn Thursday, M Station builder SJP Properties, in partnership with Scotto Properties, announced the \"topping out\" of M Station West, referring to the completion of the building's steel infrastructure\n\n\"The topping out of M Station West is a landmark moment in redefining the modern workplace across New Jersey,” said Steve Pozycki, CEO of Parsippany-based SJP. “State-of-the-art, vertically integrated buildings are attracting the most influential corporations in the world. Sanofi joins Deloitte and Valley Bank, which celebrated its grand opening at our new Speedwell Avenue property this fall.\"\n\nSanofi moved \"from a sprawling, multi-building suburban campus,\" the announcement said. Valley National Bank, meanwhile, traded in its longtime home in Wayne for a building near the Morristown Green that features retail shops on the ground level, with the bank's 660 employees occupying the five floors above.\n\n\"These tenants are turning to SJP for property solutions in amenity-rich locations with unrivaled aesthetics and the most advanced infrastructures ever built in the state,” said Pozycki.\n\nParsippany's $1.2M view:Drone video shows big development with luxury villas taking shape\n\nWhen completed, the M Station complex will include a 1,000-car parking structure with EV stations, a landscaped rooftop with wellness areas for yoga and outdoor movement classes and ground-floor retail and dining, according to the developers.\n\nBoth M Station buildings are set back 45 feet from Morris Street, creating a 10,000-square-foot landscaped promenade and two public plazas with seating.\n\nThe project is a piece of the town's redevelopment master plan. Town officials said that once completed, the area should generate about $1 million in annual tax revenue, about 4½ times more than what the owners currently pay. The new complex replaced the Midtown Shopping Center, displacing businesses such as Burger King, Cluck-U-Chicken and the Morris Pizzeria. Cluck-U-Chicken has since relocated to South Street.\n\nAs part of the M Station plan, Morristown also constructed a roundabout to improve traffic flow at the intersection of Morris and Spring streets between M Station and the Morristown Green. Redevelopment area bonds were issued to cover the $3.5 million cost, Morristown Administrator Jillian Barrick said in 2022, when construction began.\n\n\"I am thrilled to welcome Sanofi to its new headquarters in Morristown,\" Morristown Mayor Tim Dougherty said in Wednesday's announcement. \"SJP and Scotto Properties have successfully executed our vision of a project, which would invigorate our business district, attract leading-edge companies and reinforce our position as one of the top towns in the country to live and work.”\n\nWilliam Westhoven is a local reporter for DailyRecord.com.

Onto this week's mail.\n\nRichard Berg: Why did you come back? You have had not one good, positive article on Republican politicians.\n\nI realize there is a segment of IndyStar's conservative-leaning audience looking to have their views reflected back to them, and I'll admit I'm not the person to do it on a consistent basis. That's why I've said I'm working to add conservative perspectives.\n\nThat said, I'm also not the person to articulate leftist views, which is why I've solicited and published thoughts from that end of the spectrum.\n\nI approach this job as a lonely centrist who thinks Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and Democratic Mayor Joe Hogsett are generally doing good jobs. I have plenty of nice things to say about Republicans: I think Todd Young is an effective senator and Sue Finkam deserved to win last year's Carmel mayoral race in spite of some ridiculous attacks.\n\nIt's true, though, that I go harder on Republicans and there are a few reasons for that:\n\nDonald Trump is a menace who has left the Republican Party hollowed out and rotten. I respect and admire many individual Republicans, but the party collectively has handed itself over to irresponsible actors on the national level, which increasingly bleeds down to the state and local levels.\n\nI prefer cities to small towns. The Republican Party is increasingly hostile to people who share my perspective even as local mayors, including Greg Ballard and Jim Brainard, have shown how Republicans could be popular while pursuing urban agendas. The current version of the Republican Party doesn't seem interested.\n\nRepublicans hold the vast majority of power in Indiana. Even in Indianapolis, which is controlled by Democrats, Republican lawmakers dictate the terms of local governance. Because Republicans matter so much more than Democrats here, and because there are far more Republican officeholders to cover, they attract criticism proportional to their weight on the partisan scale.\n\nBack when I lived in Baltimore, I wrote more critically of Maryland Democrats, who often acted entitled to power regardless of how ineffective they were. If I were doing the job I have now in Baltimore, I might be viewed as center-right. Here in Indianapolis, I'm generally (but not always) regarded as center-left.\n\nChris Kijovsky: How long does it normally take someone (Jefferson Shreve) to realize no one wants him around?\n\nSpeaking of Republicans, I think this question is a follow-up to last week's mailbag when I talked about Shreve's failed attacks on Hogsett's crime record in the mayoral race.\n\nI'm perplexed by Shreve's mayoral campaign, as well as his pivot to run for Congress in the 6th District. I found Shreve to be an engaged and thoughtful member of the City-County Council. I talked to him quite a few times and always valued his insights on a wide range of matters.\n\nNow, Shreve seems to badly want to get elected to something — enough so that he's willing to let consultants create and recreate new versions of him in a lab and present it to the public. The only time in the mayoral campaign when Shreve seemed real to me was when he talked about improving the city's animal care services, a topic he obviously cared about.\n\nI don't pretend to know Shreve well, but I think his humanity is getting lost each time he runs for office. He might be more appealing if he could tap into it.\n\nDowntown Indianapolis: What readers had to say\n\nHere are some more reactions to my argument that suburbanites fear downtown based on misperceptions fostered by media and political campaigns.\n\nColin Meyer: My wife and I live in Madison. Last September we visited downtown Indianapolis to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. We stayed at the JW Marriott and had dinner reservations at the St. Elmo Steak House, about six blocks away. We walked from the hotel to the restaurant through the indoor skywalks, walkways, and parking garage between them. On this short walk, we encountered two homeless people sleeping on the floor. One of them was in a stairwell and we had to step over his legs to get by. There was also an aggressive panhandler sitting on the sidewalk in front of St. Elmo’s.\n\nOn the return trip, it was dark and we opted to use the outdoor sidewalks. We nonetheless walked past two passive panhandlers lying on the sidewalk before reaching the hotel.\n\nNow, we were not mugged nor assaulted but I think you can imagine that two 75-year-olds, at night, were certainly creeped out. We would return to downtown Indy for a football game or a basketball game with a lot of people attending but we won’t be making any more trips without a crowd around.\n\nBoone County is safer\n\nThomas Morris: I lived in Marion County for over a decade and now have been in Boone County over a decade. We had zero murders in Boone County last year. ZERO. Look that up. Marion County and Indianapolis has one of the highest murder rates in the country for big cities.\n\nI love downtown and come downtown regularly. I was just there for some of the NBA All-Star Game events and my wife and I had dinner with friends downtown this weekend. But the fact that people in Boone County (or other donut counties) might not want to head to Marion County for an evening out is not based on faulty logic. It is objectively and statistically much more dangerous.\n\n2020 unrest, boarded-up buildings\n\nBill Bloss: The first reason for why folks may have a fear of downtown is Jefferson Shreve ads? C'mon. At best, such ads only reinforce a perception someone already had. I find it highly unlikely those ads were the reason for the perception.\n\nThe unrest of 2020 and the media coverage of closed and boarded-up buildings played a huge role in the perception of downtown based on the people I know. Throw in the escalating murder rate at the time and the homelessness, and many believe they can find entertainment elsewhere.\n\nI realize you mentioned those items, but to lead with a political angle (Shreve) undercut the points you were trying to make.\n\nThat's all for this week!

It has been updated to reflect the current status of the legislation.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law a $1.7 trillion yearlong federal government spending package on Thursday, after the House and Senate passed it last week.\n\nThe legislation includes $772.5 billion for nondefense discretionary programs and $858 billion in defense funding. That represents an increase in spending in both areas for fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe sweeping package includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies, an overhaul of the electoral vote-counting law, protections for pregnant workers, an enhancement to retirement savings rules and a TikTok ban on federal devices.\n\nIt also provides a boost in spending for disaster aid, college access, child care, mental health and food assistance, more support for the military and veterans and additional funds for the US Capitol Police. And the legislation contains several major Medicaid provisions, particularly one that could disenroll up to 19 million people from the nation’s health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nHowever, the law, which runs more than 4,000 pages, left out several measures that some lawmakers had fought to include. An expansion of the child tax credit, as well as multiple other corporate and individual tax breaks, did not make it into the final bill. Neither did legislation to allow cannabis companies to bank their cash reserves – known as the Safe Banking Act – or a bill to help Afghan evacuees in the US gain lawful permanent residency. And the spending package did not include a White House request for roughly $10 billion in additional funding for Covid-19 response.\n\nThe spending law, which will keep the government operating through September, the end of the fiscal year, is the product of lengthy negotiations between top congressional Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCongress originally passed a continuing resolution on September 30 to temporarily fund the government in fiscal year 2023, which began October 1.\n\nHere’s what’s in the law:\n\nMore aid for Ukraine: The spending law provides roughly $45 billion to help support Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself against Russia’s attack.\n\nAbout $9 billion of the funding will go to Ukraine’s military to pay for a variety of things including training, weapons, logistics support and salaries. Nearly $12 billion will be used to replenish US stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority.\n\nAlso, the law provides $13 billion for economic support to the Ukrainian government. Other funds address humanitarian and infrastructure needs, as well as support European Command operations.\n\nEmergency disaster assistance: The law provides more than $38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans in the west and southeast affected by recent natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. It will aid farmers, provide economic development assistance for communities, repair and reconstruct federal facilities and direct money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, among other initiatives.\n\nOverhaul of the electoral vote-counting law: A provision in the legislation aims at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, the first legislative response to the US Capitol insurrection and then-President Donald Trump’s campaign to stay in power despite his loss in 2020.\n\nThe changes overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which Trump tried to use to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe legislation clarifies the vice president’s role while overseeing the certification of the electoral result to be completely ceremonial. It also creates a set of stipulations designed to make it harder for there to be any confusion over the accurate slate of electors from each state.\n\nFunding for January 6 attack prosecutions: The law provides $2.6 billion for US Attorneys, which includes funding efforts “to further support prosecutions related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol and domestic terrorism cases,” according to a fact sheet from the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe package also gives $11.3 billion to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including for efforts to investigate extremist violence and domestic terrorism.\n\nThe funding measures are part of nearly $39 billion for the Justice Department.\n\nRetirement savings enhancements: The law contains new retirement rules that could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings – and less costly to withdraw them. Among other things, the provisions will allow penalty-free withdrawals for some emergency expenses, let employers offer matching retirement contributions for a worker’s student loan payments and increase how much older workers may save in employer retirement plans.\n\nTikTok ban from federal devices: The legislation bans TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, from federal government devices.\n\nSome lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok – or its parent, ByteDance – to hand over the personal data of its US users. Recently, a wave of states led by Republican governors have introduced state-level restrictions on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices.\n\nProtections for pregnant workers: The law provides pregnant workers with workplace accommodations – such as additional bathroom breaks, stools or relief from heavy lifting duties – needed for healthy pregnancies. It will prevent them from being forced to take leave or losing their jobs, as well as bar employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions. Also, another provision in the package guarantees workplace accommodations – particularly time to pump – for more nursing workers.\n\nChanges to Medicaid and other health care programs: The law phases out the requirement that prevented states from disenrolling Medicaid recipients as long as the national public health emergency was in effect in exchange for an enhanced federal match. This continuous coverage measure was enacted as part of a Covid-19 relief package passed in March 2020 and has led to a record 90 million Medicaid enrollees, many of whom may no longer meet the income requirements to qualify.\n\nUnder the law, states will be able to start evaluating Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility and terminating their coverage as of April 1. The redetermination process will take place over at least 12 months. Also, the enhanced federal Medicaid funding will phase down through December 31, 2023, though the states will have to meet certain conditions during that period.\n\nUp to 19 million people could lose their Medicaid benefits, according to estimates, though many would be eligible for other coverage.\n\nAlso, under a provision in the law, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, will offer 12 months of continuous coverage for children. This will allow the 40 million children on Medicaid and CHIP to have uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year.\n\nIn addition, the law makes permanent the option for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage for low-income mothers through Medicaid, rather than just 60 days. More than two dozen states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the measure, which was available on a temporary basis through the American Rescue Plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another seven states are planning to implement the option.\n\nPlus, the package provides more money for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The funds are intended to speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive measures, beef up public health activities and strengthen the nation’s biosecurity by accelerating development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats and fortifying stockpiles and supply chains for drugs, masks and other supplies.\n\nIncreased support for the military and veterans: The package funds a 4.6% pay raise for troops and a 22.4% increase in support for Veteran Administration medical care, which provides health services for 7.3 million veterans.\n\nIt includes nearly $53 billion to address higher inflation and $2.7 billion – a 25% increase – to support critical services and housing assistance for veterans and their families.\n\nThe law also allocates $5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, which provides additional funding to implement the landmark PACT Act that expands eligibility for health care services and benefits to veterans with conditions related to toxic exposure during their service.\n\nBeefing up nutrition assistance: The legislation establishes a permanent nationwide Summer EBT program, starting in the summer of 2024, according to Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger advocacy group. It will provide families whose children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals with a $40 grocery benefit per child per month, indexed to inflation.\n\nIt also changes the rules governing summer meals programs in rural areas. Children will be able to take home or receive delivery of up to 10 days’ worth of meals, rather than have to consume the food at a specific site and time.\n\nThe law also helps families who have had their food stamp benefits stolen since October 1 through what’s known as “SNAP skimming.” It provides them with retroactive federal reimbursement of the funds, which criminals steal by attaching devices to point-of-sale machines or PIN pads to get card numbers and other information from electronic benefits transfer cards.\n\nHigher maximum Pell grant awards: The law increases the maximum Pell grant award by $500 to $7,395 for the coming school year. This marks the largest boost since the 2009-2010 school year. About 7 million students, many from lower-income families, receive Pell grants every year to help them afford college.\n\nHelp to pay utility bills: The package provides $5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Combined with the $1 billion contained in the earlier continuing resolution, this is the largest regular appropriation for the program, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Home heating and cooling costs – and the applications for federal aid in paying the bills – have soared this year.\n\nAdditional funding for the US Capitol Police: The law provides an additional $132 million for the Capitol Police for a total of nearly $735 million. It will allow the department to hire up to 137 sworn officers and 123 support and civilian personnel, bringing the force to a projected level of 2,126 sworn officers and 567 civilians.\n\nIt also gives $2 million to provide off-campus security for lawmakers in response to evolving and growing threats.\n\nMore money for child care: The legislation provides $8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a 30% increase in funding. The grant gives financial assistance to low-income families to afford child care.\n\nAlso, Head Start will receive nearly $12 billion, an 8.6% boost. The program helps young children from low-income families prepare for school.\n\nMore resources for children’s mental health and for substance abuse: The law provides more funds to increase access to mental health services for children and schools. It also will invest more money to address the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder.\n\nInvestments in homelessness prevention and affordable housing: The legislation provides $3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants, a 13% increase. It will serve more than 1 million people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe package also funnels nearly $6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program and related local economic and community development projects that benefit low- and moderate income areas and people, an increase of almost $1.6 billion.\n\nPlus, it provides $1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which will lead to the construction of nearly 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units and maintain the record investment from the last fiscal year.\n\nMore support for the environment: The package provides an additional $576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency, bringing its funding up to $10.1 billion. It increases support for enforcement and compliance, as well as clean air, water and toxic chemical programs, after years of flat funding.\n\nIt also boosts funding for the National Park Service by 6.4%, restoring 500 of the 3,000 staff positions lost over the past decade. This is intended to help the agency handle substantial increases in visitation.\n\nPlus, the legislation provides an additional 14% in funding for wildland firefighting.\n\nWhat’s not in the law\n\nEnhanced child tax credit: A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates pushed hard to extend at least one provision of the enhanced child tax credit, which was in effect last year thanks to the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Their priority was to make the credit more refundable so more of the lowest-income families can qualify. Nearly 19 million kids won’t receive the full $2,000 benefit this year because their parents earn too little, according to a Tax Policy Center estimate.\n\nNew cannabis banking rules: Lawmakers considered including a provision in the spending bill that would make it easier for licensed cannabis businesses to accept credit cards – but it was left out of the legislation. Known as the Safe Banking Act, which previously passed the House, the provision would prohibit federal regulators from taking punitive measures against banks for providing services to legitimate cannabis businesses.\n\nEven though 47 states have legalized some form of marijuana, cannabis remains illegal on the federal level. That means financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses are subject to criminal prosecution – leaving many legal growers and sellers locked out of the banking system.\n\nCovid-19 response: Lawmakers did not include a White House request for an additional $10 billion in funding for Covid-19, which would have been aimed at continued access to and development of vaccines and therapeutics, among other things. Earlier in the year, the Biden administration unsuccessfully pushed for $22.5 billion in extra funds.\n\nFBI headquarters: There was also no final resolution on where the new FBI headquarters will be located, a major point of contention as lawmakers from Maryland – namely House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer – pushed to bring the law enforcement agency into their state. In a deal worked through by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the General Services Administration would be required to conduct “separate and detailed consultations” with Maryland and Virginia representatives about potential sites in each of the states, according to a Senate Democratic aide.\n\nAfghan Adjustment Act: Also not included in the spending bill was the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would have helped Afghan allies who run the risk of deportation from the US. It would have given those evacuees a pathway to lawful permanent residency before their temporary status, known as humanitarian parole, expires in 2023. Many congressional Republicans raised concerns about vetting and other issues, but the legislation’s supporters, including former US military leaders, argued those worries have been addressed.\n\nLegislation to extend and expand Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked with the US during the war there and want to come to America is included in the spending bill.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby Katie Lobosco", "Tami Luhby", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/taxes/2023/02/21/how-do-rich-people-avoid-taxes/11308215002/", "title": "How the rich avoid taxes using loopholes available only to them", "text": "Armed with $80 billion in funding, the IRS is hoping to boost compliance this tax season to capture some of the more than $160 billion in tax revenue the Treasury says it loses every year because the top 1% finds ways to avoid paying “their fair share.\"\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, signed in 2022, provided the IRS with fresh funding to help it beef up its staff and modernize its computer systems to get rich people pay more.

Foundations: Some begin with as little as $250,000, but a more feasible amount begins in the millions.\n\nImmediate income tax deduction of up to 30% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for your contribution but only distribute about 5% each year for charitable purposes. Because that 5% is calculated off the previous year’s assets, the first year requires no distribution.\n\nof up to 30% of adjusted gross income (AGI) for your contribution but only distribute about 5% each year for charitable purposes. Because that 5% is calculated off the previous year’s assets, the first year requires no distribution. Avoid high capital gains tax and grow money tax efficiently. You can deduct the full fair-market value of the stock you contribute and not pay capital gains tax. If the foundation sells, it only pays 1.39% excise tax on the capital gains.\n\nExample: Investing $250,000 in a private foundation each year for five years, earning 8% annually, yields about $1.43 million after excise taxes and minimum annual distributions of 5% to charitable activities. Contrast this with $1.38 million had the money been invested in a taxable account and paid capital gains taxes along the way.\n\nBuilding solid foundations:'There are many paths': Some NFL players find efficient ways to give back\n\nFamous tax return:What we know about the 6,000 pages of Trump tax returns, Republican response and more: recap\n\n2. Property: If you own property, you can benefit from depreciation, which is how much the value of an asset decreases over time due to use, wear and tear or obsolescence. Depreciation can be deducted from your taxable income every year and is a tactic former President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner famously employed year after year to avoid taxes.\n\nThe IRS allows several types of assets that can be depreciated if used for your business such as personal property like cars, trucks, equipment, furniture or real property that includes buildings or anything else built on or attached to land. Land, though, is never depreciated. In 2023, the maximum expense deduction is $1,160,000 for most property. Residential rental property can be depreciated over 27.5 years and commercial property over 39 years.\n\nHowever, there are different ways to calculate depreciation, some that can be more lucrative in the short-term than others. Here are the basics:\n\nStraight line depreciation: the most commonly used method is calculated by simply dividing the cost of an asset, less its salvage value, by the useful life of the asset. For example, if I purchased a $220,000 building to rent and the building was valued at $200,000 and the land at $20,000. I would then be able to depreciate $200,000 over 27.5 years or $7,272 annually.\n\nCost Segregation Study: when tax experts and engineers study the various components of your building – such as its wiring, plumbing, light fixtures, flooring and exterior improvements – to determine if you can accelerate the depreciation of some of them. For example, HVAC systems, parking lots and carpeting may depreciate faster, say 5, 10, or 15 years or may even be allowed to be fully expensed in the first year. That means big deductions in the first few years and then declining as years pass, a good thing especially if you're not likely to hold a property for 27.5 or 39 years. You can reap most of the tax benefits upfront before selling.\n\nNote: You can't take a depreciation deduction on your personal home, but the tax code includes an exemption for limited renting. It says if a property is rented out for 14 days or less in a calendar year, the income is tax free. \"It started with the Masters Tournaments with golf course homes,\" said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at preparer Jackson Hewitt. Resident of Augusta are famous for renting out their properties for the tournament and leaving town for a spring vacation. Some large, nearby luxury homes go for as much as $70,000 per week\n\n\"They rent for 14 days and don’t even have to report it to the IRS,\" said Steber, who notes that this practice has broadened out to luxury ski homes to ocean front properties. Of course, you have to own and live in one of these homes first to do this.\n\n3. Gifting:\n\nAnnual gift tax exclusion . In 2022, the limit was $16,000; in 2023, it’s $17,000 per person. “If you have three kids and 10 grandkids, times two (me and spouse), that’s $34,000 per year to all 13 people that’s out of your estate and a tax-free gift,” said David Handler, Trusts and Estates Practice Group partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP.\n\n. In 2022, the limit was $16,000; in 2023, it’s $17,000 per person. “If you have three kids and 10 grandkids, times two (me and spouse), that’s $34,000 per year to all 13 people that’s out of your estate and a tax-free gift,” said David Handler, Trusts and Estates Practice Group partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP. Lifetime gift tax exclusion. This is separate from the annual gift. For 2023, it’s $12.92 million ($25.84 million for a married couple), and that amount generally rises each year based on inflation.\n\nNote: The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the lifetime gift tax amount until December 31, 2025. The amount will revert to the pre- amount of $5 million, adjusted for inflation, unless Congress extends the act.\n\n4. Family office: Typically, you need at least $100 million in assets to create a single-family office.\n\nIf properly structured, it can offer personalized services that include investment management, financial planning, estate and tax planning, philanthropic investing and concierge services for family members with all the tax deductions of a business. The stopped individual taxpayers from deducting investment, accounting, tax and similar advisory fees until 2025, but a family office might be able to take them.\n\n“Big wealthy families have the capability to do this if they all agree and get along by making it a business and deducting what would be nondeductible,” said Smith.\n\nBonus: If your kids have skills that can be used in the family office or other business, you can hire them and pay them a hefty salary that’s expensed for the business and passed on to the kids, Smith said.\n\nFamily work:Family businesses: 8 rules for working with your relatives that will keep you on speaking terms\n\nNepo babies:Jamie Lee Curtis, 'OG Nepo Baby,' says the label is designed to 'diminish' and 'hurt'\n\n5. Investments: The average U.S. chief executive salary as of Jan. 26 was $812,100, according to Salary.com. How can that be when we always hear that CEOs earn millions per year?\n\nIn contrast to the 99% who earn most of their income from wages and salaries, the top 1% earn most of their income from investments. From work, they may receive deferred compensation, stock or stock options, and other benefits that aren't taxable right away. Outside of work, they have more investments that might generate interest, dividends, capital gains or, if they own real estate, rent.\n\nReal estate investments, as seen above under property, offer another benefit because they can be depreciated and deducted from federal income tax – another tactic used by wealthy people.\n\nCalculating income:What is income tax?

Changing residency:\n\n“Jake Paul promoted it with a whole new section of the population,” said tax attorney Adam Brewer.\n\nBrothers and social media personalities Jake and Logan Paul moved to Puerto Rico in part to avoid high U.S. taxes.\n\nPuerto Rico is particularly attractive because U.S. citizens who become bona fide Puerto Rican residents – simply relocating doesn’t count – can keep their U.S. citizenship, avoid U.S. federal income tax on capital gains, including U.S.-source capital gains, and avoid paying any income tax on interest and dividends from Puerto Rican sources.\n\nNormally, U.S. taxpayers would have to give up their citizenship or green card to reap federal tax benefits.\n\nTaxing states:State taxes can be complex if you choose to work in a different state. Here's what to know.\n\nTax escape:Want to relocate? What to know about moving to Canada and Mexico\n\nNot everyone’s ready to take that leap, though.\n\n”A lot of people move to avoid state income tax,” Brewer said.\n\nIf you're a big earner, you could benefit from no income tax especially since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped at $10,000 how much state and local taxes you can deduct from your federal taxes through 2025. If Congress doesn’t act to keep this cap, state and local tax deductions will revert to unlimited.\n\nStates without income tax:\n\nAlaska Florida Nevada New Hampshire South Dakota Tennessee Texas Washington Wyoming\n\nCan we get rich people to pay more taxes?\n\nThese are just a handful of ways ultra-wealthy people can legally avoid taxes.

They’re lazy. Their parents helped them. They won the lottery. But none of these things apply to me.\n\nI grew up in a middle-income household. I worked hard to earn good grades and pay for college. I was the first one in the office and the last to leave. Sure, I got lucky by landing a high-paying investment banking job and in some of my investments, but I live a frugal life and have always been diligent about staying on top of my finances\n\nAll of that played a huge role in my early retirement in 2012, at 34. By the time I quit my job, I had amassed a net worth of about $3 million that generated roughly $80,000 in investment income per year.\n\nI don’t regret my decision\n\nI won’t lie: Early retirement has been a dream come true. I gave up a healthy six-figure paycheck, but I gained something priceless in return: Freedom.\n\nLearn more: Best personal loans\n\nPeople told me I was crazy to leave a high-paying job at such a young age, but I was absolutely burned out and felt disillusioned by my industry of work. I never anticipated how miserable I’d be working in finance, especially after the financial crisis.\n\nEarly retirement isn’t for everyone. But from my experience, the pros outweigh the cons. I get to wake up whenever I want. I no longer have to endure unproductive meetings or put up with nefarious colleagues. I’ve traveled to more than 20 countries with my wife, wrote a book on how to negotiate a severance and get to coach high school tennis.\n\nI also became a dad in 2017. Being a parent has been the toughest full-time job I’ve ever had; it makes working in investment banking for 13 years feel like a walk in the park.\n\nAre you middle class?:Here are 5 traits you might have\n\nThe downsides of early retirement\n\nI will admit that there are a few downsides. (I finally understand why researchers say that, no matter how much of a boost we get in freedom or money, we eventually revert back to our normal baseline of happiness.)\n\nIn a 2017 CompHealth survey, 68% of the 400 late-career physicians surveyed said they were not excited about retirement. Some of the top concerns included losing social interactions at work, a loss of purpose, boredom and depression.\n\nThat said, here are the biggest negatives of early retirement that no one likes to talk about:\n\n1) You may suffer from an identity crisis.\n\nOne of the most common questions people ask when they first meet each other is: “What do you do for a living?”\n\nWhen you’ve spent at least a decade working in any job, you may find it incredibly jolting to no longer be identified as the marketing expert, the investment professional or the management consultant.\n\nIt was only after I left my job that I realized how obsessed I was with my profession. I often wondered: How is the business doing without me? I was there for 11 years. Were they really able to survive without my expertise?\n\nBut after months of no emails or phone calls begging for me to come back, I finally accepted the fact that I was no longer needed.\n\nTraveling this summer? 5 ways to save money and nab last-minute flight deals\n\n2) You may second-guess yourself.\n\nWhen you retire young, you may find yourself questioning whether you made the right choice and regret all the money and status you forewent.\n\nI still had a mortgage to pay and was worried that I made a grave mistake. But after some time, my retirement plans grew clearer. I started writing more on Financial Samurai, the personal finance website I started in 2009. It was a cathartic way of dealing any stress and uncertainty.\n\nFortunately, after writing three times a week for the past 10 years, Financial Samurai has grown tremendously. I reinvested 100% of the profits it made and generated a decent amount of passive income.\n\n3) People may treat you like a misfit.\n\nMaybe it’s because retiring early is unconventional. Or maybe they’re secretly jealous you’re not grinding away at a day job. Whatever the reason, people won’t always give you the same amount of respect as they would to a working-class citizen.\n\nEventually, I grew tired of explaining why I retired early or that I wasn’t a trust fund kid. To keep the discussion simple and regain a social identity, I’d simply say I was a writer and tennis coach.\n\nPrivacy, please:This $13 million self-sustainable private island near Manhattan is for sale\n\n4) You’ll be surprised that you aren’t that much happier.\n\nMany people think that once they achieve financial freedom or leave a job they hate, they’ll be permanently happier. But, as I mentioned earlier, research has found that any significant amount of elevated happiness is only short-term.\n\nOne a scale of one to 10, my happiness level skyrocketed to a 10 after I was able to negotiate a pretty solid severance. It was enough to pay for five years worth of living expenses. But not too long after that check hit my bank account, I reverted back to my normal post-retirement baseline of happiness.\n\n5) You may get really, really bored.\n\nRetiring early is like finishing the season finale of your favorite TV show. You’re glad it got a nice ending, but you’re also sad it’s over and left wondering what’s next.\n\nWith an extra 10 to 14 hours of free time every day, my productivity suffered and I grew less motivated to achieve great wins. It didn’t help that none of my friends or former colleagues were able to hang out. There were no more company holiday parties or various client events. Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed those things!\n\nNow, I try to attend various meet-up events in order to make new friends, but my social life mostly consists of the folks I meet through playing tennis and softball.\n\nIt wasn’t until three years later, when my wife joined me in early retirement, that my boredom began to dissipate. We did a lot of traveling, but more importantly, we became parents, which renewed my sense of purpose.\n\nJaws, Batman, Finding Nemo, and more:Biggest summer blockbuster each year since 1975\n\nEarly retirement won’t solve all your problems\n\nHere’s the truth: If you’re unhappy before you retire early, it’s likely that you’ll still be unhappy after you retire. It’s better to figure out what’s at the very core of your issues and fix them first. Then, have a clear vision of what you actually plan to do when you retire. Otherwise, you’re just treating retirement as a crutch — and that rarely ever works out.\n\nAfter seven years of retirement, I finally found my groove by regularly doing things that I enjoy:\n\nWriting on Financial Samurai\n\nInvesting in real estate\n\nCoaching high school tennis\n\nBeing a husband and stay-at-home parent\n\n(I consider the first two to be more like hobbies, even though I make some money off of them.)\n\nEarly retirement isn’t the elixir to everlasting happiness, but it sure beats commuting to work and sitting in meetings all day long!\n\nSam Dogen worked in investing banking for 13 years before starting Financial Samurai, a personal finance website.

Then, an employee standing behind the counter spins around a touch screen and slides it in front of you. The screen has a few suggested tip amounts – usually 10%, 15% or 20%. There’s also often an option to leave a custom tip or no tip at all.\n\nThe worker is directly across from you. Other customers are standing behind, waiting impatiently and looking over your shoulder to see how much you tip. And you must make a decision in seconds. Oh lord, the stress.\n\nCustomers and workers today are confronted with a radically different tipping culture compared to just a few years ago — without any clear norms. Although consumers are accustomed to tipping waiters, bartenders and other service workers, tipping a barista or cashier may be a new phenomenon for many shoppers. It’s being driven in large part by changes in technology that have enabled business owners to more easily shift the costs of compensating workers directly to customers.\n\n“I don’t know how much you’re supposed to tip and I study this,” said Michael Lynn, a professor of consumer behavior and marketing at Cornell University and one of the leading researchers on US tipping habits.\n\nAmerica has tipping fatigue. Liz Hafalia/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images\n\nAdding to the changing dynamics, customers were encouraged to tip generously during the pandemic to help keep restaurants and stores afloat, raising expectations. Total tips for full-service restaurants were up 25% during the latest quarter compared to a year ago, while tips at quick-service restaurants were up 17%, according to data from Square.\n\nThe shift to digital payments also accelerated during the pandemic, leading stores to replace old-fashioned cash tip jars with tablet touch screens. But these screens and the procedures for digital tipping have proven more intrusive than a low-pressure cash tip jar with a few bucks in it.\n\nCustomers are overwhelmed by the number of places where they now have the option to tip and feel pressure about whether to add a gratuity and for how much. Some people deliberately walk away from the screen without doing anything to avoid making a decision, say etiquette experts who study tipping culture and consumer behavior.\n\nTipping can be an emotionally charged decision. Attitudes towards tipping in these new settings vary widely.\n\nSome customers tip no matter what. Others feel guilty if they don’t tip or embarrassed if their tip is stingy. And others eschew tipping for a $5 iced coffee, saying the price is already high enough.\n\n“The American public feels like tipping is out of control because they’re experiencing it in places they’re not used to,” said Lizzie Post, co-president of the Emily Post Institute and its namesake’s great-great-granddaughter. “Moments where tipping isn’t expected makes people less generous and uncomfortable.”\n\nStarbucks has rolled out tipping this year as an option for customers paying with credit and debit cards. Some Starbucks baristas told CNN that the tips are adding extra money to their paychecks, but customers shouldn’t feel obligated to tip every time.\n\nOne barista in Washington State said that he understands if a customer doesn’t tip for a drip coffee order. But if he makes a customized drink after spending time talking to the customer about exactly how it should be made, “it does make me a little bit disappointed if I don’t receive a tip.”\n\n“If someone can afford Starbucks every day, they can afford to tip on at least a few of those trips,” added the employee, who spoke under the condition of anonymity.\n\n“Un-American”\n\nThe option to tip is seemingly everywhere today, but the practice has a troubled history in the United States.\n\nTipping spread after the Civil War as an exploitative measure to keep down wages of newly-freed slaves in service occupations. Pullman was the most notable for its tipping policies. The railroad company hired thousands of Black porters, but paid them low wages and forced them to rely on tips to make a living.\n\nCritics of tipping argued that it created an imbalance between customers and workers, and several states passed laws in the early 1900s to ban the practice.\n\nIn “The Itching Palm,” a 1916 diatribe on tipping in America, writer William Scott said that tipping was “un-American” and argued that “the relation of a man giving a tip and a man accepting it is as undemocratic as the relation of master and slave.”\n\nBut tipping service workers was essentially built into law by the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which created the federal minimum wage that excluded restaurant and hospitality workers. This allowed the tipping system to proliferate in these industries.\n\nIn 1966, Congress created a “subminimum” wage for tipped workers. The federal minimum wage for tipped employees has stood at $2.13 per hour — lower than the $7.25 federal minimum — since 1991, although many states require higher base wages for tipped employees. If a server’s tips don’t add up to the federal minimum, the law says that the employer must make up the difference. But this doesn’t always happen. Wage theft and other wage violations are common in the service industry.\n\nThe Department of Labor considers any employee working in a job that “customarily and regularly” receives more than $30 a month in tips as eligible to be classified a tipped worker. Experts estimate there are more than five million tipped workers in the United States.\n\nTips on tipping\n\nJust how much to tip is entirely subjective and varies across industries, and the link between the quality of service and the tip amount is surprisingly weak, Lynn from Cornell said.\n\nHe theorized that a 15% to 20% tip at restaurants became standard because of a cycle of competition among customers. Many people tip to gain social approval or with the expectation of better service. As tip levels increase, other customers start tipping more to avoid any losses in status or risk poorer service.\n\nThe gig economy has also changed tipping norms. An MIT study released in 2019 found that customers are less likely to tip when workers have autonomy over whether and when to work. Nearly 60% of Uber customers never tip, while only about 1% always tip, a 2019 University of Chicago study found.\n\nWhat makes it confusing, Lynn said, is that “there’s no central authority that establishes tipping norms. They come from the bottom up. Ultimately, it’s what people do that helps establish what other people should do.”\n\nYou should almost always tip workers earning the subminimum wage such as restaurant servers and bartenders, say advocates and tipping experts.\n\nThe option to tip at coffee shops has become ubiquitous. Adobe Stock\n\nWhen given the option to tip in places where workers make an hourly wage, such as Starbucks baristas, customers should use their discretion and remove any guilt from their decision, etiquette experts say. Tips help these workers supplement their income and are always encouraged, but it’s okay to say no.\n\nEtiquette experts recommend that customers approach the touch screen option the same way they would a tip jar. If they would leave change or a small cash tip in the jar, do so when prompted on the screen.\n\n“A 10% tip for takeaway food is a really common amount. We also see change or a single dollar per order,” said Lizzie Post. If you aren’t sure what to do, ask the worker if the store has a suggested tip amount.\n\nSaru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, which advocates to end subminimum wage policies, encourages customers to tip. But tips should never count against service workers’ wages, and customers must demand that businesses pay workers a full wage, she said.\n\n“We’ve got to tip, but it’s got to be combined with telling employers that tips have to be on top, not instead of, a full minimum wage,” she said.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/12/02/myopia-nearsightedness-kids-doubles-screen-use-alone-likely-not-blame/4350989002/", "title": "Kids need glasses in greater numbers, screens may not be all to ...", "text": "INDIANAPOLIS – When her oldest child came home from school and said vision screening had revealed he would need bifocals, Kailey Welch was shocked. He was only 12.\n\nSure, she wore prescription lenses herself, but she didn’t start until she was well into adulthood. To her greater surprise, three of Welch’s seven other children also have needed glasses. Today, the four oldest of the eight children in her blended family must wear glasses for up-close work.\n\nThe likely reason, according to her doctor: devices, both at home and at school.\n\nNow, the mother closely monitors the younger four children’s screen time and tries to ensure that the older four wear glasses when reading.\n\n“I’m definitely paying more attention to it,” Welch said.\n\nTeen vaping:Four things parents need to know\n\nSo are eye specialists. The Welch family represents a trend they have been watching with some alarm for the past decade: a steep increase in the number of children who need corrective lenses.\n\nScreens are an easy culprit, but experts suspect that is only part of the explanation. Exposure to sunlight may play a role. More time spent outdoors appears to ward off the need for glasses. Increased awareness among parents to have their children’s eyes screened combined with simple genetics also factor into the equation.\n\nBut pinning down exactly why continues to vex the field.\n\n“That’s kind of the million-dollar question now,” said Dr. Katherine Schuetz, a pediatric optometrist with Little Eyes in Indiana. “In our profession, we’re trying to figure out why and fix it.”\n\nA New York village averted a potential school shooting. Parents are still furious.\n\nVision troubles are a rising concern\n\nWhen Gen Xers were young in the '70s, about 20% of children in the United States needed glasses. Now that number has inched closer to 40%, said Dr. David Epley, a clinical spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\nOther estimates say the percentage of young people with myopia or nearsightedness is even greater, more than 45%, said Dr. April Jones, a pediatric optometrist with Riley Childrens Health. By 2050, estimates suggest that as much as a quarter of the world may be nearsighted.\n\nJust two decades ago when Schuetz started in practice, she saw far fewer young patients who required lenses than she sees today. The biggest increase she is seeing comes in children ages 4 to 12.\n\nNor is the issue just that children with poor vision are showing up younger and younger. Once their eyesight requires corrective lenses, it’s deteriorating faster and faster.\n\n“We do know that genetics play a role, but more and more environment and lifestyle are having a bigger impact than in the past,” Jones said.\n\nAcross the globe, researchers note that children in certain countries are more likely to wear glasses than in others. In many parts of Asia, for instance, as many as 90% of children have myopia, one 2012 study found. By contrast, other countries such as Australia boast a lower percentage of children with myopia than in the U.S.\n\nFishing nets, bundles of rope:Whale found dead with a 220 pound 'huge ball' of garbage in its stomach\n\nWhat might be contributing to the problem?\n\nGenetics alone cannot explain such differences. So specialists suggest it’s a combination of factors, starting with screen use.\n\n“There’s probably a partial truth in there,” said Epley, a pediatric ophthalmologist in Kirkland, Washington, of the tendency to blame screens.\n\nExposure to sunshine, however, may be just as important if not more, experts are beginning to believe. Again, it’s not clear exactly why, but natural sunlight appears to stabilize vision regardless of whether a person uses screens.\n\nIn addition, when a child is outside playing, that is time he or she is not bent over a screen, making outdoor time even more important, the experts say.\n\nStudies suggest that exposing the eye to a spectrum of light may prevent the development and progression of myopia, but yet again, it’s unclear why, Epley said.\n\nSkeptics may note that children have been reading books for centuries and that has not had as great an impact, but screens are not exactly equivalent.\n\nIn general close work, whether staring at a screen or a book, strains eyes. When a person reads, however, he or she tends to hold the book farther away than a phone or tablet, perhaps because books are bigger.\n\nHolding objects close to the eye flexes muscles in the eye that may wind up telling the body to grow the eyeball, Jones said. While the eyeball naturally lengthens over time and a certain amount of growth each year is expected, screen use may speed up the process, resulting in myopia.\n\nEventually, a person may develop high myopia, which in addition to requiring him or her to wear corrective lenses raises the risk later in life of complications such as retinal detachment, premature cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration.\n\nTreatments to address nearsightedness\n\nNew treatments exist to try to slow the progression of myopia and spare children later in life.\n\nOne therapy known as orthokeratology, or Ortho-k, can at least temporarily eradicate the need for glasses. Each night the child puts in special hard contact lenses that reshape the eyeball as he or she sleeps.\n\nSome specialists prefer using eye drops of atropine, a medicine originally used as a nervous system blocker to treat heart rhythm problems. These drops slow the progression of myopia without risking infection as a hard contact lens may, Epley said.\n\nFor Reid McKay, however, Ortho-k has been a game changer.\n\nEvery night for the past three years, the fourth grader has worn the hard lenses. During the day, he no longer needs glasses.\n\nThe 9-year-old was prescribed corrective lenses in kindergarten after complaining about headaches. His mother, Kelly McKay, attributes his condition to genetics, not screens, as both she and her husband both have what she calls “horrible eyesight.”\n\nAbout a year after Reid first started wearing glasses, his optometrist recommended he try the hard lenses to slow down the progression of his nearsightedness. At first, Reid struggled, but now he’s a pro.\n\n\"It’s just perfect vision every day now for him,” his mother said.\n\nFollow Shari Rudavsky on Facebook and on Twitter: @srudavsky.\n\nExperts:Seniors driving to Canada for cheap prescription drugs may not be getting deals\n\nMexico ambush:Suspects arrested after shootings that killed 9 women and children", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/09/business/self-checkout-retail/index.html", "title": "Nobody likes self-checkout.

Errors at the kiosks are so common that they have even spawned dozens of memes and TikTok videos.\n\n“We’re in 2022. One would expect the self-checkout experience to be flawless. We’re not there at all,” said Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia who has researched self-checkout.\n\nCustomers aren’t the only ones frustrated with the self-checkout experience. Stores have challenges with it, too.\n\nSelf-checkout is everywhere, despite its issues. George Frey/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe machines are expensive to install, often break down and can lead to customers purchasing fewer items. Stores also incur higher losses and more shoplifting at self-checkouts than at traditional checkout lanes with human cashiers.\n\nDespite the headaches, self-checkout is growing.\n\nIn 2020, 29% of transactions at food retailers were processed through self-checkout, up from 23% the year prior, according to the latest data from food industry association FMI.\n\nThis raises the question: why is this often problematic, unloved technology taking over retail?\n\nMaking customers do the work\n\nThe introduction of self-checkout machines in 1986 was part of a long history of stores transferring work from paid employees to unpaid customers, a practice that dates all the way back to Piggly Wiggly — the first self-service supermarket — in the early 1900s.\n\nInstead of clerks behind a counter gathering products for customers, Piggly Wiggly allowed shoppers to roam the aisles, pick items off the shelves and pay at the register. In exchange for doing more work, the model promised lower prices.\n\nShoppers at Piggly Wiggly, the first self-service supermarket, in 1918. Library of Congress/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nSelf-checkout, however, was designed primarily to lower stores’ labor expenses. The system reduced cashier costs by as much as 66%, according to a 1988 article in the Miami Herald.\n\nThe first modern self-checkout system, which was patented by Florida company CheckRobot and installed at several Kroger stores, would be almost unrecognizable to shoppers today.\n\nCustomers scanned their items and put them on a conveyor belt. An employee at the other end of the belt bagged the groceries. Customers then took them to a central cashier area to pay.\n\nThe technology was heralded as a “revolution in the supermarket.” Shoppers “turn into their own grocery clerks as automated checkout machines shorten those long lines of carts and reduce markets’ personnel costs,” the Los Angeles Times said in 1987 review.\n\nBut self-checkout did not revolutionize the grocery store. Many customers balked at having to do more work in exchange for benefits that weren’t entirely clear.\n\nIt took a decade for Walmart (WMT) to test self checkout. Only in the early 2000s did the trend pick up more widely at supermarkets, which were looking to cut costs during the 2001 recession and faced stiff competition from emergent superstores and warehouse clubs.\n\nWalmart first tested self-checkout in the late 1990s. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“The rationale was economics based, and not focused on the customer,” Charlebois said. “From the get go, customers detested them.”\n\nA 2003 Nielsen survey found that 52% of shoppers considered self checkout lanes to be “okay,” while 16% said they were “frustrating.” Thirty-two percent of shoppers called them “great.”\n\nThe mixed response led some grocery chains, including Costco (COST), Albertsons and others, to pull out the self-checkout machines they had installed in the mid-2000s.\n\n“Self-checkout lines get clogged as the customers needed to wait for store staff to assist with problems with bar codes, coupons, payment problems and other issues that invariably arise with many transactions,” grocery chain Big Y said in 2011 when it removed its machines.\n\nWalkaways\n\nThe move to self-checkout has created unintended consequences for stores as well.\n\nRetailers found that self-checkout stations were not autonomous and required regular maintenance and supervision, said Christopher Andrews, a sociologist at Drew University and author of “The Overworked Consumer: Self-Checkouts, Supermarkets and the Do-It-Yourself Economy.”\n\nStores have challenges with self-checkout, including higher levels of theft. John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough self-checkout counters eliminated some of the tasks of traditional cashiers, they still needed to be staffed and created a need for higher wage IT jobs, he said.\n\nSelf-checkout, Andrews added, “delivers none of what it promises.”\n\nIn the biggest headache for store owners, self-checkout leads to more losses due to error or theft than traditional cashiers.\n\n“If you had a retail store where 50% of transactions were through self checkout, losses would be 77% higher” than average, according to Adrian Beck, an emeritus professor at the University of Leicester in the UK who studies retail losses.\n\nCustomers make honest errors as well as intentionally steal at self-checkout machines.\n\nSome products have multiple barcodes or barcodes that don’t scan properly. Produce, including fruit and meat, typically needs to be weighed and manually entered into the system using a code. Customers may type in the wrong code by accident. Other times shoppers won’t hear the “beep” confirming an item has been scanned properly.\n\n“Consumers are not very good at scanning reliably,” Beck said. “Why should they be? They’re not trained.”\n\nOther customers take advantage of the lax oversight at self checkout aisles and have developed techniques for stealing. Common tactics include not scanning an item, swapping a cheaper item (bananas) for a more expensive one (steak), scanning counterfeit barcodes attached to their wrists or properly scanning everything and then walking out without paying.\n\nStores have tried to limit losses by tightening self-checkout security features, such as adding weight sensors. But additional anti-theft measures also lead to more frustrating “unexpected item in the bagging area” errors, requiring store employees to intervene.\n\n“There’s a delicate balance between security and customer convenience,” Beck said.\n\nSelf-checkout is here to stay\n\nDespite self-checkout’s many shortcomings for customers and store owners, the trend is only growing.\n\nWalmart (WMT), Kroger (KR) and Dollar General (DG) are piloting exclusively self-checkout stores. Costco and Albertsons have brought self-checkout back after removing it years ago. Amazon (AMZN) has taken the concept a step further with cashier-less Amazon (AMZN) Go stores.\n\nIt may simply be too late for stores to turn their back on self-checkout.\n\nAmazon has developed cashier-less Go stores. Other retailers are trying to jump in on the trend. Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nStores today are catering to shoppers who perceive self-checkout to be faster than traditional cashiers, even though there’s little evidence to support that. But, because customers are doing the work, rather than waiting in line, the experience can feel like it’s moving more quickly.\n\nStore owners have also seen competitors installing self-checkout and determined they don’t want to miss out.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This AI technology lets you skip the checkout line 02:22 - Source: CNN Business\n\n“It’s an arms race.

Instagram isn’t filled with posts bragging about tossed leftovers.

They conducted studies and found, in essence, that Americans waste food because we don’t know another way, and because we can.\n\nThe first study to look at U.S. consumers' attitudes about food waste came out of the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future in June 2015. One revelation was that having a leaky faucet or leaving lights on bothered people more than throwing away food did. But the gas created by food decay in landfills is a major environmental threat.\n\nThe second study, out of Ohio State University in 2016, found that a majority of Americans think food waste is a problem, but find it difficult to reduce their own waste. Indeed, a quarter of respondents said they’re too busy to change.\n\nIt’s not all bad, though.

The produce department has some of the biggest profit margins in a grocery store.\n\nArmed with the intent to feed ourselves and our families only the best, we fill our carts with “good fat” avocados, antioxidant-rich berries and all the fixings for that salad we’re definitely going to bring to work this week.\n\nAnd then life happens.\n\nThe avocados turn to mush. Those berries grow fuzz before we know it. That salad becomes another thing we didn’t get to this week. In the trash they go.\n\nSixty percent of people in the Johns Hopkins study said they threw away food out of a desire to eat the freshest foods. A similar number said the same in the Ohio State survey.\n\nRosalynn Torres has the best intentions when she goes food shopping. She keeps a list of what she’s out of and doesn’t buy more than she needs. Her fridge and pantry aren’t stuffed full just for appearance’s sake.\n\nMore:Quiz: How much food do Americans throw away?\n\nEven so, the 37-year-old Pheonix-area resident ends up throwing out food. Sometimes it’s the banana her husband forgot in his lunchbox. Or the dinner leftovers lost in the back of the fridge. More likely it’s the milk that’s older than the date printed on its package and her 10- and 17-year-old sons won’t drink.\n\n“Those are the things … we’re human,” Torres said. “We can try our best to have the perfect diet and have an eating schedule but you cannot follow it all the time. Every day is not the same day.”\n\nAcross the globe, fruits and vegetables have the highest wastage rates of all food products, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nThose fruits and vegetables are some of the most nutrient-dense food available. In a new study that's under review for publication, researchers at Johns Hopkins discovered that annual food waste represents 1,217 calories per person per day in America. That waste was high in protein, fiber, vitamin D and other things necessary for a healthy diet.\n\nWe are not self-aware\n\nAmericans think they waste less than their neighbors.\n\nMore than 70% of people in the Johns Hopkins study and more than 85% in the Ohio State study said they toss fewer foods than others do.\n\nThat’s a “natural tendency,” said Brian Roe, director of the Ohio State Food Waste Collaborative and co-author of the university’s study. It’s the same tendency that makes us think we’re better drivers than everyone else on the road, he said.\n\nFood-waste reduction advocates say people should sort their trash to find out how much they waste. They say putting food scraps into a separate container from other trash for a few weeks will give you an accurate understanding of your behavior. You can download a toolkit to measure and record your waste on the Environmental Protection Agency’s website.\n\nBut sorting and measuring trash is a lot to ask of busy people, said Katy Franklin of ReFED, a non-profit aimed at reducing waste through a data-driven approach.\n\nA much easier way to see what you waste is to keep your grocery receipt, she said. When you clean out your fridge or throw food away, highlight whatever got wasted on that receipt. It’ll give you a snapshot – and real data – on what you toss most often and how much it’s really costing you.\n\nOnce you’re aware of your habits, you can start to see the patterns.\n\n“Maybe you bought two eggplants because they were two-for-one but now you see that every time you buy two-for-one, you throw one away. You only need one,\" Franklin said.\n\nWe can afford to throw food away\n\nAmericans spend less on groceries than anyone else in the world.\n\nWe spend 6.4% of our budgets on food, according to USDA calculations based on Euromonitor International data from August 2016.\n\nThat number jumps to 10.3% in Germany, 13.2% in France and 14.1% in China. The poorest countries spend around half of their money on food: 41.9% in the Philippines; 43% in Kazakhstan and 56.4% in Nigeria.\n\nLess than half of respondents in the Ohio State study said throwing away food was a major source of wasted money. Yet the Johns Hopkins study found the strongest motivator to get someone to reduce their waste is the prospect of saving money.\n\nMore:10 ways to reduce food waste in your kitchen right now\n\nThe average American loses $371 a year to wasted food, according to the USDA. But that’s not a large enough figure to influence most people, according to the Johns Hopkins study. That amount “might not be sufficient to motivate most non-low-income consumers,” it said.\n\nThe number, broken down to about a dollar a day, doesn’t seem big. But it’s all about perspective.\n\nThink about the car-insurance companies that use that same amount — “hundreds of dollars in savings a year” — as the foundation for their multimillion-dollar ad campaigns. If that’s enough motivation to get consumers to act, why isn’t saving food?\n\nWe don’t know a lot about food safety\n\nAmericans would rather be safe than sorry.\n\nSixty-five percent of people in the Ohio State study said they discarded food because they worry about food poisoning. Of those respondents, 91% said they pay attention to date labels on food.\n\nPeople think older food and food that’s past its date will make them sick.\n\nBut more often than not those dates refer to quality, not safety. And most food-borne illness is caused by contamination along the supply line or improper food handling, not from expired food.\n\nFood-date labeling is confusing at best. What do “use by,” “sell by” and “best before” mean anyway? Probably not “poisonous after.”\n\nInfant formula is the only food product with federal regulation for label dates. Everything else is left up to a patchwork of state and local laws.\n\nMore:'Don’t Waste, Donate:' New report shows how government can help reduce food waste\n\nTake milk, for example.\n\nIn most states, the date printed on milk cartons is 21 to 28 days after pasteurization. In Montana, that date is 12 days after pasteurization. When that date passes, retailers are not allowed to sell or donate the milk. Opponents of that law say it has led to an untold amount of milk poured down the drain and has caused milk prices to increase.\n\nThe Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic examined Montana’s law in a documentary called “Expired? Food Waste in America.” They pointed out that since milk is pasteurized, which removes potential contaminants, it's unlikely to make you sick if it's spoiled.\n\nU.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) introduced the Food Date Labeling Act of 2016, which called for federal standardization of date labeling. It died in committee.\n\nLate last year, the USDA released guidance for the food industry to adopt the phrase “Best If Used By” on date labels.\n\nThis year, two of the biggest trade groups in the grocery industry encouraged manufacturers to voluntarily adopt two standard phrases. The Food Marketing Institute and Grocery Manufacturers Association urge producers to label food with “Use By” if it’s a highly perishable item for which there is a food-safety concern. Otherwise, food should be marked with a “Best If Used By” date to describe product quality, not safety.\n\nEssentially, the complications around date labeling come back to affordability. Most Americans can afford the “extra layer of safety” of basing their actions on a date label while those with tighter budgets “look at a label twice, sniff three times and then make a decision,” said Roe, co-author of the Ohio State University study.\n\nHow we can change\n\nAmericans might say reducing food waste is simple: Just stop throwing away wholesome food. But it’s not that easy.\n\nIt’s a fundamental shift in our thinking and actions, activists say. Consumers need to acknowledge their roles in wasting and then learn how to stop.\n\nThat could mean buying less, or storing food more carefully so it lasts longer.\n\nIt could mean learning how to cook with leftovers, or not minding them in the first place.\n\nComposting, donations and rallying to change laws are all on the table.\n\nAmerica has a national goal of cutting food waste by 50% by 2030.\n\nReFed thinks consumer education campaigns and innovation have huge potential to make a difference. In April, it launched an Innovator Database that tracks more than 400 organizations that fight food waste (and which created more than 2,000 new jobs).\n\nHowever we get there, Americans are setting out to waste less.\n\nMore:French supermarkets must now donate unsold food to charity", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959661/does-rishi-sunak-have-a-china-problem", "title": "Does Rishi Sunak have a China problem? | The Week", "text": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is coming under increasing pressure to adopt a “hawkish” view on China as concerns mount over the UK’s ability to deal with the threat of Chinese spy balloons.\n\nSeveral unidentified flying objects have been shot down over North America in the past week, with one brought down by an American F-22 fighter jet after it had floated over the United States for several days.\n\nThe prime minister said that the UK was “in touch with our allies” over the apparent Beijing spy missions and said the government would do “whatever it takes” to protect the country. “We have something called the quick reaction alert force, which involves Typhoon planes which are kept on 24/7 readiness to police our airspace, which is incredibly important,” Sunak told reporters on Monday.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman is now “urging” the police to ensure their use of Chinese technology does not expose them to interference by Beijing, said the paper.\n\nThe “many strands of concern” relating to Chinese surveillance might be “coalescing into something of a crunch point for Sunak”, suggested Politico’s London Playbook. And putting further pressure on Sunak is the news that his predecessor Liz Truss – who formally designated China a “threat” to the UK during her short tenure as prime minister – will give a major foreign policy speech in Japan on Friday, where she will highlight “growing concerns” over China and its place in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nTruss is not the only Tory grandee putting pressure on Sunak from the backbenches. Yesterday, former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith joined Uyghur activists outside the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office in Westminster to protest a reported visit to Britain by the governor of Xinjiang, Erkin Tuniyaz.

Here's how companies are coping ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nRestaurants have a delivery problem.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, when eateries were forced to shut their doors, delivery became a lifeline. Restaurant operators scrambled to set up delivery channels from scratch or promote ones that previously existed.\n\nBut there was a reason that many restaurants hadn’t focused on delivery before the pandemic: Delivery is a pain. It’s expensive, since restaurants have to hire drivers or outsource to third-party providers like DoorDash (DASH) or Grubhub, which charge a fee that cuts into their already razor-thin margins. It’s also stressful for employees, who must balance taking care of in-store customers while filling increasing numbers of to-go orders. And when deliveries go wrong, the restaurants take the blame, whether or not it’s their fault.\n\nRestaurants aren't huge fans of delivery. Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nCustomers, on the other hand, don’t see it that way. Delivery is convenient. It’s usually pretty fast, and perhaps best of all, they can do it through an app — without ever having to talk to a person.\n\nAlthough dine-in restrictions in most places have eased, delivery rates remain higher now than they were pre-Covid. In 2019, delivery accounted for about 7% of total US restaurant sales, according to Euromonitor International. After a spike in 2020, it settled at nearly 9% in 2021, according to Euromonitor’s forecast for last year (The company’s 2021 foodservice data has not been published.)\n\nSo whether restaurant owners like it or not, delivery is here to stay.\n\n“Consumers have become accustomed to getting products delivered to their homes,” said Joe Pawlak, managing principal at Technomic, a food service consulting company. Now, restaurants “have to figure out what to do to make it profitable.”\n\nFor restaurants, fixing delivery means not only making it work better, but also finding ways to convince customers to choose carryout or drive-thru instead.\n\nThe problem with delivery\n\nDuring the pandemic, restaurants had to shift to a delivery or takeout model to survive, said Tom Bailey, senior consumer foods analyst at Rabobank.\n\n“They didn’t necessarily do the most efficient adjustment,” Bailey noted.\n\nFor some restaurants, the economics of delivery simply don’t add up. Third-party providers charge fees which can be as high as 30%. Restaurants, particularly independent ones, already have thin margins. For some, delivery fees can mean operating in the red.\n\nCertain measures have been put in place to help make delivery less expensive for restaurants. Cities have been capping fees at lower rates. Third-party providers have also started offering lower rates for limited services, allowing restaurants to opt into more affordable, if less extensive, services. Some restaurants are able to negotiate lower rates directly. Others pass costs onto consumers.\n\nAnother problem with outsourcing delivery is that when circumstances outside of a restaurant’s control go wrong, their own costs can spike. Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Kevin Johnson walked analysts through a recent scenario that increased costs for the coffee chain during a February call.\n\n“Our third-party delivery providers had Omicron-related staffing shortages, impacting their ability to fulfill a portion of our distribution needs,” he said. “This required us to greatly increase the use of much more expensive … alternative delivery solutions in order to meet strong customer demand,” he added. Ultimately, the disruptions meant “a rapid increase” in costs.\n\nVirtual brands\n\nCheeto-flavored wings are on the menu at Cosmic Wings. Cosmic Wings\n\nOne way to tackle the delivery challenge is to separate the service from regular restaurant operations, and use it mainly to attract new customers. That’s especially important for casual dining brands such as Applebee’s and Chili’s, which are designed to serve diners primarily in their restaurants.\n\nThe pandemic prompted these chains and others to set up online-only concepts designed specifically for delivery.\n\nApplebee’s launched Cosmic Wings, which serves Cheeto-flavored chicken wings. Brinker International (EAT), owner of Chili’s and Maggiano’s Little Italy, has two virtual brands so far: It’s Just Wings and Maggiano’s Italian Classics.\n\nOnline-only brands allow restaurants to promote products that travel well for delivery, such as sandwiches and wings, helping turn the service from a burden into an competitive advantage.\n\nThose virtual brands “offer some really unique opportunities to explore … urban and smaller take-out delivery-centric prototypes,” said Wyman Roberts, Brinker’s CEO, during a February analyst call.\n\nFor fast casual and fast food restaurants, which were already designed to get people out the door quickly, better drive-thrus and incentives for carry-out may be the way to go.\n\nBetter drive-thrus and easier pick up\n\nRestaurants like Burger King are investing in drive-thrus. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nAs customer habits change, restaurants are rethinking their layouts. For many, that means more drive-thrus.\n\nChains from Taco Bell to Burger King are adding drive-thru lanes to restaurants. More lanes can help speed pick ups — and faster drive-thrus could ultimately be a more attractive option to consumers than delivery.\n\nChipotle (CMG), for example, is planning to open about 4,000 more locations in North America. Most of them will have Chipotlanes, a dedicated drive-thru for customers who place orders digitally.\n\n“What we’ve seen with the Chipotlane [is], our digital business goes up, our delivery business goes down as a percentage and the order pickup percentage goes up,” the company’s CEO Brian Niccol told CNN Business in a recent interview ahead of the opening of the chain’s 3,000th location. “From an economic standpoint, the best margin transaction for us is in order ahead, and then the customer comes in,” he said.\n\nIf chains can’t convince customers to use speedier drive-thrus, they might try something else, like a small bonus for skipping delivery.\n\nLate last month, Domino’s (DPZ) offered a deal: Pick up your own pizza, the company said, and get a $3 credit toward your next order. Earlier this year, the chain also vowed to deliver a pizza to customers in under two minutes — but only if those customers drove themselves to a Domino’s (DPZ) location and parked in the right spot.\n\nIf all else fails, companies may see delivery fall off naturally as the service becomes pricier.\n\nHigher prices\n\nTo make delivery more profitable, companies have been making it more expensive.\n\nAt many restaurants, “menu prices are higher for delivery than they are .. when somebody goes to the restaurant,” said Pawlak.\n\nThat’s certainly the case at Chipotle (CMG). “The reality is that channel comes with additional cost,” Niccol said during a recent analyst call. “What we’ve seen is people recognize that and are willing to accept that for those occasions.”\n\nCompanies have been raising prices on everything from menu items to consumer goods and are saying that so far, customers are sticking around. But that won’t last forever.\n\n“It’s easier to do pricing in a stimulus environment where everyone else is going up,” Coca-Cola (KO)’s CEO James Quincey said during a recent analyst call. “It’s much harder when there’s a real squeeze on income.” Coca-Cola (KO) raised prices last year, and may do so again this year if needed.\n\nThe risk is that with inflation on the rise, customers might turn on higher prices, including for delivery. “Consumers are willing to pay for [delivery] now,” Pawlak said. “At a certain point, there’s going to be some pushback on that.”", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/real-estate/commercial/2022/02/14/milwaukee-brewers-have-planned-years-seek-more-public-money/6709037001/", "title": "Milwaukee Brewers stadium funding concerns put public dollars in ...", "text": "This story was made available for all readers Feb. 10, 2023.\n\nIt was a big story in March 2020 when the public agency that owns American Family Field, then known as Miller Park, voted to end the sales tax used to finance the Milwaukee Brewers stadium.\n\n\"Five-county Miller Park stadium sales tax will go away on March 31 after 23 years,\" read the headline of a JSOnline.com article about the unanimous vote by the Southeast Wisconsin Professional Baseball Park District board.\n\nThen-board Chair Don Smiley's remarks included a thank you to Milwaukee-area taxpayers.\n\n\"With their support, we continue to enjoy one of the greatest ballparks in the country,\" Smiley said, before he and others at the meeting broke into applause.\n\nJust under two years later, the Brewers have taken an initial public step towards what will likely be an effort to seek a new round of public help in paying for the ballpark's future improvements.\n\nRick Schlesinger, Brewers president of business operations, told the board at its Jan. 31 meeting of his concerns of a possible funding shortfall if estimated long-term improvement costs exceed the stadium district's $87 million reserve fund.\n\nLease could be extended to 2040\n\nA shortfall would create a problem for the district.\n\nIts lease to the Brewers, which runs through at least 2030 and could be extended by the club to 2040, requires the agency to pay for improvements — including those needed to keep American Family Field up to the evolving standards of other Major League Baseball stadiums.\n\nWe'll know more by early summer. That's when a report assessing the stadium's long-term needs is to be completed by the Brewers.\n\nSchlesinger told board members the club isn't seeking a return of the 0.1% stadium sales tax, which collected in its lifetime $605 million — around $342 per person in Milwaukee, Waukesha, Ozaukee, Washington and Racine counties.\n\nInstead, he said, a possible shortfall could result in a creative solution \"that involves a lot of stakeholders.\" He didn't elaborate, and the baseball club's officials have declined further comment.\n\n\"We’re glad the stadium district was willing to hear our concerns, and was open to the fact that they may need more information to chart a fiscally responsible path forward,\" said Tyler Barnes, Brewers senior vice president of communications and affiliate operations, in a statement.\n\nPlan in works for years\n\nA possible new round of public assistance has been in the works for at least three years — before the sales tax ended.\n\nIt was in 2019 that club officials asked the stadium district to conduct a comprehensive study of future improvements. Those requests were made as the district board was projecting an end to the five-county sales tax, which started in 1996.\n\nAlong with helping finance the stadium's construction, the tax created a reserve fund to pay for future stadium improvements.\n\nTo be sure, the Brewers didn't publicly oppose the board's preliminary March 2019 decision, and its final March 2020 vote, to end the sales tax.\n\nBut, club officials wanted the stadium district to have a detailed understanding of cost estimates tied to future improvements that the agency is required to fund through the lease.\n\nSchlesinger, at the board's Jan. 31 meeting, said the stadium district declined to do a comprehensive study.\n\nInstead, Schlesinger said, it relied on a much more limited report from Minneapolis-based construction firm M.A. Mortenson Co.\n\nSmiley, who's chief executive officer of Milwaukee World Festival Inc., which operates Summerfest, is no longer on the stadium district board. He cited that fact in declining to speak with the Journal Sentinel for this article.\n\nBrewers want an in-depth report\n\nMortenson's March 2019 10-page report amounted to a review of cost estimates within the district's master plan.\n\nThat review concluded that the district's estimates for future projects were reasonable, and would be covered by the reserve fund.\n\nThose future projects included such items as upgrading elevators and escalators; improvements to the sound system; replacing all 35,244 fixed seats in 2024 and 2025, and ongoing repairs to the ballpark's signature retractable roof.\n\nThe cost estimates reviewed by the Mortenson report totaled $71.7 million over 20 years.\n\nMortenson also recommended that the stadium district also consider \"unforeseen or unexpected conditions and inflationary impacts\" that aren't part of the district's master plan.\n\nMortenson's review of the district's master plan didn't amount to a comprehensive assessment, Schlesinger said at the Jan. 31 board meeting.\n\nMLB requirements could be costly\n\nAmong other things, the lease requires the stadium district to pay for improvements required by Major League Baseball, he said.\n\nAlso, improvements must be made in a manner consistent with MLB stadiums which \"can reasonably be said to fall within the 'top' twenty-five percent (25%) of all such facilities, when such facilities are ranked or rated according to the quality with which they are repaired and improved,\" according to the lease.\n\nCall it the \"keeping up with the Joneses\" clause.\n\nIt means that as other MLB parks add items, such as a ribbon video scoreboard, then the stadium district is obligated to make similar upgrades for the Brewers.\n\nThe district in the 2005-'06 off-season added a ribbon scoreboard and an out-of-town scoreboard at the cost of $3.1 million. Those boards were updated in the 2019-'20 off-season — costing $2.1 million, according to the district.\n\nAlso, LED stadium lights were installed in the 2020-'21 off-season for $2 million. That was another improvement triggered by the \"keeping up with the Joneses\" clause.\n\nThe district's decision to rely on the Mortenson report before dropping the sales tax led the Brewers in 2019 to hire Brentwood, Tennessee-based Venue Solutions Group to do the more extensive assessment.\n\nThat work was suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but has since resumed.\n\nThe report is to be done by early summer.\n\nIt will provide information detailing whether the Brewers believe a funding shortfall is looming.\n\nDebate over funding is likely\n\nThat will likely trigger debate among public officials and others about how the stadium district responds to that claim.\n\nMeanwhile, other events over the past two years have been leading up to the current situation.\n\nIn February 2020, around three weeks before the district board voted to end the sales tax, a study commissioned by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce said the stadium has generated a $2.5 billion statewide economic impact since construction started in 1999, followed by the ballpark's 2001 opening.\n\nSuch studies are often done in connection with efforts to seek public funding for projects such as convention centers or sports arenas.\n\nThe MMAC-commissioned study, conducted by Conventions, Sports & Leisure International, a Frisco, Texas-based firm, \"seems like a normal, very professionally done impact study,\" said Ross Milton, a University of Wisconsin assistant professor of public affairs.\n\nIt's not unexpected that a large public investment, like the stadium, would generate sizable economic benefits, said Milton, who recently reviewed the report at the Journal Sentinel's request.\n\nHowever, he also said the study doesn't address a more useful point.\n\n\"It doesn't answer the question: is the stadium the best thing\" for an investment by taxpayers compared to other alternatives, said Milton, who has an academic background in economics.\n\nIn a 2020 Journal Sentinel story about that study, MMAC President Tim Sheehy alluded to future financial needs at the ballpark, saying \"we’re going to have to think about what we do as a community to make sure there is baseball being played here in 2040.\"\n\n“We’re not trying to scare anybody. But we’re going to have to continue to make that kind of investment because it never ends,\" he said then.\n\nSheehy now leads board\n\nSheehy in August 2021 was appointed by Gov. Tony Evers as stadium district board chair — succeeding Smiley.\n\nSheehy recently told the Journal Sentinel that the study was done to coincide with the stadium's 20th anniversary.\n\n\"We felt it was a compelling time to do the study,\" said Sheehy, who also said he had \"no inkling\" that Evers in 2021 would appoint him to serve as stadium district chair.\n\nSheehy also said he was \"not privy to the board discussions on the sales tax sunset, nor was I aware of the Brewers discussing or doing a facilities study.\"\n\nSheehy was appointed to the stadium board after Smiley decided to not seek another term, according to a statement from the governor's office.\n\n\"The criteria considered for Tim Sheehy’s appointment included a deep familiarity and understanding of the Milwaukee Brewers, issues related to American Family Field, and the regional dynamics of the five counties that make up the Southeast Wisconsin Professional Baseball Park District.,\" the statement said.Meanwhile, the lease's base term ending date of 2030 deserves attention, Sheehy told the Journal Sentinel.\n\n\"So my personal view is, let's get as much information as we can, as soon as we can, so we have the most latitude in which to make decisions that guide us thru 2030 and beyond,\" he said.\n\nTom Daykin can be emailed at tdaykin@jrn.com and followed on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/14"}]}

Not to mention dangers posed to residents.\n\n“It is very easy to sit in Berlin and have an opinion about our affairs in Botswana,\" Masisi was quoted saying in NBC reporting. \"We are paying the price for preserving these animals for the world.\"\n\nIt's not immediately clear how or when Masisi would get thousands of elephants to Germany, but the president has dug his heels in on the subject, saying, according to NBC News: “We won’t take no for an answer.\"\n\nBotswana has threatened to send herds of elephants to other countries before\n\nBritain’s parliament approved a ban on the import of hunting trophies, joining Belgium, earlier this month.\n\nGovernment officials from Botswana also “threatened to flood Hyde Park in London” with 10,000 elephants, NBC reported. There have been plenty instances of documented dissent over trophy hunting, from other governments and animal rights organizations, that prompted Botswana to initially ban trophy hunting in the country in 2014.\n\nBotswana reversed the decision a couple years later, citing “loss of income, damaged crops and elephants killing livestock,” according to NBC News.\n\n“Elephants are intelligent creatures and so steered clear of the hunting areas as far as possible until hunting was banned,” Dilys Roe, chair of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Sustainable Use and Livelihoods Specialist Group, told NBC News. Once the ban was in place, the elephants “not only re-inhabited those areas but also ventured out onto the adjacent farmland with huge damage to crops and livelihoods.\"\n\nTrophy hunting may seem like a \"visceral representation of how humans endanger animals,\" but it doesn't actually \"threaten the survival of species as a whole,\" NBC reported.\n\nTrophy hunting may actually have the ability to aid in conservation efforts by “giving value to wildlife and therefore increasing the tolerance of local people to put up with dangerous wild animals on their doorsteps,” Roe told NBC.\n\nGermany probably won't see elephants despite threats from Botswana\n\nThough it's highly unlikely that President Masisi would follow through with his plan to send thousands of elephants to Germany, or any other country for that matter, Roe says the point he made was valid.\n\n“We in London, Berlin, New York or elsewhere have no idea what it’s like to live alongside dangerous animals and simply be expected to put up with them,” Roe told NBC News. “We wouldn’t want elephants in our back gardens.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/04"}]}

It comes a year after the US announced a surprise US-Australia submarine partnership – upending France’s own submarine deal with Australia and infuriating French officials. The perilous relations are no small matter, given the array of major challenges facing the larger western alliance.\n\n“If you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “President Macron has been the dynamic leader inside the G7 … so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.”\n\nIn an early sign of that diplomacy, the Elysee confirmed to CNN on Thursday a series of gifts exchanged between the world leaders and their spouses.\n\nMacron gifted his US counterpart a centerpiece from French goldsmith and tableware house, Christofle, the Elysee said. The present, crafted in 2012, is a tribute to the French transatlantic liner, the “Normandie,” which sailed with a Christofle silverware collection in the interwar period, per the Elysee.\n\nBiden was also presented with a vinyl record and CD of the soundtrack of the film “A man and a woman,” directed by Frenchman Claude Lelouch. The Elysee described the gift as a “nod to the personal history of the Biden couple” as they watched the 1966 film during their first date. The film also won France’s highest film award, the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden received two French literary works: a copy of “Madame Bovary,” by Gustave Flaubert, as well as a collection of essays written by Albert Camus, per the Elysee.\n\nFinally, Biden received two gifts from the Elysee Palace gift shop, a watch from watchmaker LIP and a jumper from the French brand Saint James.\n\nButter-poached Maine lobster and calotte of beef, shallot marmalade, are seen at the White House during a media preview of the state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron. Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Sipa USA/AP\n\nThe dinner has domestic political overtones, as well. As the Bidens roll out the red carpet for Macron and his wife Brigitte, there’s word they have two more state dinners in the works along with several other social events to come. Several people with knowledge of White House planning and operations, who spoke to CNN for this story, confirmed this State Dinner will be one of several hosted by the Biden administration in upcoming months.\n\nIt may suggest, said those familiar with the thinking around future state dinners, Biden indeed wants to run for a second term, something he has said he intends to do, but a decision that also hinges on the consent and support of his wife and extended family.\n\n“These are intricate – and expensive – events,” said one of the people, who has worked in the White House, of state dinners. “If the administration is willing to sink budget dollars into them, there’s probably a larger strategy at play.”\n\nThe guest list for Biden’s first state dinner was big from the start, made extra-large to include all of the people who have missed out on key social time with the president due to Covid-19 restrictions. Having done the mental calculations months ago as planning began, said two people familiar with the dinner’s details, the East Wing, the West Wing, the State Department and the National Security Council’s lists ballooned.\n\nAmong those attending the state dinner were celebrities and musicians, as well as top lawmakers, according to a printout of guests from the White House. Stephen Colbert, Anna Wintour and John Legend were among the invitees to rub shoulders with the likes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nTwo guests of Macron – the head designers for fashion house Oscar de la Renta, Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia – confirmed to CNN that Jill Biden wore the luxury label at the dinner.\n\nGarcia said they collaborated with the first lady for about two months on the dress, getting her input on what she wanted for the look, which included “a sense of ease.”\n\nThis first State Dinner offered the opportunity to finally make amends to VIPs and diplomats, members of Congress and deep-pocketed donors. A decision was made to hold the dinner in a tent on the South Lawn, which would allow them to comfortably seat the more than 400 guests expected to attend. (The White House is referring to the tent as a “pavilion,” as it has clear panels on the sides.)\n\nAn indoor dinner in the State Dining Room is limited by space restrictions – only about 120 guests can be accommodated. The second and last Trump administration State Dinner, for Australia, was held in the Rose Garden, which could seat approximately 200 for a formal dinner.\n\n“We’ve always expected a larger guest list as it’s the first state dinner of the Biden Administration,” Vanessa Valdivia, Jill Biden’s press secretary, told CNN.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe dinner for France was actually supposed to take place months prior, said the two people, but scheduling conflicts, including campaign trips for midterm elections, foreign travel and the wedding of Naomi Biden, meant the date was pushed back more than once. Thursday evening was ultimately where the schedules of several executive branch agencies landed with clear calendars.\n\nUnfortunately for the White House social offices and usher’s office, the final date also meant pulling off the ritual of holiday decorations and dozens of White House holiday parties in tandem with a debut State Dinner, something that has not been done before during a modern presidency. The White House calligraphers, kitchen staff, service teams and floral shop all worked to juggle the demands of overlapping, high-caliber events.\n\nAncillary kitchen space has been added with refrigeration units placed outside the White House kitchen area, as is usually the case for multiple or large social events, especially during the busy holiday party season where there can be as many as two or three receptions per day. (Three of the industrial-sized refrigerators outside earlier this week were labeled with the word “cheese,” in black magic marker – unclear whether for the French dinner, or holiday party nibbles.)\n\nFor the State Dinner, the Bidens have opted to use rental dishes, glasses, flatware, table accoutrements and linens. The venue, though on the White House grounds, does not allow for the official White House china services to be used for the dinner, said White House social secretary Carlos Elizondo. White House curators, who oversee the use of all items in the White House collection, do not count the temporarily installed tent as part of the campus – and thus the china of presidents’ past would not be part of the service.\n\nThe overall design and the floral arrangements were put together by an event planner, Jung Lee, and her company, Fete, a posh party design outfit favored by celebrities.\n\nA stage and dance floor was erected in the tent for the evening’s entertainment from singer Jon Batiste, a New Orleans native, a city Jill Biden said Wednesday is “shaped by both French and American culture.” The Macrons will visit New Orleans after Washington, before returning to France.\n\nWhite House Executive Chef Cris Comerford presents the menu during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe décor for the dinner was inspired by red, white and blue, the shared colors of the American and French flags, and “our common values: liberty and democracy, equality and fellowship,” said Biden at a preview of the table settings and menu.\n\nThe trick of a successful State Dinner format, says a former White House social secretary, is to seamlessly and organically combine elements from both the United States and the visiting country, an offering of hospitality on the side of a main course of diplomacy. But without being too hokey about it.\n\nThe flowers on the tables Thursday night were mostly roses; American Beauty varietals and Piano Roses, deep red blooms because, as Elizondo said, Emmanuel Macron likes the piano. French-made Champagne flutes were used for toasting, but filled with American sparkling wine. Tall candelabras holding blood-red candles are meant to mimic the Statue of Liberty, France’s gift to the United States. And so on.\n\nThe table setting is something the first lady has said is always her first consideration when hosting anyone for a meal, a memory from her childhood and her mother. “Even if we were only having fish sticks from the freezer, she always made our dinners feel special,” said Biden, who is expected to make remarks at the dinner.\n\n“The first lady has been involved since the beginning, it’s been important to her that the dinner reflects the warmth and approachable hospitality that the Bidens are known for,” Valdivia said.\n\nA person with knowledge of the first lady’s hands-on approach to the dinner said she was involved with all aspects of the planning, down to doing tastings of each dish and overseeing the seating chart, much like her immediate predecessor, Melania Trump, whose first state dinner also happened to be for the Macrons. Unlike the Trump dinner, the Bidens served caviar and butter-poached lobster for a first-course, Calotte of beef and watercress and sunchoke salad for the main. Trump went with goat cheese gateau with tomato jam, and a rack of lamb. Though the two dinners would share a dessert: crème fraiche ice cream.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnother common thread with Biden’s immediate predecessor is the lack of a high number of state dinners by this time in his presidency. However, for much of it, Biden has not been able due to the pandemic to host parties. Trump had a third State Dinner in the works – for the King and Queen of Spain – but canceled it as the pandemic took hold around the world.\n\nBiden is also not as inclined socially to host big events at the White House, Covid-19 restrictions or not. The first couple has notably spent most weekends away from Washington in Delaware or Camp David, and as a closely bonded family, there are few occasions where guest lists for dinners expand beyond relatives.\n\nPrevious presidents have used the White House frequently to entertain, typically with a subtext, whether political or cultural. In recent history, Barack and Michelle Obama hosted birthday parties and music concerts, bringing together celebrities and politicians for fun-filled, late nights of elbow-rubbing and bonding. The Obamas’ State Dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande in 2014 brought a star-studded guest list that included Bradley Cooper, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Stephen Colbert and Elon Musk.\n\nSinger Mary J. Blige entertained at the dinner. By contrast, Trump’s two state dinners lacked bold-faced guests and headliners, as his political leanings were often antithetical from those of mainstream Hollywood. (For the Trump State Dinner for Macron, the Washington National Opera performed, which a guest told CNN was lovely, “but it wasn’t Beyonce.”)\n\nUS President Gerald Ford dances with Britain's Queen Elizabeth II during a state dinner in Washington, DC, in 1976.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images In pictures: White House state dinners Prev Next\n\nGoing back further, presidents accumulated State Dinners as a means to help soothe icy relationships, or build support on geopolitical crises.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, for example, continued to hold State Dinners during World War II, to pull in allies. Dwight Eisenhower in 1959 hosted Nikita Khrushchev, the first State Dinner for a Soviet leader, to help quell concerns of escalating nuclear tension. Jimmy Carter was not a big party guy – the State Dinners hosted by the president and Rosalyn Carter did not include hard liquor, just beer and wine – but he had held 33 State Dinners by this time in his tenure. After the signing of the Panama Canal treaties, Carter hosted one state dinner for 18 Latin American heads of state, according to data collected by the White House Historical Association.\n\nAs time went on, guest lists for the dinners routinely grew, observed by the orders for presidential china sets, which went from accommodating about 100 people, to the most recent official set for the Obamas, which accommodated 320 people. Biden, in other words, still has the time and the space to showcase the highest form of diplomacy this country can offer another world leader. And he intends to.\n\n“There are more being planned and in the works for the future,” said one of the people with knowledge of the larger Biden State Dinner strategy. “This is just the start.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/politics/white-house-shinzo-abe/index.html", "title": "President Biden 'stunned, outraged and deeply saddened' over Abe ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Friday said he was “stunned, outraged and deeply saddened by the news that my friend Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister of Japan, was shot and killed while campaigning.”\n\nAbe, 67, died after being shot during a speech in Nara, Japan.\n\n“Above all, [Abe] cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House. “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family.”\n\nIn recognition of Abe’s death, Biden has ordered that the American flag at the White House and on other federal grounds be flown at half-staff until July 10.\n\nBiden told reporters Friday afternoon that he reached out to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and plans to stop by the Japanese embassy to sign a condolence book later in the day.\n\n“I tried to put a call in to the present Prime Minister, and he was – it was very late there at night. … I’m going to be stopping by to sign the condolence book in the Japanese embassy on the way to the CIA,” Biden said.\n\nThe President said that the weapon used in Abe’s murder “was a homemade weapon” and underscored the rarity of gun-related deaths in Japan compared to the US.\n\nJapan reported only one death due to firearms in 2021, according to the National Police Agency. A total of 10 firearm-related incidents were reported in the country in 2021 — up from seven in 2020.\n\nAbe’s death, the President argued, was unlikely to have “any profound, destabilizing impact on Japanese security or Japanese solidarity.”\n\nAbe was a close ally to US Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. His relationship with Trump was especially notable given the Republican President’s attempt to warm relations with North Korea and the generally chilly reception he received from other world leaders.\n\nTrump eulogized Abe in a pair of posts to Truth Social Friday morning, calling his death “a tremendous blow to the wonderful people of Japan.”\n\n“Few people know what a great man and leader Shinzo Abe was, but history will teach them and be kind,” Trump wrote. “He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country.”\n\nThe former President also called for Abe’s assassin to be “dealt with swiftly and harshly.”\n\nAbe was the first world leader to meet with then-President elect Trump in 2016 in New York City, just two weeks after the Republican was elected. Trump hosted Abe twice in Florida during his first term, bonding over their shared love of golf while playing together at Mar-a-Lago. In 2019, Japan returned the favor by hosting a lavish state visit for Trump and his family. Abe also arranged for Trump and his wife Melania to attend a traditional sumo wrestling match, where he was awarded the “United States President’s cup.”\n\nAbe visited Hiroshima with then-President Obama in May 2016, who was the first sitting president of the US to visit the city where the first atomic bomb was dropped in 1945. Later that year, Abe would become the first prime minister from Japan to visit Pearl Harbor with a US president when he visited the base with Obama.\n\nObama on Friday said he was “shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and longtime partner.”\n\n“Former Prime Minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan,” Obama wrote on Twitter. “I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance, the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle.”\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.", "authors": ["Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/06/09/queen-elizabeth-hosts-president-joe-biden-first-lady-jill/7529713002/", "title": "Queen Elizabeth to host Joe Biden, first lady Jill at Windsor Castle", "text": "American presidents come and go; Queen Elizabeth II abides. And offers them tea.\n\nAt 95 and less than a year before she celebrates her Platinum Jubilee marking an unprecedented 70 years on the throne, Her Majesty is getting ready to meet her 13th occupant of the White House, President Joe Biden and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, at Windsor Castle on Sunday, after the conclusion of a summit he is attending in Cornwall.\n\nAs the president's press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters said last week, \"Who among us wouldn't want to meet the queen? … They issued, of course, a graceful invitation, which he certainly accepted. He's looking forward to seeing her with Dr. Biden as well.\"\n\nThis will be the Bidens' first overseas trip since taking office and his first meeting with the queen as president. But he's spent nearly five decades in Washington and the White House says he met Her Majesty in 1982 when he was in his second term as a U.S. senator from Delaware.\n\nDuring her reign, the queen has been treated to a record five State Dinners at the White House – more than any other monarch or head of state according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nThe announcement:Queen Elizabeth II and Joe Biden to meet at Windsor Castle\n\nWhich US presidents has Queen Elizabeth II met?\n\nNo other human being alive now (or ever) can say what she can say: to have met every serving American president except one (President Lyndon Johnson) out of 14 since 1951, historians say. Her first was President Harry Truman, whom she met when she was Princess Elizabeth, the year before she became queen.\n\nThat record is in part due to her age and long service. But it's also because of the esteem in which she is held. The president of the United States may be the most powerful world leader but the queen is arguably the most famous and the most well-liked, possessed of tremendous soft power earned over seven decades.\n\nSo the Bidens, who took office just under five months ago, are no doubt aware this meeting will be a date with a woman who is as much a living symbol of history as the 1,000-year-old castle in which they will meet.\n\nAlthough Buckingham Palace is the queen's working residence, she has been sheltering and working at her weekend residence at Windsor Castle west of London since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.\n\nNext year:Britain plans celebrations for Queen Elizabeth's upcoming 70 years on the throne\n\nWhat to expect from queen's meeting with the Bidens\n\nThe meeting with the Bidens will not be a state visit; it's a more informal courtesy call of the sort former President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump carried out when they dropped by for tea with Her Majesty at the castle in 2018. (The following year, she hosted them for a state visit, including the usual lavish state banquet at Buckingham Palace.)\n\nTypically, the actual meeting with the queen is private but the pageantry aspect (at which the royals excel) includes an outdoor massing of scarlet-clad troops in the castle Quadrangle with the monarch and the president pacing down the lines to inspect the Guard of Honour as the band plays on.\n\n(The Quadrangle will be getting a workout this weekend: On Saturday, a mini-Trooping the Colour parade celebrating the queen's official birthday will take place there, the second year this usually sprawling London ceremony has been reduced and moved to the castle due to the pandemic.)\n\nPresident Biden, who's spent decades attending official ceremonies on the world stage, can be expected to avoid some of the same missteps perceived by Trump's legion of critics in Britain at the time.\n\nThe Bidens arrived in the United Kingdom on Wednesday. He's attending the Group of Seven leaders' summit in scenic and far-from-London Cornwall, which began Friday.\n\nWhat will the first lady's schedule look like?\n\nThe Bidens met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie Johnson (they married last week) on Thursday. Afterwards, Jill Biden and Johnson met separately over tea. They were supposed to tour St. Michael’s Mount, the historic castle and island off the coast of Cornwall, but the trip was canceled due to bad weather, according to the first lady's office.\n\nAs is usual at these summits, the first lady will take part in the program organized by Johnson for G7 spouses on Friday and Saturday.\n\nOn Friday, she appeared with Duchess Kate of Cambridge at a local school in Cornwall to highlight their joint interest in early childhood education.\n\nAnd Friday evening, the Bidens and other G7 leaders will attend a reception hosted by the queen, Prince Charles and his wife, Duchess Camilla of Cornwall, and Prince William and Kate. The get-together, confirmed late Thursday by the White House, was an indication that the British crown and government view the first G7 summit of the Biden administration as important enough to deploy the top royals to mingle with the visitors.\n\nAlso on Saturday, the first lady will meet with Bude Surf Veterans, a local volunteer group (partially funded by Prince Harry's Invictus Games) that helps military veterans cope with physical or mental health injuries through surfing. Biden has made support for veterans and military families one of her FLOTUS causes.\n\nAfter their meeting with the queen Sunday, the first lady will meet with U.K. veterans who participated in Walk of America, a 2018 expedition led by Walking with the Wounded to share stories of injured service members, and for which Biden served as patron.\n\nRecent royal events shape narrative ahead of the meeting\n\nThe queen's government hopes Britain can use its role as host nation this year to help forge a post-Brexit \"Global Britain\" role, and to show that the G7 club of rich nations still has clout.\n\nLack of clout is not something the queen has to worry about. But she comes to this meeting after several years of family joys and tribulations.\n\nOn the joy side, there was the welcome birth on June 4 in Santa Barbara, California, of her 11th great-grandchild, Lilibet \"Lili\" Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, daughter and second child of her grandson, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his wife, Duchess Meghan of Sussex.\n\n'Delighted':Kate Middleton and Prince William congratulate Harry and Meghan on birth of Lilibet Diana\n\nThe queen and other senior members of the family were \"delighted\" at the news, the palace said in a statement. Diana honors Harry's late mother, Princess Diana. Lilibet is the name the queen called herself as a toddler unable to pronounce Elizabeth; it was adopted as a private family name used by her grandfather, father and husband. The baby will be called Lili.\n\nOn the tribulation side, there was the death of her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on April 9, just short of his 100th birthday on June 10. Forced by the pandemic to reduce the long-planned funeral and enforce social distancing, the nevertheless sublime service was marked by the poignant image of the grieving queen sitting alone in St. George's Chapel at Windsor.\n\nHer second son, Prince Andrew Duke of York, 61, has been benched since 2019 due to scandal over an interview about his relationship with a convicted sex-offender, the late Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThen, her beloved grandson Harry, 36, and his biracial American wife, the former Meghan Markle, 39, gave up their royal roles and moved to America in 2020.\n\nIn a March interview with Oprah Winfrey watched by millions worldwide, they explained their departure by citing racism in the media and in the royal family, and what they saw as a lack of support for their mental health issues arising from the pressures of being in the royal family and feeling trapped by the restrictions of royal life.\n\nStunned, especially by the racism allegations, the queen issued a statement promising the claims would be taken seriously and addressed privately, although \"some recollections may vary.\"\n\nSo it was more bad news last week when The Guardian reported explosive new allegations, based on documents in the National Archives, that as recently as the late 1960s Buckingham Palace courtiers banned “coloured immigrants or foreigners” from clerical jobs in the royal household, relegating them to domestic jobs only.\n\nNew racism allegations hit Buckingham Palace – and not from Prince Harry or Duchess Meghan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/22/pm-modi-us-visit-biden/70321862007/", "title": "Why is Biden lavishing India's right-wing PM Modi with a state visit?", "text": "WASHINGTON − India’s democracy is at a weak point. The U.S. government has accused India of engaging in significant human rights abuses.\n\nAnd yet, on Thursday, the U.S. president is throwing India’s prime minister a lavish state dinner.\n\nFor a politician who has made strengthening democracy a central theme of his administration, President Joe Biden’s courtship of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi underscores the tension between his campaign principles and the realities of being president.\n\nBiden’s administration has accused India’s government of participating in unlawful and arbitrary killings, restricting freedom of speech and allowing violence against religious, racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nOrganizations that track democracy have downgraded India. Freedom House now rates it only partially free.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“It's very awkward, and embarrassing even, to have the rhetorical emphasis on democracy for the foreign policy, while at the same time this critical partner is seen as backsliding,” said Irfan Nooruddin, a professor of Indian politics at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service.\n\nModi pressed on human rights\n\nProgressive Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she would boycott Modi’s address to Congress during the visit over his “long history of human rights abuses, anti-democratic actions, targeting Muslims & religious minorities, and censoring journalists.” She described the conduct in a tweet as “unacceptable.”\n\n“It’s shameful that Modi has been given a platform at our nation’s capital,” said Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Cori Bush, of Missouri, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, also are protesting the event.\n\nThe White House said Biden would raise human rights questions with Modi when they speak privately. A spokesman stressed it is a topic Biden routinely addresses.\n\n“Certainly human rights is of concern to the United States, and it's a foundational element to President Biden's foreign policy,” White House national security strategic communications coordinator John Kirby said.\n\nA group of more than 70 lawmakers asked Biden in a letter Tuesday to “discuss the full range of issues” facing the two nations during the visit. They noted that “independent, credible reports reflect troubling signs in India” and told him that “friends can and should discuss their differences in an honest and forthright way.”\n\n“We think it's important that we have a strong relationship between India and the United States, regardless of who India's prime minister is, but we also think it's important that the president raise these human rights issues and make it clear that the institutions of democracy − free press, freedom of religion, a free judiciary, an independent judiciary − these are all things that ensure a democracy,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who was born in India, said in an interview. “And without a democracy, it's going to be much harder for the United States and India to have a long-term, strong relationship.”\n\nDiscrimination, harassment and erosion of trust\n\nTrust in India’s judiciary system is also eroding. Earlier this year, a court convicted one of Modi’s chief political opponents, Rahul Gandhi, of defamation for disparaging the surname \"Modi\" in a case that is viewed as highly political.\n\nIf the conviction stands, Gandhi, who highlighted India’s struggles with democracy during a recent trip to the U.S., will be barred from competing in India’s national elections next year.\n\nModi and his political party have increasingly used government institutions to target political opponents. Discriminatory policies against the Muslim population and harassment of journalists and government critics grew significantly under Modi, Freedom House president Michael Abramowitz said.\n\n“So it is still a democracy, as they say. It’s got a thriving election system. But it's these other policies that cause concern for Freedom House,” Abramowitz said.\n\nModi has not fielded questions at a news conference since he became prime minister. But the White House said he and Biden would speak with the media on Thursday.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman who co-chairs the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, said that the U.S. should be “candid” about freedom of press and human rights questions.\n\nBut the congressman, who said he plans to attend the state dinner, argued, “The imperfections in democracy should not prevent the alliance of democracies.”\n\nUkraine on the menu\n\nIndia has refused to denounce Russia’s war on Ukraine and has continued to buy Russian oil amid the conflict.\n\nThe United States has not been able to put meaningful pressure on India to join the U.S. and its allies in working to cripple Russia’s economy. And Modi’s government views itself as having a lot of leverage in the relationship, Nooruddin said, because of how focused the Biden administration has been on maintaining positive relations with the nation that it hopes can serve as a counterweight to China.\n\nThe war will be on the United States’ agenda during the meeting, the White House says, but the conversation is likely to focus on the importance of territorial sovereignty and the humanitarian assistance India has given Ukraine.\n\n“We haven't since the beginning of this war, nor are we going to start, browbeating or arm-twisting other nations about the way they're looking at this war in Ukraine,” Kirby told reporters Tuesday.\n\nOne way that Biden could indirectly create a further separation between Russia and India is by accelerating U.S. approvals of defense equipment for India, said Richard Rossow, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“It won’t be something dramatic. The tilt that has been happening over the years, where India is tilting away from Russia as a primary weapons supplier, I think that will accelerate,” he said. “But you’re not going to have a cold, hard stop, and I don’t think this trip is going to trigger that.”\n\nEmerging superpower\n\nBiden has sought to deepen the United States’ security partnership with India through a group known as the Quad. It is part of his administration’s efforts to counter China’s global influence.\n\nWith a population of nearly 1.4 billion people, India will soon be the world’s third-largest economy, behind only China and the United States.\n\nRossow said India’s growing economy and competition between the U.S. and China are at the heart of Biden’s decision to roll out the red carpet for Modi, who attended a large rally in Texas with former President Donald Trump in an earlier visit to the U.S.\n\nModi held a reciprocal rally for Trump in 2020 when the former president visited India. He is expected to host Biden in September during the Group of 20 Summit. The two leaders also met a month ago in Japan.\n\n“You’re not going to see the big theatrics I think that you saw with the Trump administration,” Rossow said. “So maybe not the warmth and bombast that you saw in the previous administration but regular engagement.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/22/onpolitics-biden-state-dinner-modi/70347246007/", "title": "OnPolitics: Biden to host lavish state dinner for Modi.

About 45 minutes later, they finally relented.\n\n“They just kept talking and talking and talking. And so you eventually had protocol people from both sides just continuing to step forward. I was actually wondering if they were about to physically grab them and drag them out of the room,” a senior administration official said, describing the meeting on the condition of anonymity. “I think if they had been left to their own devices, they probably would have sat there for another two hours and just kept talking.”\n\nThe September meeting typified the close working relationship that aides say has emerged between the two men. And it belied the fact that it fell almost exactly one year after French-American relations sunk to their lowest point in decades, with Macron taking the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington for consultations over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multi-billion dollar defense contract.\n\nThose tumultuous weeks are now far from the minds of either men or their respective administrations as Macron touches down in Washington on Tuesday evening for an official state visit, the first time Biden has bestowed that honor on any leader since taking office nearly two years ago.\n\nThe visit will put on display the critical alliance and the increasingly close working relationship between the two men, brought even closer in the nine months since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February, according to US and French officials. And it will be an opportunity for the pair – who both place a premium on personal relationships as a tool of international diplomacy – to deepen their personal relationship as well, with a private dinner with their spouses on Wednesday night ahead of the lavish state dinner the following day.\n\nSaul Loeb/Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden and Macron have met several times on the sidelines of international conferences and speak regularly over the phone to coordinate the West’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – including at least seven one-on-one calls so far this year and a dozen joint calls with other leaders. During the midterm campaign, Biden frequently invoked an anecdote involving Macron to make his case about the importance of protecting democracy.\n\nAnd when Biden turned 80 earlier this month, Macron sent the US president a handwritten birthday card, a US and French official said, wishing Biden a happy birthday and congratulating him on his granddaughter’s wedding, which took place the same weekend.\n\nAbove all, senior administration officials indicated that France’s selection for Biden’s first state visit was intended to highlight the premium Biden has placed on the US core alliances, his view of the importance of democracies in a world being tested by rising autocracies and France’s central role in both of those principles – both as the US oldest ally and Macron’s starring role in its defining battles.\n\n“I mean, if you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “President Macron has been the dynamic leader inside the G7, particularly there in Europe. And so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.”\n\nOther natural candidates to highlight the US core alliances in Europe have become less obvious choices. The United Kingdom has been riven by political turmoil and Germany became a lesser-known quantity on the international stage following the departure of longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel. Meanwhile, Macron is the longest-serving European leader within the G7 and has sought to establish himself as Europe’s preeminent head of state.\n\n“France has in many respects jumped to the head of the queue and become America’s go-to partner when it comes to advancing transatlantic cooperation,” said Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former senior director for European affairs at the National Security Council. “And I think that’s in part because of Macron himself, who leans into Europe’s role in the world and who in comparison with most other European leaders is quite active and quite ambitious.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden (back to camera) shakes hands with French President Emmanuel Macron during the Global Fund Seventh Replenishment Conference in New York on September 21, 2022. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUS and French officials do not expect the visit to yield any major deliverables, but both sides see it as an opportunity for the two countries to deepen their partnership on a slew of global challenges, from the war in Ukraine to policy toward China and the challenges posed by Iran’s nuclear program. The two sides will also advance working group discussions which were launched in the wake of last year’s submarine affair to step up cooperation on space, cyberspace and energy issues.\n\n“We’re in an extremely strong place with France. There has been a tremendous convergence of our policy on all the big ticket items,” a senior administration official said.\n\nUkraine will be “front and center” in Biden and Macron’s discussions, the official said, from coordinating their efforts to supply Ukraine’s military, to continuing to punish Russia for its invasion and mitigating the economic and energy fallout on the West. Those discussions come as Europe braces for the stinging effects high energy costs and tight supply will have and as Ukraine’s recent battlefield advances have ratcheted European calls for negotiations with Russia.\n\nThe US and Europe’s policy in the Indo-Pacific and toward China is expected to be a close second, following Biden’s recent meeting with Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 in Indonesia and as Macron prepares to make a trip to Beijing early next year.\n\n“The two presidents are going to want to compare notes on that,” a senior administration official said. “Our views on China are not identical, but I think there is a strong view that we should be speaking from a common script in response to China.”\n\nWhile the US and France are closely aligned on both big ticket items, that’s not to say there aren’t also areas of disagreement and divergence. As a difficult winter approaches, calls in Europe for Ukraine to move toward negotiations have begun to grow louder and concerns are emerging about preserving Western unity as the war drags on. On China, Biden will look for Macron to link arms with him in confronting the country over its trade practices and military moves in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nPerhaps the biggest point of tension will be over billions of dollars in electric vehicle subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which applies only to those manufactured in North America. Macron has slammed the measure as protectionist and French officials said he intends to raise the issue in meetings with Biden and congressional leaders. The Biden administration has stood up a working group with the European Union to address the issue, but the text of the law limits the administration’s ability to act.\n\nA French flag flies alongside the US flag in front of the White House in preparation for this week's state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, in Washington, U.S., November 29, 2022. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nMacron’s forward-leaning stance on the issue underscores another dynamic of the Biden-Macron relationship: despite the closeness of the relationship and overarching agreement on top global issues, Macron has not been shy about carving out his own space on the global stage – including by pursuing and maintaining backchannel communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin – and publicly disagreeing with Biden at times.\n\nIn March, Macron warned against the risk of escalation after Biden called Putin a “butcher” who “cannot remain in power.” The next month, he warned again about an “escalation of words,” disagreeing with Biden’s decision to call Russian war crimes in Ukraine a genocide. And in October, Macron urged “prudence” after Biden warned of the risk of nuclear “Armageddon.”\n\nMacron’s approach has rankled US officials at times, but officials and experts say the free-wheeling nature of the comments point to a relationship with Biden – and the US – built on more than just personal connection.\n\nMacron had also secured the first state visit of President Donald Trump’s term in office, after pursuing a charm offensive that left some calling the relationship a “bromance.” But that “bromance” struggled to survive as Trump repeatedly cast doubt on the US commitment to the NATO alliance, leading to a war of words between the two men.\n\nNow, both sides know they have a partner fundamentally committed to the alliance – tactical and stylistic differences notwithstanding – particularly in the face of the war in Ukraine.\n\n“The irritants in the relationship are completely overwhelmed by partnership and solidarity,” said Kupchan, the former NSC senior European affairs director under President Barack Obama. “I think with Biden, (the French) know they have an Atlanticist. And they have someone who has transatlantic partnership in his DNA.”", "authors": ["Jeremy Diamond"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/middleeast/china-xi-jinping-mbs-saudi-arabia-intl/index.html", "title": "China's Xi gets a grand welcome to Saudi Arabia and promises a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping with a lavish reception in the capital Riyadh on Thursday, as the two countries head for a number of summits heralding an “epoch-making milestone” in China’s relations with the Arab world.\n\nSaudi state TV showed a grand ceremony laid out for the Chinese leader, as bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler known as MBS, received him at Al-Yamamah Palace.

NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization also agreed to make a joint mission to the International Space Station next year.\n\nContributing: Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/27/politics/hunter-biden-emails-invs/index.html", "title": "Hunter Biden was repeatedly warned of tax problems, a review of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn the Fall of 2018, Hunter Biden received a quick succession of emails from his accountant: They were all about his taxes.\n\n“They are late,” Bill Morgan told his client in October, noting that Biden had missed an already extended deadline of October 15.\n\n“Your 2017 tax returns are still unfiled,” the accountant reminded Biden two weeks later.\n\n“You need to get 2017 filed so we can try to work out a payment schedule,” he added the following day.\n\nMorgan also noted in that email that Biden’s assistant had sent him a copy of an IRS notice from 2015. “They want $158,000,” the accountant wrote. “IRS has notified the State Department and they will not renew your passport until this is resolved.”\n\nWelcome to the dysfunctional world of Hunter Biden’s finances. While the general topic of the President’s son’s financial troubles has been widely reported, the details surrounding his past filings may offer a glimpse into some of the areas federal investigators are delving into as part of an ongoing probe into possible tax violations and other crimes that is nearing a critical juncture. Prosecutors, sources say, could make a decision soon on whether to file criminal charges against the President’s son.\n\nHunter Biden’s legal jeopardy has been leveraged by Republicans seeking to accuse his father, President Joe Biden, of being complicit in his alleged wrongdoing. Republicans expect, should they regain control of the House, to investigate the Biden family through committees they will control.\n\nBiden has denied any wrongdoing and has said he has cooperated with investigators. His father is not implicated in the ongoing federal investigation, according to sources who have been briefed on the matter.\n\nCNN hired a cyber forensics expert to help authenticate a cache of emails related to Hunter Biden’s finances that were posted on the internet by a former Trump White House aide and allegedly traced back to a laptop that turned up at a Delaware repair shop.\n\nInformation from the laptop has fueled countless stories about Biden’s drug abuse, alleged sexual indiscretions and money trouble, many of which CNN – and other media outlets – have not been able to verify. Biden has not directly commented on the authenticity of the emails or the stories upon which they are based. He told CBS News last year he did not know if that laptop was his.\n\nJake Williams, a former National Security Agency operative, who analyzed the emails for CNN, said he was able to authenticate a subset of the emails because they contained verified signatures within their metadata that showed they had not been modified. Only emails he authenticated are cited in this report.\n\nWilliams, who previously examined data from the laptop for The Washington Post, said the majority of emails he reviewed for CNN could not be verified because they lacked sufficient technical data necessary for the validation process, among other reasons.\n\nCNN’s review of emails showed that Biden struggled with tax issues for years and that his accountant at times seemed at a loss to keep track of the flow of Biden’s money. In one email, his accountant raised a question about a $550,000 receipt, asking whether it should be recorded as a loan or income from Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company on whose board Biden served. No response from Biden is shown on that email chain.\n\nBiden received as much as $50,000 a month for serving on Burisma’s board from 2014 to 2019, according to a Republican-led Senate report on his business activities.\n\nDespite that lavish income, Biden’s debts piled up, even as he received repeated warnings from his bank, his accountant and others.\n\n“Insufficient funds,” read an automated Wells Fargo email Biden received in December 2018 that stated one of his accounts lacked $1,700 for a payment on a Porsche. Other bank alerts that year warned that Biden’s checking account had a “low balance” and that one of his credit cards had risen above its “pre-set amount” of $65,000.\n\nAttempted charges to another credit card were repeatedly declined due to deficient funds, multiple emails in 2018 and 2019 show.\n\n“I am trying to figure out what to do about bills,” Biden’s then-assistant emailed him on December 28, 2018. She listed a series of payments Biden owed, including health insurance, a car payment and her salary.\n\n“Pay the health care. Pay the Porsche,” Biden responded, though he said she should pay herself half of the salary she said she was owed. Biden also complained that someone else was still getting a cut of what he said he was personally owed by Burisma. “So there’s not much income coming through these days,” he told her.\n\nBy March 2019, Biden’s bills, debts and back taxes totaled more than half a million dollars, according to another email from his assistant.\n\n“Please let me know if there is a new plan for paying these bills,” the assistant wrote to him in that message, noting he still owed about $370,000 worth of taxes and $120,000 in other bank debt.\n\nBiden’s assistant did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nHunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, speaks to guests during the White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House, April 18, 2022, in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nBiden’s attorney, Chris Clark, said his client has now “fully paid” his IRS tax debts. Clark added that 2018 and 2019 were difficult times for Biden, who struggled with alcohol and drug addiction after the death of his brother Beau. It is unclear how far back prosecutors may be looking into Biden’s tax woes, which according to the emails, date as far back as 2015 and continued into 2019.\n\n“He is current on his tax obligations and is committed to remaining so as he continues his recovery from addiction,” Clark said.\n\nDuring some of the same months that Biden’s accountant messaged him about taxes owed, Biden made large cash withdrawals, emails show. He withdrew about $4,800 from ATMs in roughly two weeks in October 2018, for example.\n\nBiden’s ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, wrote a recent memoir chronicling the rockiness of the couple’s finances when they were married. “More than once my debit card was declined at a store. I’d have to call Hunter to transfer money into my account,” she wrote in her memoir published earlier this year. “Hunter and I drove nice cars and had a beautiful home, but we were running fast on that hamster wheel and barely staying on.”\n\nIn 2018, Buhle wrote to Morgan, the accountant, who has since died, seeking advice about an IRS tax lien based on an unpaid bill of $112,805.\n\nBuhle said she was at “a loss” and asked Morgan to “Please advise.”\n\nIn his own book, “Beautiful Things,” published last year, Hunter Biden wrote candidly about his addictions. He told NPR he wrote the book to give hope to others who have struggled with substance abuse. He shared that paychecks he received for sitting on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma provided him with cash for crack cocaine.\n\n“But by that mad, bad end, the board fee had morphed into a wicked sort of funny money,” Biden wrote. “It hounded me to spend recklessly, dangerously, destructively. Humiliatingly. So I did.”\n\nHe was continuing to make amends, “both figurative and literal,” he wrote. “I still have a ton of work to do on myself, with my addiction, and clearing the wreckage of my past.”", "authors": ["Curt Devine Scott Glover Kara Scannell Evan Perez", "Curt Devine", "Scott Glover", "Kara Scannell", "Evan Perez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}]}

Weather ...", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the winter weather for Sunday, Jan. 14. For the latest weather news, view our live updates file for Monday, Jan. 15..\n\nARLINGTON, Va. − A deep freeze that settled in across much of the nation Sunday threatened to wallop dozens of states with snow and ice, bring freezing temperatures as far south as Florida and create chaos for travelers, football fans and even voters in the Iowa Caucuses.\n\nWind chill advisories or warnings were in effect Sunday for more than 100 million Americans, and over 44 million were under a winter weather advisory. Much of the country faced temperatures 20-40 degrees below normal.\n\nThe severe cold was expected to push as far south as northern Texas while Montana and the Dakotas could see subfreezing wind chills. The National Weather Service said North Dakota could see \"life-threatening wind chills as low as 60 below zero.\"\n\n“It takes a matter of minutes for frostbite to set in,” the South Dakota Department of Public Safety said in a statement Sunday urging people to stay indoors.\n\nA winter storm with snow and ice will threaten the mid-Atlantic and New England from Monday night to Tuesday night, AccuWeather said. The storm, and a wall of arctic air, is expected to ride the jet stream across most of the nation over the next few days.\n\n\"For much of the country, this will end up being the coldest and most persistent outbreak of arctic air in a couple of winters,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Matt Benz said.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, tasked with operating the state's power grid, has said it expects the grid to function normally, though city and county leaders and energy experts have warned of the possibility of outages caused by extreme conditions. In the winter storm of 2021, 4 million Texans were left without power after nearly half of the state's generation capacity was knocked offline because of frozen equipment and other weather-related problems across the system.\n\n∎ In Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser was planning to activate a Cold Weather Emergency on Monday through Thursday. Human services agencies will assist unsheltered and vulnerable residents with shelters, warming buses, gloves, blankets, and handwarmers.\n\n∎ In Arlington, outside of the nation's capital, deep freezes are rare and authorities urged residents to consider wrapping pipes or leaving water running a trickle to avoid freezing and cracking: \"Temperatures expected to drop this week. Think of the pipes.\"\n\nSnow and ice from Texas to Tennessee\n\nSnow rolling across Texas, Oklahoma and southern Kansas on Sunday was forecast to expand into Arkansas, Missouri, the Tennessee Valley and the southern Appalachians through Monday. Some areas could see more than a foot of snow, AccuWeather said. An area of dangerous ice was forecast late Sunday in Texas and southeastern Oklahoma before spreading into Louisiana, Mississippi, southern Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee into Monday.\n\nOfficials in southern states advised residents to prepare for the subfreezing weather. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency in advance to give utility trucks and trucks transporting essential supplies more flexibility to respond.\n\n\"Texans are urged to take precautions to protect themselves, their loved ones, and their homes,\" Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday.\n\nIn Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson, officials said they were preparing for the cold weather. Pipes had burst in 2021 and 2022 amid cold snaps, causing water pressure to drop across the city. Ted Henifin, Jackson’s interim manager of the city’s water system, told WAPT-TV that crews were on standby to respond to any broken pipes.\n\n3 feet of snow, 50-mph winds\n\nIn the Northeast, Buffalo was under siege and an NFL playoff game scheduled for Sunday was postponed. The National Weather Service said a band of lake-effect snow would dump 1 to 2 feet across much of the area, and some communities could see up to 3 feet. Winds gusts of up to 50 mph would prompt near-blizzard conditions, the weather service warned.\n\n\"Travel will be very difficult to impossible at times with deep snow cover on roads,\" the advisory said. \"Widespread blowing snow will reduce visibility to near zero.\"\n\nIowa, where iconic political caucuses are scheduled for Monday, was setting temperature records Sunday. The temperature at 7:30 a.m. dipped to minus 18 degrees at Des Moines International Airport, the lowest temperature recorded for a Jan. 14 in Des Moines since 1888. It's also the lowest temperature recorded since a minus 20 reading in January 2019.\n\n\"Many roads have drifted shut or partially shut overnight,\" the weather service in Des Moines warned on social media Sunday. \"Do yourself and the road crews a favor and do not travel!\"\n\nParts of northern Florida are projected to trend from a daytime high near 70 degrees on Monday to the upper 40s by Wednesday. Overnight temperatures could drop below freezing across the northern third of the state, AccuWeather warned.\n\nFreezing temperatures in Michigan\n\nSnowfall may hit between two and six inches and another four inches Sunday night, while areas of southern Michigan may see up to an inch after the severe storm slammed the state over the weekend.\n\nSince Friday, regions across the state saw heavy snowfall, high winds and thundersnow. Snowfall and low temperatures brought icy conditions, making roadways hazardous. The storm began Friday afternoon and continued into Saturday, bringing dangerous conditions and thousands of power outages throughout Michigan.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Transportation and Michigan State Police reported dozens of crashes throughout the weekend, with crews working continuously to clear roadways. Road conditions are particularly dangerous in northern Michigan, where intense lake bands are causing near whiteout conditions and low visibility, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nOfficials urge residents to keep an emergency kit and fully charged cell phone with them before hitting the roads.\n\nIowa Caucuses 2024 live updates:Why does the race matter for Trump, Haley and other GOP hopefuls?\n\nIn Iowa, heroism of first responders aids woman in labor\n\nDeputies in Marshall County, Iowa, worked with other first responders to aid a woman who gave birth in the snowstorm early Sunday. The call for help from a woman who was having contractions came shortly before midnight, the sheriff's office said in a statement. Responding deputies found the snow-covered road unpassable and hiked a half-mile in blizzard conditions to reach the woman's home.\n\nThe Clemons Fire Department brought in a tractor to clear a path for an ambulance. The woman gave birth at 12:38 a.m., and she and her baby were taken to Unity Point Health, authorities said.\n\nTrump not worried about weather for Iowa Caucuses\n\nIn Des Moines, former President Donald Trump met with campaign volunteers on Sunday before heading to a rally in Indianola, less than 20 miles south. Trump is a heavy favorite to win the Republican Caucuses − a new Iowa Poll released Saturday night showed him leading the field by 28 percentage points.\n\nThis is expected to be the coldest Iowa Caucus ever. In 1972, the first Iowa Caucus, wind chills reached 26 degrees below zero. But the high temperature climbed to 25 degrees. Monday's expected high is minus 3 degrees.\n\n\"We seem to have a lot of good enthusiasm,\" Trump said. \"I don't know, maybe the weather is not going to be that big a deal.\"\n\nDangerous road conditions are coming:We have tips for driving in snow.\n\nWest Coast not exempt from wintry weather, outages\n\nAlmost 170,000 homes and businesses were without power across Oregon early Sunday after a winter storm blasted across much of the state and Oregon and southwestern Washington. Temperatures dipped into the teens as power companies scrambled to bring back heat and light. Adding to the struggle: Strong winds with gusts above 80 mph tumbled trees and powerlines.\n\nPortland's Bureau of Environmental Services said its crews were working around the clock at several locations to make emergency repairs and prevent sewage releases into homes and businesses. Portland’s largest sewage pump station, which serves downtown and the surrounding inner city, was under partial service due to a frozen pipe.\n\n\"As conditions remain hazardous for the next several days, we need you to stay home,\" Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler posted Saturday on social media. \"As you are able, please check on your neighbors. It takes our entire community to get through this weather event.\"\n\nThe Oregon Department of Emergency Management also activated its Emergency Coordination Center for state agencies and nonprofit partners to share life safety resources. The department encouraged people to stay home, stay informed, have an emergency plan, and stock an emergency kit.\n\nIowa won't be warming up soon\n\nThe high temperature in Des Moines was only expected to reach minus 9 degrees, close to the all-time record of minus 14 in January 1912. Today's wind chill could reach minus 40.\n\nThe reprieve won't come right away, either. The overnight low Sunday night was forecast at minus 17. Highs on Monday, Iowa Caucuses day and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, were expected to be minus 5 degrees. The temperatures will fall to minus 11 degrees Monday night, with a wind chill of minus 30, forecasters said.\n\n\"This extreme arctic air combined with breezy to strong winds will continue to create dangerous temperatures and wind chills through early next week, with wind chill values as low as 45 below zero possible at times,\" the weather service in Des Moines warned.\n\nA 2007 study indicates poor weather benefits the Republican Party’s vote share − and may have contributed to presidential races in 1960 (good weather in several close states helped Democrat John F. Kennedy) and 2000 (rain in Florida helped Republican George W. Bush). But the caucuses are primaries and don't pit party against party.\n\nSteelers vs. Bills:AFC wild-card game in Buffalo postponed until Monday due to weather\n\nA different kind of 'delay of game' for Buffalo\n\nIn New York, the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services urged Western New Yorkers to stay home.\n\n\"Travel in impacted areas will be impossible and dangerous at times throughout the weekend due to life-threatening blizzard-like conditions,\" the agency said in a statment.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul cut a deal with the NFL to postpone Sunday's playoff game between the Buffalo Bills and the Pittsburgh Steelers from Sunday to Monday.\n\n\"I've been in communication with @NFL commissioner Roger Goodell regarding the dangerous conditions in Buffalo this weekend,\" she wrote on social media. \"In consultation with our emergency response teams, @BuffaloBills leadership, and the NFL, the Bills game will be postponed to 4:30 pm Monday.\"\n\nContributing: Marina Pitofsky, USA TODAY; Victoria Reyna-Rodriguez, José Mendiola and Philip Joens, the Des Moines Register; Alan Torres and David DeMille, Eugene Register-Guard; Jenna Prestininzi, Detroit Free Press; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/07/14/friday-heat-forecast-across-us/70408376007/", "title": "Millions of Americans under heat warnings; Phoenix, Las Vegas ...", "text": "Millions of Americans were under heat warnings and watches across the West and the South on Friday with multiple cities expected to shatter heat records, and it's only going to get worse and more dangerous over the weekend, officials say.\n\nThis weekend, \"a searing heat wave is set to engulf much of the West Coast, the Great Basin, and the Southwest,\" the National Weather Service said. Much of the south-central and western U.S. has been hit by an unrelenting wave of near record-breaking temperatures in recent days and weeks, which forecasters say is intensifying.\n\nMore than 34 million people were under excessive heat warnings, and 61 million under heat advisories from the weather service as they woke on Friday morning. Nearly 730,000 Americans also were under excessive heat watches.\n\nBetween Saturday and Sunday, there are 45 record-high temperatures forecast in California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Florida, Oregon and Idaho, the National Weather Service said.\n\nIn Death Valley, California, which has recorded the hottest temperatures anywhere in the world, temperatures are poised to hit 130 degrees, while the weather service said daytime highs from the Great Valley region of California to the Desert Southwest will hit between 105 and 115 degrees Saturday.\n\nScientists say the recent record-breaking heat is evidence of climate change stoked by fossil fuel emissions.\n\n\"We're expecting a large dome of high pressure to build overhead,\" Accuweather meteorologist Mike Youman told USA TODAY.\n\nYouman said Las Vegas; Fresno, California and Flagstaff, Arizona, are among the areas forecasted to approach or hit record highs.\n\n'Oppressively hot': Southwest sees triple digits\n\nParts of the desert in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will likely top 120 degrees Saturday, the weather service said.\n\nPhoenix hit 110 degrees for the fourth consecutive day Thursday. It reached 114 degrees at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, tying a record set for the day in 2020. The city's record for consecutive temperatures of 110 degrees or above is 18 days, set in 1974.\n\nLas Vegas is set to break its hottest temperature ever recorded on Sunday, when it's forecasted to reach 118 degrees, which would break the previous record of 117.\n\nThere's a chance Death Valley will climb above 130 degrees this weekend. Its all-time heat record of 134 degrees was set in July 1913. Temperatures there will \"struggle to fall below 100\" overnight this weekend through Tuesday, the weather service forecasted.\n\nFarther east, the weather service warned of \"oppressively hot and steamy conditions\" stretching from Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley all the way to Florida. Little relief will be offered in the early morning hours, either, with low temperatures across the South remaining \"excessively warm.\"\n\nHigh humidity to make high temperatures more brutal in Plains, Southeast\n\nAcross the Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast, temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s aren't the only thing people need to worry about. With the combination of high humidity, 100 degrees could feel worse than 115 degrees, the weather service reports.\n\nThe weather services forecasts the heat wave to haunt the region through this weekend and into next week. Over at least the next six days, about 27 million people across the contiguous United States will experience an air temperature or heat index above 110.\n\n\"With the humidity continuing on the air feels heavier, feels harder to breathe. So all of that is caused by those those higher dew points and higher humidity values,\" Youman said.\n\nThe Northern Plains, however, should get a reprieve from the heat as cooler air from central Canada dips into the region by early Saturday, according to the weather service forecast.\n\nUS KEEPS SHATTERING RECORDS:Heat record after heat record will be broken in 2023. Here's how to make sense of it all.\n\nWhat is causing the heat wave?\n\nThe National Weather Service said the soaring temperatures are due to an \"upper level ridge of high pressure\" over the Southwest, which is set to strengthen. A heat dome happens when a persistent region of high pressure traps the heat over an area.\n\nAnother factor impacting the heat? A shift in position of the jet stream, AccuWeather reported. Jet streams are narrow bands of strong winds high in the atmosphere sometimes called \"rivers of air,\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nAccording to AccuWeather meteorologists, a northward bulge of the jet stream will be \"extreme as it can be over the interior Southwest\" into early next week, causing dangerously high temperatures in that region.\n\nHow to stay safe in soaring temps\n\nOfficials warn that exposure to the extreme heat can be dangerous and even deadly. Most years, heat leads all other weather-related causes of death, according to the National Weather Service. There are an average of 702 heat-related deaths each year in the country and tens of thousands of emergency room visits for heat, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.\n\nThe weather service in Sacramento, California, advised residents to consider cancelling outdoor activities during the hottest parts of the day and to make sure to stay hydrated. Saturday and Sunday are being considered a \"major heat risk,\" which means the heat is dangerous to anyone without adequate access to cooling or hydration.\n\nIf you experience confusion, dizziness, or loss of consciousness, you should call 911, the weather service said.\n\nUS heat index forecast\n\nMore severe rainfall unfolds in Midwest, mid-Mississippi Valley and returns to New England\n\nSouthern New England and the coastal Mid-Atlantic states can expect heavy rain Friday as a slow-moving cold front shifts southeastward bringing with it a slight risk of excessive rainfall, meteorologists said.\n\nFollowing the catastrophic flooding earlier this week, interior New England is still sensitive to more harsh rainfall requiring the forecast \"to be monitored very closely as any changes can bring big impacts,\" according to the weather service.\n\nFurther south, a slight risk of excessive rainfall was also in effect for the lower Mississippi Valley through the central Gulf Coast region on Friday, where severe storms could get organized through the day.\n\nUS weather watches and warnings\n\nNational weather radar", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/09/21/nhc-forecasts-east-coast-storm-could-be-ophelia/70920561007/", "title": "NHC forecasts Ophelia will form, storm to impact Washington, NYC", "text": "Tropical storm conditions are expected to begin Friday along portions of the East Coast, as a low pressure system in the Atlantic Ocean strengthens and is anticipated to become a tropical cyclone.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, tropical storm conditions will first begin in North Carolina Friday morning and spread north Saturday. There is a danger of life-threatening storm surge in coastal areas, and high surf and rip currents also are expected through the weekend, along with heavy rainfall across the Mid-Atlantic, from North Carolina to New Jersey.\n\nA tropical storm warning was issued for portions of the East Coast on Thursday as a \"potential tropical cyclone\" formed in the Atlantic Ocean not far from the southeastern U.S. shoreline.\n\nThe current forecast track for the storm indicates it will impact the densely populated I-95 corridor from Washington, DC, to Boston over the weekend. As of Thursday, more than 5 million people faced tropical storm warnings from North Carolina to Delaware.\n\nMeteorologist Maria Torres, a public affairs officer at the hurricane center, said Thursday people along the Atlantic coast need to watch the storm’s progress, gather supplies and make preparations over the next 24 to 48 hours for its arrival.\n\nAs of Friday morning, the system was located about 330 miles southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, forecasters said, and was moving to the north at 14 mph.

It would be the 16th named storm of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nWhat else is out there? What about Hurricane Nigel?\n\nIn addition to the system near the Southeast U.S., forecasters were also tracking Hurricane Nigel in the north Atlantic and another developing system off the coast of Africa.\n\nAs of late Thursday, Nigel was moving quickly over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean as a Category 1 hurricane. The hurricane center said Nigel’s maximum sustained winds were 80 mph and the storm was centered about 630 miles east-southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and moving east-northeast at 37 mph.\n\nForecasters expected Nigel will weaken over the next couple of days. It was forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone on Thursday night.\n\nElsewhere, a tropical wave off the coast of Africa showed signs of development on Thursday. According to the hurricane center, environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression is likely to form late this week or this weekend while the system moves generally westward at 10 to 15 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic.\n\nIt's too early at this time to determine if there will be any impact to the U.S. or the Caribbean from the tropical wave.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; C.A.

The alerts stretch across 37 states, dipping as far south as the Texas/Mexico border.\n\nThe number of people under winter alerts and wind chill alerts has grown to over 100 million people, or roughly a third of the US population, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe cold will stick around for Christmas weekend, making this the coldest Christmas in roughly 40 years for portions of the Plains and Midwest.\n\nLIVE UPDATES ON THE WINTER STORM FOR THURSDAY\n\nStorm timeline:\n\nWednesday: The storm will strengthen over the Northern Plains through the day as heavy snow falls across much of the Rockies, the Northern Plains and into the Midwest. Slick roads will lead to travel headaches and airport delays through places like Minneapolis, Omaha and Rapid City.\n\nThis system will bring 5 to 9 inches of light fluffy snow across the region, with “the highest amounts just north and west of the Twin Cities,” said the weather service office in Twin Cities. While snow will steadily fall across the region, the high winds won’t kick in until Thursday.\n\nDenver will go from a high of 47 on Wednesday to 10 degrees below zero by daybreak Thursday. That would be the city’s coldest day in 32 years, according to the weather service. Cheyenne, Wyoming, recently dropped 32 degrees in just eight minutes.\n\nTemperatures in the Denver metro area will drop drastically once the front passes in the next couple of hours.\n\nBy sunrise, the temperature is expected to be around 10 degrees below zero and gusty north winds will create a wind chill of around minus 25. The high-temperature tomorrow will likely not make it above zero degrees.\n\nA wind chill warning is in effect as well as a winter weather advisory. Several inches of snow will also make for difficult travel late this afternoon through early Thursday.\n\nThursday: Thursday will be the most difficult day for travel. The storm will be hitting the Midwest extremely hard with heavy snow and strong winds. Western Minnesota will face not only blizzard conditions, but potentially deadly wind chills Thursday and Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions are expected during that time with travel becoming very difficult or impossible,” said the weather service. “This event could be life-threatening if you are stranded with wind chills in the 30 below to 45 below zero range.”\n\nChicago could also face blizzard conditions with winds gusting as high as 50 mph, with 2 to 4 inches of snow forecast.\n\n“Overall, concern continues to increase in the quick development of dangerous conditions Thursday afternoon with potentially significant impacts to the evening peak travel window,” warned the weather service office in Chicago.\n\nSnowfall early Wednesday in Glasgow, Montana. Angel Enriquez\n\nAdditionally, strong winds may knock out power lines in the Midwest, especially in areas where heavy snow fell last week and is already weighing down tree branches. This will leave millions finding a way to stay warm as temperatures plummet to well below freezing.\n\nSnow could fall as far south as Jackson, Mississippi, Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee and even Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday. Little to no accumulation is expected for most of the southern cities, however, Nashville could pick up about an inch of snow.\n\nIn anticipation of what will be a week of travel nightmares, United, American, Delta, Southwest and Jet Blue have issued travel waivers for dozens of airports across the country from the South to the Northeast, because in addition to snow covering roadways, low visibility could make air travel dangerous.\n\nAt least 1,000 flights had been canceled across the US, according to the flight tracking site Flightaware on Wednesday evening.\n\nChicago’s O’Hare International Airport leads the way, followed by Denver International and Chicago’s Midway International.\n\nCancellations at those airports could have a wider impact because they are busy hubs where travelers often change planes in order to reach other destinations. Thursday is expected to be the busiest pre-Christmas day for travel.\n\nFriday: The storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone” Thursday evening into Friday. A bomb cyclone is when a storm rapidly intensifies – and drops 24 millibars (a term used to measure atmospheric pressure) in 24 hours.\n\nThe storm is expected to reach the pressure equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane as it reaches the Great Lakes, with the weather service describing the strength of the low a “once-in-a-generation” event.\n\n“This is a case in which snow totals may not tell the whole story. Even small snow amounts, when combined with very strong wind gusts and plummeting temperatures, can cause poor visibility and slick spots on roads. The sudden arrival of these conditions can increase the danger,” the weather service explained.\n\nThe storm will be over the Great Lakes on Friday and continuing to produce heavy snow across much of the Midwest. Portions of Michigan could pick up more than a foot of snow by Friday, making travel impossible at times.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect for parts of the Dakotas, Montana, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Michigan – where travel conditions will become difficult to impossible as the storm peaks Thursday into Friday. Major cities like Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Twin Cities and Detroit are under winter storm warnings for heavy snow and near blizzard conditions.\n\nHeavy rain will also blanket much of the I-95 corridor, adding to the travel troubles and lengthy airport delays.\n\nEven in places where the snow has ended, strong winds will continue to blow 30 to 40 mph across much of the Midwest and into the Northeast.\n\nFriday night into Saturday morning, New England will get a quick shot of snow and windy conditions.\n\nTravelers check in at Minneapolis' St. Paul Airport, Wednesday, December 21, 2022. Abbie Parr/AP\n\nLife-threatening cold\n\nPlaces that will escape the snow, won’t escape the cold. Areas from eastern Montana through the Dakotas will experience the coldest air beginning Thursday morning. Current wind chills across Montana and the Dakotas are as cold as 50 to 60 degrees below zero and will fall even further after dark Wednesday.\n\nRapid City will feel like 45 degrees below zero on Thursday morning. By Friday morning, Chicago’s wind chill will bottom out at 30 degrees below zero.\n\n“The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 minutes,” warned the weather service office in Bismarck.\n\nEven the South will be dangerously cold. Nashville and Atlanta’s wind chill will drop to minus 11 on Saturday morning and Birmingham will feel like minus 5.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday declared a state of emergency due to the upcoming “historic low temperatures” across the state, with near zero or negative digit wind chills by midday on Friday.\n\nGreg Behrens, of Des Moines, Iowa, tries to stay warm as he makes his way on a snow-covered sidewalk, Wednesday, December 21, 2022, in Des Moines, Iowa.

Andy Beshear also declared a state of emergency, with wind gusts expected to reach 40 to 50 mph on Friday and minus 10 to minus 26 degrees wind chills expected on Saturday. Beshear asked residents to stay off roads and to have a backup heat source.\n\nJackson and Birmingham will both spend more than 80 hours below freezing between Friday and Monday.

What ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN Business —\n\nFor over a decade, companies from Google to General Motors have poured billions of dollars into the pursuit of what was seen as the Holy Grail of driving technology: the fully self-driving car. Such vehicles would usher in an era of consumer safety and convenience, experts promised, and would be an immensely valuable product for carmakers.\n\nBut recently many of the main players in the autonomous vehicle game have been scaling back or outright abandoning their lofty ambitions. Last week Ford and Volkswagen pulled the plug on their self-driving effort, Argo AI, the latest admission from a hype-fueled industry that building a good self-driving car that’s also a profitable business may not happen anytime soon.\n\nWhen it all began\n\nArgo AI CEO and co-founder Bryan Salesky was part of a famed Carnegie Mellon University team that developed a primitive self-driving vehicle that won a Pentagon race in 2007.\n\nFour students on the team went on to co-found self-driving companies, which have raised billions since: Salesky, who founded Argo; Dave Ferguson at Nuro; and Drew Bagnell and Chris Urmson at Uber-backed Aurora.\n\n“We started out doing this stuff because it was cool and it was a neat idea, but we weren’t quite sure how it was going to be used,” Salesky said in a 2019 interview.\n\nThe team’s self-driving Chevrolet Tahoe caught the eye of Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who went on to launch a self-driving car program in 2009, later dubbed Waymo, that ignited an industry. Competitors like Uber jumped in, fearful that being left out of self-driving would destroy their business’s future. (Uber launched its program in 2015 before selling it in 2020 following a costly lawsuit with Alphabet.)\n\nA Waymo robotaxi is shown in Arizona. Caitlin O'Hara/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nGeneral Motors bought a self-driving company in 2016. Ford followed suit a year later with Argo AI. Uber rushed to scoop up engineers from Salesky’s alma mater, Carnegie Mellon.\n\nMore than $10 billion was invested in self-driving cars since 2010, McKinsey estimated.\n\nProponents of self-driving believed they were onto something big. Driving is the deadliest of the common forms of transportation, and a leading cause of death for many age groups. More Americans have died in traffic crashes than fighting in all of its wars.\n\nInvestors swooned at the potential to make billions while saving millions of lives.\n\nThis business would be huge, they said. “$7 trillion as autonomous vehicles become mainstream,” claimed Intel.\n\nBig talk, smaller results\n\nUrmson, while leading Google’s self-driving car project before founding Aurora, talked of his preteen son never needing to get a driver’s license. Optimism ran wild.\n\nWhy would anyone even own a car? Autonomous taxis would be even cheaper than walking, said one industry analyst.\n\n“Autonomous vehicles are able to acquire new skills faster than humans,” Salesky said in 2021.\n\nBut there was one problem. The technology could do impressive things but mastering all the situations we face as human drivers is tough. The billions invested in the technology haven’t yet been able to drive better than a human in some situations.\n\nThat’s been a problem for the long list of companies that set aggressive targets for self-driving cars. General Motors in 2017 promised mass production of fully autonomous vehicles in 2019. Lyft said in 2016 that half its rides would be self-driving by 2021. Ford talked up 2021 too, promising full self-driving vehicles deployed broadly.\n\nBut there’s a funny saying from the software world, known as the 90-90 Rule. Once 90% of the work is done, you only have 90% to go. The ability of self-driving car software to steer the vehicle within a highway lane is great, but being able to do so, even for thousands of miles at a stretch, isn’t enough. A self-driving car, without a steering wheel or pedals, would have to be able to drive itself in literally every situation possible.\n\nWith millions of miles being driven by humans every day, the number of tricky and unusual situations, called edge cases, is vast. Unusual events are individually, by definition, uncommon. But the sheer number of unusual events encountered by millions of drivers all over the world means that “unusual events” are quite common.\n\n“It’s really, really hard,” Waymo’s then-CEO John Krafcik said in 2018 of self-driving technology. “You don’t know what you don’t know until you’re really in there and trying to do things.”\n\nIndustry leaders have backed off their big claims. Waymo has said it will be decades before the technology is everywhere in the world.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk now largely stands alone for sticking with aggressive predictions. He’s said every year since 2017 that the software capable of full self-driving will probably arrive in the “next year.” The software hasn’t arrived though. Instead, the company has drawn increasing scrutiny from regulators for its big talk. It’s being investigated for the rear-ending of emergency vehicles stopped on roads, and appeared unable to identify motorcycles at times.\n\nHumbled but not defeated\n\nIn recent years many industry leaders have quietly acknowledged and tried to tweak their business plan. Urmson and Bagnell shifted to the development of self-driving trucks that drive mostly on highways, which are much easier to master.\n\nFerguson left the Google self-driving car project to start a company building fully autonomous vehicles without a person inside for goods delivery. It’s a far simpler challenge as there’s no worry about protecting people inside the vehicles. Even Google itself started working on self-driving trucks.\n\nCompanies developing lidar, widely seen as a key component for self-driving vehicles, as well as self-driving companies, have seen their stocks plummet recently.\n\nLidar companies Velodyne, Quanergy, Luminar, and Ouster have all seen their stocks pummeled this year. Autonomous truck companies Aurora, TuSimple, and Embark have all had huge dives too this year.\n\nTesla, which has promised “full self-driving” for years, has delivered a less ambitious driver-assist feature that’s enjoyed by some, but it is also a beta product with lots of room for improvement. It’s also facing several government investigations related to the technology.\n\nOnly VW and Ford’s Argo AI and GM’s Cruise stayed focused exclusively on true self-driving cars.\n\nNow only one of them remains.\n\nCruise is offering some rides to passengers in San Francisco at night. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nGM’s Cruise offers a nighttime ridehail service in San Francisco, which completed 84 trips in June, 224 in July and 416 in August. (Driving in daytime is much harder as there’s more traffic including pedestrians and cyclists.) Ride fees are similar to riding with Uber or Lyft.\n\nCruise has lost $1.4 billion this year, and it cannot stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars per trip forever. It plans to expand service to offer rides in Austin and Phoenix later this year.\n\nCruise CEO Kyle Vogt said last week that “next year marks the beginning of our rapid scaling phase.”\n\nThere will be plenty of kinks to work out. The local government has raised safety and traffic concerns about Cruise’s expansion plans.\n\nSome longtime industry observers caution that self-driving technology still has a long way to go, a line of thinking Ford CEO Jim Farley echoed Wednesday.\n\n“Things have changed,” Farley said of Ford’s 2017 plans to broadly deploy self-driving cars in 2021.\n\nThe company is instead focusing on advanced driver-assist technology.\n\nAutomakers, aside from Tesla, largely rely on Mobileye, an Israeli tech company, for driver-assist technology. Intel spun out Mobileye last week, raising $861 million. The successful IPO suggests there’s still a robust market for driver-assist technology, even if it falls short of fully autonomous vehicles.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/business/tesla-fsd-california-dmv/index.html", "title": "Tesla's 'full self-driving' feature may have finally met its match | CNN ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\n“Full self-driving,” the controversially named driver-assist feature from Tesla, may have finally met its match.\n\nTesla’s foil isn’t a silver-haired US Senator, world-class autonomous driving experts, or some of the country’s preeminent safety advocates. They’ve all warned that “full self-driving” isn’t really full self-driving. The technology is designed to navigate local roads with steering, braking and acceleration, but it requires an attentive human driver who’s ready to take control and correct the system, which “may do the wrong thing at the worst time,” Tesla warns.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Elon Musk wants to end traffic. The company he built to do it may not deliver 02:06 - Source: CNN\n\nBut while these critics may have the traditional bully pulpit of the Senate or other institutions, they have no real power to change any policy on their own. An actual impact may instead come from an unglamorous public agency, one that many Americans think of as only capable of offering customers long wait times: the Department of Motor Vehicles. The California DMV has become the first US government entity to formally move against the naming of “full self-driving.”\n\nAutomotive regulation has traditionally fallen to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the Department of Transportation, and Congress, which can push NHTSA to regulate specific things like driver-assist technology. But NHTSA and Congress have spent recent years swept away in the excitement and lobbying surrounding a more eye-catching technology — fully autonomous vehicles.\n\nNHTSA has even exempted some robotaxis from its safety standards, and described many potential benefits of these technologies, including improved quality of life, safer roads, shorter commutes, lower energy usage and more access to jobs. It’s claimed in the past that leaving “breathing room for innovation” led to the development of technologies like air bags. Self-driving cars and trucks could, in theory, revolutionize transportation and save millions of lives if crashes become rarer, as supporters of the technology have predicted.\n\nCalifornia's DMV appears poised to take action on Tesla's \"full self-driving.\" Santiago Mejia/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed a law related to self-driving cars. It hasn’t acted on the more pedestrian driver-assist technologies.\n\nNHTSA has no standards for these systems, which has effectively left automakers like Tesla to decide what’s safe enough. But there are strong signs in the last year that NHTSA is shifting some of its attention to driver-assist technologies. It announced last summer, for instance, that automakers must report driver-assist crashes.\n\nNHTSA has also cited its powers to protect the public from motor vehicle risks that it received when created in 1970.\n\n“Given the rapid evolution of these technologies and testing of new technologies and features on publicly accessible roads, it is critical for NHTSA to exercise its robust oversight over potential safety defects,” it said.\n\nNHTSA has even taken steps toward standards for one driver-assist feature, automatic emergency braking. But the first major regulatory impact may be from that unlikely candidate, the California Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nMost Americans’ interactions with their own state DMV is limited to dreary, underfunded offices with long lines and beleaguered staff. Most people are there to fill out forms and pay fees for various bureaucratic duties that the agency undertakes.\n\nBut that is not the entirety of the California DMV.\n\nIt has long been a leader in regulating autonomous vehicles, largely due to the fact many companies developing autonomous vehicles are based in California. It released its own rules for testing autonomous vehicles in 2015, and hasn’t backed down from conflict.\n\nUber provoked the DMV in 2017 when it tested autonomous vehicles in San Francisco without a required DMV permit. The DMV revoked Uber’s vehicles’ registrations in response, and Uber pulled its cars from San Francisco streets. (Uber fled to the looser regulations of Arizona, but was kicked out of the state in 2018 after one of its test vehicles was involved in a high-profile fatal crash. It then sold its robotaxi business in 2020.)\n\nNow, the California DMV is flexing the type of muscle that could force Tesla to drop the name “full self-driving,” according to autonomous driving experts.\n\nThe DMV recently filed a complaint that says Tesla’s description of its driver-assist technologies, Autopilot and “full self-driving,” is deceptive and grounds for suspending or revoking its license to sell motor vehicles in the state. The risk of losing such a license may force Tesla’s hand. The automaker was founded in California, it’s made most of its cars in California, and its vehicles are among the best-selling in California. “Full self-driving” is even designed to be at its best in California’s San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nTesla’s use of the words “full self-driving” and “Autopilot,” as well as its descriptors of the technology on its website, suggest the vehicles are autonomous, when they aren’t, the DMV says in its complaint.\n\nTesla has long qualified the limits of its systems with disclaimers. But the DMV says in its complaint that one Tesla disclaimer “contradicts the original untrue or misleading labels and claims, which is misleading, and does not cure the violation.”\n\nIt’s unclear how Tesla and the DMV’s differences might be resolved, and the conflict could include lengthy litigation.\n\nA settlement could include changes to how Tesla talks about the systems on its website, a promise to avoid similar behavior in the future, or even new names for its products, according to Bryant Walker Smith, a professor at the University of South Carolina law school who researches autonomous vehicles.\n\n“Full self-driving describes a system that is used by a driver. That’s making me dizzy,” Smith said. “How can a driver use a full self-driving system?”\n\nTesla claimed in 2016 that all its new vehicles had the hardware capability for “full self-driving,” and it would soon offer complementary software for the cars to drive themselves. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said every year from 2015 to 2022 that self-driving Teslas were probably a year or two away. Tesla has released a beta version of “full self-driving” to more than 100,000 drivers, but the software requires constant vigilance as it sometimes makes dangerous decisions.\n\nThis is not the first fight over this type of language. A German court ruled in 2020 that Tesla’s language was misleading, which the automaker appealed last year.\n\nWaymo chose to stop using the term \"self-driving\" and refers to its vehicles as fully autonomous. Andrej Sokolow/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nWaymo, the self-driving subsidiary of Google’s parent company, stopped using the term “self-driving” in 2021, saying that misuse by other automakers was giving the public a false impression of its capabilities. Waymo began referring to its robotaxis as “fully autonomous.” Waymo, which operates robotaxis in the Phoenix area, does not need a human in the driver’s seat to ensure safe operation.\n\nThe California DMV’s actions are officially limited to the state, but the impact could be much greater. It’s routine for California to lead on regulations and for other states to follow, such as vehicle emission standards. California’s large population makes tailoring vehicles just for that state too expensive for most automakers.\n\n“Once you talk about one state investigating, you could talk about 50 states potentially investigating,” said Smith, adding that it will become easier politically and factually. “They’re not putting their necks out.”\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/15/cars/nhtsa-autopilot-robotaxi-crash-data/index.html", "title": "Teslas using driver-assist systems were involved in 273 crashes ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN Business —\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released on Wednesday nine months of crash data from vehicles using driver-assist technologies like Tesla Autopilot as well as fully autonomous vehicles like Waymo’s robotaxis.\n\nNHTSA broke crash data into two categories based on the level of the autonomous systems: driver-assist systems – which offer speed and steering input – and fully autonomous technologies, which are intended to one day safely function without human intervention. NHTSA found that there have been 367 crashes in the last nine months involving vehicles that were using these driver-assist technologies. 273 of the incidents involved a Tesla system, either its “full self-driving” software or its precursor, Tesla Autopilot.\n\nThere were 130 crashes involving fully automated driving systems, 62 of which were Waymo crashes. Transdev, a shuttle operator, reported 34 crashes, and Cruise, which offers robotaxis for General Motors in San Francisco, reported 23.\n\nThe data lacks critical context like fleet size or the number of miles traveled, making it impossible to fairly compare the safety of the different technologies. Not all relevant crashes may be included in the data set, NHTSA said, because crash data recording may vary widely among manufacturers.\n\nA Tesla dashboard is shown as the Autopilot software disengages during a drive in Brooklyn, New York. Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\n“I would advise caution before attempting to draw conclusions based only on the data we’re releasing. In fact, the data alone may raise more questions than they answer,” NHTSA administrator Steven Cliff told reporters in a briefing Tuesday.\n\nTwo of the technologies with the most reported crashes are also two of the most commonly used systems. Tesla Autopilot, for example, comes standard on all of its vehicles, unlike competing driver-assist systems from other automakers. Drivers describe using Autopilot regularly because they say it can make them feel less fatigued after long drives. Waymo, the other company with the most total crashes, operates the most extensive robotaxi service in the country, with operations in much of metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona and San Francisco.\n\nFor the first time, automakers and robotaxi operators have had to report to NHTSA data about crashes involving these vehicles. NHTSA says it will use the data to identify safety issues and intervene as necessary. Pony.ai, which is testing robotaxis in California, recalled three of its vehicles this year following data NHTSA gathered from this process.\n\nOf the 497 crashes total, 43% occurred in California. The state is home to Silicon Valley, making it a hotspot for testing new technologies.\n\nNHTSA found that of the 367 driver-assist crashes reported, there were six fatalities and five serious injuries.\n\nThe safety risks of these new technologies have drawn the attention of safety advocates for years. There are not specific regulations for driver-assist systems, leaving automakers to market and describe the systems as they so choose.\n\nTesla’s Autopilot and “full self-driving” software have been especially controversial. NHTSA’s investigation into Teslas rear-ending first responders’ vehicles was expanded last week and could lead to a recall.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has investigated fatal crashes involving Autopilot and called for the automaker to make changes, such as developing technology to more effectively sense the driver’s level of engagement and alert them when their engagement is lacking.\n\nTesla has released data since 2018 claiming that Autopilot has a lower crash rate per mile than typical driving. But safety experts caution that Tesla’s analysis compares apples to oranges, as most Autopilot driving takes place on highways, where crash rates per mile are much lower than all driving.\n\nTesla states that drivers using Autopilot must remain alert and be prepared to take full control of the vehicle at a moment’s notice. However, drivers using technologies like Autopilot risk becoming distracted, experts say.\n\nWaymo says it sees value in nationally standardized and uniform crash reporting as autonomous driving is developed. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nA 2021 MIT study found that Tesla drivers looked away from the road more frequently while using Autopilot than when driving without the driver-assist system.\n\nNHTSA said that its investigation into Teslas rear-ending emergency vehicles while using Autopilot found that in 37 of 43 crashes with detailed car log data available, drivers had their hands on the wheel in the last second prior to the collision.\n\nFor years, Tesla detected torque on the wheel to determine if a driver was engaged. It’s begun to use an in-car camera for detecting distraction, which many safety experts say is a superior method, as cameras can track eye movement.\n\n“We see value in having nationally standardized and uniform crash reporting during this early stage of the development and deployment of autonomous driving technology, and there’s public benefit in NHTSA sharing its findings,” Waymo said in response to the data.

But so far Tesla is struggling to produce 1,000 model three cars a week. There are also reports of some quality issues with the new vehicle, which would only serve to further dog production.\n\nExperts caution that Tesla increasingly is in a race against the clock, as a growing number of automakers announce plans to electrify part of all of their fleets.\n\nIf they follow through, Tesla will suddenly find itself going from being the only game in town to just one of many choices for consumers looking for an electric car, whether that's on the low end (consider the Chevy Bolt) or the high (the forthcoming Porsche Mission E sedan).\n\nMore:A trucker asleep in the cab?

Uber bought Otto last summer for $670 million.\n\nIn the ongoing case, Uber has argued that it has never used any of the documents allegedly taken by Levandowski to create its LiDAR technology. Waymo attorneys have said that Levandowski downloaded 14,000 files shortly before taking leave of his former employer, which has been working on autonomous tech since 2009 and recently announced it would be using its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans to ferry around passengers in the Phoenix area.\n\nThe race toward cars that drive themselves is accelerating, with dozens of technology and automotive companies in the running.\n\nMost experts assume that, at least initially, self-driving cars won't be privately owned but instead will be deployed by big companies as ride-hailing fleets in urban centers.\n\nUber may have had a huge valuation of nearly $70 billion, but Kalanick has repeatedly pointed out that the road to true profitability for companies like his remains anchored to the notion of not having to share ride revenues with drivers.\n\nLevandowski's role change comes at a time of intense internal and external scrutiny for Uber.\n\nKalanick has responded to allegations from a former employee of fostering a sexist environment by ordering an internal investigation and searching for a chief operating officer.

Tesla’s driver-assist features made significant advances in his tenure, but also have drawn increased scrutiny from regulators over their safety record.\n\n“It’s been a great pleasure to help Tesla towards its goals,” Karpathy tweeted. “Autopilot graduated from lane keeping to city streets and I look forward to seeing the exceptionally strong Autopilot team continue that momentum.”\n\nKarpathy said that he had no concrete plans for his next move, but he planned to revisit “technical work in AI, open source and education.”\n\n“Thanks for everything you have done for Tesla! It has been an honor working with you” CEO Elon Musk tweeted Wednesday.\n\nNeither Karpathy nor Musk provided an explanation for his departure. Karpathy’s five-year tenure was longer than many previous leaders on the Autopilot team. Tesla is notorious for a demanding culture that can lead to turnover, but it’s not clear if that played any role in his exit. Karpathy’s announced departure comes several months after Musk announced in March that Karpathy would be taking a roughly four-month sabbatical.\n\nKarpathy said at the time that he was traveling in Europe and Asia with only a backpack. He praised European cities during his travels for being more unique, clean, safe and “pedestrian/bike friendly.”\n\nIt’s not uncommon for Tesla executives to make a soft exit from the company, departing shortly after going on a leave of absence, like executive Doug Field, who led the development of the Model 3 and is now at Ford, or chief people officer Gaby Toledano.\n\nTesla owners have described seeing improvements to Autopilot during Karpathy’s tenure. Many say it makes them feel less fatigued after long trips. But Autopilot has also been controversial. Drivers can become distracted while using it, which has at times been deadly. Tesla has since expanded its driver monitoring technology, with an in-car camera. The naming of Tesla’s driver-assist technologies, Autopilot and “full self-driving,” have also been criticized as inducing more trust from some drivers than is prudent, given the systems’ limitations.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has spent nearly a year investigating reports of Teslas using Autopilot rear-ending first responder vehicles parked on highways to respond to crashes.\n\nThe investigation may lead to Tesla issuing a recall, or litigation between Tesla and the federal government.\n\nTesla already recalled “full self-driving,” an advanced version of Autopilot intended for city streets, earlier this year as it was not coming to complete stops at stop signs. The flaw was fixed with an over-the-air update, a recall fix that’s less onerous for automakers and consumers.\n\n“Full self-driving” has been celebrated by many of Tesla’s ardent fans. But many of their friends and loved ones have been less enthusiastic, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released data this month showing that Teslas using its driver-assist technology have been involved in 273 crashes.\n\n“Full self-driving” can drive in a jerky, uncomfortable manner. In some cases, it steers, brakes and accelerates smoothly. Other times, its flaws can be unsettling. Tesla warns drivers that it “may do the wrong thing at the worst time.”\n\nKarpathy was an advocate for Tesla’s unique approach to developing autonomous driving features. The automaker relies on cameras to perceive the world, rather than using additional sensors like radar and lidar, which are the norm among nearly all its competitors, including Alphabet’s Waymo and General Motors’ Cruise.\n\n“Is that person distracted and on their phone? Are they going to walk into your lane?” Karpathy said in 2019. “Those answers are only found in vision.”\n\nKarpathy was already highly regarded among artificial intelligence experts before joining Tesla in 2017. He left a position as a research scientist at OpenAI, a research laboratory that Musk was initially involved in. Karpathy also created Stanford’s first class on deep learning, a trendy type of artificial intelligence that’s seen huge gains in recent years. Karpathy studied artificial intelligence at the University of Toronto with Geoffrey Hinton, a legend in the field.\n\nKarpathy and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/05/30/tesla-autopilot-most-often-used-highway-driving-mit-researchers-say/656223002/", "title": "Tesla Autopilot most often used for highway driving, MIT researchers ...", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Tesla's innovative and controversial Autopilot software — which powers the partially self-driving features of its electric cars — is most often used for highway driving, according to the initial findings of an MIT study using volunteer owners.\n\nThe research, shared at a conference Wednesday in Cambridge, Mass., came a day after the latest crash of a Tesla using Autopilot and as two consumer groups renewed criticism of the software's name and marketing, which they say dangerously misleads drivers.\n\nLaunched in 2015, the software Tesla CEO Elon Musk once said could be \"safer than humans\" is receiving more scrutiny as the number of Teslas on the road increase and other automakers unveil their own, partially autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in an on-going study of 34 Tesla owners who volunteered for the project, found Autopilot was used during 36% of the miles driven by the 22-car test group (some cars are owned by couples).\n\n\"That it's actually being used quite often by most drivers jibes with what Musk has said,\" Bryan Reimer, research scientist in the MIT AgeLab and associate director of MIT's New England University Transportation Center, told USA TODAY.\n\nDrivers are most likely to use it for highway-speed driving, with the next biggest cluster between 25 and 45 miles per hour, Reimer said in an address Wednesday to the New England Motor Press Association's annual tech conference.\n\nMore:'Consumer Reports' reverses course, recommends Tesla Model 3 after Elon Musk improves brakes\n\nMore:Your fancy new car steers and brakes for you; so why keep your hands on the wheel?\n\nMore:Tesla, Uber crashes spotlight automatic emergency braking. Here's what it won't do.\n\nMore:Warning, drivers: Your car can cruise on its own, but you're still responsible\n\nTesla owners seem to come in a few flavors. Some adore their cutting-edge tech sedans but never engage Autopilot, but most are so enamored of the semi-autonomous features that they use them regularly to take some of the monotony out of driving. (In more extreme cases, they film themselves while the car drives itself.)\n\nReimer says that interviews with participants in other research test groups show a \"glaring gap\" in the understanding of automation and safety technology. He says that demands an increase in driver education on the part of stakeholders such as automakers, dealers and perhaps even licensing authorities.\n\nThat confusion may well have played a role in some of the recent crashes involving Teslas on Autopilot.\n\nThe latest one happened Tuesday in Laguna Beach, Calif., where a Model S hit and totaled a parked, but empty, police car.\n\nIn an earlier Utah crash, the driver — who sustained only a broken ankle after hitting a stopped fire truck at 60 mph — was looking at her phone and disengaged from driving for 80 seconds before impact. In March, the driver of a Model X died after his Autopilot-enabled car steered into a highway divider in Mountain View, Calif.\n\nIn each case, Tesla has responded by reminding consumers that the system is not meant to turn the vehicle into a self-driving car and that it requires constant driver oversight.\n\nBut Musk's enthusiastic forecast for the capabilities of Autopilot, as well as its name, often override those admonitions, two consumer groups say.\n\nConsumer Watchdog and the Center for Auto Safety held a press conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday to urge state and federal regulators to push Tesla to rename Autopilot and possibly require that it be tested further.\n\n\"People relying on Tesla (Autopilot) are getting killed, and that's what we're trying to stop,\" said John Simpson, privacy and technology project director at Consumer Watchdog, which has been dogging Tesla for years.\n\nSimpson said the two groups are urging California Department of Motor Vehicles officials to investigate how the electric automaker's claims about the technology match up to Autopilot's reality.\n\nJason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said the consumer groups also are asking the Federal Trade Commission to look into what they call \"dangerously misleading and deceptive marketing practices\" associated with Autopilot.\n\n\"Tesla has captured the imagination of the buying public with cars pitched directly to consumers by a celebrity CEO,\" Levine said. \"But the software and hardware (of Autopilot, which uses radar and cameras to scan the road ahead) needs to be improved or the name has to be changed. These recent deaths should give politicians pause.\"\n\nOne of the trickiest aspects of semi-self-driving cars involves the moment when a situation requires handing control back to the driver, also known as the \"handoff.\"\n\nAutomakers from Tesla to Nissan to Cadillac have used different kinds of feedback to force the driver to re-engage with the vehicle once this driver-assist tech is deployed.\n\nIn the MIT study, of the nearly 20,000 studied Autopilot \"disengagements\" — when control was handed back to drivers — a scant 0.5% were initiated by the car, with humans taking over for reasons ranging from planned maneuvers to complex road scenarios.\n\nThat result suggests this particular test group does not seem to be abusing the system, which would trigger various warnings to take back control of the vehicle.\n\nThe general public has been fascinated when it comes to the coming age of self-driving cars, a future heralded by some of technology's biggest names. But this effort took a hit in March when an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian in Arizona and led to the company pulling out of the statewide testing.\n\nJust how much confusion exists is hammered home by a finding from an MIT AgeLab survey question that asked respondents: \"To your awareness, are self-driving vehicles available for purchase today?\"\n\nNearly 23% said yes. But there are no self-driving vehicles available for purchase today; only cars with semi-autonomous features such as Autopilot.\n\n\"As I mentioned,\" Reimer says, \"there's a lot of confusion out there.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech writer Marco della Cava on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/13/business/tesla-recall-boombox/index.html", "title": "Tesla Boombox recall: Elon Musk blames 'fun police' for recall of ...", "text": "1.

Billions of dollars are at stake.\n\nTesla has been a technology leader and other companies are rushing to catch up, including Ford. Yet Tesla has also been in the news lately for federal crash investigations in Michigan and Florida to determine the role of driver-assist technology.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ford unveiled video showing highway testing of its Blue Cruise technology soon to be featured in already-sold Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150s.\n\nFarley tweeted at 9:22 a.m. to his 32,000 followers, \"BlueCruise! We tested it in the real world, so our customers don’t have to.\"\n\nWhile some read the tweet as a straight-forward alert that Ford testing is happening and the technology is coming soon, Tesla fans saw Farley throwing shade at Tesla.\n\n\"Ford CEO Jim Farley took a jab at Tesla's use of real-world owners to test its Full Self-Driving suite, while revealing its own BlueCruise,\" tweeted @Teslarati to its 422,700 followers at 6:30 p.m.\n\nTeslarati describes itself online as a \"California-based multi-platform media company and leading lifestyle brand with a focus on Tesla, SpaceX, and ventures affiliated with Elon Musk.\"\n\nMore than 10,000 Twitter users fueled debate into Thursday, including Musk.\n\nWhat's the controversy?\n\nFord’s Blue Cruise hands-free highway driving system is expected to be installed with over-the-air downloads in more than 100,000 vehicles by the end of the year. A $600 subscription fee will allow hands-free driving on 100,000 miles of highway in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nHands-free driving has, so far, been available only in Cadillac’s Super Cruise system, which debuted in 2017 but has been limited to a handful of CT6 sedans and Escalade. GM will add the feature to four more vehicles this year and plans to offer Super Cruise on 22 models by the end of 2023.\n\nLike Super Cruise, Ford’s Blue Cruise promises to outperform Tesla’s Autopilot, which does not offer hands-free driving — despite some Tesla drivers’ behavior to the contrary.\n\nThe Tesla website is clear:\n\nAutopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel ...\n\n... While using Autopilot, it is your responsibility to stay alert, keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times and maintain control of your car.\n\nand maintain control of your car. Before enabling Autopilot, the driver first needs to agree to “keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times” ... Every time the driver engages Autopilot, they are shown a visual reminder to “keep your hands on the wheel.\"\n\nElon strikes back\n\nResponding to what was perceived as bait from Farley, Musk responded at 6:35 p.m. to Teslarati, \"I found some footage of the drive.\"\n\nMusk posted a 2:39 video clip of the 1995 cult comedy movie \"Tommy Boy,\" featuring actors Chris Farley and David Spade behind the wheel of a vehicle completely out of control on the highway.\n\nTwitter went wild.\n\nMusk, a billionaire with 50.8 million Twitter followers, won raves.\n\n\"Using Farley to troll Farley is ... pretty hilarious. Even Mr. Ford Man has gotta crack a smile at this,\" tweeted Ryan McCaffrey at @DMC_Ryan to his 137,400 followers.\n\nMcCaffrey is host of Ride the Lightning, an unofficial Tesla podcast, and executive editor of previews at the IGN video game and entertainment website.\n\nThe real 'Tommy Boy'\n\nChris Farley is Jim Farley's cousin. He died just before Christmas 1997.\n\nWhen Jim Farley took his job with Toyota, he moved to Torrance, California, and left his cousin behind in Los Angeles. That same year, Chris Farley joined the cast of \"Saturday Night Live.\" on NBC. He had sought treatment for drug and alcohol addiction throughout his adult life, and Jim Farley tried to protect the family member who made everyone laugh. Between 1990 and 1997, the comedian surged to stardom with TV and film roles. He died at 33.\n\nThe drug overdose of Chris Farley crushed the tight-knit Irish Catholic family.\n\n\"He was going through fame, dealing with being a Wisconsin boy exposed to so much,\" Jim Farley told the Free Press in 2019. “Chris’ humor, in many ways, came from his dad, my father’s brother. ... I remember hearing so many times Chris talk to his dad about a character he was thinking about.\"\n\n\"Tommy Boy\" was actually inspired by real-life characters. It is about a father-son relationship and what happens when a son inherits an auto parts plant and must make the business work. He sets out on a cross-country sales trip with his assistant.\n\nIn real life, Chris' father, Tommy Farley, graduated from Georgetown University and returned home to Wisconsin to sell asphalt. The father often inspired characters for his comedian son.\n\nJim Farley has said talking about his cousin is painful, mixed with guilt and sadness and wondering years later what he could have done to save his cousin's life.\n\nIntense pressure\n\nThe Twitter sparring between CEOs is not trivial; it's revealing, Karl Brauer, executive analyst at ISeeCars.com, a car listing and data site, told the Free Press late Wednesday.\n\nHe downplayed the conflict and noted that Musk recently tweeted praise about Ford not needing a government bailout during the Great Recession.\n\n\"If you look at the totality of the situation, I do think there's kind of a mutual respect to the point where these two can jab at each other,\" Brauer said.\n\n\"There is a highly competitive race to see who gets full self-driving mastered first. There are a lot of players and a pretty big payoff at the end,\" Brauer said. \"So this is kind of a public sniping of two of the big players that have pressure on them to perform. They're all anxious about who's going to win.\"\n\nCrossing the line\n\nYet not everyone applauded Musk's tweet.\n\nSome responses were scathing, saying that using a clip featuring a Farley family member who died young to troll the Ford CEO was unfunny and lacked class. Other Twitter responses challenged Musk for making fun of reckless driving when Tesla was cited for \"lax safety practices\" last month by the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nE.W. Niedermeyer tweeted to his 13,100 followers from @Tweetermeyer, \"Bold take from a guy whose 'Autopilot' has been identified by the @NTSB as a contributing factor in multiple fatal crashes!\"\n\nNiedermeyer, author of \"Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors\", told the Free Press, \"Farley's jab was playful, but Elon took it to a decidedly less-playful place.\"\n\nThe issue of hands-free driving isn't a joke, he said.\n\n\"The important part of this is not the dynamic between two CEOs though, it's aspects of Autopilot's design that have contributed to at least three thoroughly investigated deaths. ... That's the real issue here. The fact that Musk continues to get away with selling a system that was designed to seem 'autonomous' rather than be safe ... as a society we are failing to live up to the responsibilities that come with new technologies.\"\n\n'Down by the river'\n\nJim Farley hadn't replied to the \"Tommy Boy\" tweet by Thursday morning.\n\nHe did reply to a @marc_benton tweet that asked, \"Why does the CEO of @ford make social media posts like this? An obvious dig at Tesla. And they wonder why Tesla 'super fans' trash them on social media.\"\n\nFarley: \"It's an excellent system for customers.\"\n\nMeanwhile, his Twitter profile @jimfarley98 makes reference to his cousin, and has for some time. It says, \"Mustang and racing fan. CEO @Ford. Happen to love white vans ... preferably down by the river.\"\n\nThat phrase \"down by the river\" was made famous by Chris Farley.\n\nHe premiered the character of Matt Foley, a divorced motivational speaker who lives in a van down by the river on \"SNL\" in 1993. He tells his young audience, \"You're not going to amount to jack squat. You're going to end up eating a steady diet of government cheese and living in a van down by the river.\"\n\nMore:Ford CEO Jim Farley is doing important work at TCF Center — and few know it\n\nMore:Jim Farley retweets Chrissy Teigen for 'those of us who have lost children'\n\nOnlineslang.com defines \"van down by the river\" as \"where a person in bad circumstances lives. From a Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Chris Farley.\" And lists as style of use, \"If you don't study hard in school, you'll be living in a van down by the river.\"\n\nFans used the latest Twitter thread to acknowledge Chris Farley.\n\nInvestment manager @EmmetPeppers tweeted to his 15,300 followers, \"I miss that guy.\"\n\nSoftware developer @KennyBastani tweeted to his 7,296 followers, \"When I was ten, Chris Farley showed up at my soccer team's practice because he was doing rehab nearby.

We got plenty of upsets on Day 1.\n\nThe highlight was No. 14 Oakland knocking off No. 3 Kentucky, a loss that raises a lot of questions about John Calipari's future. But Big Blue Nation isn't the only fan base left licking its wounds. A trio of 11-seeds — Duquesne, Oregon and NC State — knocked off their No. 6 counterparts. Needless to say, there aren't very many perfect brackets left.\n\nMen's NCAA tournament games are airing and streaming across CBS, TBS, TNT and truTV.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports provideed the latest news, scores, analysis and more all day. Here's how it unfolded.\n\nMarch Madness first round highlights\n\nOakland upsets Kentucky\n\nDuquesne upsets BYU\n\nDayton rallies past Nevada\n\nNCAA Tournament scores\n\nHere's the full scoreboard from Thursday's first-round games.\n\nMen's March Madness NCAA Tournament schedule\n\nHere's the full schedule for Friday's first-round games.\n\nMarch Madness scores so far\n\nHere's a look back at the results of Thursday's games:\n\nKansas holds on after benefitting from controversial foul call\n\nKansas may have caught a break.\n\nThe Jayhawks led by as many as 22 points in the second half, but Samford surged back and cut the deficit to one point with 20 seconds left. Kansas tried to move the ball around and got it up to guard Nicolas Timberlake.\n\nHe went for a dunk and Samford’s A.J. Staton-McCray contested it. It was called a foul, much to the objection of the Bulldogs.\n\nWhen the CBS broadcast showed a replay, Staton-McCray appeared to block the ball without touching Timberlake. Broadcasters Brad Nessler and Brendan Haywood both agreed it was a bad call, but the call couldn't be reviewed.\n\nSo, instead of it being a block with Samford potentially getting the ball back down by one, Timberlake got two free throws. He made both to make it a 92-89 game. Samford couldn’t tie the game on the next possession, and the Jayhawks won 93-89. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nRed-hot NC State dominates paint to beat Texas Tech\n\nThe No. 11-seed North Carolina State Wolfpack got into the NCAA Tournament by winning five games in five days last week, conquering the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament to “steal” an NCAA bid with an automatic berth. Five days later, they proved to be one of the hottest teams in the first round with an 80-67 win against No. 6-seed Texas Tech in Pittsburgh.\n\nBut they didn’t “steal” anything this time, except for the basketball eight times against Tech. They earned it by dominating the paint, 42-20, and closing out the game with a 28-18 scoring clip .\n\nA trio of Wolfpack big men combined for 54 points – Ben Middlebrooks, a transfer from Clemson, poured in a career-high 21 points. Forward DJ Burns, a transfer from Winthrop, had 16; while Missouri transfer Mohamed Diarra added 17.\n\nJust last week, they all had limped into their league tournament with four straight losses to end the regular season with a 17-14 record. They would not have gotten into the tournament without getting so hot. And now they’re on the verge of the Sweet 16, set for a second-round game Saturday against No. 14-seed Oakland University of Michigan. — Brent Schrotenboer\n\nSamford stages comeback. Can it upset Kansas?\n\nThe Bulldogs are back in it.\n\nAfter falling behind by 22 points, Samford’s offense has woken up and now trails Kansas 81-78 with less than five minutes left.\n\nThere were several runs made by Samford, but it was the 3-point shooting that got the Bulldogs back in the game. In the second half, Samford has made 7-of-14 3-point attempts.\n\nWashington State comes back to beat Drake\n\nIt trailed for a majority of the second half, but Washington State used a late run and Drake made costly turnovers, which helped the Cougars get their first NCAA Tournament win since 2008 with a 66-61 victory.\n\nDrake led by eight points with under seven minutes left, but Washington State used a 9-1 run to tie the game at 55. It was knotted up at 58, but a 3-point shot from Isaiah Watts gave the Cougars the lead for good. Back-to-back turnovers for Drake doomed it in the final 30 seconds.\n\nFree throws will haunt Drake after the loss. Despite being a top 40 free-throw shooting team, it couldn’t convert Thursday with a 6-for-14 mark from the charity stripe. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nKansas pulling away from Samford\n\nThe Jayhawks aren’t feeling the upset, extending their lead against Samford to 63-41 early in the second half.\n\nKansas used a 12-1 run to strengthen its lead against the Bulldogs, capped off by an emphatic dunk by K.J. Adams Jr., who scored half of the points during the run. He leads all scorers with 16 points on the night. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTennessee wins big, advances to face Texas in Rick Barnes reunion game\n\nTennessee coach Rick Barnes wasn’t good enough to keep his job at Texas in 2015, but now he’ll get a chance to put the Longhorns down in the second round after leading the No. 2-seed Volunteers to an 83-49 win over No. 15-seed Saint Peter’s in a first-round game in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nThe Volunteers throttled the Peacocks defensively, building a 46-20 lead at halftime and holding Saint Peter’s to 16-of-55 shooting (29.1%), including just 4-for-24 from 3-point range.\n\nStar guard Dalton Knecht, a transfer from Northern Colorado, led the way with 23 points and eight rebounds.\n\nThe Volunteers bounced back from losses in their previous two games to destroy Saint Peter’s, a small college in New Jersey known for making a run all the way to the Elite Eight in 2022.\n\nNow the Volunteers take on Texas, which fired Barnes in 2015 after 17 seasons. Tennessee hired him that same year. — Brent Schrotenboer\n\nKansas vs. Samford halftime: Underdogs handing around\n\nKansas may be hurt, but it’s giving Samford a tough game in the first round with the Jayhawks leading 48-38 at halftime.\n\nA hot start to the game got Kansas going with six of its first seven shot attempts going in to get a sizable lead. The Jayhawks did lead by as much as 16, but the Bulldogs aren’t out of the game yet, as they kept up in the final minutes to still have a shot of pulling off an upset.\n\nOne of the best offenses in college basketball, Samford has struggled against Kansas’ defense, with the Bulldogs shooting 13-for-37 (35.1%) in the first half and getting dominated on the glass. What’s kept the Bulldogs in it are Kansas’ turnovers, with 12 turning into 11 Samford points. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nAt some point in the next few days, John Calipari and Kentucky officials need to get in a room, lock the door and agree not to come out until they’ve reached a number that will end this agony.\n\nIt’s over.\n\nIt needs to be over.\n\nIt’s time for college basketball’s premier program and the sport's most underachieving coach to go their separate ways and do something different.\n\nIf Calipari returns to Kentucky next year after another March disasterclass — this time against Oakland Thursday in the first round of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament — he will be the most miserable multi-millionaire in a state that no longer wants him there and no longer envisions a revival in whatever magical abilities he once had. — Dan Wolken\n\nIt seems pretty likely that Oakland University men’s basketball coach Greg Kampe get a bonus payment for his No. 14-seeded team’s colossal, 80-76 upset of No. 3 seed Kentucky on Thursday night in an NCAA men’s basketball tournament first-round game.\n\nHowever, according to the university’s general counsel’s office, only two people know the amount: Kampe and Oakland athletics director Steve Waterfield.\n\nKampe’s contract with the school, obtained by USA TODAY Sports through an open-records request, includes a highly unusual arrangement under which any performance-bonus payments are at the AD’s discretion and based on unspecified goals that are to be determined annually and are subject to change at any time. — Steve Berkowitz\n\nNC State vs. Texas Tech halftime: Surprise ACC tourney winner aims for another upset\n\nCould a third 6-11 upset be in the cards Thursday?\n\nNo. 11 NC State, fresh off a surprise run to the ACC tournament final, leads No. 6 Texas Tech 37-33 at halftime.\n\nThe Wolfpack opened up its largest lead at 37-30, but the Red Raiders got a little bit of momentum back with Darrion Williams’ buzzer-beating 3-pointer.\n\nNC State’s Ben Middlebrooks leads all scorers with 14 points off the bench. — Jace Evans\n\nWashington State vs. Drake halftime: Cougars hold close lead\n\nIt was a first half of runs in Washington State vs. Drake, with the Cougars holding a 33-29 lead at the half.\n\nWashington State got out to an early lead, but Drake followed it with a 12-0 run to lead 21-15. After that, the Cougars went on a 13-2 run to lead 28-23 and both sides traded baskets for the remainder of the half.\n\nThe stats are nearly identical, with both teams making 13 shots and Drake knocking down three 3-pointers while Washington State has four made 3-pointers. The only real difference has been at the foul line, with Washington State making 3-of-6 from the charity stripe while Drake missing two free throw attempts. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTennessee vs. Saint Peter's halftime: No magic so far for Peacocks\n\nSaint Peter’s shocked the world in 2022 with a run to the Elite Eight out of the No. 15 spot.\n\nThe Peacocks are a No. 15 seed again, but this NCAA Tournament is shaping up to be a lot less magical.\n\nNo. 2 Tennessee was clinical in the first half against Saint Peter’s, shooting 64% from the field while limiting the Peacocks to 23.3% shooting. That disparity helped Tennessee take a 46-20 lead into the break.\n\nJonas Aidoo and Dalton Knecht are leading the way with 13 points apiece. — Jace Evans\n\nGonzaga vs. McNeese final: Bulldogs keep up first-round success\n\nWhile the world was watching No. 14 Oakland upset No. 3 Kentucky, Gonzaga was quietly doing what it does.\n\nThe No. 5 Bulldogs crushed McNeese State, leaving no doubt in an 86-65 victory. Gonzaga has now won at least one NCAA Tournament game every year the tournament’s been played since 2009.\n\nGonzaga led 48-25 at halftime and cruised home to victory. Five players scored in double figures, and all but three scored at least seven points.\n\nThe Bulldogs shot 51.7% from the field and hit 10-of-21 3-pointers (46.5%) while holding McNeese to just 33.3% shooting overall (and just 22.7% from three). — Jace Evans\n\nWith a history of heartbreak and a tortured relationship with the No. 2 seed, Iowa State fans may have been a little apprehensive heading into Thursday’s first-round NCAA Tournament game despite being a heavy favorite.\n\nThere was no need to worry.\n\nThe No. 2 Cyclones rode a sizzling shooting start into the second round by demolishing No. 15 South Dakota State, 82-65, on Thursday night to continue on in the NCAA Tournament at CHI Health Center. — Travis Hines, Des Moines Register\n\nWhile not as memorable as a No. 16 seed or a No. 15 seed pulling off a first-round stunner and while not as common as a No. 12 seed knocking off a No. 5 seed, a No. 14 seed toppling a No. 3 seed is one of the more thrilling possible outcomes in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe result embodies what millions across the country love about the frenetic opening days of March Madness — a program from a small conference getting the best of one of the sport’s top 15 teams, the vast majority of which come from one of college basketball’s most powerful leagues.\n\nIt took just one full day of the 2024 NCAA Tournament to produce such an upset. — Craig Meyer, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nDown goes Big Blue nation.\n\nThe No. 14 seed Oakland Golden Grizzlies used a memorable 3-point shooting performance by Jack Gohlke to stun No. 3 seed Kentucky, 80-76, in the biggest upset of the men's NCAA Tournament so far.\n\nOakland got off to a bad start after it missed its first seven shots of the day. But it shook it off with an outstanding 3-point performance, hitting 15 of 31 shots from beyond the arc - including 10 by Gohlke - to defeat the team that was the best 3-point shooting squad in the country. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nTexas vs. Colorado State final: Longhorns stave off Rams' comeback attempt\n\nThe Texas-Colorado State game seemed all but over when the Longhorns hit the half with a 27-11 lead.\n\nNo. 7 Texas did get the win in the end, beating No. 10 Colorado State 56-44, but it certainly wasn’t easy.\n\nThe Longhorns were ice-cold from 3-point range the entire game – they went just 1-for-14 behind the arc – and had several prolonged scoring droughts in the second half that allowed the Rams to get back into it after a dreadful first 20 minutes.\n\nThough the Rams cut the deficit to as little as seven points, in the end the hole they dug was too deep to climb out of.\n\nDylan Disu helped stave off complete disaster for Texas with some big buckets and free throws down the stretch. He finished with 12 points, which was somehow good enough to match the game high. He was joined in double figures by Chendall Weaver (11), who had a big and-1 that put Texas back up 12 with 3:07 to go, and Max Abmas (12).\n\nAs bad as Texas shot this game (40%), Colorado State was even worse (29.8%). The Rams were the sloppier team, too, committing 19 turnovers to the Longhorns’ 12. — Jace Evans\n\nGonzaga vs. McNeese halftime: Bulldogs dominate first half\n\nNo. 5 Gonzaga is up big against No. 12 McNeese and head into halftime with a 23-point lead. They led by as many as 24 points in the first half.\n\nBulldogs freshman Dusty Stromer and junior Graham Ike both have 10 points, while junior Nolan Hickman knocked down 3-of-4 3s to add nine points. Gonzaga is shooting 58.6% from the field and 8-for-11 from the 3-point line.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cowboys are 1-for-9 from 3 and are shooting a dismal 28.1% from the field. Senior Shahada Wells has a team-high six points and two rebounds, while junior Christian Shumate added five points and five rebounds. No McNeese player has reach double digits. — Cydney Henderson\n\nIowa State vs. South Dakota State halftime: Cyclones stay hot\n\nNo. 2 Iowa State hammered Houston in the Big 12 title game and kept the momentum rolling in the first half of its first-round game against No. 15 South Dakota State.\n\nThe Cyclones sprinted out to a 17-3 lead and looked well on their way to winning a laugher. But the Jackrabbits have at least made a game of things. Iowa State hits the half with a 40-33 lead.\n\nIowa State shot a blistering 63% from the field and hit five of its 10 3-pointers. Keep that up, and ISU should cruise to the second round. — Jace Evans\n\nKentucky vs. Oakland halftime: Jack Gohlke has Golden Grizzlies in lead\n\nOakland guard Jack Gohlke is having himself a night. The Golden Grizzlies guard scored 21 points in the first half, all from the 3-point line, to give No. 14 Oakland a 38-35 lead over No. 3 Kentucky. Gohlke is 7-for-13 from beyond the arc and is five 3-pointers away from setting a NCAA Tournament record. (Loyola Marymount’s Jeff Fryer knocked down a record 11 3s vs. Michigan in 1990.)\n\n“He better hit seven more if we want to win because we aren’t going to win if he and (Blake) Lampman don’t do that,” Oakland head coach Greg KampeI said, before pointing out the free throw disparity. “I don’t know why we just aren’t getting the call inside… We foul fewer than any team in the country, but all their points are coming from the line. We got to fix that. If we don’t fix that, we are going to lose.”\n\nThe Wildcats are 10-for-14 from the free-throw line, while the Grizzlies are 1-for-5.\n\nKentucky senior guard Antonio Reeves has 14 points and two rebounds. Tre Mitchell is near a double-double with eight points and 11 rebounds. The Wildcats are shooting 40.7% from the field and 3-for-10 from 3. — Cydney Henderson\n\nOakland’s Jack Gohlke hot from three vs. Kentucky\n\nDespite only scoring five points in the opening five minutes of the game, Oakland guard Jack Gohlke has led the No. 14 seeded Golden Grizzlies to a 23-17 lead over No. 3 seeded Kentucky with 7:23 remaining in the first half. Gohlke leads his team in scoring with 15 points off the bench, making 5-of-9 three pointers. Only three other Golden Grizzlies players have scored a field goal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Wildcats only have 17 points as a team, led by six points each from Tre Mitchell and Antonio Reeves. Kentucky is 0-4 from the three-point line. — Cydney Henderson\n\nPerfect bracket? Vast majority already have at least one loss\n\nOne quarter of the first round of the NCAA Tournament has been completed. Chances are, your bracket is already busted.\n\nThere's just 856 perfect brackets left in the USA TODAY Sports Men's Bracket Challenge out of 30,441 entries. ESPN pegs the number of perfect brackets on its site at 576,098 ... out of 21,538,558 entries.\n\nThe most likely bracket busters to this point are No. 11 seeds Duquesne and Oregon. — Jace Evans\n\nColorado State vs. Texas halftime: Longhorns pull away in snoozefest\n\nThe No. 7 seeded Texas Longhorns are up 27-11 over the No. 10 seeded Colorado State Rams at the halftime break of their first-round game.\n\nTexas guard Max Abmas made a long three-point bucket at the buzzer to provide a little excitement in what has otherwise been a dud. The shot was the Longhorns’ lone basket from beyond the arc so far.\n\nTexas went on a 25-3 run, including 14 unanswered points, after the Rams took an early lead. Colorado State has committed 11 turnovers.\n\nTexas forward Dylan Disu, who averages 15.8 points per game, has only scored two points in the form of the opening layup. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nColorado State vs. Texas: Longhorns wake up to take first lead\n\nAfter going down by six points, the No. 7 seeded Texas Longhorns found their rhythm and went on a 12-0 run. They are now up 14-8 over the No. 10 seeded Colorado State Rams with 8:04 on the clock in the first half.\n\nColorado State called timeout after Longhorns forward Dillon Mitchell tipped in his own layup for his first points of the game.\n\nA few minutes earlier, Texas guard Tyrese Hunter was fouled while making a layup, and he made the free throw to complete the three-point play.\n\nThe Rams haven’t scored in more than seven minutes. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nColorado State vs. Texas: Colorado State jumps out to early lead\n\nNo. 10 seed Colorado State is not missing a beat coming out of its First Four win and into the Big Dance. The Rams are up 8-2 over the No. 7 seed Texas Longhorns with 14:57 on the clock.\n\nGraduate student forward Dylan Disu scored the first points of the game – and the only one so far for Texas – with a layup. The Longhorns have turned over the ball three times.\n\nFour different players have scored for the Rams. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nDayton vs. Nevada final: Flyers rally, complete double-digit comeback\n\nNo. 7 seed Dayton trailed No. 10 Nevada by as many as 17 points in the second half before closing the game on a 24-4 run to advance to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Dayton will face No. 3 seed Arizona on Saturday.\n\nWith Nevada trailing Dayton 61-60, Wolf Pack forward Nick Davidson committed a turnover with 17 seconds remaining. Nevada fouled Dayton’s Nate Santos, who made both free throws to put the Flyers up 63-60 with 15 seconds left. Davidson missed a three-point attempt to tie it up and, after an offensive rebound, Kenan Blackshear air-balled a three as time expired.\n\nFlyers junior forward Daron Holmes II had a game-high 18 points, nine rebounds, three steals and one block. Junior guard Koby Brea added 15 points and two rebounds. Dayton shot 44.7% from the field and 8-for-19 from three.\n\nMeanwhile, Nevada senior guard Jarod Lucas had 17 points and four rebounds, while Davidson, a sophomore, had 15 points, seven rebounds and three steals. The Wolf pack shot 44.6% from the field and 7-for-20 from three. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNevada vs. Dayton: Flyers coming back late in second half\n\nNo. 10 Nevada led by as many as 17 points in the second half before No. 7 Dayton went on a 11-0 run to cut the Wolf Pack’s lead to 56-50 with 4:23 remaining in the game.\n\nFlyers junior forward Daron Holmes II has 15 points, nine rebounds, one block and two steals. Junior guard Koby Brea has 12 points and two rebounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Nevada sophomore forward Nick Davidson has 15 points, seven rebounds and three steals, while Jarod Lucas has 15 points and four rebounds. — Cydney Henderson\n\nOregon vs. South Carolina: No. 11 Ducks upset Gamecocks\n\nIt might not be as dramatic as Duquesne winning their first NCAA tournament game in 55 years, but we have our second No. 11 upset of a No. 6 team of the day.\n\nThe Oregon Ducks beat the No. 6 South Carolina Gamecocks 87-73 in first round action on Thursday in Pittsburgh.\n\nSenior guard Jermaine Couisnard, who transferred from South Carolina, scored a career-high 40 points. The mark is also the Oregon record for most points in a men’s NCAA Tournament game. His family was in attendance after making the six-hour drive from Chicago. It was the first time his grandmother attended one of his college games.\n\n“I knew I had to make sacrifices for her one day,” Couisnard said on the TNT broadcast. “That’s all I dreamed of was for her to come to one of my games.”\n\nOregon was in the driver’s seat the entire second half with a lead as high as 18 points. The Ducks had eight steals and six blocks.\n\nJunior guard Meechie Johnson led the Gamecocks with 24 points.\n\nThe Ducks will now play No. 3 Creighton in the second round. Head coach Dana Altman will face his former team. He was at the helm of Creighton for 16 seasons where he became the winningest men’s basketball coach in school history. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nDuke will be without sharp-shooting guard Caleb Foster for NCAA Tournament\n\nDuke freshman guard Caleb Foster is officially done for the season and won't return for the NCAA Tournament, head coach Jon Scheyer announced Thursday. Foster has been ruled out with a stress fracture in his ankle.\n\nFourth-seeded Duke (24-8) plays No. 13 seed Vermont (28-6) in a first-round game on Friday night at 7:10 ET on CBS.\n\n\"My heart breaks for Caleb because Caleb has done literally everything you could ask from a guy who has an injury and trying to get back out there,\" Scheyer said.\n\nScheyer said the injury is \"unique\" and the 6-foot-5, 197-pound Foster had several second opinions on the ankle. Foster also attempted to practice earlier in the week, but according to Scheyer, \"He wasn't able to really be himself.\"\n\nFoster has missed the previous five games for the Blue Devils. He made 15 starts in 27 games this winter, averaging 7.7 points, 2.4 rebounds and 2.1 assists a game, while hitting 40.6% of his 3-pointers. — Alex Abrami, Burlington Free Press\n\nIllinois' Marcus Domask makes history with NCAA Tournament triple double\n\nMarcus Domask etched his name in NCAA Tournament lore on Thursday.\n\nThe Illinois basketball guard recorded the 10th triple-double in March Madness history vs. 14 seed Morehead State with a 12-point, 11-rebound and 10-assist performance in an 85-69 victory over Morehead State.\n\nDomask notched his triple-double with a 3-pointer with 2:57 remaining in the game.

Shannon Jr. finished with 26 points.\n\nSenior Illini guard Marcus Domask finished with a triple-double, recording 12 points, 10 assists and 11 rebounds, marking just the 10th triple-double in NCAA Men’s Tournament history. He joins players like Ja Morant, Dwyane Wade, Draymond Green, Shaquille O’Neal and others.\n\nIllinois will play No. 11 Duquesne in the second round. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nNevada vs. Dayton score: Wolf Pack leads at halftime\n\nNo. 10 Nevada ended the first half on a 16-0 run to take a nine-point lead over the No. 7 Dayton.\n\nSophomore forward Nick Davidson has 10 points and three rebounds. Senior forward Tre Coleman has eight points, one rebound and one assist. The Wolf Pack are shooting 48.3% from the field and 4-of-9 from three.\n\n“We got out of character defensively. Once we settled down defensively, it kicked in our offense,” Nevada head coach Steve Alford said at halftime. “We got a lot of good stops, we got out in transition and we’re making our shots… If we can hold them to 25, that’s pretty good.”\n\nFlyers junior forward Daron Holmes II has eight points, seven rebounds, one block and one steal. No Dayton scorers are in double digits. Dayton is shooting 41.7% from the field and 3-of-12 from three. — Cydney Henderson\n\nOregon vs. South Carolina score: Ducks still up after halftime buzzer beater\n\nNo. 11 Oregon established its dominance down the stretch of the first half to go into the break up 34-29 over South Carolina.\n\nA beyond-halfcourt shot from Ta'Lon Cooper at the buzzer snapped a field goal drought of more than eight minutes for the Gamecocks.\n\nAfter both teams went back and forth to open the game, the Ducks surged ahead for a 10-point lead with 1:57 on the clock. They entered the break on a 20-9 run. Oregon's senior guard Jermaine Couisnard, who transferred from South Carolina, is the game’s leading scorer with 14 points.\n\nSouth Carolina doesn’t have a player who’s scored double digits and is being kept alive by making seven of nine free throws. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nIllinois vs. Morehead score: No. 3 Illini finally pulling away\n\nIllinois is getting its much-needed secondary scoring option in the form of junior forward Dain Dainja — and the Illini might just be pulling away.\n\nComing off the bench, Dainja has become a force on the glass, particularly on the offensive end.\n\nDainja is a perfect eight-of-eight from the field with 17 points and seven rebounds, four of which have been offensive boards. He has 13 second half points.\n\nIllinois is on a 9-0 run and leads 57-48, with 11:59 left to play. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nIllinois vs. Morehead State: Illini in danger of upset\n\nThe senior guard continues to be the Illini offense with a game-high 21 points. If you take his shooting out of the equation, the rest of Illinois is combined to go just 9-of-22 (40.9%) from the field.\n\nNo. 14 Morehead State has gone to a very short rotation, playing just a six-man rotation. But the Eagles are keeping things competitive, making 3 pointers (7-of-16) and forcing the Illini into eight turnovers.\n\nMorehead State is up 45-44, with 15:58 left in the game. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nNorth Carolina vs. Wagner final: Tar Heels win 90-62\n\nThe No. 1 Tar Heels cruised to the second round of March Madness after leading by as many as 30 points in their 90-62 victory over No. 16 Wagner, who advanced to the round of 64 with a First Four win.\n\nNorth Carolina senior guard R.J. Davis, the ACC player of the year, had a game-high 22 points, two assists and one steal, while senior forward Armando Bacot recorded a double-double (20 points, 15 rebounds) in his final NCAA Tournament. Senior forward Jae’lyn Withers also had a double-double coming off the bench, with 16 points and 10 rebounds. The Tar Heels shot 55% from the field and 9-for-18 from three.\n\nNorth Carolina is 33-2 in the round of 64 since 1985.\n\nSize and depth proved to be the difference. The Seahawks were outrebounded 43-24 in the contest and had 20 points in the paint, compared to North Carolina’s 48.\n\nWagner sophomore guard Julian Brown recorded 18 points and one steal, while junior guard Melvin Council Jr had 18 points, two blocks and four rebounds.\n\nNorth Carolina will face No. 9 Michigan State next. — Cydney Henderson\n\nIllinois vs. Morehead State score: Illini lead at halftime\n\nNo. 3 Illinois has settled, its star guard is going off and the Illini claimed the lead late in the first half.\n\nThe Illini went on an 13-4 scoring three-quarters of the way through the first half, as senior guard Terrence Shannon Jr., the country’s third-leading scorer at 23 points per game, dropped 19 in the first half on 7-of-13 shooting.\n\nFellow Illini senior guard Marcus Domask has been quiet on the score sheet, going just one-of-five from the floor with two points, but he has a game-high six assists.\n\nIllinois has the edge in fast-break points (eight to three) and points in the paint (16:10).\n\nAnother area of concern for No. 14 Morehead State: the Eagles made their first trip to the free-throw line with 3:22 left in the first half. The Eagles, though, are getting solid showings from senior guards Riley Minx and Jordan Lathon, each of whom have 12 points.\n\nIllinois is up, 39-38, headed into the half. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nNorth Carolina vs. Wagner: Tar Heels pulling away in second half\n\nThe Tar Heels went on a 10-2 run to extend their lead over the Seahawks to 20, their largest of the game, with 7:58 remaining in the first-round matchup.\n\nSenior guard R.J. Davis is getting rolling, scoring 11 of his 16 points in the second half after a slow start. Armando Bacot is up to 18 points, 14 rebounds, one block and one steal.\n\nWagner sophomore guard Julian Brown has a team-high 18 points, while junior guard Melvin Council Jr had 14 points, two blocks and three rebounds. — Cydney Henderson\n\nArizona vs. Long Beach State final: Wildcats win 85-65\n\nSnoop Dogg’s bracket is busted.\n\nBut no upsets here as No. 2 Arizona beat No. 15 Long Beach State 85-65 in the first round of the men’s NCAA Tournament in Salt Lake City.\n\nSophomore guard Kylan Boswell had a career-high 20 points with eight assists and former Tar Heels player Caleb Love added 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Wildcats. The team made 13 three-point buckets and had 10 steals and eight blocks.\n\nArizona was up by as many as 24 points after a back-and-forth first half.\n\nThis is redemption for the Wildcats, who were ousted in the first round of last year’s tournament. They were a No. 2 seed then as well and were upset by No. 15 Princeton.\n\nThe Wildcats will play the winner of No. 7 Dayton vs. No. 10 Nevada.\n\nThis marks the end of 49ers head coach Dan Monson’s run with the team. Ahead of the tournament, he agreed to part ways with the program after the season.\n\nSnoop Dogg, a Long Beach native, had Long Beach State going to the Elite Eight. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nMorehead State vs. Illinois: Eagles up in first half\n\nAfter a smooth and free-flowing pace to the start of this game, both Illinois and Morehead State found the muck.\n\nBricked shots, turnovers and disjointed play has slowed the pace down some; from 14:04 in first half to 10:35, both teams combined to score just five points. But, just as quickly as play slowed down, it picked right back up. Illinois senior guard Terrence Shannon Jr. is on fire, with 14 points on 5-of-8 shooting.\n\nEach time Illinois has put up some resistance, however, Morehead State has answered back. Out of the last seven Illinois field goals, Morehead State has responded with its own basket on the following possession five times.\n\nThe Eagles are shooting 11-of-22 (50%) from the field and hold a 27-23 lead with 7:06 left to play in the first half. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nLeBron James congratulates Duquesne, former coach on upset\n\nLeBron James was proud of his high school coach, Keith Dambrot, for leading the No. 11 Duquesne men’s basketball team to an upset over No. 6 Brigham Young. The first round win is the Dukes’ first victory in the Big Dance since 1969.\n\n\"AYYYYYYYEEEEE!!! First tournament win in 55 years! @CoachDambrot,\" the Los Angeles Lakers star posted on X, formerly Twitter, with a goat and clapping hands emojis. \"@DuqMBB Keep it going.\"\n\nDambrot coached James in his first two seasons at St. Vincent-St. Mary's High School in Akron, Ohio and is now head coach for the Dukes. Also on the Duquese staff is associate head coach Dru Joyce III, who played with James in high school and remains a friend of his today.\n\nAhead of the first round matchup, the 20-time NBA All-Star gifted the Dukes players each a pair of his signature shoes. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nIllinois vs. Morehead State: Illini battling back\n\nNo. 14 Morehead State punched first, but the No. 3 Illinois Fighting Illini have fought back.\n\nAfter starting 0-for-4 from the field, Illinois made its next five shots to close an early lead. Morehead State, with Illinois’ cold shooting, actually raced out to an early 9-0 lead. The Eagles, who play a deliberate style of half court offense, are shooting 7-of-12 (58.3%) from the field, including 3-of-4 from 3-point range.\n\nThe concern for Illinois, however, is that only two players have scored and one of those, guard Terrence Shannon Jr., has nine of the team’s 13 points.\n\nMorehead State is up 17-13 at the first media timeout. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nNorth Carolina vs. Wagner halftime: Tar Heels lead 40-28\n\nNo. 1 North Carolina is sitting comfortably with a double-digit lead over No. 16 Wagner heading into halftime. Senior forward Armando Bacot already has a double-double, with a game-high 14 points and 11 rebounds. Senior forward Jae’lyn Withers added 10 points and 5 rebounds, while R.J. Davis, the ACC player of the year, has been held to only five points through the first half. The team is shooting 51.9% from the field and 2-for-7 from three.\n\nThe Tar Heels have used their size to their advantage, outrebounding the Seahawks 25-14 in the first half. North Carolina also has 24 points in the paint, compared to Wagner’s 12.\n\nMelvin Council Jr has a team-high 10 points and three rebounds. He’s the only Seahawks player in double digits. Wagner, who only has seven active players on their roster, has no bench points so far and is collectively shooting 32.4% from the field and 2-for-10 from three. — Cydney Henderson\n\nCreighton vs. Akron final: Bluejays moving on\n\nNo. 14 Akron, which was 0-5 all-time in the men's NCAA Tournament games headed into Thursday, will have to wait some more to get its first-ever victory in the big dance.\n\nNo. 3 Creighton went cold down the stretch, scoring only three points during a six-minute span, before the Bluejays put the Zips away to win their first-round game, 77-60.\n\nCreighton had all five of its five starters in double figures, with senior center Ryan Kalkbrenner leading the way with 23 points and eight rebounds, as senior guard Baylor Scheierman chipped in a double-double with 15 points and 13 boards.\n\nCreighton will play the winner between No. 6 South Carolina and No. 11 Oregon. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nDuquesne NCAA Tournament history\n\nBy virtue of its first-round upset against BYU, Duquesne is heading to the NCAA Tournament's second round.\n\nThe Dukes are making their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1977 and this was their first win since 1969, when they made it to the Sweet 16.\n\nDuquesne's only Final Four appearance came in 1940.\n\nDuquesne vs. BYU: Dukes notch first upset of March Madness 2024\n\nJust two games into the first round of the men's NCAA men's tournament and we already have our first upset.\n\nThe No. 11 seed Duquesne defeated No. 6 seed Brigham Young 71-67 in the first game from the East Region to continue what has been an impressive run for the Dukes in recent weeks.\n\nThe win started with Duquesne opening the game on a 9-0 run as BYU missed its first eight shots. The Cougars eventually caught up to lead 20-19 more than halfway through the first half, but Duquesne responded with a 14-1 run to take back a lead it wouldn't give up the rest of the way. Duquesne led by as much as 14 in the second half, but BYU stormed back to tie it with 90 seconds to go. Duquesne was then able to nail its free throw attempts and get a big late layup from Jimmy Clark III to pull away from the Cougars.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the Duquene Dukes. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNorth Carolina vs. Wagner: Tar Heels doing what a top seed should\n\nThe West Regional’s No. 1 seed, North Carolina, is getting balanced scoring, with a pair of players – senior forwards Armando Bacot and Jae’lyn Withers each in double figures – and six players on the score sheet.\n\nNorth Carolina is shooting 11-of-17 (64.7%) from the field, with most of its points coming in the paint, and the Tar Heels are also limiting No. 16 Wagner to just 8-of-25 (32%).\n\nNorth Carolina is up 33-23 with 5:34 left to play in the first half. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nCreighton vs. Akron: Bluejays extend lead with red-hot shooting performance.\n\nThe Bluejays are 9-of-13 on field goals in the second half and are lights out from 3-point range, going 10-of-15 overall (66.7%) from beyond the arc.\n\nCrieghton’s 7-foot-1 senior center Ryan Kalkbrenner continues to be a dominant presence in the paint on defense. While he has recorded only one block against the Zips, he has constantly forced Akron's players to adjust their shot angles.\n\nCreighton has opened a 20-point lead, 67-47, with just fewer than nine minutes left to play. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nMichigan State NCAA Tournament history\n\nThe Spartans are moving on to the second round of the NCAA Tournament after taking down Mississippi State 69-51 on Thursday.\n\nMichigan State is in the NCAA Tournament for the 26th consecutive time, dating back to 1998. There was no tournament in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Spartans will play the winner of No. 1 North Carolina vs. No. 16 Wagner on Saturday. Michigan State will be looking for its second consecutive Sweet 16 berth and 15th since 1998.\n\nMichigan State has won two national championships, its most recent coming in 2000.\n\nArizona vs. Long Beach State halftime: Wildcats lead 41-35\n\nNo. 2 Arizona leads No. 15 Long Beach State 41-35 at halftime.\n\nThere was a stall with less than 10 seconds left before the break while officials figured out the exact time on the clock for a Long Beach State inbound. Once they figured it out, Jason Hart Jr. missed a jumper at the buzzer.\n\nThe first period was a bit of a back and forth, but the Wildcats ended on a 15-4 run.\n\nArizona took an eight-point lead early and the 49ers came back to take a five-point lead. There were a few ties before the Wildcats pulled away in the last two minutes of the game. Former Tar Heels star Caleb Love drained a three-point bucket as part of their surge.\n\nWildcats sophomore guard Kylan Boswell is the leading scorer with 11 points and five assists. He’s the only player in double digits.\n\nLong Beach state head coach Dan Monson is essentially playing for pride points as he agreed with school officials that this would be his last season before the 49ers got a berth in the Big Dance.\n\nRap star Snoop Dogg, a Long Beach native, has the 49ers going to the Elite Eight. -- Victoria Hernandez\n\nCreighton vs. Akron: Bluejays open up 14-point lead\n\nCreighton has started the second half on a 17-8 run to claim a 56-42 lead with 14:20 left in the game.\n\nAkron has been outscored 25-8 since 2:50 mark of first half. — Casey Moore\n\nDuquesne vs. BYU: Dukes respond from Cougars run\n\nDuquesne and BYU are trading baskets late in this one, and the Cougars recorded the first tie of the game with 1:47 left to play.\n\nDuquesne answered with a pair of Jimmy Clark III free throws after he drove to the basket to draw the foul. Duquesne is up two, with a pair of free throws upcoming.\n\nThe Cougars are only 1-10 this season in games in which they’ve trailed inside of five minutes left to play. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWhen does North Carolina play in NCAA Tournament\n\nThe No. 1 seed in the West Region, North Carolina opens March Madness play shortly against No. 16 seed Wagner.\n\nThe Tar Heels and Seahawks are following Michigan State's 69-51 win against Mississippi State. The winner of their game will take on the Spartans.\n\nThe game will be televised on CBS.\n\nDuquesne vs. BYU: Dukes respond from Cougars run\n\nBYU ripped off a 7-0 run to make it a one-point game, but the Dukes quickly answered with an and-one from forward Fousseyni Drame.\n\nThe problem for Duquesne is that BYU senior guard Jaxson Robinson is on an absolute heater, with a game-high 25 points. After Drame drained his free throw, Robinson sunk a 3-point shot.\n\nThe Cougars have tightened up on defense, making each Duquesne possession a grind with active hands and ball denial.\n\nBuckle up because this one could come down to the final possession. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nArizona vs. Long Beach State: 49ers staying even with Wildcats\n\nMarch Madness is underway and fans can flip from game to game without blinking.\n\nIn the West Region, the No. 15 seed Long Beach State 49ers are tied 22-22 with the No. 2 seed Arizona Wildcats with 7:28 to play in the first half.\n\nThe 49ers took an 18-17 lead midway through the period when Amari Stroud made a three-point bucket and then furthered the lead with a layup from Marcus Tsohonis. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nWhen does Illinois play in the NCAA Tournament?\n\nIllinois, the No. 3 seed in the East Region, will get their tourney run started shortly against No. 14 Morehead State, a matchup scheduled for 3:10 p.m. ET.

The winner will play the Wisconsin-James Madison winner.\n\nDuquesne vs. BYU: Cougars finally matching Dukes' physicality\n\nIt’s not a coincidence that BYU is making its run in the second half after stepping up the physicality.\n\nThe Cougars closed the gap to three points with 7:41 left to play. Most promising for BYU is that it is finding ways to score in the paint. The Cougars, known as a team that relies on the 3-point shot, are 1-for-7 from beyond the arc in the second half and just 6-of-21 (28.6%) in the game overall.\n\nAs he did in the first half, senior guard Jaxson Robinson is the providing the difference. He leads all scorers with 22 points, including the last seven BYU points. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nMichigan State vs. Mississippi State final: Spartans win 69-51\n\nNo. 9 seed Michigan State made it through the first round of the NCAA tournament with a 69-51 win over No. 8 seed Mississippi State.\n\nThe Spartans led the entire game in Charlotte, North Carolina, and their 18-point margin at the end was their largest of the day.\n\nTo put the icing on the cake, senior guard Davis Smith, the son of Michigan State legend Steve Smith, made a three-point bucket with 27 seconds on the clock with an assist from graduate student guard Steven Izzo, head coach Tom Izzo’s son.\n\nThe shot was one of 10 three-point baskets the Spartans made to dominate the Bulldogs, who only made six buckets from beyond the arc.\n\nMichigan State graduate student guard Tyson Walker was the game’s leading scorer with 19 points. Jaden Akens added 15. For Mississippi State, freshman guard Josh Hubbard had 15 points.\n\nThis is Michigan State’s sixth straight round of 64 win and their 14th time advancing past the first round in 17 tournament appearances.\n\nThe Spartans will play the winner between No.1 seed North Carolina and No. 16 seed Wagner.\n\nAkens wasn’t fazed at the possibility of playing the top-seeded Tar Heels.\n\n“We gonna be ready to play,” he said on the CBS broadcast. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nKansas' Bill Self issues statement on Kevin McCullar Jr.\n\nSince the news broke that Kansas basketball would be without graduate senior guard Kevin McCullar Jr. due to injury for the NCAA Tournament, speculation has swirled about McCullar’s status.\n\nBut Thursday, ahead of the No. 4 Jayhawks’ game against No. 13 Samford, Kansas coach Bill Self took a rare trip to social media to address what’s being said.

Then Mason Miller hit a tiebreaking 3 and Baylor Scheierman made a jump shot with under a minute to go.\n\nCreighton is shooting 60% from the field, including 7 of 10 from 3-pointers. — Casey Moore\n\nDuquesne vs. BYU: Dukes defense leading the way\n\nThe Dukes' perimeter defense continues to be the reason why they have such a commanding lead.\n\nDuquesne is up 14 – its largest of the game – with 15:58 left to play in the second half. It continues to harass BYU’s players beyond the 3-point line, crowding them and jumping into passing lanes to force tips and steals.\n\nThe Cougars ranked second in the country this season in both 3-pointers made (11.2 per game) and attempted (32.2). Duquesne has limited BYU to 5-of-16 shooting (31.3%) from beyond the arc, and the Duke have shot lights out from three, going 7-of-15 (46.7%). — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nArizona vs. Long Beach State underway\n\nAnd, at least for another two minutes, we have four games at the same time.\n\nNo. 2 Arizona takes on No. 15 Long Beach State in a first-round game in the West Region. — Casey Moore\n\nCreighton vs. Akron: Zips, Bluejays deadlocked\n\nAkron is giving Creighton fits on defense and the Zips are tied with the Bluejays at 31-31 at the 3:28 mark.\n\nCreighton has gone more than three minutes with a basket, and Akron has received a big first half from both of their big men, Enrique Freeman (13 points) and Ali Ali (9 points).\n\nCreighton's Ryan Kalkbrenner has made 5 of 8 shots for a team-high 11 points. — Casey Moore\n\nMichigan State vs. Mississippi State: Spartans keeping Bulldogs at a distance\n\nMichigan State is now up 60-45 over Mississippi State with 7:39 left in the second half.\n\nAfter the Spartans nabbed two offensive rebounds on the same possession, a 3-point basket from Tre Holloman reestablished the Spartans’ 14-point lead, their largest margin that they also had earlier in the game.\n\nA free throw from A.J. Hoggard gave Michigan State a 15-point margin for a new largest lead.\n\nThe Bulldogs have had a few dunks to give them bursts of life, two from Cameron Matthews and one from Tolu Smith.\n\nBut Michigan State has made seven three-point shots and five of their six free throws while Mississippi State has only made one from the charity stripe. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nCreighton vs. Akron: Zips staying close\n\nAkron is staying with Creighton, down 21-19 with 11:23 left to go in the first half.\n\nEnrique Freeman has a game-high nine points for the Zips, while junior guard Trey Alexander leads the Bluejays with eight. — Casey Moore\n\nDuquesne vs. BYU halftime: Dukes maintain 38-30 lead\n\nNo. 6 BYU looked poised to close the half on a little run, but late turnovers and missed shots allowed No. 11 Duquesne to maintain a healthy, eight-point margin headed into the half.\n\nSo, for the first time in the men’s tournament, we’re on upset alert.\n\nKnown as a streaky team, the Cougars were on a 7-0 run late in the half and closed the deficit to three, before the Dukes fought back and ended the half on a mini 5-2 spurt of their own. Freshman Duquesne forward Jakub Necas, from the Czech Republic, poured in eight points off the bench, including 2-of-3 from 3-point range.\n\nDuquesne is up 38-30 and the Dukes have a 17-5 record this season when leading at the half. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nCreighton vs. Akron: It's raining 3-pointers in Pittsburgh\n\nThe Zips and Bluejays have combined for six 3-pointers as Creighton is off to an 18-14 lead.\n\nAkron star and MAC players of the year Enrique Freeman already has three, which is a career-high. Freeman is a 6-7 forward who only made 17 3-pointers all season. —Casey Moore\n\nMichigan State vs. Mississippi State: Spartans take largest lead of game\n\nThe Spartans stormed out in the second half to go up 43-29 over Mississippi State. The 14-point lead is Michigan State’s biggest of the game.\n\nThe second half has featured the first free throws of the game. The Spartans’ Malik Hall made his two shots early in the period and then made a layup later on. Tyson Walker was fouled and made both free throws to put Michigan State at this score. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nCreighton vs. Akron underway\n\nThat last channel button is about to be put to work as No. 3 Creighton and No. 14 Akron have started play in their first-round game in the Midwest Region.\n\nThe Bluejays-Zips matchup give us three games to balance. Isn't it great? — Casey Moore\n\nDuquesne vs. BYU: No. 11 Dukes have been better team\n\nDuquesne has blitzed double teams when BYU has had the ball in the post, leading to Cougar kick outs, but the Dukes' help defense has rotated in to pick off several steals. BYU has not made a single field goal in more than six minutes.\n\nOn the other end, senior Duquesne guard Dae Dae Grant is scoring at all three levels, getting into the paint and finishing, and waiting for defenders to go under screens so he can have the space to drain perimeter shots.\n\nThe Dukes ripped off a 14-1 run to take a 12-point lead with 2:32 left to play in the half. – Lorenzo Reyes\n\nDuquesne vs. BYU: Cougars bench keeping them in game\n\nFifteen of BYU’s first 20 points have come off the bench, with senior guard Jaxson Robinson carrying the load. He leads all scorers through the first 14 minutes of play, with 13 points on 3-of-5 shooting, and a perfect 4-of-4 on free throws. Robinson helped BYU, which started out in an early 9-0 hole, take a brief lead, though Duquesne stormed back and now holds a 24-20 edge with a little more than six minutes to play in the half.\n\nThe Dukes are shooting 47.6% from the floor, but holding BYU to just 31.6% on the other end. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nMichigan State vs. Mississippi State halftime: Spartans lead 31-24\n\nMichigan State got a bit of a scare midway through the first half when Mississippi State went on a 7-0 run. But the Spartans brushed themselves off and rallied to finish the period up 31-24 with a jumper from Malik Hall at the buzzer.\n\nTom Izzo’s team had nine turnovers in the first half. They made five 3-point shots and the Bulldogs didn’t score one until their late run, but tallied four before the break.\n\nMississippi State freshman guard Josh Hubbard is the leading scorer with 13 points. Graduate student guard Tyson Walker has 10 points for Michigan State.\n\nThere were no free throw attempts by either team in the first half. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nMichigan State vs. Mississippi State: Spartans squash Bulldogs run\n\nMississippi State went on a 7-0 run late in the first half, including a 3-point bucket from Josh Hubbard. It was the Bulldogs’ first shot from beyond the arc of the game. Spartans guard Jaden Akins snapped the streak with a jumpshot.\n\nDuring the Bulldogs’ scoring stretch, Michigan State had five turnovers, but cleaned up their game to go up 29-18 with 2:56 left before the half. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nDuquesne vs. BYU: Bad start for Cougars\n\nBYU is still looking for its first field goal of the tournament more than four minutes into their game against Duquesne, going 0-for-6 from the field.\n\nThe Cougars also momentarily lost sophomore guard Dallin Hall, who took an elbow to the nose as Duquesne forward Fousseyni Drame came down with a rebound. Hall crumpled to the ground and immediately checked his face, eventually seeing some blood dripping down his nose. Medical staff tended to him, plugging his nose with cotton. He briefly left to the locker room but returned to the bench.\n\nDuquesne ran out to a 7-0 lead at the first television timeout. ― Lorenzo Reyes\n\nLeBron James' gift to Duquesne players\n\nLeBron James didn't play collegiate ball, but he still has some rooting interest in this year's March Madness.\n\nDuquesne coach Keith Dambrot was James' coach for his first two seasons at St. Vincent-St. Mary in Akron, Ohio. The two have maintained contact over the years, and James gifted his signature shoes (in white and light blue) to the players ahead of their first-round game against BYU.\n\nJames' longtime close friend and former teammate Dru Joyce is also an associate head coach for the Dukes. — Casey Moore\n\nDuquense vs. BYU underway\n\nThe second game on today's March Madness schedule is underway, as No. 6 BYU is taking on No. 11 Duquesne in the East Region.\n\nThe game can be found on truTV.\n\nMichigan State vs. Mississippi State: Spartans up big early\n\nMidway through the first half of play in the NCAA Tournament’s opening round, Michigan State leads Mississippi State 20-8. The Spartans have been ahead the entire game.\n\nA KeShawn Murphy steal that he tossed to Josh Hubbard for a layup brought Mississippi State within two points, but a few possessions later, Mady Sissoko slammed a dunk. Tyson Walker made back-to-back three-point baskets to further Michigan State’s lead again.\n\nWith 10:21 left in the first half, Michigan State’s Tyson Walker leads all scorers with eight points. The Spartans have made four 3-point shots while the Bulldogs have yet to drain a shot from beyond the arc.Mississippi State head coach Chris Jans said the team is managing graduate forward DJ Jeffries’ time – he has two points so far and was limping when he was subbed off – because he’s dealing with an injury he suffered in the SEC tournament. ― Victoria Hernandez\n\nNCAA tournament streaming free\n\nYou can catch every second by streaming every game through a few different options.

Taking over his duties will be Adam Zucker.\n\nGumbel, 77, has been a tournament staple for CBS for decades, first hosting the network's coverage in 1998, and has been at the Final Four during his tenure. Last season, CBS celebrated Gumbel's 25th anniversary of tournament coverage.\n\nJay Bilas bracket: ESPN analyst sees UConn repeating\n\nESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas is never shy about challenging conventional wisdom whenever he's in front of a microphone.\n\nHis 2024 NCAA men's basketball tournament picks, however, don't stray too far from the norm. In his annual ESPN.com column, Bilas has three No. 1 seeds – Connecticut, Houston and Purdue – reaching the Final Four, along with No. 2 seeded Arizona. And he has the defending champion UConn Huskies cutting down the nets once again in Phoenix.\n\nWhat channel is truTV?\n\nOne of the biggest questions surrounding March Madness every year is: Where on earth can I find truTV on my television? CBS and Turner Sports have the broadcasting rights to the men's NCAA Tournament, and they broadcast the games on four channels. Three of them are familiar to fans – CBS, TNT and TBS. But truTV is the one exception.\n\nTruTV can be found on several cable providers, and has the same channel number nationwide on some of the providers.

There are usually a few, but finding the right ones isn’t always easy. (Full disclosure: we went 0-for-5 in this space last year – but we press on.) Here are five upset candidates to consider as you fill out your bracket.\n\nWhere is Jim Nantz? Why is Jim Nantz not broadcasting March Madness?\n\nNo Jim Nantz? No \"hello, friends\"? As the men's NCAA Tournament begins, fans may be wondering about the voice synonymous with one of the most popular events in college sports.\n\nNantz decided the 2023 NCAA Tournament would be his last so he could focus on his family and other broadcasting commitments. Nantz didn't retire from broadcasting; he's still calling The Masters and serves as the lead play-by-play person for CBS' NFL coverage alongside Tony Romo.\n\nNantz became the lead voice for CBS' coverage of the NCAA Tournament in 1991, serving as the No. 1 play-by-play man who called every Final Four since. But this year, you will likely only see and hear Nantz during commercial breaks.\n\nHas there ever been a perfect March Madness bracket?\n\nAfter No. 16 seed Farleigh Dickinson shocked the world and upset No. 1 seed Purdue in the first round of last year's NCAA tournament – becoming only the second men's No. 16 seed to take down a No. 1 seed – the NCAA announced there were no more perfect brackets remaining out of more than 20 million submissions.\n\nThat might lead many hopeful participants to wonder if there's ever been a perfect NCAA Tournament bracket during March Madness, home of the buzzer-beaters, upsets and Cinderella runs?\n\nThe answer is a resounding no. There has never been a perfect bracket that correctly guessed the outcome of all 63 games in the tournament, despite millions and millions of brackets submitted each year.\n\nMarch Madness predictions: 10 bold predictions for men’s NCAA tournament\n\nThe NCAA men's tournament is all about chaos and unpredictability. There are sure to be upsets And if there was one lesson to learn from last season's edition, it's that nothing is guaranteed and anything can happen. We saw the second No. 16 seed win over a No. 1 seed in tournament history and no No. 1 seeds made it to the Elite Eight. These predictions may sound crazy − and it's very unlikely they all are correct − but with the unexpected nature of the tournament, who's to say they can't happen?

Your chances of filling out a perfect bracket are miniscule, but maybe you need a few tips to win your office pool. We've got you covered with a look at how to pick an upset and a look historically at how the seeds have performed in the NCAA Tournament. Three of our five USA TODAY experts have UConn as their picks to win the national title on April 8. Here are our expert picks.\n\nJoe Biden, Kamala Harris, Barack Obama release March Madness brackets\n\nAs Americans cast their ballots in presidential primaries and special elections across the country, they’re also predicting winners on the basketball court. President Joe Biden released his brackets for the NCAA men and women’s basketball tournaments too, and before March Madness picks up steam, let's take a look at his predictions.\n\nBiden chose a group of highly rated teams for his Final Four, picking UConn, North Carolina, Houston and Tennessee. The president predicted that UConn will defeat North Carolina, while Houston will beat Tennessee, with UConn ultimately winning the men’s tournament. In the women’s championship, Biden selected South Carolina, Stanford, UCLA and UConn to make it to the Final Four. The president forecast that South Carolina would defeat Stanford, and UConn would defeat UCLA, choosing South Carolina as his champion.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris released her picks on Wednesday. On the women's side, Harris took the South Carolina Gamecocks over the USC Trojans in the final. The bracket features a notable upset pick in the Elite Eight as the former junior Senator from California took the UCLA Bruins over all-time leading NCAA scorer Caitlin Clark's Iowa Hawkeyes.\n\nIn the men's tournament, the Vice President has a Final Four of UConn, North Carolina, Marquette and Tennessee. Harris took UConn over Tennessee in the final, picking the Huskies to defend their 2023 crown.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama also shared his brackets. He gave UConn, Baylor, Kentucky and Purdue his Final Four men's spots, ultimately choosing UConn to win it all. In the women’s tournament, Obama selected South Carolina, Southern California, Iowa and Stanford for the Final Four, choosing South Carolina as the champion.\n\nColorado men extend Boise State's misery in First Four\n\nOne of the hottest teams the last few weeks, Colorado needed every late-season win to make the tournament. Wednesday's win was Colorado's ninth in its last 10 games. Can the Buffaloes keep it rolling and make a run deep into March Madness?\n\nBoise State is now 0-10 in March Madness play.\n\nHead coach Tad Boyle credited his team's defense on getting the win, despite Boise State getting a whopping 19 offensive rebounds.\n\n\"We really started playing tougher on the glass. Boise State's a physical team, they keep coming at you, and we made just enough plays down the stretch. I thought our defense was great all night, our guys were locked in,\" Boyle said.\n\nGrambling State gets first March Madness win at First Four; meet Purdue's first-round opponent\n\nHow about not only making your first NCAA Tournament, but getting the team's first March Madness win?\n\nThe Grambling State Tigers used a second-half rally to force overtime and defeat Montana State in the First Four, 88-81, in its first-ever NCAA Tournament game and secure a date with No. 1 seed Purdue on Friday.\n\nThe win continued what has been a dream season for Donte Jackson's squad, getting through a tough start of the regular season to its best year in school history. The team was led by Jimel Cofer, who came off the bench and scored a season-high 19 points to lead Grambling State to the historic victory.\n\n\"I just know my team has my back. Anybody on this team can get hot, and today was just my night,\" Cofer said after the win.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/high-school/2022/02/22/boys-basketball-st-bernard-new-london-nfa-top-ecc-tournament-seeds-ct-mohegan-sun/6891158001/", "title": "ECC high school boys basketball tournament kicks off this week ...", "text": "Larry Kelley\n\nFor The Bulletin\n\nDave Cornish doesn't agree with singer Andy Williams and millions of children throughout the world.\n\nHe doesn't think Christmas is \"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year.\"\n\nThe Norwich Free Academy boys basketball coach believes now - the end of February and upcoming March Madness when basketball tournaments rule - trumps the end-of-year holidays.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/955385/africa-cup-of-nations-is-there-a-more-disrespected-tournament", "title": "Africa Cup of Nations: is there a more disrespected tournament ...", "text": "The 33rd Africa Cup of Nations kicked off on Sunday with hosts Cameroon defeating Burkina Faso 2-1 in the opening match of group A. At the Olembé Stadium in Yaoundé, a multicultural opening ceremony marked the hosting of the continent’s most prestigious international men’s football tournament.\n\nThere was “relief and atmosphere” as Cameroon started their campaign in style, said Jonathan Wilson in The Guardian. The tournament was two-and-a-half years later than planned, but “few in Yaoundé would be bothered by that”.\n\nIt’s been 50 years since Cameroon last hosted the continental showpiece – a “lifetime in footballing terms”, said ESPN’s Lindsay du Plessis. And the young population of the Central African nation will have “only heard about that 1972 tournament in whispered memories passed down through the generations”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The 60,000-capacity Olembé Stadium, which opened in September last year, will host the final on 6 February.\n\n‘Less than helpful’\n\nThe build-up has been overshadowed by a number of issues, including the threat of Covid-19 and of safety fears due to civil war. Conflicts between separatists and security forces is “intensifying” in Cameroon, “yet has received little coverage in the build-up”, said Kieran Guilbert in The Independent.\n\nIdeally, the discussion leading up to the event, “would have centred on potential winners, surprise packages and stand-out players”, Wilson said in The Guardian. However, with the event taking place during the European season, the discussion, “in England at least”, has centred on “which Premier League clubs will be worst affected?”.\n\nIt’s “clearly frustrating” for clubs to lose key players halfway through a season, especially when Covid outbreaks are hitting squads, said Robert Kidd in Forbes. But some clubs have been “less than helpful” in releasing players for international duty.\n\nSee more\n\n‘Can you imagine the furore?’\n\nThe player call-up debate has led to many people asking the question: does the Africa Cup of Nations get the respect it deserves? Established in 1957, it is the second-oldest continental football tournament, older than the European Championship.\n\nIan Wright believes the media coverage has been “completely tinged with racism”, CNN reported. Is there a more disrespected tournament, the former Arsenal and England striker asked on social media. “Why is this tournament constantly getting so much flak?”\n\nA number of players were asked if they would honour call-ups to their national teams and Wright said had it been England’s stars there would have been uproar. “You are getting journalists asking players... players getting asked if they will be honouring the call-ups to their national teams,” he said. “Imagine if that was an English player representing the Three Lions. Can you imagine the furore?”\n\nDisrespect for Africa\n\nWhen Ajax striker Sébastien Haller was asked if he would join up with Ivory Coast or stay with his club, he reacted angrily. “This question shows disrespect for Africa,” he said. “Would this question ever be asked to a European player ahead of the Euros?”\n\nCameroon international Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa said it wasn’t an easy decision to step away from Napoli’s title charge, but he has the full backing of the Italian club, ESPN reported.\n\n“It’s always delicate for a player to leave his team, but the club have to understand that the Africa Cup of Nations is an important thing when you’re an African player, and they have to respect that as well,” he told the broadcaster. “In my situation, the club didn’t have a problem, even though they know that I’m an important component of the team.”\n\nPure and passionate\n\nEverything Wright said about the Africa Cup of Nations was “eloquent and absolutely spot on”, said Eurosport’s Pete Sharland. There remains to this day an “inherent conscious bias” about African players and that “spills over to the way AFCON is viewed by media and fans”.\n\nThe Cup of Nations has always existed “amid a battle for recognition, politically and in football”, Wilson said. And a “habitual complaint” of European clubs is that the Cup of Nations comes every two years. “That is a matter both of history and financial necessity.”\n\nOne thing the football world should never complain about is how “pure” and “passionate” the Africa Cup of Nations is, Sharland said. It is “arguably the best tournament” international football has and it is the sort of tournament that “makes you fall back in love with the game”.", "authors": ["Mike Starling", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Rafi Schwartz", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2024/03/14/march-madness-2024-dates-tv-schedule-locations-ncaa-womens-tournament-basketball-south-carolina-lsu/72957710007/", "title": "March Madness 2024: Dates, TV schedule, locations for NCAA ...", "text": "The 2023-24 women’s college basketball season has been a banner one for a sport that has watched its popularity skyrocket in recent years.\n\nOver the past four months, there has been no shortage of compelling storylines that have captivated fans nationally.\n\nMORE:Watch the 2024 NCAA Women's Tournament live with Fubo (free trial)\n\nSouth Carolina and coach Dawn Staley wrapped up their second-consecutive undefeated regular season and, in the weeks to come, they will look to bolster their reputation as the sport’s modern-day dynasty.

brackets\n\nWhen is the First Four?\n\nFor just the third year in its existence, the NCAA women's basketball tournament will feature a First Four after the field expanded from 64 teams to 68 for the 2022 tournament. Unlike the men's First Four, which is held every year at UD Arena in Dayton, Ohio, the women's First Four will take place at campus sites of the team hosting first-round games. Last season, for example, the First Four games were held in South Bend, Indiana (Notre Dame); Bloomington, Indiana; Columbus, Ohio; and Stanford, California.\n\nThe First Four will match up the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers against each other in two separate games while the same format will hold for the four lowest-seeded at-large teams. The winner of each game advances to the Round of 64, which will begin Friday, March 22.\n\nWednesday, March 20\n\nGame 1: (16) Presbyterian vs. (16) Scared Heart | 7 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo)\n\n(16) Presbyterian vs. (16) Scared Heart | 7 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo) Game 2: (12) Columbia vs. (12) Vanderbilt | 9 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo)\n\nThursday, March 21\n\nGame 3: (11) Arizona vs. (11) Auburn | 7 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo)\n\n(11) Arizona vs. (11) Auburn | 7 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo) Game 4: (16) UT Martin vs. (16) Holy Cross | 9 p.m. | ESPNU (Fubo)\n\nWhen is the Final Four?\n\nThe 2024 Final Four will take place at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, the home arena of the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. The two national semifinal games will be played on Friday, April 5, followed by the national championship game on Sunday, April 7.\n\nIt's the second time the venue has hosted the women's Final Four. The previous instance came in 2007, when it was then known as Quicken Loans Arena. That year, Tennessee defeated Rutgers in the national championship game.\n\nFriday, April 5\n\nGame 65: TBD vs. TBD | 7 p.m. | ESPN (Fubo)\n\nTBD vs. TBD | 7 p.m. | ESPN (Fubo) Game 66: TBD vs. TBD | 9:30 p.m. | ESPN (Fubo)\n\nHow to watch March Madness games in 2024\n\nChannels: ABC | ESPN | ESPN2 | ESPNU | ESPNews\n\nABC | ESPN | ESPN2 | ESPNU | ESPNews Streamingn: NCAA March Madness Live app | Fubo (free trial)\n\nEvery game of the 2024 NCAA women's basketball tournament will air on ESPN's family of networks. Just like last season, each game will be broadcast on one of ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPNews.\n\nYou can also stream select NCAA Tournament games on Fubo (free trial for new users) and the NCAA March Madness Live app.\n\nWhere is March Madness 2024?\n\nThe NCAA women's tournament is formatted slightly differently from its male counterpart, in which every game is staged at a neutral site.\n\nThe First Four games are held at a campus site of one of the tournament's top 16 overall seeds. From there, the first- and second-round games will take place at the home arena of the highest-rated team in a given four-team pod. For example, South Carolina, as a certain No. 1 seed, will host a yet-to-be-determined No. 16 seed before, barring a seismic upset, playing against the winner of the No. 8 seed's matchup against the No. 9 seed, with all those games taking place at Colonial Life Arena in Columbia.\n\nOnce in the Sweet 16, neutral sites are introduced, though the women's tournament has just two regions, compared to four for the men's. This year, those Sweet 16 and Elite Eight games will be held in Albany, New York and Portland, Oregon. The Final Four and national championship will be hosted at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland.\n\nHere is a full breakdown of which sites and locations will be a part of the NCAA Tournament this year:\n\nFirst Four:\n\nNote: First Four games held at campus sites among top 16 seeds\n\nAlbany Regional 1: Colonial Life Arena (Columbia, S.C.)\n\nColonial Life Arena (Columbia, S.C.)

Last year, they carried an undefeated record into the Final Four, but once there, they lost to Clark and Iowa 77-73.\n\nHere's a full list of odds for teams to win the national championship (as of Wednesday, March 13):\n\nSouth Carolina (-120)\n\n(-120) Iowa (+400)\n\n(+400) LSU (+650)\n\n(+650) Stanford (+2000)\n\n(+2000) UConn (+2500)\n\n(+2500) Ohio State (+2500)\n\n(+2500) UCLA (+3000)\n\n(+3000) Texas (+3000)\n\n(+3000) Kansas State (+3500)\n\n(+3500) N.C.

For Tigers coach Kim Mulkey, it was her fourth title, with her previous three coming at Baylor.\n\nUConn has the most NCAA women's basketball championships of any school, with 11. Tennessee, with eight, is the only other program that has won more than three.\n\nIt's worth noting that this championship count only goes back to 1982, when the NCAA assumed governing powers over women's college basketball.\n\nHere is a full list of which schools have won titles going back to 1982, and how many each of them has won:\n\n1.

Both were in action again. The 13-seeded Paladins started the men's action with a loss to No. 5 San Diego State. But the 15-seeded Tigers advanced to the Sweet 16 with a win against No. 7 Missouri.\n\nOn the women's side, No. 1 seed Indiana was in action after top seeds South Carolina, Virginia Tech and Stanford took care of business on Friday. The Hoosiers kicked off Day 2 of the women's first round with a 77-47 win against No. 16 seed Tennessee Tech, which beat Monmouth in a First Four game on Thursday.\n\nThink you have what it takes to beat your friends?

Freshman Kiki Rice led the way with 15 points, while senior Charisma Osborne finished with 11 points, 12 rebounds, five assists and two blocks. UCLA outrebounded Sac State 47-32 and turned the ball over just five times. The Bruins will play Oklahoma on Monday for a spot in the Sweet 16.\n\nWomen's final: Texas 79, East Carolina 40\n\nShaylee Gonzales led four players in double figures with 20 points, Rori Harmon dished out 12 assists and Texas dominated East Carolina in every phase of the game in a 79-40 win. Texas had as many points in the paint as East Carolina had total, and the Longhorns shot 54% while holding the Pirates to less than 18% shooting. Texas did have 17 turnovers, but East Carolina could only turn them into eight points.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nNo. 1 Alabama defeats No. 8 Maryland to close out men's slate\n\nNo. 8 Maryland got off to a quick 9-2 start but Alabama asserted control and then cruised to a 73-51 victory in the final game of Saturday's men's NCAA Tournament slate. Alabama joined Houston as the only No. 1 seeds to make it through the opening weekend after Kansas lost earlier Saturday and Purdue was shocked by No. 16 Fairleigh Dickinson in the first round on Friday.\n\nIt was a struggle from the field for both teams. Maryland shot just 35.2% from the field, including a 1-for-8 mark from 3-point range. Alabama wasn't much better even playing in front of a partisan crowd in Birmingham, converting just 39.7% from the field and hitting six of its 21 3-point attempts.\n\nBrandon Miller, who didn't score in the Crimson Tide's first-round win over Texas A&M-Corpus Christi, found a semblance of his pre-injury form, finishing with 19 points, though he went just 5-for-17 from the field. Jahvon Quinerly led Alabama with 22 points.\n\nThe Crimson Tide will face No. 5 San Diego State in the Sweet 16.\n\nWomen's final: Duke 89, Iona 49\n\nThird-seeded Duke outrebounded No. 14 seed Iona 43-15 (no, that’s not a misprint) as the Blue Devils led wire-to-wire in their 89-49 blowout win.\n\nKennedy Brown scored 10 points, grabbed eight rebounds and handed out four assists. Twelve different Blue Devils got in the scorebook as Duke shot 58% from the field, advancing to the second round to meet sixth-seeded Colorado.\n\nWomen's final: Oklahoma 85, Portland 63\n\nSeven players scored 8 points or more, led by 14 from both Taylor Robertson and Aubrey Joens, and Oklahoma became the second fifth-seed to win Saturday, using a 24-point third quarter to separate from Portland and go on to win, 85-63.\n\nThe Sooners, regular season co-champions of the Big 12, led almost the entire game. OU held Portland to 38% from the field and just 16% from 3, and out rebounded UP 49-30. The Sooners turned 18 Portland turnovers into 23 points, too. Portland forward Alex Fowler finished with 18 points and seven rebounds.\n\nUCLA wins, but attention turns to health of David Singleton\n\nAnother day, another major injury for UCLA ... maybe.\n\nThe Bruins won 68-63 over seventh-seeded Northwestern on Saturday, but it came with a scare.\n\nFifth-year guard David Singleton, who averages 9.2 points for the second-seeded Bruins, went down with 20.3 seconds to play and UCLA up 64-60 after badly turning his right ankle.\n\nSingleton was clearly in a lot of pain, and paramedics actually came on to the floor to cart him off. He managed to hobble off with help, but the loss of another guard could be devastating for UCLA. Just before the conference tournament the Bruins lost Jaylen Clark, one of the nation's best perimeter defenders, to a season-ending injury.\n\nSingleton came back out to the handshake line and was walking on his own power, which is a good sign for the Bruins. Mick Cronin said afterward that he wasn’t sure how bad Singleton’s injury was, but “I knew it scared him.”\n\nSingleton had five points and six rebounds in 28 minutes in UCLA’s win. He will likely be re-evaluated and his availability will be announced later this week.\n\nBrandon Miller gets on the board\n\nAlabama star Brandon Miller finally got in the points column in the Crimson Tide's second-round game against No. 8 Maryland. After going scoreless (0-for-5 from the field) in the first-round victory over Texas A&M-Corpus Christi while dealing with a groin injury, Miller hit three of eight shot attempts in the first half against the Terrapins to take a game-high nine points into halftime. No. 1 Alabama led 28-23.\n\nMen's final: Texas 71, Penn State 66\n\nNo. 2 Texas was in control most of the game, but a 10-0 Penn State run put the No. 10 Nittany Lions up 58-55 with 4:50 to go.\n\nUndaunted, the Longhorns responded with a 10-0 run of their own, powered by four Dylan Disu baskets. Disu finished with a game-high 28 points and added 10 rebounds for the double-double.\n\nThe victory advanced Texas to the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2008. It will face the winner of Sunday's game between Xavier and Pitt.\n\nWomen's final: Colorado 82, Middle Tennessee 60\n\nFrida Formann scored 15 of her team-high 21 points on 3-pointers, and Colorado used its long-range shooting to roll past Middle Tennessee 82-60. The sixth-seeded Buffaloes made a season-high 13 3-pointers, including one by Tayanna Jones midway through the first quarter that gave Colorado the lead for good.\n\nIt’s the first time since 2003 that Colorado has won a first-round game.\n\n– Nancy Armour\n\nNo. 5 Louisville women fend off No. 12 Drake in first-round thriller\n\nA frenzied back-and-forth game featuring 12 lead changes and 14 ties came to an end when Hailey Van Lith, Louisville’s All-American guard, hit a pull-up at the elbow with 53 seconds to play, giving Louisville a lead it would not relinquish.\n\nThe Cardinals clinched the 83-81 win by making four of five free throws in the final 20 seconds, staving off what would have been the third 12-5 upset of the day.\n\nAfter Drake hit two free throws to get within one, 78-77, a terrific sideline out of bounds play from Louisville got Van Lith open for an and-1 layup with 16 seconds to play, which made it a two possession game. A quick 3 from Drake’s Sarah Beth Gueldner again brought the Bulldogs within one, but Van Lith hit two more free throws to give Louisville breathing room. Drake’s next 3 attempt missed badly, and Louisville fouled to not allow a 3. Drake made the first free throw and missed the second, but Louisville corralled the rebound.\n\nVan Lith led all scorers with 26 points, while Mykasa Robinson added 14 points and seven assists. Five Drake players scored in double figures, led by Katie Dinnebier, who had 20 points and seven assists.\n\nNo. 1 Houston overcomes slow start to reach Sweet 16\n\nNo. 1 Houston found itself down 10 at halftime against No. 9 Auburn in Birmingham, Alabama. The Cougars were in danger of becoming the third No. 1 seed to be eliminated before the Sweet 16. But they turned it on in the second half, outscoring Auburn 50-23 on the way to an 81-64 victory.\n\nThis was not an aesthetically pleasing game. The teams combined to shoot 65 free throws. One of the major differences in the contest was the shooting from the free throw line: Houston hit 24 of its 29 attempts (82.8%); Auburn went a dreadful 19-for-36 (52.8%).\n\nHouston received a boost from the return of Marcus Sasser. The AAC player of the year aggravated a groin injury suffered in the conference tournament in Thursday's first-round win over Northern Kentucky. But he got the start Saturday and scored 22 points on 7-for-14 shooting. That trailed only Tramon Mark, who had a game-high 26 points.\n\nThe Cougars will play the winner of Sunday's game between Miami and Indiana.\n\nPrinceton men and women make Ivy League history\n\nThis was a tournament to remember for the Ivy League even before the Princeton men reached the Sweet 16.\n\nThis is the first year the Ivy’s teams have won first-round games in both tournaments. A day after the No. 15 Princeton men stunned No. 2 Arizona, the 10th-seeded Princeton women upset N.C. State on Friday night on a 3-pointer with seven seconds left.\n\n“We were watching (the men) in the locker room right before practice,” Julia Cunningham said Friday night. “Watching them, all the coverage they are getting from the media, it was so well deserved. We looked at each other and thought, we’re next, now it’s our turn.\n\n“It is special,” she added. “A special week to be a Tiger.”\n\n– Nancy Armour\n\nNo. 15 Princeton reaches Sweet 16\n\nIn a battle of Tigers, No. 15 Princeton looked like the higher seed with an impressive 78-63 win over No. 7 Missouri.\n\nRyan Langborg led the way with a game-high 22 points.\n\nPrinceton is just the fourth No. 15 seed to reach the men's Sweet 16, joining 2013 FGCU, 2021 Oral Roberts and 2022 Saint Peter's, which made it all the way to the Elite Eight last year before falling to national runner-up North Carolina.\n\nThe Ivy League's Tigers will play the winner of Sunday's Baylor-Creighton game.\n\nArkansas coach Eric Musselman rips shirt off after upset of Kansas\n\nThe No. 8 Razorbacks sent the defending champions home, defeating No. 1 Kansas 72-71 in the second round of the men's NCAA Tournament. To celebrate, coach Eric Musselman ripped his shirt off. Really.\n\nMusselman, one of the most high-energy coaches in college basketball – which is saying something – pulled his polo up over his head and twirled it before \"Calling the Hogs\" with celebrating Arkansas fans. Photos showed him embracing players and coaches sans-shirt.\n\nThis isn't the first time the 58-year-old's shirt has come off on the court or locker room. Musselman was known to rip his shirt off in celebration during his previous stop at Nevada from 2015-2019.\n\nThe Razorbacks are into the Sweet 16 for the third consecutive year. We imagine if they break through to the Final Four, we will see more of Musselman's midriff this March.\n\nMen's final: No. 8 Arkansas upsets No. 1 Kansas\n\nThe second No. 1 seed in the NCAA men's tournament has gone down before the Sweet 16.\n\nNo. 8 Arkansas knocked off No. 1 Kansas 72-71 with a spirited second-half surge and late free throws by Ricky Council IV.\n\nBaylor women complete comeback from 18 down to knock out Alabama\n\nBaylor’s long-range shooting kept the Bears in the NCAA tournament.\n\nAfter being held to a season-low four points in the first quarter and trailing by as much as 18 in the first half, Baylor shot itself back into the game from long range. Baylor made 14 3-pointers – no, that’s not a misprint – with Ja’Mee Asberry contributing seven of them in the No. 7 seed's 78-74 victory over 10th-seeded Alabama.\n\nBaylor didn’t have the lead until Sarah Andrews made a 3 – what else? – with 5:35 left in the third quarter. But Alabama came back and regained control, leading by eight early in the fourth quarter. The Crimson Tide went cold, however, making just two field goals over the final 6:21, and made several mistakes that allowed Baylor to close it out.\n\nThe loss spoiled a monster effort by Alabama's Brittany Davis, who matched her career high with 33 points. At one point in the first half, Davis was singlehandedly outscoring Baylor.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nNo. 15 Princeton men lead No. 7 Missouri at half\n\nPrinceton takes a 33-26 lead into the locker room against Missouri as it aims to become the fourth No. 15 seed to reach the Sweet 16 of the men's NCAA Tournament.\n\nPrinceton led 33-19 before Missouri closed on a 7-0 run that included Sean East II beating the buzzer to take a little bit of momentum into halftime.\n\n– Jace Evans\n\nWomen's final: No. 4 Villanova 76, No. 11 Cleveland State 59\n\nMaddy Siegrist reached another milestone in the Wildcats’ 76-59 win over the Vikings. She became just the fifth player in women’s Division I history to score 1,000 points in a single season following her 35-point performance on her birthday. She’s the first person to do so in Villanova history.\n\nThe Wildcats shot 43.9% from the field, 10-for-25 from three and outrebounded the Vikings 45-29. Christina Dalce added 16 rebounds and eight offensive boards.\n\nDestiny Leo had 25 points.\n\nWomen's final: UNC 61, St. John's 59\n\nNorth Carolina’s Deja Kelly came up clutch in a thrilling first-round game Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, driving and scoring on an and-1 to give the Tar Heels a 61-58 edge with 2.2 seconds left.\n\nSt. John’s Danielle Patterson was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 1.5 seconds to play and had a chance to tie, but the 81% free throw shooter missed her first two attempts and North Carolina held on to win and advance to play third-seeded Ohio State on Monday.\n\nSt. John’s took its first lead with 6:39 to go on a 3 to go up 49-48, and the teams traded big plays for the rest of the game. Mimi Reid scored for St. John’s on a wild layup with 6.5 seconds to go, and it looked like overtime was near. But then Kelly came up big for UNC.\n\nKelly scored 18 points and grabbed 4 rebounds, while Kennedy Todd-Williams added 14 points and seven rebounds. Jayla Everett led St. John’s with 17 points.\n\nNo. 1 Kansas leads No. 8 Arkansas at half\n\nThe Jayhawks entered halftime with a 35-27 lead over the Razorbacks, but Kansas fans collectively held their breath when Dajuan Harris Jr. went down with an ankle injury. He hobbled to the locker room with 3:07 left in the half after landing awkwardly on his right foot while contesting a shot. He had four points, while Jalen Wilson leads the team with nine points.\n\nArkansas’ Anthony Black turned his ankle early in the game, but returned after getting his ankle re-taped. He has two points and Ricky Council IV has a game-high 10 points.\n\nBoth teams are struggling from the 3-point line. Kansas was 1-for-7 from beyond the arc, while Arkansas was 1-for-9.\n\nWomen: No. 12 Toledo 80, No. 5 Iowa State 73\n\nIn the second 12-5 upset of the day, the Rockets of Toledo used 48% shooting to knock off fifth-seeded Iowa State 80-73. Toledo advances to play Tennessee on the Lady Vols’ home floor Monday.\n\nFive-foot-10 guard Quinesha Lockett — fittingly nicknamed “Lockett the Rocket” — scored 24 points and grabbed 13 rebounds in the win, and Jayda Jansen added 17 points on 6-for-13 shooting. Iowa State star Ashley Joens, a perennial All-American, finished with 23 points and 13 rebounds, but her team went just 13-for-30 on layups and couldn’t recover after being outscored 23-13 in the second quarter.\n\nToledo built as much as a 16-point lead in the second half as the Rockets picked up their first NCAA Tournament win since 1996.\n\nWomen: No. 2 UConn 95, No.15 Vermont 52\n\nAaliyah Edwards did a little bit of everything in UConn’s 43-point win over Vermont. She finished with a career-high 28 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 steals and two blocks. Caroline Ducharme added 12 points off the bench.\n\nThe Huskies controlled the boards, outrebounding the Catamounts 43-19, and had 14 free throw attempts, compared with Vermont’s two. UConn shot 61.9% from the field, compared with the Catamounts shooting 33.3%.\n\nMen: No. 4 Tennessee 65, No. 5 Duke 52\n\nTennessee's Olivier Nkamhoua was on fire in the second half, scoring 23 of his 27 points after halftime. He entered Friday’s matchup shooting 31.3% from 3-point range but went 3-for-3 from beyond the arc to extend Tennessee’s lead in the second half. Nkamhoua put an exclamation point on the win with a put-back dunk with 1:16 left.\n\n\"They didn’t let me play in the first so I had to get my action in the second,\" Nkamhoua said after the 65-52 win.\n\nTurnovers were the story of the game for the Blue Devils. They committed 15 turnovers that led to 18 points for the Volunteers. Tyrese Proctor led Duke with 16 points. Dereck Lively II had 11 rebounds, but didn’t attempt a shot the entire game. Jeremy Roach, who was in foul trouble a majority of the game, finished with 13 points.\n\nWomen: No. 12 FGCU 74, No. 5 Washington State 63\n\nThe nation’s leader in 3-pointers per game needed only five treys — Florida Gulf Coast averages almost 12 — to pull off one of the biggest upsets of the women’s first round, topping fifth-seeded Washington State 74-63.\n\nThis is the second year in a row that No. 12 seed FGCU beat a 5 in the first round (last year Virginia Tech fell victim to the Eagles). FGCU shot a sizzling 56% from the field and dominated the paint (50 to 26) in the win.\n\nIt was a significant letdown for Washington State, which just a couple weeks ago won the school’s first-ever Pac-12 championship when the Cougars knocked off UCLA in the conference tournament championship. FGCU did a terrific job locking up WSU star Charlisse Ledger-Walker, who finished with just five points before fouling out with 5:25 to play.\n\nFour Eagles scored in double figures, led by guard Sha Carter, who had 24 on 10-for-13 shooting. She also grabbed 6 rebounds.\n\nWomen: No. 9 Miami 62, No. 8 Oklahoma State 61\n\nThe Hurricanes edged out a 62-61 win over the Cowgirls on Friday and it was a dramatic finish. Oklahoma State’s Anna Gret Asi knocked down a quick three with 5.3 seconds left in the game to bring the Cowgirls within one, 62-61. Miami was hit with a five-second violation and turned the ball over while attempting to inbound the ball. Oklahoma State’s Naomie Alnatas missed a jumper that would have won the game as the clock expired.\n\nThe Hurricanes outscored the Cowgirls 42-24 in the second half to erase a 17-point halftime deficit, which is tied for the fifth largest comeback in NCAA tournament history. It was a team effort for Miami with four starters in double digits, led by Haley Cavinder’s 16 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists.\n\nDuke and Tennessee in low-scoring defensive battle\n\nThe Blue Devils and Volunteers are finding a tough time finding the bucket as Tennessee leads 27-21 at halftime.\n\nTennessee is shooting 33% and closed the first half on a 14-2 run and Duke, who have also committed 11 turnovers is doing slightly better, hitting at a 36 percent clip.\n\nDariq Whitehead leads Duke with eight points, while Santiago Vescovi is pacing the Volunteers with eight points.\n\nWomen: No. 3 Ohio State 80, No. 14 James Madison 66\n\nNo lead is safe when Ohio State is playing.\n\nThe third-seeded Buckeyes rallied from 16 points down to beat 14th-seeded James Madison 80-66. It’s the seventh time this year Ohio State has won after trailing by double digits, including a record-setting comeback against Indiana in the Big Ten tournament semifinals when the Buckeyes erased a 24-point deficit.\n\nBig Ten freshman of the year Cotie McMahon had 18 before fouling out to lead four Buckeyes in double figures. Ohio State also got a big game from Jacy Sheldon, who was playing just her fourth game – and making her first start – after missing much of the last three months with a foot injury. Sheldon had 17 points, nine assists and four steals.\n\nThe loss continued the streak of futility for 14 seeds in the women’s tournament.\n\n– Nancy Armour\n\nWomen: No. 4 Tennessee 95, No. 13 Saint Louis 50\n\nRickea Jackson and Jordan Horston combined for 39 of the Lady Vols’ 95 points in a first-round win over the Billikens. Horston (8 rebounds) was two point shy of a double-double. The 45-point win marked Tennessee’s largest margin of victory of the season and the Lady Vols improved to 25-0 in the first round of the NCAA Tournament at home.\n\nBrooke Flowers, Saint Louis’ all-time leader in blocks, added five more to her career total Saturday, in addition to 17 points and nine rebounds in her last collegiate game. The Billikens collectively shot 3-for-20 from 3-point range, had 20 turnovers and were outrebounded 39-28.\n\nSan Diego State 75, Furman 52\n\nSan Diego State is heading to the Sweet 16 after using a suffocating defensive effort to shut down Furman, ending the Paladins’ Cinderella run in the second round.\n\nThe Aztecs advance to the South Regional in Louisville, Kentucky to face the winner of Alabama and Maryland, making their first Sweet 16 appearance since 2014.\n\nMicah Parrish had 16 points for San Diego State, who shot 50 percent and outrebounded Furman by 16 as the Paladins had no answer for the Aztecs and their inside game. Darrion Trammell had 13 points, Lamont Butler scored 12, and Matt Bradley chipped in with 10.\n\nJalen Slawson, the Southern Conference Player of the Year, had eight points and two rebounds before fouling out with 10 minutes left. Mike Bothwell led Furman with 15 points. The Paladins shot 32 percent, including 6-26 from three-point range.\n\nAlabama's Brandon Miller expected to play vs. Maryland: report\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. – Alabama forward Brandon Miller is expected to play against Maryland, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Tuscaloosa News on Saturday. The person was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Miller's status.\n\nMiller played only 19 minutes in the win over Texas A&M-Corpus Christi on Thursday and did not score . He is dealing with a groin injury suffered in the SEC Tournament final.\n\nThe SEC player of the year, who has been in the headlines because of his involvement in a capital murder case, was held out of live practice drills Friday, Alabama coach Nate Oats said. \"I think knowing Brandon and how tough he is, physically, mentally, I think he'll be ready to go tomorrow.\"\n\n— Nick Kelly, The Tuscaloosa News\n\nWomen: No. 1 Indiana 77, No. 16 Tennessee Tech 47\n\nSydney Parrish led the Hoosiers to a 30-point win over the Golden Eagles with 19 points, eight rebounds and one steal. Indiana had two other starters in double digits: Grace Berger (17 points) and Yarden Garzon (12 points).\n\nBut the star of the show was the Hoosiers’ defense with 11 blocks and seven steals in front of a crowd of 14,000 fans at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana. \"It's such an advantage having a sixth man,\" Berger said of the home crowd.\n\nTennessee Tech was held to eight fourth-quarter points. Maaliya Owens had a team-high 17 points.\n\nSan Diego State looking to stop Furman's Cinderella run\n\nSan Diego State is 20 minutes from the Sweet 16 as it leads Furman 39-25 at halftime in second-round action in the South Region.\n\nThe Aztecs took control with an 18-1 run, holding Furman without a field goal for more than 10 minutes. The Paladins shot 33 percent, including 2-of-11 from 3-point range, in the first half.\n\nMicah Parrish has 14 points off the bench for SDSU, while Furman's Jalen Slawson has eight points and two rebounds.\n\n– Scooby Axson\n\nRanking Saturday's games\n\nSaturday's winners earn a spot in the Sweet 16, and the eight games feature some of the best teams and players in college basketball. Three No. 1 seeds are in action, and the spotlight is on first-team All-Americans Jalen Wilson of Kansas and Alabama forward Brandon Miller, and potentially Houston's do-everything guard Marcus Sasser.\n\nHere’s the list of Saturday’s eight games ranked by how watchable they are.\n\nNo. 4 Tennessee vs. No. 5 Duke (2:40 p.m. ET) No. 1 Alabama vs. No. 8 Maryland (9:40 p.m.) No. 7 Missouri vs. No. 15 Princeton (6:10 p.m.) No. 1 Kansas vs. No. 8 Arkansas (5:15 p.m.) No. 1 Houston vs. No. 9 Auburn (7:10 p.m.) No. 2 UCLA vs. No. 7 Northwestern (8:40 p.m.) No. 2 Texas vs. No. 10 Penn State (7:45 p.m.) No. 5 San Diego State vs. No. 13 Furman (12:10 p.m.)\n\n– Scooby Axson\n\nBill Self out again\n\nKansas head coach Bill Self will not coach in the team's second-round game against Arkansas on Saturday, the school announced. Self continues to recover from a heart catheterization, which caused him to miss the Big 12 tournament. The 60-year-old Self did attend the Jayhawks practice on Friday, but mostly sat and watched.\n\nAssistant Norm Roberts will once again serve as acting head coach for Kansas. He coached the Jayhawks to a 96-68 win over Howard in the first round.\n\nThe defending national champions will tip off against the Razorbacks at 5:15 p.m. at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nDid that really happen?!?!\n\nIn case you missed it Friday night (though we can't imagine how), Purdue became just the second men's No. 1 seed to fall to a 16 since the bracket expanded to 64 teams in 1985, when Fairleigh Dickinson shocked the nation with a 63-58 upset.\n\nIf there’s a winner besides current Fairleigh Dickinson players and first-year head coach Tobin Anderson — not to mention every single FDU graduate and fan — it’s probably Virginia coach Tony Bennett, who is now not the only coach to lose to a No. 16 seed. Yikes. Talk about a club you don’t want to join.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest winners are fans of college hoops. That we’ve now seen two 16-seeds beat 1-seeds in the last five years is proof that parity continues to grow in men's college basketball, which makes the NCAA Tournament more unpredictable and ultimately, more fun.\n\n— Lindsay Schnell and Paul Myerberg\n\nSisters could face off in second round with Saturday wins\n\nLior Garzon's initial excitement during Sunday's selection show was over Oklahoma State receiving No. 8 seed in the NCAA women's tournament opposite No. 9 Miami (Fla.). It took the junior forward less than a minute to realize not only were the Cowgirls dancing, they were heading to Bloomington, Indiana, where her younger sister, Yarden Garzon, is a freshman guard for No. 1-seed Indiana.\n\nAt their respective schools by way of Ra'anana, Israel, the Garzon sisters never discussed the possibility of ending up together in the bracket prior to Sunday, but they knew it could at least be in play. Indiana tip-off against Tennessee Tech at 11:30 a.m. ET, followed by Oklahoma State-Miami at 2 p.m.\n\nThursday's reunion at the team hotel marked the first time the sisters have seen each other since Yarden visited Stillwater, Oklahoma over winter break.\n\n\"I'm really excited to watch her play,\" said Lior, who averages 11 points and shoots 43% off the bench.\n\nAs for the possibility of an Indiana-Oklahoma State second-round matchup — and Lior was quick to point out they still have to win their first-round games — it would mark the first time the sisters have gone head-to-head since they played in a club game shortly before Lior left for the United States.\n\n— Brian Haenchen, Indianapolis Star\n\nPrinceton partying like it's 1996\n\nNo. 15 seeded Princeton dominated inside and threw the South Region into chaos with an upset of Arizona.\n\nMaybe this wasn’t exactly like when the Tigers pulled off a memorable upset of UCLA in 1996, when they were seeded 14th and beat the third-seeded and defending champion Bruins 43-41. There was more offense and given how common upsets are now, it probably didn’t shock as many people. But it’s still a big deal. And it’s the just the second tournament win for Princeton since that game. The Tigers beat UNLV in the first round in 1998.\n\n— Lindsay Schnell\n\nWhat's a Paladin?\n\nPrinceton might have pulled off the biggest upset Thursday, but 13-seeded Furman's downing of No. 4 Virginia was a fun (unless you're a Cavaliers fan, of course) start to the 2023 men's NCAA Tournament.\n\nIt's been a long wait for Paladins men's basketball fans. It was more than 40 years since Furman was last in the tournament, and over 45 years since its last March Madness win.\n\nThe American Heritage College Dictionary defines a Paladin as a \"paragon of chivalry\" or \"a heroic champion.\" A Paladin was also one of the 12 legendary peers or knightly champions in attendance on the court of Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, in the 8th century.\n\n— Jordan Mendoza\n\nAlabama's biggest opponent may be exhaustion from unending chaos\n\nThe athletics director issued a statement at halftime. The most scrutinized 20-year-old in basketball couldn’t make a shot before eventually going to the bench to rest a sore groin. The walk-on nobody had heard of before Wednesday night threatened to sue the New York Times. And the coach is losing his mind on every dribble for two straight hours of a game he didn’t come close to losing.\n\nIn other words, it was just another day in Alabama basketball.\n\n— Dan Wolken\n\nHouston ruins title hopes by playing Marcus Sasser before he was ready\n\nThat backfired in spectacular fashion.\n\nJust five days after Marcus Sasser strained his groin in the American Athletic Conference tournament semifinals, he was back in the Cougars’ starting lineup Thursday night. For a first-round game against a No. 16 team.\n\nIn a surprise to pretty much no one, Sasser didn't even make it to halftime. Now top-seeded Houston might not make it to the second weekend, let alone to the Final Four in its hometown.\n\n— Nancy Armour\n\nFinal USA TODAY Sports coaches poll\n\nHouston entered the NCAA Tournament with the No. 1 ranking in the USA TODAY Sports coaches poll, despite its loss in the American Athletic Conference championship game just prior to the unveiling of the brackets on Sunday.\n\nThe Cougars, who were playing without leading scorer Marcus Sasser in the loss to Memphis, retained 21 of 32 No. 1 votes to stave off second-ranked Alabama. The Crimson Tide received eight firsts after winning the SEC title in impressive fashion on Sunday.\n\nHouston handled Northern Kentucky in its first-round game, while Alabama routed Texas A&M Corpus Christi in its tournament opener. The Cougars clash with No. 9 seed Auburn on Saturday, while the Crimson Tide take on 8-seed Maryland.\n\n— Eddie Timanus", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/softball/2023/05/14/ncaa-softball-tournament-teams-seeds-schedule-times-tv/70217218007/", "title": "NCAA softball regionals schedule dates, times, TV for 2023 ...", "text": "Let the \"Mayhem\" begin.\n\nThe 2023 NCAA Division I softball tournament kicked off Friday with 64 teams eyeing the ultimate prize – a trip to the Women's Colllege World Series in Oklahoma City.\n\nSixteen teams are hosting double-elimination regionals this weekend, and the top eight teams will host best-of-three super regionals the following weekend.

What a finish. And what a run for Lionel Messi and Inter Miami.\n\nInter Miami outdueled Nashville SC in a penalty kick shootout 10-9 to settle a 1-1 tie in the Leagues Cup final on Saturday night in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nMESSI LIVE:Inter Miami vs. FC Cincinnati US Open Cup semifinal kicks off\n\nWe're just seven games into the Messi experience in Miami and MLS. And Messi has already helped Inter Miami win its first championship since joining the league in 2020.\n\nAlthough this feels like what should happen when the world’s greatest soccer star joins what was an otherwise lowly MLS team before his arrival, this Leagues Cup final was fought to the very end.\n\nMessi scored in the 23rd minute. Nashville’s Fafá Picault scored in the 57th minute. And both sides were inches away from winning it in the final minutes of regulation before needing 22 total penalty kicks to decide it.\n\nStill, Messi’s presence cannot be denied.\n\n“We were able to put ourselves in position where we could have stole it,” Nashville coach Gary Smith said. “You’re looking at the greatest player on the planet possibly being the difference on what happened today.”\n\nMessi wins Leagues Cup best player award\n\nMessi – who scored 10 goals in his first tournament action with Inter Miami – won the Leagues Cup top scorer and best player awards.\n\nInter Miami’s Drake Callender won best goalkeeper of the tournament after blocking two kicks in the final minutes by reigning MLS MVP Hany Mukhtar, and Nashville goalkeeper Elliot Panicco’s final penalty kick to end it.\n\nAnd the celebration began.\n\nMessi’s teammates hoisted him in the air as they celebrated on the pitch.\n\nInter Miami coach Tata Martino and his coaching staff settled for a group hug full of smiles and some tears on the bench.\n\nAnd David Beckham hugged his wife, Victoria, and fellow Inter Miami co-owners Jorge and Jose Mas in the stands as their vision for Messi in Miami came to fruition.\n\n“It was a tight game for both teams. Any team could have won it,” said Martino, who coached Messi before with FC Barcelona and Argentina. “I was very impressed with the win. We came together.\"\n\nMartino's postgame press conference ended when Inter Miami players stormed the room to soak their coach in champagne.\n\n“After this month, we’re champions. And it feels great,” Martino said.\n\nInter Miami earns $2 million and an automatic berth in the Round of 16 in the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup with its win.\n\nWhen does Lionel Messi play next?\n\nSoccer fans won’t have to wait long to see Messi and Inter Miami return to action.\n\nMessi could take the pitch again twice in the upcoming week.\n\nInter Miami is slated to play a U.S. Open cup match against Cincinnati on Wednesday and begins MLS regular season play again next Saturday (8/26) against the New York Red Bulls.\n\nMartino said he’s going to be thinking about the upcoming match on the plane ride home.\n\n“We’re happy for what happened. There’s not a long time to celebrate,” Martino said. “This one is in the past, and we’re dreaming about the match against Cincinnati on Wednesday.”\n\nInter Miami vs. Nashville SC score, highlights\n\nInter Miami won the Leagues Cup title by downing Nashville SC in a shootout, 10-9. Messi scored a first-half goal for Miami.\n\nInter Miami's Drake Callender wins goalkeeper of the tournament\n\nOutside of Messi, no Inter Miami player played a bigger role than Callender in the Leagues Cup final.\n\nCallender blocked two kicks in the final minutes by reigning MLS MVP Hany Mukhtar, among five saves in the match, to keep the game tied at 1 in regulation.\n\nCallender also made Inter Miami’s 11th and final penalty kick in the match, and added one more save, stopping Nashville goalkeeper Elliot Panicco’s final penalty kick to clinch the title.\n\n“It’s a huge honor to play a role in making our first win in a final,” Callender said on Apple TV after the game. “It’s pretty surreal and emotional.”\n\nHow close was Leagues Cup final before penalty kicks?\n\nInter Miami and Nashville each had gut-wrenching misses in the final minutes that allowed this game to be decided by penalty kicks.\n\nInter Miami’s Leonard Campana missed two shots on goal after Panicco left the net to contest his first shot, which was too wide to the left side of the net.\n\nAs the ball rolled in front of the empty next, Campana slid and stretched his left foot onto the ball, hitting the left goal post.\n\nBefore Inter Miami’s near-miss, Nashville had two of its own.\n\nMukhtar, the reigning MLS MVP, was unable to convert on both of his late attempts. Callender deflected a high kick in the 90th minute, one minute after Mukhtar’s free kick following a yellow card in the 89th minute was contested.\n\n“There’s no negatives in how we played tonight,” Nashville coach Gary Smith said. “Just real disappointment.”\n\nVictor Ulloa misses crucial PK, but Elliot Panicco’s miss wins it for Inter Miami\n\nNashville’s Randall Leal missed the second penalty kick. Inter Miami’s Victor Ulloa missed the fifth and final kick to extend the game.\n\nAnd after 11 penalty kicks by both sides, it was Inter Miami celebrating its first title of the Messi era after Panicco missed the final kick of the night.\n\nThe players who took PKs for Miami were: Messi, S. Busquets; L. Campana; K. Miller, V. Ulloa (miss), S. Kryvtsov, J. Alba, D. Gómez, D. Ruíz, D. Yedlin, D. Callender.\n\nThe players who took PKs for Nashville were: H. Mukhtar, R. Leal (miss), A. Godoy, W. Zimmerman, S. Surridge, S. Moore, D. Lovitz, L. MacNaughton, S. Davis, J. Shaffelburg, E. Panicco (miss).\n\nHany Mukhtar miss: Inter Miami 1, Nashville 1\n\nMLS MVP Hany Mukhtar had a free kick and an opportunity to deliver a serious blow to Inter Miami.\n\nBut Mukhtar was unable to convert his kick just outside the box in the 84th minute.\n\nInter Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender watched as the kick sailed to the right side outside of the net.\n\nIf the game remains tied at the end of regulation, it will be decided by penalty kicks.\n\nNashville misses: Inter Miami 1, Nashville 1\n\nNashville almost found an opportunity to take the lead.\n\nMLS MVP Hany Mukhtar led the charge toward the net and dropped a pass to Sam Surridge, but his shot was blocked by Inter Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender in the 77th minute.\n\nWe’re still tied at 1 heading into the final 10 minutes.\n\nMessi off the post: Inter Miami 1, Nashville 1\n\nMessi was inches away from his second goal in this game.\n\nMessi found space to get a kick off with his left foot, but the ball ricocheted off the right goal post in the 71st minute.\n\nMessi nearly had another brace, or two goals scored, during Leagues Cup play.\n\nMessi missed another shot from outside the box earlier in the second half.\n\nFafá Picault goal: Inter Miami 1, Nashville SC 1\n\nWe’ve got a tie game, folks.\n\nNashville took advantage of a set piece from the corner, and has made this Leagues Cup final even more intriguing.\n\nFafá Picault’s kick hit off Inter Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender and went into the net in the 57th minute.\n\nHalftime: Inter Miami 1, Nashville SC 0\n\nLionel Messi’s left boot has already made its mark in this Leagues Cup final.\n\nMessi scored in the 23rd minute, and Inter Miami leads Nashville SC 1-0 at halftime.\n\nMessi is up to 10 goals in seven games during his Inter Miami career.\n\nNashville trails for the first time at halftime during its Leagues Cup run.\n\nLionel Messi goal: Inter Miami 1, Nashville SC 0\n\nLionel Messi does it again.\n\nMessi scored the first goal in the Leagues Cup final in the 23rd minute.\n\nMessi had four defenders around him, and still found space for his left boot to perform its magic.\n\nMessi is now up to 10 goals in seven games in his Inter Miami career.\n\nThe goal also is No. 37 in a final in Messi’s storied career.\n\nHighlights from first 20 minutes: Inter Miami 0, Nashville SC 0\n\n∎ Robert Taylor misses Inter Miami’s first shot on goal in the match just before the 21st minute.\n\n∎ Nashville’s Walker Zimmerman misses a header at the next in 17’ with good defense by Inter Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender. Nashville missed its first two shots on goal.\n\n∎ Messi was bumped by a Nashville player in the opening minutes and it was his longtime teammate Sergio Busquets, who came to his defense.\n\nGiannis does Ronaldo’s ‘SIU’ celebration before Messi game\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo, a minority owner in Nashville SC, scored a goal on the pitch before the game. But his celebration is the news here.\n\nAntetokounmpo celebrated by performing Cristiano Ronaldo’s “SIU” celebration near midfield after his kick hit the back of the net.\n\nWe'll see if Antetokounmpo poked the bear with his antics during the game.\n\nHow to watch: Messi, Inter Miami in Leagues Cup final\n\nThe Leagues Cup final between Inter Miami and Nashville SC kicks off at 9 p.m., and can be streamed live via the MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.\n\nThe game will not be broadcast on cable TV.\n\nPredictions for Inter Miami, Nashville SC Leagues Cup final\n\nHere are a few game predictions from members of the USA TODAY Sports staff:\n\nAlicia DelGallo: Messi gets a brace in the first half, Inter Miami wins 2-0.\n\nSafid Deen: Messi and Inter Miami score early and often, 3-1.\n\nMike Brehm: Nashville wins 3-1.\n\nJace Evans: Miami has to lose at some point, right? Nashville wins 2-1.\n\nCydney Henderson: I am going to put my money on Messi and Inter Miami. 4-1!\n\nCelebrities show out at Messi game\n\nThe stars are once again out for Lionel Messi, and tonight’s Leagues Cup final between Inter Miami and Nashville SC.\n\nNBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks is in Nashville's ownership group, and was on the pitch before the game.\n\n“This is amazing. This is an amazing atmosphere,” Antetokounmpo said.\n\nU.S. Men’s National team alum Landon Donovan was also interviewed on the pitch by Apple TV.\n\n“To see, in my opinion, the greatest player ever on our fields just blows my mind first of all,” Donovan said.\n\n“I was not expecting him to come out of the gate and be so dominant so early, and make everyone around him better. That's the real sign of a great leader, great captain, great player. He makes everyone else better. And it's been really fun to watch.”\n\nAnd actress Reese Witherspoon posed for a photo alongside Inter Miami co-owner and soccer legend David Beckham before the game.\n\nIs Messi playing tonight? Here are the starting lineups:\n\nMessi is in the starting lineup once again for Inter Miami, marking his sixth start in seven games.\n\nHere’s the starting lineups for both teams:\n\nInter Miami, Nashville ticket prices for Leagues Cup Final\n\nWant to see Messi in the Leagues Cup final in Nashville?\n\nIt could cost a pretty penny, based on ticket sales prices skyrocketing for Inter Miami games since Messi’s arrival.\n\nThe cheapest tickets available just before gametime: Vivid Seats ($285), StubHub ($397), Ticketmaster ($473).\n\nAnd the most expensive: Ticketmaster ($3,748), Vivid Seats ($2,299), StubHub ($1,260).\n\nYeah, that’s per ticket.\n\nHow quickly has Messi made impact on Inter Miami\n\nMessi has scored nine goals in six games, while Inter Miami has scored 21 goals during the Leagues Cup. All six games before tonight’s final were victories for Inter Miami.\n\nBefore Messi, Inter Miami scored 22 goals in 22 MLS games this season. With their 5-3-14 (W-D-L) record, Inter Miami sits at the bottom of the MLS Eastern Conference.\n\n“They're only gonna get better,” Philadelphia Union coach Jim Curtin said after the 4-1 loss to Inter Miami.\n\n“Their ownership is going to spend like crazy and they're going to make them the best team in the league, and they might already be one of the best teams in the league. So yeah, that's coming and I don't think anything is stopping that.”\n\nMessi and Inter Miami’s last time out vs. Philadelphia Union\n\nIt was supposed to be the toughest test yet for Lionel Messi and Inter Miami.\n\nAnd they aced it with flying colors.\n\nJosef Martinez scored three minutes into the match. Messi scored a long goal off his left foot in the 20th minute. Jordi Alba scored just before halftime. And David Ruiz, 19, scored in the 84th minute to lead Inter Miami to a 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Union in their Leagues Cup semifinal match on Tuesday night.\n\nHow difficult was this challenge supposed to be for Miami? Philly lost just one match in their last 41 contests on their home pitch before their loss to Inter Miami.\n\nInside Inter Miami's transformation with Messi\n\nAlong with Messi, Inter Miami signed Messi’s former FC Barcelona teammates in Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets. They signed Paraguayan international Diego Gómez. They added 20-year-old Argentine midfielder Facundo Farías and 19-year-old Argentine defender Tomás Avilés.\n\nAnd with the influx of talent, Inter Miami hired Messi’s longtime coach Tata Martino, who coached him with Barcelona and Argentina.\n\nThe new additions have elevated Inter Miami’s play naturally.\n\n“We are inspired, motivated and confident. But we are focused on doing everything the team needs to get better,” Martino said after the victory over Philadelphia.\n\n“We are not confused because we’re in the final now. No, we’re focused. We want to make Inter a very competitive team. Even though we’re in the final, we have a long way to go. If we didn’t have this result, we’d be complaining. But we haven’t done everything yet. No team can put together a solid team in 30 days or so.”\n\nWhat to expect from Nashville SC in Leagues Cup final?\n\nNashville SC upset Liga MX powerhouse CF Monterrey, 2-0, in the semifinals to reach Saturday night's final.\n\nNashville has made the playoffs in each of its three seasons, reaching the MLS conference semifinals in 2020 and 2021.\n\nAmong Nashville standout players: Hany Mukhtar, the reigning league MVP, is having a sensational follow-up to his MVP campaign, currently leading MLS with 13 goals. Defender Walker Zimmerman is a two-time MLS defender of the year and a four-time MLS Best XI selection. Fellow defender Shaq Moore, and Zimmerman, were part of the United States' 2022 World Cup team. Newly signed forward Sam Surridge scored the first goal in Nashville's 2-0 win over Monterrey in the Leagues Cup semifinals.\n\nWhat's at stake in Leagues Cup final?\n\nInter Miami and Nashville SC — as well as the winner of the third-place game between the Philadelphia Union and CF Monterrey — have earned automatic berths for 2024 into the Concacaf Champions Cup (formerly named the Concacaf Champions League).\n\nHowever, the Leagues Cup winner will earn automatic qualification to the Round of 16 in the Concacaf Champions Cup.\n\nMessi 'enjoying the moment' with Inter Miami\n\nMessi held his first press conference earlier this week, nearly a month after joining Inter Miami.\n\nWhile moving to South Florida has been an adjustment, Messi said he’s happy with the decision he made to join the MLS franchise co-owned by David Beckham.\n\n“I’m happy enjoying this new stage, and I’m enjoying the experience of living here in this country,” Messi said.\n\nMessi feels he was forced out of Barcelona to PSG\n\nMessi, softspoken and introspective, said his Miami experience so far has been drastically different from previous stops in his illustrious career.\n\n“I chose to come here. I wanted to come here. And it’s a decision we made with time. It wasn’t something we decided one day to the next. We are where we want to be. It’s a decision we made. That makes everything much easier and simpler,” Messi said.\n\n“When I went to Paris, it wasn’t something I wanted. I didn’t want to leave Barcelona. In some ways, it was one day to the next. I had to adapt to somewhere completely different from where I lived all my life. But that’s totally different from my experience here.”\n\nWill Messi play on turf in MLS?\n\nMessi has played most of his historic career on natural grass, creating some discussion on whether he would play on synthetic turf in some MLS stadiums.\n\nMessi appeared open to the possibility to playing on turf.\n\n“All of my lower leagues, I’ve always played on turf,” Messi said. “That was a long time ago and it’s been a long time since I played on synthetic turf. But I have no problem adapting to turf again.”\n\nWhat is Inter Miami's remaining 2023 schedule?\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. Open Cup semifinal game on Aug. 23 (which will be available to stream on the CBS Sports Golazo Network), all other Inter Miami games are available to watch via the MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/passaic/west-milford/2018/01/02/west-milford-wrestling-encouraged-after-fourth-place-showing/995244001/", "title": "West Milford wrestling encouraged after fourth-place showing", "text": "ROSELLE PARK – An encouraging ending to 2017 has the West Milford High School wrestling team amped to start the New Year.\n\nFollowing back-to-back top four finishes in its last two tournaments to close out the year, including last week’s fourth-place showing in the competitive Panther Invitational Tournament at Roselle Park, the Highlanders ring in 2018 with hope and promise.\n\n“We are wrestling well right now and I think a lot of it is coming from how hard we are working in practice,” said head coach Taylor Pevny. “We want our guys to compete every day and get the best out of each other in the practice room. I think you can see it translating to the mat.”\n\nWest Milford (2-1) kicked off the season two weeks ago with a third-place finish in the Dover Tournament, producing two champions, a silver medalist and had several other top five finishers. They followed that up by winning two of three matches against Ramapo and neighboring Kinnelon in a quad they hosted that also featured state power Kittatinny.\n\nMore:Wrestling: West Milford on the road back to the top\n\nMore:Former Turkish wrestling champ from West Milford cherishes his memories\n\nPevny, determined to get his program back to relevant status, purposely set up a series of competitive tournaments and matchups back in the offseason to help his Highlanders prepare come time for the start of the dual match season in January.\n\nAt last Friday’s Panther Invitational at Roselle Park High School, West Milford finished with 127 points, good enough for a fourth-place finish behind team champions West Essex (197.5 points).\n\nHost school Roselle Park took second with 186 points, followed by Westfield, who finished in a distant third with 160 points.\n\nWest Milford finished ahead of Passaic County rivals Passaic Valley (123.5), as well as Piscataway (144), Madison (59), Bloomfield (34) and Franklin (27.5).\n\nCraig Blumeling was the lone individual champion for West Milford, claiming top honors at 152 pounds with a 6-3 finish over Passaic Valley’s Luke Geleta. The senior pinned his first two opponents before edging Geleta in the finals.\n\n“He [Blumeling] looked really good in this tournament,” said Pevny. “This was Craig’s first time in the finals of a tournament and he wrestled well all day beating a tough kid in the finals.”\n\nJoining Blumeling on the podium were teammates Carlos Villeda (120) and Trevor Fleet (126), who both finished second and freshman Reilly Fleet who was third at 113 pounds.\n\n“Carlos had a good day getting himself into the finals and picking up a silver medal,” said Pevny. “He’s a kid with a lot of potential and he makes our team pretty strong being down at 120.”\n\nTrevor Fleet, a state qualifier last year, cruised into the finals before running into state contender Mark Montgomery of Roselle Park in a 7-3 setback. Fleet’s brother Reilly bounced back to finish third after losing to West Essex’s Jack Ruane, 4-0 in the semifinals.\n\n“It was a tough match for Trevor, but those are the types of matches you need to prepare for a good run towards the end of the year,” said Pevny. “Reilly wrestled well yet again and is now 8-1 on the year.”\n\nThe Highlanders picked up key team points to help in the standings when heavyweights Joey DeSanno (220) and Mike Podmokly (285) both went 1-1 on the day with big pins in small brackets.\n\nWest Milford rings in the New Year and the dual match season on Wednesday night with a home match against Wayne Hills. On Friday night they hit the road when they travel to Bergen County to face Pascack Valley.\n\n“We have big matches coming up this week including our conference home opener verse Wayne Hills,” said Pevny.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2024/03/17/march-madness-bracket-ncaa-tournament-reveal/72955781007/", "title": "March Madness bracket reveal: See full 2024 NCAA bracket, schedule", "text": "Editor's note: Follow all of the men's March Madness action, scores and highlights here with USA TODAY Sports' live coverage.\n\nMen’s college basketball launches fully into March Madness 2024 as the 68-team field for the NCAA Tournament was announced on the Selection Sunday.\n\nUConn, which won the national championship last year, will enter the tournament with an even bigger target as the No. 1 overall seed.

The rest of the crew – Clark Kellogg, Jay Wright and Seth Davis – all wished Gumbel and his family well before the bracket was announced. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nMarch Madness bracket winners and losers\n\nWINNERS\n\nNorth Carolina — Despite being the weakest of the four top seeds, the Tar Heels are in what looks on paper to be the easiest region.\n\nDespite being the weakest of the four top seeds, the Tar Heels are in what looks on paper to be the easiest region.

There’s never been a time in the history of college basketball where being a blue blood has meant less in terms of March Madness success.\n\nThis year, it seems likely that at least one or more of those historically prominent programs will quench their thirst and find a way to Phoenix. Here are the eight schools most likely to break their Final Four-less streaks, ranked by the amount of heartbreak they’ve endured in pursuit of it.\n\nDan Wolken's list of teams most likely to end their droughts is ranked by heartbreak.\n\nWhich teams are in the men's First Four?\n\nAll games are on truTV.\n\nTuesday, March 19, 6:40 p.m. ET: Wagner (16-15) vs. Howard (18-16) for the No. 16 seed in the West.

The winner will face No. 7 Florida on Friday, March 22.\n\nWest Region bracket: North Carolina earns last No. 1 seed\n\nAll three contenders for the final No. 1 seed all lost in their conference tournament but the Tar Heels benefit from reaching the ACC tournament title game while Tennessee and Arizona flamed out before the final. Arizona still stays in the west and has a nice path to the Final Four. Baylor also could be primed for a run along with Alabama. Both score but lack defense. This is a very balanced group of top seeds but not the toughest grouping.

Before that game, Vols coach Rick Barnes could be matched with former school Texas in the second round. Gonzaga surprisingly gets a No. 5 seed. Big boost for the Bulldogs, which could be matched with a struggling Kansas team in the second round. Virginia is a big surprise addition in the play-in game. Cavaliers seemingly were outside the bubble. Colorado State joins Boise State as Mountain West teams in the play-in games.

However, there will be some challengers with Marquette, Duke and Kentucky in this regional. The Golden Eagles need standout guard Tyler Kolek to be healthy. It'll be worth watching if North Carolina State keeps its unlikely run going after five wins in the ACC tournament and a tough opener against Texas Tech.

The Huskies could face Florida Atlantic – a Final Four team last year that won its way to Houston with two victories in New York last year. Illinois and Iowa State are the Nos. 2 and 3 seeds and both could be major threats. Two contrasting teams there with the Illini one of the top scoring offenses and the Cyclones having an outstanding defense.

Here’s everything you need to know about how Selection Sunday works.\n\nWho plays in March Madness?\n\nThe winners of the 32 conference tournaments are automatically given a spot in the tournament, regardless of record. The remaining 36 spots are at-large bids determined by the committee. Here’s everything you need to know about how Selection Sunday works.\n\nHow are March Madness bids determined?\n\nThere are several different resources for the committee to choose the best 36 at-large teams, such as record and strength of schedule. But perhaps the most important one is the NET ranking. The NET ranking looks at a team's record and résumé, which then ranks all teams in Division I. Games are divided into four quadrants, and a team's quadrant record depends on who they are playing and where. This is how quadrant games are broken down:\n\nQuadrant 1: Home 1-30, Neutral 1-50, Away 1-75\n\nQuadrant 2: Home 31-75, Neutral 51-100, Away 76-135\n\nQuadrant 3: Home 76-160, Neutral 101-200, Away 135-240\n\nQuadrant 4: Home 161-353, Neutral 201-353, Away 241-353\n\nThe more Quad 1 wins, the better chance for a team to be selected in the tournament. Considering the NET ranking and other factors, the committee will then come up with the 36 best at-large teams to be selected. There are no limits to how many teams from a certain conference gets selected. Here’s everything you need to know about how Selection Sunday works.\n\n2024 March Madness automatic bids\n\nThere are 32 conference tournaments that produce 32 automatic bids.

Once all the teams are ranked, every four teams are evaluated in the same seed line. Example: Nos. 1-4 will be the No. 1 seeds, Nos. 5-8 will be the No. 2 seeds and so on. The four lowest-ranked automatic qualifying teams will play in the First Four games as 16 seeds, while the four lowest at-large teams will compete in the other First Four games, typically as a No. 11 or No. 12 seed. Here’s everything you need to know about how Selection Sunday works.\n\nHow does Selection Sunday work?\n\nOn Selection Sunday, the full brackets will be revealed on CBS for the men and ESPN for the women, with matchups for every first-round game, as well as location, unveiled. A 12-person selection committee decides who will be in the tournament, as well as where each team is seeded and will play. Here’s everything you need to know about how Selection Sunday works.\n\nWhen is the first March Madness game?\n\nGames for the men's First Four are March 19-20. First-round games for the men are March 21-22.\n\nMarch Madness 2024 game locations\n\nHere are all the venues hosting tournament games over the next several weeks.\n\nRound City Venue Dates First Four Dayton, Ohio UD Arena March 19-20 First/Second Brooklyn.

State Farm Stadium April 8\n\nHow is it determined where teams play in March Madness?\n\nOnce the seeds for each team are determined, the committee must then place them in the regional location that makes sense and preferred, as well as the first- and second-round sites. All tournament locations are predetermined, so the higher the seed, the better the site location for the team.\n\nExample, if the No. 1 seed is Houston, it will get to play in the South region, which takes place in Dallas. It likely would get to pick the location for the first two games, which would be in Memphis since it's the closest spot to the school. The No. 1 seeds typically get the best possible location for them, and it could be a prime location for seeds Nos. 2-4 as well. The committee attempts to put the bracket in snake order, like the No. 5 overall seed will be in the same region as the No. 4 overall seed, but there are restrictions such as:\n\nFirst four teams from the same conference must be in different regions if they are a Nos. 1-4 seed.\n\nTeams from the same conference cannot meet before a regional final if they played each other three times during the regular season and conference tournament.\n\nTeams from the same conference cannot meet before a regional semifinal if they played each other two times during the regular season and conference tournament.\n\nTeams from the same conference cannot meet before the second round if they played each other once during the regular season and conference tournament.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about how Selection Sunday works.\n\nMarch Madness 2024 schedule\n\nHere is the men's schedule:\n\nSelection Sunday : Sunday, March 17\n\n: Sunday, March 17 First Four : March 19-20\n\n: March 19-20 First round : March 21-22\n\n: March 21-22 Second round : March 23-24\n\n: March 23-24 Sweet 16 : March 28-29\n\n: March 28-29 Elite Eight : March 30-31\n\n: March 30-31 Final Four : Saturday, April 6 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\n: Saturday, April 6 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

And with an upset of Duke, an overtime victory over Virginia and its smothering of the Tar Heels on Saturday night, it managed to pull it off.\n\n\"Why not us? We carried that mantra into the tournament,\" fifth-year guard Casey Morsell said. \"We knew we were the underdog, but we love that feeling. We love being the underdogs. We were like 10-point underdogs today. We love that. We love it all.” – Tom Schad\n\nFive most overpaid men's college basketball coaches: John Calipari, Mike Woodson make list\n\nWhether you believe Kentucky coach John Calipari is overpaid could depend on the year, the month, even the week. Calipari earned his mega-millions salary when the Wildcats were among the most dominant teams in Division I, capturing one national championship in 2012 and playing for others in 2011, 2014 and 2015. But Kentucky hasn't been back to the Final Four since even as Calipari's annual salary continues to rise ― now at $8.5 million in total compensation for 2023-24, second-most in the country.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports compiled pay information from each school in the Power Five conferences and from each school outside those conferences whose team has appeared in at least three of the past five NCAA tournaments.\n\nWhile Kentucky has had moments this season, including a late run that has lifted the Wildcats toward the top of the SEC, the results and payoff given the school's mammoth investment into Calipari and the program makes him yet again one of the most overpaid coaches in the country. Read Paul Myerberg’s full story here.\n\nHow much does John Calipari make?\n\nKentucky’s John Calipari is now at $8.5 million in total compensation for 2023-24, second-most in the country.\n\nMichigan State's basketball maverick: How Tom Izzo has prospered on his terms for 30 years\n\nNearly three decades ago, Michigan State University offered Tom Izzo a five-year, $540,000 contract to be its next men's basketball coach. He didn't bother countering or negotiating. In fact, he didn't even have an agent. In the years since, Izzo has led the Spartans to eight Final Four appearances and a national championship in 2000 – emerging as one of the sport’s iconic coaches and, in many ways, the face of the university. His contracts have gotten more lucrative and complex as a result, but he said his approach at Michigan State hasn't changed.\n\n\"I've never negotiated a contract,\" Izzo told USA TODAY Sports. \"Ever.\"\n\nNor does he have an agent.\n\n\"I heard I'm one of the only dumb ones,\" he added, with a laugh.\n\nIt’s no surprise that Izzo, who spent 12 seasons as a Michigan State assistant before being promoted to head coach in 1995, is once again among the highest-paid men’s basketball coaches in the country in 2024. According to USA TODAY Sports’ annual review of coaching compensation, the 69-year-old is making roughly $6.2 million this season, which puts him third behind only Bill Self of Kansas and John Calipari of Kentucky.\n\nWhat’s unusual, however, is the way that Izzo and Michigan State have gotten to this point – piecing together big-money contracts for almost 30 years with little public acrimony, even as Izzo’s stature has grown, administrators have come and gone, and the landscape of college sports has shifted.

{"question_id": "20240412_15", "search_time": "2024/04/12/23:06", "search_result": [{"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/tech/tiktok-ban-users/index.html", "title": "TikTok might be too big to ban, no matter what lawmakers say | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn July 2020, the same month former President Donald Trump said he would ban TikTok in the United States, Callie Goodwin of Columbia, South Carolina, posted her first video on the app to promote the small business she had started out of her garage during the pandemic.\n\nInspired by a neighbor dropping off some brownies and a handwritten note for her while she was in quarantine, Goodwin decided to launch a pre-stamped greeting cards company called Sparks of Joy Co. A few months later, a TikTok influencer with some two million followers shared one of Goodwin’s cards on her account and Goodwin saw her business take off.\n\nGoodwin, now 28, told CNN that more than 90% of her orders currently come from people who discover her business through TikTok. “If it were to get banned, I would see business plummeting,” Goodwin told CNN. “I would lose most of my sales.”\n\nFor much of the past two years, talk of an outright TikTok ban seemed to recede. TikTok outlasted the Trump administration and only saw its popularity continue to grow. It was the top downloaded app in the United States last year, and remains the top downloaded app year-to-date in 2022, according to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower. In the process, TikTok, which said it had 100 million US users as of 2020, became even more central to American culture and to livelihoods of influencers and business owners like Goodwin.\n\nBut suddenly, the future of TikTok in the United States appears more uncertain than at any point since July 2020. A growing number of Republican governors have recently announced bans on TikTok for state employees on government devices, including from multiple states on Thursday alone. State attorneys general and a Republican commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission have each pressured Apple and Google to take tougher measures with the app. And a trio of US lawmakers led by Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, introduced a bill earlier this week that once again seeks to block TikTok in the US due to the parent company’s base in China.\n\nCallie Goodwin launched a small business shortly before Trump first said he would ban the app. Two years later, she said a TikTok ban would cause her to \"lose most of my sales.\" Courtesy Callie Goodwin\n\nThe renewed political scrutiny comes amid a broader, ongoing reckoning over the impact that TikTok and other social media platforms have on their youngest users. There have been recent debates over whether TikTok’s content is age-appropriate for teens as well as fears that its algorithms may lead users to potentially harmful subject matter, including posts related to suicide and eating disorders.\n\nAt the same time, TikTok has come under fire in Washington for its ties to China through its parent company. The criticism ramped up earlier this year after a Buzzfeed News report said some US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China, and cited one employee who allegedly said, “Everything is seen in China.” TikTok, for its part, has confirmed US user data can be accessed by some employees in China.\n\nTikTok has been negotiating for years with the US government and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) on a potential deal that addresses the lingering national security concerns and allows the app to continue operating in the United States. Recently, there have been reports of delays in those negotiations.\n\nThe tremendous reach of TikTok may only make it harder to ban the service outright, some national security experts say. Even some TikTok critics have hedged on whether a ban is the right approach. Sen. Josh Hawley, who authored a bill to ban TikTok from US government devices, said this week he would be “fine” if the US government and TikTok reached a deal to safeguard US users’ data. “But if they don’t do that,” Hawley said, “then I think we’re going to have to look at more stringent measures.”\n\nAs lawmakers have renewed calls for tougher action to be taken with the app, some of its users who have built their livelihoods and found a sense of community on the app say they can’t imagine an America without it.\n\nTikTok now drives culinary habits (including a 200% jump in Feta sales at one grocery store after a baked pasta dish went viral); countless fashion and beauty crazes (from “skin cycling” to “glazed donut nails”), and propels new and old music (including the 1980s song “Break My Stride”) to the top of streaming charts. A significant percentage of US politicians campaigned on the app ahead of the midterm elections. And legacy news organizations like the 176-year-old Associated Press have recently joined TikTok to reach new audiences.\n\nKahlil Greene. Laurie Gomez\n\n“So many people, myself included, are always on TikTok,” Kahlil Greene, 22, of New Haven, Connecticut, told CNN. “That’s where we get our entertainment from, our news from, our musical taste from, our social inside jokes we make with friends come from memes that started on TikTok.”\n\nGreene, who is known as the “Gen Z historian” across social media, has amassed more than 580,000 followers on TikTok by documenting social and cultural issues. Greene’s following on TikTok even garnered the attention of the Biden administration. Greene was among the handful of TikTokers who were recently invited to a White House press briefing on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“So much of our culture and lives are driven by TikTok now that it’s not just something you can rip away easily,” he said.\n\n“Too big to fail”\n\nTikTok has simultaneously tried to ease concerns about its impact on Americans and their data while also working to expand its footprint in the country.\n\nThe company, which is owned by Beijing-based Bytedance, has committed to moving its US user data to Oracle’s cloud platform and to taking other steps to isolate US user data from other parts of its business. TikTok said last week that it would restructure its US-focused content moderation, policy and legal teams under a special group within the company led by US-based officials and walled off organizationally from other teams focused on the rest of the world.\n\nIn response to the bill calling for a ban, a TikTok spokesperson said: “It’s troubling that rather than encouraging the Administration to conclude its national security review of TikTok, some members of Congress have decided to push for a politically-motivated ban that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States.”\n\nA growing number of state and federal lawmakers are attempting to crack down on TikTok, including some who are calling for an outright ban.

At a time when major tech giants including Meta and Twitter are slashing staff, TikTok is still hiring American engineers. TikTok also appears be to taking aim at a chunk of Amazon’s e-commerce empire by seeking to build out its own warehousing network in the United States, a flurry of recent job postings indicates.\n\nThe challenge for the federal government “is it’s almost like TikTok is too big to fail,” said Rick Sofield, a partner at Vinson & Elkins L.L.P., who focuses on national security reviews, export controls and economic sanctions. “I think their minds are made up that ByteDance owning TikTok is a national security concern – the reason that we’ve been hung up is it’s too big to fail, and they’re trying to figure out a soft landing.”\n\n“There’s a whole lot of things I think that would have to happen first, before there’s a ban,” he added.\n\nA livelihood and a lifeline\n\nFor Adrianna Wise, 30, TikTok hasn’t just been “essential” for building her bakery in Columbus, Ohio, it’s also been a critical tool that lets her reach young Black and brown people in her community and share knowledge and tips on how to build a business.\n\n“I see the impact that I’m having when I go out into the community and people are like, ‘Oh my gosh, I follow you TikTok,’” Wise, who is co-founder of Coco’s Confectionary Kitchen, told CNN. “I had a little girl a few weeks ago tell me, ‘It was just so cool because you have hair like me, and you’re on TikTok and you have so many views!’”\n\nAdrianna Wise says TikTok allows her to reach young Black and brown people in her community. \"A lot of them are learning the skills and the tools they need to be able to create and cultivate their own businesses on platforms like TikTok, if not exclusively on TikTok,\" she said. Courtesy Adrianna Wise\n\n“A lot of them are learning the skills and the tools they need to be able to create and cultivate their own businesses on platforms like TikTok, if not exclusively on TikTok,” she said.\n\nGoodwin, the Sparks of Joy Co. founder, similarly says a TikTok ban would not only be devastating for her business, but also for her sense of community. She candidly documents her mental health journey via TikTok and has built a support system via the platform. “My best friend in the world right now, I met on TikTok,” she said. “We’re practically family at this point.”\n\n“TikTok is way more than just dancing videos or lip-syncing videos. It really has so many different niches, and you can find community in any of them,” Goodwin told CNN. “So if it were to go away, it would be it would be a great loss.”\n\nDespite the hullaballoo, Greene, the Gen Z historian, says he is not particularly worried about a potential TikTok ban – even though he acknowledges it could cause a hit to his income and sponsorship deals. If anything, he says the folks in government calling for a ban don’t seem to be aware of how central it is to the lives of people in his generation.\n\nHootie Hurley, 23, a Los Angeles-based full-time creator with more than 1.3 million followers on TikTok, told CNN that he now makes most of his income through his TikTok following. Courtesy Hootie Hurley\n\n“Generally speaking, the side of the argument that’s like super against TikTok, super alarmist about what it means, hasn’t done a great job communicating that message,” he said. Greene views “data privacy concerns” as “more of a buzzword than a tangible fear.”\n\n“We grew up in a generation where our data was always public,” he said, “and we always put our lives on social media.”\n\nHootie Hurley, 23, a Los Angeles-based full-time creator with more than 1.3 million followers on TikTok, told CNN that he now makes most of his income through his TikTok following. While a ban would be “very scary” for him and his livelihood,” Hurley said he and other TikTok creators are more focused on entertaining their audience than stressing about it – especially after weathering the first ban threats back in 2020.\n\n“If the government ever did ban it,” he said, “everybody would actually be very, very surprised.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/12/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/tech/tiktok-bytedance-journalist-data/index.html", "title": "TikTok confirms that journalists' data was accessed by ByteDance ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nTikTok parent company ByteDance has fired four employees who improperly accessed the personal data of two journalists on the platform, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter confirmed to CNN Thursday.\n\nTikTok user data from the two journalists, who worked for the Financial Times and BuzzFeed, was accessed while ByteDance employees were investigating potential employee leaks to the press, according to the company. The employees involved, two based in the United States and two in China, were fired following an investigation conducted on behalf of the company by an outside law firm, the CEOs of TikTok and ByteDance revealed to employees in two separate emails Thursday.\n\nThe personal data accessed from the journalists’ accounts included IP addresses, according to the spokesperson. IP addresses can provide information about a user’s location.\n\n“The individuals involved misused their authority to obtain access to TikTok user data,” TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in his email to employees, according to an excerpt of the email reviewed by CNN. “This is unacceptable.”\n\nThe disclosure could further inflame the scrutiny TikTok is facing in the United States over national security concerns given its ties to China. US lawmakers have raised concerns about the security of user data and the ability for the company’s Chinese employees to access information about US TikTok users.\n\nThe criticism ramped up earlier this year after a BuzzFeed News report said some US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China, and cited one employee who allegedly said that “everything is seen in China.” TikTok, for its part, has confirmed US user data can be accessed by some employees in China, but the company says that a US-based security team decides who can access US user data from China.\n\nIn October, Forbes reported that ByteDance planned to use TikTok data to surveil certain US citizens. In a Thursday report, Forbes named three journalists who had been tracked by the company. (TikTok declined to comment on whether a third journalist had indeed been affected.) The New York Times also reported that several of the journalists’ contacts on TikTok had also gotten wrapped up in the tracking, which the company declined to confirm.\n\n“The misconduct of these individuals, who are no longer employed at ByteDance, was an egregious misuse of their authority to obtain access to user data,” Oberwetter said in a statement Thursday. “This misbehavior is unacceptable, and not in line with our efforts across TikTok to earn the trust of our users.”\n\nIn response to the incident, TikTok said it has restructured its internal audit and risk teams, and removed access to US user data for those teams, according to the spokesperson. “We take data security incredibly seriously, and we will continue to enhance our access protocols, which have already been significantly improved and hardened since this incident took place,” Oberwetter said.\n\nThe Financial Times said that “spying on reporters, interfering with their work or intimidating their sources is completely unacceptable. We’ll be investigating this story more fully before deciding our formal response,” according to a statement included in a report from the newspaper.\n\nA spokesperson for BuzzFeed said in a statement to CNN that it is “deeply disturbed” by the disclosure, calling it a “blatant disregard for the privacy and rights of journalists as well as TikTok users.”\n\n“It’s even more troubling that this comes in the wake of a series of reports by BuzzFeed News that exposed major issues within its parent company, from employees accessing American users’ data from China to ByteDance’s attempts to push pro-China messaging to Americans,” the BuzzFeed spokesperson said.\n\nMore than a dozen states, including Maryland, South Dakota and Texas, have announced bans in recent weeks of TikTok for state employees on government-issued devices, and a small but growing number of universities are also blocking access to TikTok on school-owned devices or WiFi networks. The Senate earlier this week passed a bill to ban TikTok from all US government devices. And a trio of lawmakers has introduced legislation aimed at banning the short-form video app from operating in the United States.\n\nTikTok is currently engaged in longstanding negotiations with the US government on a potential deal to address national security concerns and let the app continue serving US customers. It has also said it has taken steps to isolate US user data from other parts of its business, including through a partnership with US-based Oracle.\n\n“No matter what the cause or the outcome was, this misguided investigation seriously violated the company’s Code of Conduct and is condemned by the company,” ByteDance CEO Rubo Liang said in the Thursday email to employees. “We simply cannot take integrity risks that damage the trust of our users, employees, and stakeholders.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/tech/tiktok-user-data-oracle/index.html", "title": "TikTok moves US users' data to Oracle servers to address security ...", "text": "1.

But the White House hopes it will convince tech companies to take additional steps to protect consumers, including clearly explaining how and why an automated system is in use and designing AI systems to be equitable. The blueprint joins a number of other voluntary efforts to adopt rules regarding transparency and ethics in AI, which have come from government agencies, companies and non-government groups.\n\nThough the use of AI has proliferated in recent years — being used for everything from confirming people’s identities for unemployment benefits to generating a highly realistic picture in response to a written prompt — the US legislative landscape has not kept pace. There are no federal laws specifically regulating AI or applications of AI, such as facial-recognition software, which has been criticized by privacy and digital rights groups for years over privacy issues and leading to the wrongful arrests, of at least several Black men, among other issues.\n\nA handful of individual states have their own rules. Illinois, for instance, has a law known as the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), which forces companies to get permission from people before collecting biometric data like fingerprints or scans of facial geometry. It also allows Illinois residents to sue companies for alleged violations of the law. Since 2019, a number of communities and some states have also banned the use of facial-recognition software in various ways, though a few have since pulled back on such rules.\n\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights includes five principles: That people should be protected from systems deemed “unsafe or ineffective;” that people shouldn’t be discriminated against via algorithms and that AI-driven systems should be made and used “in an equitable way;” that people should be kept safe “from abusive data practices” by safeguards built in to AI systems and have control over how data about them is used; that people should be aware when an automated system is in use and be aware of how it could affect them; and that people should be able to opt out of such systems “where appropriate” and get help from a person instead of a computer.\n\n“Much more than a set of principles, this is a blueprint to empower the American people to expect better and demand better from their technologies,” said Alondra Nelson, the deputy director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, during a press briefing.\n\nWhile some privacy and technology advocates responded positively to the guidelines, they also pointed out that they are just that, guidelines — and not legally binding.\n\nIn a statement, Alexandra Reeve Givens, president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington, DC-based nonprofit, said, “Today’s agency actions are valuable, but they would be even more effective if they were built on a foundation set up by a comprehensive federal privacy law.”\n\nIn a separate statement, ReNika Moore, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Racial Justice Program, called the principles “an important step in addressing the harms of AI” and added that “there should be no loopholes or carve-outs for these protections.”\n\n“It’s critical that the Biden administration use all levers available to make the promises of the Bill of Rights blueprint a reality,” Moore said.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/957406/us-presidential-election-2024-the-possible-republican-candidates", "title": "2024 presidential candidates | The Week", "text": "Election Day 2024 will be here before we know it, and a once-crowded presidential field has now narrowed to its final contestants. Here is a list of candidates on all sides of the aisle, though expect to see more names drop off as the race progresses.

Personal freedom is fundamental to who we are as Americans. There's nothing more important. Nothing more sacred,\" the president said at the start of a three-minute launch video. \"Around the country, MAGA extremists are lining up to take down those bedrock freedoms.\" This is \"not a time to be complacent,\" he continued, \"and that's why I'm running for re-election.\" Should the president succeed in reclaiming the White House, he will be 86 at the end of his second term.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, Biden secured enough delegates to clinch the Democratic Party's nomination, setting him up for a rematch with former President Donald Trump.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Trump will carry the banner of the Republican Party into the general election on the back of 88 criminal indictments against him.\n\nMarianne Williamson (D) — odds of winning: not displayed\n\nCall it a comeback (or not), but Marianne Williamson is not giving up the Democratic nomination without a fight. Her unsuccessful 2020 bid saw Williamson drop out of the race almost a full year before election day, and she did the same in 2024 — for a while. Following a third-place finish in the Democratic primary in Michigan, Williamson unsuspended her campaign in a rare reentry into the presidential race. Williamson had dropped out \"because I was losing the horse race, but something so much more important than the horse race is at stake here, and we must respond,\" the candidate said in a video on X . Like most of the remaining candidates beyond Biden and Trump, however, Williamson's chances of winning the White House are believed to be low, and her name is not even listed among the betting candidates on Oddschecker's presidential odds.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. (I) — odds of winning: +3,300\n\nAn environmental lawyer as well as the son of late U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy — yes, that one — RFK Jr. is perhaps best known for his support of anti-vaccine rhetoric, beliefs that have been vehemently denounced by his own family. After initially launching his White House bid in conjunction with the Democratic Party, Kennedy in October switched to independent, which could complicate things for both Biden and Trump alike .\n\nThe aforementioned condemnation by his own family has made him an outlier among the Democratic tentpoles. RFK Jr.'s nephew, Jack Schlossberg, said his uncle was \"trading in on Camelot, celebrity conspiracy theories and conflict for personal gain,\" calling his candidacy \"an embarrassment.\" As the election creeps closer, RFK Jr. is believed to be courting a number of vice presidential candidates, with a Bay Area lawyer and the backer of an RFK Jr. Super Bowl ad, Nicole Shanahan, reportedly at the top of the list.\n\nCornel West (I) — odds of winning: +99,900\n\nPhilosopher, scholar and activist Cornel West raised the perennial debate over third-party spoilers when he announced a run for president alongside the People's Party, then the Green Party, and now as an independent. \"People are hungry for change,\" West wrote on X when announcing his switch to run as an independent. \"They want good policies over partisan politics. We need to break the grip of the duopoly and give power to the people.\"\n\nLike RFK Jr., though, his run as an independent means West is unlikely to travel very far in his presidential aspirations. He has recently been using the events of the Israel-Hamas war as a catalyst to draw in Muslim and Arab American voters, many of whom have become disillusioned with the Biden administration's response to the war.\n\nChase Oliver (L) — odds of winning: not displayed\n\nChase Oliver , a libertarian, announced his candidacy in April 2023, per Ballotpedia . Speaking at the Iowa State Fair, the 2022 U.S. Senate candidate out of Georgia described himself as \"armed and gay,\" and urged a \"cultural war ceasefire,\" per the Des Moines Register . \"I don't care how you live, who you love, how you worship, how you express yourself, if you do it in peace, that's your business, not the government's,\" he said. Oliver is also pro-choice, supports the legalization of marijuana, and wants to see an increased focus on combating addiction and drug use in the U.S. Like Williamson, his odds of winning are so low that they are not displayed on Oddschecker.\n\nDropped out\n\nWill Hurd (R), former congressman from Texas: dropped out of the race in October 2023 and endorsed Nikki Haley.\n\nFrancis Suarez (R), mayor of Miami, Florida: dropped out of the race in August 2023 after promising to do so after failing to secure a spot in the first GOP debate.\n\nLarry Elder (R), conservative political commentator and radio host: dropped out of the race in October 2023 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nPerry Johnson (R), businessman and former gubernatorial candidate: dropped out of the race in October 2023 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nMike Pence (R), former vice president: dropped out of the race in October 2023, saying it was \"not my time.\"\n\nTim Scott (R), South Carolina senator: dropped out of the race in November 2023 during a surprise announcement on Fox News.\n\nCorey Stapleton (R), former Montana secretary of state: dropped out of the race in October 2023.\n\nDoug Burgum (R), governor of North Dakota: dropped out of the race in December 2023 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nChris Christie (R), former New Jersey governor: dropped out of the race in January 2024 and said he would not \"enable Donald Trump to ever be president of the United States again.\"\n\nAsa Hutchinson (R), former Arkansas governor: dropped out of the race in January 2024 after getting less than 200 votes in the Iowa caucuses.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy (R), businessman and entrepreneur: dropped out of the race in January 2024 after a poor performance in the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nRon DeSantis (R), governor of Florida: dropped out of the race in January 2024 after a poor performance in the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nNikki Haley (R), former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador: dropped out of the race in March 2024 after a resounding defeat to Trump on Super Tuesday.\n\nRyan Binkley (R), pastor and entrepreneur from Texas: dropped out of the race in February 2024 and endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nUpdated March 18, 2024: This article has been updated throughout.", "authors": ["Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Brigid Kennedy", "With Contributions From", "The Week Staff", "Joel Mathis", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harold Maass", "Peter Weber", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2024/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959061/people-of-2022", "title": "People of 2022: from Meghan Markle to Matt Hancock | The Week", "text": "1.

He squinted through the glare of the sun to make out the figure of Martin Luther King III beyond the Jumbotron.\n\n“If we choose community,” King said, “50 years from now, people will say that we were able to redeem the soul of America and began to fulfill the promise of democracy by systematically eliminating systematic racism and exploitation.”\n\nElyjah, a 13-year-old from the Northeast Side, looked back at the sea of black, brown and white faces dotting the National Mall, all the way to the Washington Monument, at the “Get Your Knee Off Our Neck” Commitment March.\n\nThe chanting from the crowd — calling for equality and an end to police brutality — reverberated in his ears.\n\nGet the news delivered to your inbox: Sign up for our politics newsletter\n\nHours after the crowds at the march had dissipated, Elyjah sat in the corner of a room at the Ivy City Hotel, which he shared with his mom and two other Columbus-based protesters, and scrolled through TikTok.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nDays earlier, Elyjah said his reason for tagging along to the march with his mom, Heather Johnson, was because he was certain the coronavirus would force his middle school to cancel its annual eighth-grade trip to D.C. next spring.\n\n“It’s a little bit bigger than that now,” he said.\n\n'I don’t want them to end up as hashtags': Heather takes to the streets\n\nElyjah’s mom knew she had to go to D.C.\n\nThe minute the 32-year-old heard the Rev. Al Sharpton announce that there would be a march in Washington on the 57th anniversary of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, she booked the hotel room, a few miles from the center of the capital.\n\nHeather felt compelled to become involved in Columbus’ protest scene after George Floyd’s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis. She said she was watching a Facebook livestream of a demonstration on East Livingston Avenue and Lockborne Road in late May when she saw a protester beaten by Columbus police.\n\n“I can still picture it in my mind, you know?” Heather said. “And with Trayvon Martin I sent money, with Freddie Gray I sent money … I felt guilty about only sending money.”\n\nSo Heather decided to take to the streets this summer.\n\nIt’s where she met the protesters who eventually gave the Johnsons a ride to D.C. in a packed Prius, and with whom she shared a common goal: complete abolition of police in Columbus and across the country.\n\nThe protests have changed her. She found a full-time position as a community advocate with the Columbus nonprofit group Halt Violence, leaving her previous job at a Chase Bank call center. She also volunteered to register people in the community to vote. And she starts classes at Ohio State University in September through a community health worker program.\n\nThe mother of five knows firsthand how the effects of police brutality can impact a family. She was only 9 years old, she said, when she watched her oldest brother, Demetrius, beaten by a white police officer in front of the McGuffey Market in North Linden.\n\n“I remember running down the street, screaming for help,” she said.\n\nHeather’s kids — Elyjah, Elyzah, 11, Elyias, 8, Antwan Jr., 3, and Antonio, 2 — are her biggest priority in life.\n\n“I don’t want them to end up as hashtags,” she told The Dispatch.\n\nHow often does Heather worry about the likelihood of her kids becoming victims of police brutality?\n\n“All the time,” she said. “Better question is when do I not worry about it? ”\n\nBig dreams for Columbus teen\n\nElyjah is an enthusiastic kid.\n\nBefore making the trek to D.C., he had only been out of Ohio once, when he was 2 and taken to visit family members in Mississippi. But this would be a trip he would remember.\n\nOn Thursday night before the march, Elyjah begged his mom to check out the scene at the White House, where protesters, residents and curious passersby were gathered for a dance party at Lafayette Square.\n\n“I’m not tired, I’m a different breed,” Elyjah said, goading Heather into catching a second wind after mother and son had spent the afternoon at the International Spy Museum.\n\n“EJ, you need to chill,” his mom said.\n\nBut Elyjah won out.\n\nElyjah has ambitions to become a criminal prosecutor. It’s something he’s been saying since the third grade, ever since he started avidly watching “Law & Order: SVU.”\n\n“These days everyone wants to be a YouTuber or streamer, but not all of them are gonna make it,” he said.\n\nAnd as far as Elyjah’s dream to become a prosecutor goes?\n\n“It’s not a question of whether or not it’s going to happen,” he said. “I’m gonna do it.”\n\nMost days this summer, Elyjah has spliced anime videos on TikTok — his favorite anime is “Dragon Ball Z” — or goofed off with his siblings and friends. He tries not to take life too seriously.\n\nBut he spent Thursday night streaming the scene at Lafayette Square to his Instagram page.\n\n“My friends were like, ‘Where in the world is this?’” he said.\n\nAfter his mom and a few other protesters walked toward the South Lawn entrance of the White House, attendees from the Republican National Convention were seen leaving. Protesters with #BlackLivesMatter jeered at the maskless crowd.\n\n“It feels like we're on a reality TV show,” Elyjah said to his mom as fireworks lit up the sky behind them, marking the end of the convention and President Donald Trump’s acceptance to become the Republican Party’s 2020 presidential nominee.\n\nWhat's equality? 'We're all just one herd' in the 'animal kingdom'\n\nOn Friday, as Heather stood on the steps on the Lincoln Memorial to watch Sharpton speak, she called her grandmother and put her on speakerphone.\n\n“You know she was here 57 years ago, when Dr. King made his speech,” Heather explained. But when she called her grandmother, who is now 88 years-old, she told Heather to hang up and videotape it for her.\n\nShe said her grandparents believe that this moment in time is more dangerous than the civil rights movement during the 1960s. They are worried — along with the rest of her extended family — about Heather’s decision to join the protest movement.\n\nBut they still support her.\n\nThe unity during Friday’s speeches and march reminded Heather of her favorite MLK Jr. quote: “It’s always the right time to do the right thing.”\n\n“It would’ve been easy to stay home,” she said. “But this was the gas I needed for me to come back to Columbus and protest.”\n\nAt dinner, later on Friday, Elyjah was fighting exhaustion.\n\n“I’m tired, I wanna go back to the hotel,” he announced to the table.\n\nHis mom shook her head, then asked him what he really thought about the day.\n\nElyjah paused for a moment.\n\n“I think we’re gonna get true equality,” he said. “You know, it’s like if we’re in the animal kingdom. We’re all just one herd, using each other to survive. There ain’t no ‘You’re better than me’ or ‘I’m better than you.’ That’s what equality means.”\n\nA couple of hours later, back at the hotel, Elyjah was still thinking about Martin Luther King III’s speech. He said, at times, he felt humiliated listening to MLK Jr.’s son, still fighting for the same injustices his father died for.\n\n“It just makes you think: What in the world did we do to deserve this treatment?” he said.\n\nHeather gazed down at her son, who had resumed watching YouTube videos on his phone.\n\nShe was thinking about her run-in with Jacob Blake’s father, who attended the march despite the fact his son was shot in the back seven times by a police officer in Kenosha just a few days before.\n\nHeather had asked for a picture with Jacob Blake Sr. and was over the moon that he agreed.\n\n“That man coming here while his son lies in the hospital paralyzed makes me think,” she said, thinking of her own children. “How do you keep pushing when your reason to live is no longer there?”\n\ncdoyle@dispatch.com\n\n@cadoyle_18", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/business/germany-china-olaf-scholz-visit-trade/index.html", "title": "Germany's leader and top CEOs are visiting Beijing. They need ...", "text": "Hong Kong/London CNN Business —\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in China on Friday with a team of top executives, sending a clear message: business with the world’s second-largest economy must continue.\n\nScholz met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People after landing in the capital Friday morning and was received by Premier Li Keqiang in the afternoon.\n\nJoining Scholz for the whirlwind one-day visit is a delegation of 12 German industry titans, including the CEOs of Volkswagen (VLKAF), Deutsche Bank (DB), Siemens (SIEGY) and chemicals giant BASF (BASFY), according to a person familiar with the matter. They were expected to meet with Chinese companies behind closed doors.\n\nThe group entered China without undergoing a mandatory seven-day hotel quarantine standard for most arrivals. Images showed hazmat-clad medical workers greeting Scholz’s jet at Beijing’s Capital International Airport to test the official delegation for Covid-19 upon their arrival.\n\nDuring the Friday morning meeting between the two leaders, Xi called for Germany and China to work together amid a “complex and volatile” international situation, and said the visit would “enhance mutual understanding and trust, deepen pragmatic cooperation in various fields and plan for the next phase of Sino-German relations,” according to a readout from state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference with Premier Li, Scholz said that Germany’s economic relationship with China had recently become “more difficult” because Beijing was making access to some of its markets more difficult.\n\n“We are seeing discussions in China tending more towards autonomy and less economic ties. And these views are ones that need discussing,” Scholz said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrives at Beijing Capital International Airport on November 4, 2022. Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nScholz’s visit — the first by a G7 leader to China in roughly three years — comes as Germany slides towards recession. But it has fired up concerns that the interests of Europe’s biggest economy are still too closely tied to those of Beijing.\n\nSince Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine this year, Germany has been forced to ditch its long dependence on Russian energy. Beijing has declared its friendship with Moscow has “no limits,” while China’s relations with the United States are deteriorating.\n\nNow, some in Scholz’s coalition government are growing nervous about Germany’s ties with China.\n\nThe tension was highlighted recently by a fierce debate over a bid by Chinese state shipping giant Cosco to buy a 35% stake in the operator of one of the four terminals at the port of Hamburg. Under pressure from some members of the government, the size of the investment was limited to 24.9%.\n\nThe potential deal has raised concerns in Germany that closer ties with China will leave critical infrastructure exposed to political pressure from Beijing, and disproportionately benefit Chinese companies.\n\nBut Germany is hardly in a position to rock the boat with Beijing as it grapples with the challenge of reviving its struggling economy. Its consumers and companies have borne the brunt of Europe’s energy crisis, and a deep recession is looming.\n\nIf the European Union and Germany were to decouple from China, it would lead to “large GDP losses” for the German economy, Lisandra Flach, director of the ifo Center for International Economics, told CNN Business.\n\nThe Kiel Institute for the World Economy estimates that a major reduction in trade between the European Union and China would shave 1% off of Germany’s GDP.\n\nGermany needs to shore up its export markets as ties with Russia, once its main supplier of natural gas, continue to unravel.\n\nWhen it comes to China, Germany won’t want to “lose also this market, this economic partner,” said Rafal Ulatowski, an assistant professor of political science and international studies at the University of Warsaw.\n\n“They [will] try to keep these relations as long as it’s possible.”\n\nPressure on Berlin\n\nAs Western countries have imposed swingeing economic sanctions on Russia, China has publicly maintained its “neutrality” in the war while ramping up its trade with Moscow.\n\nThat has triggered a backlash in Europe, where some companies are already becoming wary of doing business in China because of its stringent “zero Covid” restrictions.\n\nPressure on Berlin is also mounting over China’s human rights record. In an open letter Wednesday, a coalition of 70 civil rights groups urged Scholz to “rethink” his trip to Beijing.\n\n“The invitation of a German trade delegation to join your visit will be viewed as an indication that Germany is ready to deepen trade and economic links, at the cost of human rights and international law,” they wrote in the memo, published by the World Uyghur Congress. Based in Germany, the organization is run by Uyghurs raising awareness of allegations of genocide in China’s Xinjiang region.\n\nIt suggested Berlin was “loosening economic dependence on one authoritarian power, only to deepen economic dependence on another.”\n\nIn an op-ed published in a German newspaper on Wednesday, Scholz said he would use his visit to “address difficult issues,” including “respect for civil and political liberties and the rights of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province.”\n\nA spokesperson for the German government addressed wider criticism last week, saying at a press conference that it had no intention of “decoupling” from its most important trading partner.\n\n“[The chancellor] has basically said again and again that he is not a friend of decoupling, or turning away, from China. But he also says: diversify and minimize risk,” the spokesperson said.\n\nLast year, China was Germany’s biggest trading partner for the sixth year in a row, with the value of trade up over 15% from 2020, according to official statistics Chinese trade with Germany was worth a combined €245 billion ($242 billion) in 2021.\n\nA new flashpoint\n\nStill, the furor surrounding the Hamburg port deal is a reminder of the tradeoffs Germany has to confront if it wants to maintain close ties with such a vital export market and supplier.\n\nA spokesperson for Hamburger Hafen und Logistik (HHLA), the company operating the port terminal, told CNN Business on Thursday that it was still negotiating the deal with Cosco.\n\nFlach, of the ifo Center for International Economics, said the deal warranted scrutiny because “there is no reciprocity: Germany cannot invest in Chinese ports, for instance.”\n\nA container ship from Cosco Shipping moored at the Tollerort Container Terminal owned by HHLA, in the harbor of Hamburg, Germany on Oct. 26. Axel Heimken/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, it is easy to overstate the impact of the potential agreement, said Alexander-Nikolai Sandkamp, assistant professor of economics at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\n“We’re not talking about a 25% stake in the Hamburg harbor, or even the operator of the harbor, but a 25% stake in the operator of a terminal,” he told CNN Business.\n\nJürgen Matthes, head of global and regional markets at the German Economic Institute, told CNN Business that critics were no longer simply weighing the business benefits of Chinese investment in the country.\n\n“Politics and economics have to be looked at together and cannot be taken separately any longer,” he said. “When geopolitics comes into play, the view of China has very much declined and become much more negative.”\n\nChina’s recent treatment of Lithuania has also deepened concerns that Beijing “does not hesitate to simply break trade rules,” Matthes added. The small, Eastern European nation claimed last year that Beijing had erected trade barriers in retaliation for its support for Taiwan.\n\nChina has defended its downgrading of relations with Lithuania, saying it is acting in response to the European nation undermining its “sovereignty and territorial integrity.” This year, after a Lithuanian official visited Taiwan, Beijing also announced sanctions against her and vowed to “suspend all forms of exchange” with her ministry.\n\nWhat’s on the table\n\nAs the German delegation touched down on Friday, they were faced with another issue, which has become the single biggest headache for companies across China.\n\n“The biggest challenge for German businesses remains China’s zero-Covid policy,” said Maximilian Butek of the German Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\n“The restrictions are suffocating economic growth and heavily impact China’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment,” he told CNN Business.\n\nAn aerial view of the urban landscape in Shanghai on Sept. 25. The city underwent a months-long Covid lockdown earlier this year. CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nHe said the broader restrictions were so stifling that some companies had moved their regional headquarters to other locations, such as Singapore. “Managing the whole region without being able to travel freely is almost impossible,” he added.\n\nIn a brief statement, Volkswagen told CNN Business that its CEO was attending the trip since “there have been no direct meetings for almost three years” due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n“In view of the completely changed geopolitical and global economic situation, the trip to Beijing offers the opportunity for a personal exchange of views,” the automaker said.\n\nEnd of a golden era?\n\nDespite Beijing’s Covid curbs and geopolitical tensions, Germany has every economic incentive to stay close to China.\n\nIts dependency on China can be seen across industries. While about 12% of total imports came from China last year, the country was responsible for 80% of imported laptops and 70% of mobile phones, Sandkamp said.\n\nThe automobile, chemical and electrical industries are also reliant on Chinese trade.\n\n“If we were to stop trading with China, we would run into trouble,” Sandkamp added.\n\nChina made up 40% of Volkswagen’s worldwide deliveries in the first three quarters of this year, and it’s also the top market for other automakers such as Mercedes.\n\nWariness among some German officials over the country’s closeness with China could filter into a more restrictive trade policy, though economic cooperation is still in both parties’ interests.\n\nIn September, Germany’s economy minister Robert Habeck told Reuters that the government was working on a new trade policy with China to reduce dependence on Chinese raw materials, batteries and semiconductors.\n\nUnidentified sources also told the news agency that the ministry was weighing new rules that would make business with China less attractive. The ministry did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nBut “despite all odds and challenges, China remains unrivaled in terms of market size and market growth opportunities for many German companies,” said Butek, of the German Chamber.\n\nHe predicted that “the large majority will stay committed to the Chinese market and is expecting to expand their business.”\n\nCompanies appear to be toeing that line. Last week, BASF CEO Martin Brudermüller was quoted in Chinese state media as saying that Germans should “step away from China-bashing and look at ourselves a bit self-critically.”\n\n“We benefit from China’s policies of widening market access,” he said at a company event, according to state-run news agency Xinhua, pointing to the construction of a BASF chemical engineering site in southern China.\n\n— CNN’s Simone McCarthy, Chris Stern, Lauren Kent, Nadine Schmidt, Claudia Otto and Arnaud Siad contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh Anna Cooban", "Michelle Toh", "Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/business/tesla-bot-robot/index.html", "title": "Tesla robot slowly walks on stage at AI Day | CNN Business", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nTesla revealed on Friday a prototype of a humanoid robot that it says could be a future product for the automaker.\n\nThe robot, dubbed Optimus by Tesla, walked stiffly on stage at Tesla’s AI Day, slowly waved at the crowed and gestured with its hands for roughly one minute. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the robot was operating without a tether for the first time. Robotics developers often use tethers to support robots because they aren’t capable enough to walk without falling and damaging themselves.\n\nThe Optimus’ abilities appear to significantly trail what robots from competitors like Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics are capable of. Boston Dynamics robots have been seen doing back flips and performing sophisticated dance routines without a tether.\n\nTesla plans to use its AI expertise to develop a humanoid robot. Tesla\n\n“The robot can actually do a lot more than we just showed you,” Musk said at the event. “We just didn’t want it to fall on its face.”\n\nTesla also showed videos of its robot performing simple tasks like carrying boxes and watering plants with a watering can.\n\nMusk claimed that if the robot was produced in mass volumes it would “probably” cost less than $20,000. Tesla maintains that Optimus’ advantage over competitors will be its ability to navigate independently using technology developed from Tesla’s driver-assistance system “Full Self Driving,” as well as cost savings from what it has learned about manufacturing from its automotive division. (Tesla’s “Full Self Driving” requires a human that is alert and attentive, ready to take over at any time, as it is not yet capable of fully driving itself.)\n\nTesla has a history of aggressive price targets that it doesn’t ultimately reach. The Tesla Model 3 was long promised as a $35,000 vehicle, but could only very briefly be purchased for that price, and not directly on its website. The most affordable Tesla Model 3 now costs $46,990. When Tesla revealed the Cybertruck in 2019, its pick-up truck that remains unavailable for purchase today, it was said to cost $39,990, but the price has since been removed from Tesla’s website.\n\nTesla AI Day is intended largely as a recruiting event to attract talented people to join the company.\n\nMusk claimed the robot could be transformative for civilization. The robot displayed Friday, despite its limitations compared to competitors, was significantly ahead of what Tesla revealed a year ago, when a person jumped on stage in a robot suit and danced around.\n\n“‘Last year was just a person in a robot suit,” Musk said before the robot walked on stage. “We’ve come a long way. Compared to that, it’s going to be very impressive.”\n\nTesla is not the first automaker to develop a humanoid robot. Along with Hyundai’s Boston Dynamics, Honda worked on robots dubbed “Asimo” for nearly 20 years. In its final form, Asimo was a child-size humanoid robot capable of untethered walking, running, climbing and descending stairs, and manipulating objects with its fingers.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}]}

The offer is based off of language in Piedmont’s pilot contract, negotiated in 2021 with the largest pilot union in the world, the Airline Pilots Association, that allows for the company to offer a “safe haven for employment” for pilots at “distressed” carriers, according to the company.\n\nThe offer isn’t just coming from Piedmont Airlines, either. American Airlines subsidiary Envoy Air “has the same provisions and we are offering ExpressJet/Aha pilots conditional job offers with no interview,” according to Ric Wilson, Vice President of Flight Operations from Envoy Air.\n\nAtlanta-based ExpressJet operated over 450 aircraft at its peak, but pandemic-induced woes proved a fatal blow for the regional carrier. The airline, which calls itself a “reboot” of the company formerly flying as Delta Connection and United Express, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Monday in Delaware and ceased operations, according to the company website. It pointed to stifled growth, rising costs and lower revenue due to the pandemic.\n\n“No one wants to see an airline fail, ever. We know that ExpressJet pilots are well-trained aviators who know the Embraer 145 [aircraft], and we are very pleased to make this transition as easy as possible for them,” said Matt Kernan, Piedmont’s Director of Operations, in a press release Thursday. “This is an opportunity to get these pilots significant pay and bonus increases, expedited job offers and in the process, help Piedmont grow its fleet.”\n\nThe effort to snap up experienced pilots from the downtrodden company comes as Piedmont looks to expand its business and compete in an aviation sector with a thirst for pilots. Despite efforts by airlines to hire more pilots, the US pilot shortage is still forecast to get worse. And that will especially be true for the regional airlines like Piedmont serving smaller cities on behalf of the major carriers, like American Airlines. It is mainly those pilots who are being hired away to fly the larger jets.\n\nBased on data from consulting firm Oliver Wyman’s fleet forecast and models for industry growth, there is expected to be shortage of almost 30,000 pilots in North America by 2032 if the industry fails to address its staffing problems. That’s almost four times higher than this year’s anticipated gap of 8,000 pilots, which has already proven to be problematic.\n\nThis shortage is hitting regional airlines like Piedmont especially hard. According to the Regional Airline Association (RAA), two dozen markets served by regional airports have lost half of their service in the last three years — and that doesn’t include the rounds of cuts planned for later this year. Another 42 markets have lost between one third and half of service in that time frame.\n\nBehind the pilot shortage is a confluence of trends, including the retirement of aging Baby Boomers and significantly fewer job candidates coming from the military, as the use of unmanned drones steadily increased and there were fewer deployments. Covid-19 exacerbated the shortfall, with airlines offering pilots early retirement at the height of the pandemic. When travel demand surged in 2021, the pilot shortfall was so dramatic that it hampered the airlines’ ability to ramp back up, leading to flight delays and cancellations.\n\n“Communities were losing air service for the better part of the last decade,” said Faye Malarkey Black, CEO of the RAA. “You don’t have to lose all your service to lose connectivity to the system. When you lose much of your frequency, businesses won’t want to locate in a place.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/tech/american-airlines-boom-supersonic-jets/index.html", "title": "American Airlines agrees to purchase 20 Boom Supersonic jets ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nAmerican Airlines is placing a bet on a future in which supersonic jets might return to the skies, shuttling passengers on some routes at speeds roughly twice as fast as current commercial aircraft.\n\nExactly how big that bet is, however, remains unclear. American, which said it put down a deposit for up to 20 supersonic jets with the option to buy up to 20 more, declined to share the financial terms of the deal, which was announced Tuesday.\n\nIt all depends, however, on if the company slated to build the jets, Boom Supersonic, can make good on its lofty promises. Experts have questioned whether supersonic jets are likely to make a return.\n\nBoom is developing a jet called the Overture that the company says will be able to carry 65 to 80 passengers at nearly twice the speed of sound.\n\nBut the jet is still in the early stages of development. Boom recently unveiled a “refined’ version of the aircraft, which it said has completed some wind tunnel tests. It has yet to conduct a test flight, however, and the first production vehicles aren’t expected to roll off the line until 2025, according to a press release.\n\nThe Overture is reminiscent of the Concorde, the ultra-quick — and exceedingly pricey — jet that shuttled people across the Atlantic Ocean for as much as $10,000 a seat. The Concorde, notably, was taken out of service in 2003 because the economics simply didn’t work. The fuel-guzzling jet was too noisy to fly over land because its high speeds would generate deafening sonic booms, relegating it to trips across the ocean, like its popular London to New York City route.\n\nExperts have said jets like the Concorde aren’t likely to make a return, in part because these jets would need to find enough customers willing to fork over the premium price point. But that hasn’t stopped Boom, American, and United Airlines — which announced plans to buy up to 15 of Boom’s jets last year — from putting cash and marketing power behind plans to revive supersonic air travel.\n\nBoom says its jets could enter service by 2029, and, though they won’t be able to hit top speeds over land, they could still travel as much as 20% faster than current commercial jets, the company claims.\n\n“Flying from Miami to London in just under five hours and Los Angeles to Honolulu in three hours are among the many possibilities,” Boom claims.\n\nBut foreign regulators and the US Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates commercial airlines, will have to approve the jets first. And it’s not clear when or if that will happen.\n\nAfter the economic failure of the Concorde, both airlines and aircraft makers have generally concentrated on greater efficiency, not speed.\n\nBoeing, for example, ditched its plans for a near-supersonic jet, the Sonic Cruiser, in the early 2000s and shifted its focus to developing a lightweight, fuel-efficient jumbo jet, the 787 Dreamliner. (The 787, of course, has its own issues.)\n\nThe US government, however, has shown interest in reviving supersonic jets. The FAA states on its website that it’s currently working to establish new rules of the road for such aircraft, including allowable noise levels over land. And NASA has put money into developing a “quiet” supersonic jet, called the X-59, in the hopes of passing that tech on to the commercial sector. But even the first prototype has yet to take flight, with the first test not expected until later this year.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/business/frontier-airlines-customer-service-call-center/index.html", "title": "Frontier Airlines no longer has a customer service phone line | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nCustomers who need flight information or want to make changes to travel plans can no longer call Frontier Airlines and speak to an agent, the company confirmed to CNN Saturday.\n\nStarting last week, the ultra low-cost airline said it has transitioned to fully digital communications. Customers seeking help or information from the carrier must deal with an online chatbot, social media channels or WhatsApp. Those who need to speak to a live agent can use the carrier’s 24/7 chat tool.\n\n“We have found that most customers prefer communicating via digital channels,” spokesperson Jennifer F. de la Cruz said in a statement, saying they can now receive information as “expeditiously and efficiently as possible.”\n\nFrontier is known for its cost-cutting measures, such as charging for advance seat assignments and for carry-on bags that exceed the carrier’s size rules.

We want our customers to be able to operate efficiently as well, which is why we make it easy to find what you need at Flyfrontier.com or on our mobile app. We also have a chat service available 24/7.”\n\nIts low-cost flight competitors, Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Airlines, still use call centers staffed by live agents.\n\nIt’s no wonder Frontier wants to get rid of customer service over the phone. The Department of Transportation in November said it is issuing $7.25 million in fines against six airlines for the “extreme delays” in providing refunds since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic to passengers. The only US carrier was Frontier, which was fined $2.2 million by the agency.\n\nFrontier recently launched an unlimited annual flight pass currently for $799 – though it comes with caveats, such as blackout periods concentrated around the holidays.

But Holland-Kaye said Heathrow’s latest forecast showed an excess number of seats had already been sold and therefore airlines needed to stop selling tickets now.\n\n“Even despite the amnesty, daily departing seats over the summer will average 104,000 – giving a daily excess of 4,000 seats.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn my line of work – and probably yours, too – I cannot collect payment for a service, refuse to perform it, refuse to issue a refund and expect to remain legally and reputationally in the clear. If I did that, and especially if I did it over and over again, I would expect to be sued, shunned and eventually out of a job.\n\nJill Filipovic Courtesy Jill Filipovic\n\nBut I’m not an airline.\n\nThis week, the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced that six airlines have been forced to issue $600 million in refunds. The DOT is also fining the airlines $7.25 million for flights that were canceled during Covid and not refunded. Those facing fines include Frontier, Air India, TAP Portugal, Aeromexico, El Al and Avianca.\n\nIt’s about time this industry saw some consequences. The airline industry posted record profits this past summer, while also canceling and delaying a huge number of flights. When an industry is failing at doing its one job properly and yet is still making money hand over fist, there’s a big problem – and it’s one being borne by consumers.\n\nI’m one of them. I was booked on a TAP Portugal flight to Lisbon in the spring of 2020, which obviously didn’t happen because of Covid. That’s understandable – I didn’t expect to board a flight during a global pandemic. But given that the flight didn’t fly, I did expect my money back. For more than a year and a half, I didn’t get it, despite messages and calls to both TAP and Expedia. Eventually, in December 2021, I received a partial refund, though still far below the full cost of the ticket.\n\nA similar thing happened last Christmas: I flew to Kenya for the holidays on a ticket booked with Chase credit card points, and on Dec. 23, I received an email that Emirates had canceled my return flights – and had, as it turned out, also canceled all of its flights out of Nairobi, stranding my husband and me. We had to book a last-minute one-way flight home on a different airline, during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.\n\nAfter weeks of back and forth with Emirates and Chase, and in that particular purgatory one is thrust into when trying to recoup one’s losses from two major companies, neither of which wants to take financial responsibility, we were never reimbursed by either – although I do have an expired Emirates credit sitting in my Chase account, a now-invalid offer to fly an airline I hope to never set foot on.\n\nVirtually no other industry is permitted to operate this way. And it is mind-boggling that airlines can sell you a ticket to get from Point A to Point B, not fly the plane from Point A to Point B and then keep your money – or issue you a credit they know you’re unlikely to use, so you can do the same thing all over again.\n\nCovid has, of course, complicated things. Some cancellations are due to lack of staffing. But it’s hard to feel sorry for an industry that accepted massive government bailouts, culled its staff anyway and then says it simply doesn’t have the personnel to operate the flights it scheduled with the full knowledge of its own limitations – especially when that industry has been charging more and raking in record revenue.\n\nGet our weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAccording to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the DOT will be “ratcheting up the penalty side” until airlines change their behavior. And this is frankly the least they can do. Over and over, airlines exploit the fact that their customer base is a captive one, often desperate to get to where they were going and with little alternative. And so passengers muddle through all kinds of insults and indignities, from major ones like cancelations to more mundane and minor offenses, like seats far too small for the average human and being nickel-and-dimed for expecting to carry on a bag.\n\nAt the very least, if airlines do not provide the service they sold – flying an airplane on the day and time scheduled – they should pay up. If they delay flights significantly, they should pay up, or provide passengers with a place to stay and something to eat – without making them stand in hours-long lines to collect measly, limited little vouchers. They should issue reimbursements automatically and swiftly, without requiring passengers to spend hours hounding them for refunds. And if they don’t, they should expect to see exactly what’s happening now, thanks to the Buttigieg DOT: paying far more than if they had just done the right thing in the first place.", "authors": ["Jill Filipovic"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/politics/boeing-air-force-one-delivery-delay/index.html", "title": "Delivery of new Air Force One planes has been delayed again ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nBoeing’s delivery of two new Air Force One planes has been delayed again, the Air Force announced Tuesday, with the completion of the first of the new presidential planes not expected for at least another four years.\n\n“The new objective delivery date to the Presidential Airlift Group for the first aircraft is September 2026 and the second aircraft is February 2027, a 24-month delay from the original contractual dates; and the new threshold dates are September 2027 for the first aircraft and February 2028 for the second, a 36-month delay,” the Air Force said in a statement.\n\nBoeing struck the deal to make the two new planes in 2018 with then-President Donald Trump.

He said the 2018 deal with the Air Force included “a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn’t have taken.”\n\nThe former President, with his deal-making persona, took an unusually hands-on approach to the Air Force One deal.

A bipartisan group of negotiators set to work in the Senate and unveiled legislative text on Tuesday. The bill – titled the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act – was released by Republican Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe House on Friday passed the bill by 234-193, including 14 Republicans voting with Democrats.

Old statutes didn’t include intimate partners who may not live together, be married or share children.\n\nNow the law will bar from having a gun anyone who is convicted of a domestic violence crime against someone they have a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law isn’t retroactive. It will, however, allow those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nThe bill encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System with grants as well as implements a new protocol for checking those records.\n\nThe bill goes after individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income but have previously evaded registering as federally licensed firearms dealers. It also increases funding for mental health programs and school security.\n\nJust before signing the bill, Biden praised the families of gun violence victims with whom he had met.

Many states – including California, Delaware and New York – have also passed new laws to help curb gun violence, such as regulating untraceable ghost guns and strengthening background check systems.\n\nThe year 2022 is the second-highest year of mass shootings in the United States on record, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit tracking gun violence incidents across the country.\n\nThere have been at least 647 mass shootings through December 31 this year. The country saw 692 mass shootings in 2021, the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014.\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nThere is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings, according to a January study published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit focused on gun violence prevention.\n\nNot everyone agrees increased gun control is the answer. Some Americans advocate for their right to keep and bear arms, enshrined in the Constitution, while others argue gun control measures save lives and do not infringe citizen rights.\n\nAmid the debate, some lawmakers have forged ahead with passing gun control laws.\n\n“States continue to lead on gun safety, passing new and innovative policies that we will work to replicate across the country while continuing to secure significant investments in community violence intervention programs,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, which killed 20 children and six educators.\n\n“This progress and our electoral victories in November shows that the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than ever and sets the stage for continued progress in the new year,” Watts continued.\n\nHere is a summary of the state and federal laws approved in 2022:\n\nFederal legislation\n\nOn June 25, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act after the House and the Senate approved the measure. The package represents the most significant federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he signed the bill.\n\nThe package includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs, which can be used to manage red flag programs, as well as for other crisis intervention programs such as mental health, drug and veteran courts.\n\nRed flag laws, approved by the federal measure, are also known as Extreme Risk Protection Order laws. They allow courts to temporarily seize firearms from anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe legislation encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which would provide a more comprehensive background check for people between 18 and 21 who want to buy guns.\n\nIt also requires more individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income to register as Federally Licensed Firearm Dealers, which are required to administer background checks before they sell a gun to someone.\n\nThe law bars guns from anyone convicted of a domestic violence crime who has a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law, however, allows those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia was ranked the top state in the nation for gun safety in 2021. It has the strongest system in the nation for removing firearms from people who become prohibited from having them, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in July signed a package of five bills on gun safety after they were passed by the California State Senate.\n\nOn July 1, Newsom signed AB 2571, which prohibits the gun industry from marketing firearm-related products to minors, as well as AB 1621, which further restricts ghost guns, including the parts used to build them.\n\nOn July 12, the governor signed AB 1594, legislation establishing a firearm industry standard of conduct to promote “safe and responsible firearm industry member practices,” the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is AB 2156, signed on July 21, which cracks down on the manufacture of firearms by prohibiting any person, regardless of federal licensure, from manufacturing firearms without a state license. It also prohibits unlicensed individuals from using 3D printing to manufacture any firearm or precursor part.\n\nThe last bill, signed on July 22, is SB 1327. It allows private citizens to bring civil action against anyone who manufactures, distributes, transports or imports assault weapons or ghost guns, which are banned in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis signed House Bill 22-1086, or The Vote Without Fear Act, on March 30.\n\nThe law prohibits a person from openly carrying a firearm within any polling location or central count facility.\n\nIt also bans individuals from open carrying within “100 feet of a ballot drop box or any building in which a polling location or central count facility is located,” while election activity is in progress, according to the legislation. Violations are punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine, up to 364 days imprisonment in the county jail, or both.\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney on June 30 signed a package of gun safety bills including legislation to prohibit assault weapons, regulate high-capacity magazines and strengthen background checks.\n\nThe Delaware Lethal Firearms Safety Act of 2022 prohibits the manufacture, sale, offer to sell, transfer, purchase, receipt, possession or transport of assault weapons in Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, according to HB 450.\n\nThe package also includes legislation to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase or possess a firearm from 18 to 21, ban the use of devices which convert handguns into fully automatic weapons and hold gun manufacturers and dealers “liable for reckless or negligent actions that lead to gun violence,” the bill states.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed two bills to address secure storage of firearms and regulating ghost guns.\n\nOn May 18, the governor signed HB 4383, which prohibits individuals from selling or possessing ghost guns and ensures all firearms are serialized, allowing law enforcement to better trace them.\n\nPritzker later signed HB4729 on June 10, which requires the Department of Public Health to develop and implement a two-year public awareness campaign focused on safe gun storage, which includes sharing information about safe gun storage, the bill says.\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced on April 8 he would allow Senate Bill 387, which bans the sale or possession of ghost guns, to become law without his signature, noting it doesn’t go far enough in taking “decisive action to hold violent criminals accountable.”\n\nThe bill, which took effect on June 1 after bipartisan support, expands the definition of “firearm” to include an unfinished frame or receiver. It requires the Secretary of State Police to maintain a system to register firearms imprinted with serial numbers and “prohibits a person from purchasing, receiving, selling, offering to sell, or transferring an ‘unfinished frame or receiver’ or a firearm unless imprinted with specified information,” the bill states.\n\nThe law also requires the governor to allocate $150,000 in the annual state budget to fund registration proceedings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on July 5 signed seven gun safety bills, six of which were part of his Gun Safety 3.0 package he introduced to the state legislature in April 2021.\n\nThe package includes legislation which would allow the state’s attorney general to sue members of the firearm industry for violations stemming from the sale or marketing of firearms, the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is legislation to regulate the sale of handgun ammunition, developing a system of electronic reporting of these sales; and require training prior to the issuance of a gun purchaser identification card with a validity date of 10 years.\n\nAnother bill in the package mandates firearm owners who become state residents to obtain a Firearm Purchaser Identification Card and register out-of-state acquired handguns, according to the bill.\n\nOn December 22, Murphy signed another gun safety bill strengthening the state’s firearm licensing laws and established a list of ‘sensitive places’ where concealed carry is prohibited, including playgrounds, bars and restaurants serving alcohol, train stations, and polling places.\n\nNew York\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed a package of bills and an additional piece of legislation to address a wide range of gun safety issues.\n\nHochul signed a gun safety package on June 6, which includes bills requiring microstamping on handguns, strengthen the state’s extreme risk and firearm purchase permit law, raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21 and enhance information sharing between state, local and federal agencies when guns are used in crimes.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision on June 23 to strike down a New York gun law enacted more than a century ago which places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside the home, Hochul signed legislation to strengthen the state’s gun laws and bolster restrictions on concealed carry weapons.\n\nThe law, which takes effect on September 1, will expand eligibility requirements in the concealed carry permitting process, restrict the carrying of concealed weapons in sensitive locations and establish state oversight over background checks for guns and regular checks on license holders for criminal convictions, according to the legislation.\n\nOregon\n\nIn the November 2022 US midterm elections, Oregon voters enacted a gun safety ballot measure, Measure 114, which strengthens background checks and prohibits the sale and transfer of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nThe measure also closes the “Charleston Loophole,” which allows gun purchases to move forward by default after three days even if a background check has not been completed. It requires state police to complete background checks on individuals before a gun sale or transfer is made.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee signed three gun safety bills on June 21. They prohibit high-capacity magazines, ban the open carry of rifles and shotguns in public and raise the legal age to purchase firearms or ammunition from 18 to 21, with exceptions for law enforcement officers.\n\nOne of the bills also changes the definition of “rifle” and “shotgun” consistent with federal law.\n\nVermont\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott signed into law a package on March 25 banning firearms from hospital buildings and prohibits the transfer of firearms between unlicensed people.\n\nThe governor vetoed a similar bill, S.30, in February which would have closed the “Charleston Loophole.”\n\nThe new law, S.4, addresses the policy by extending the time period to seven days for the federal government to complete a background check before an individual can purchase a firearm. It also strengthens protections for victims of domestic violence, according to the bill.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee signed three gun safety bills into law on March 23.\n\nHB 1705 prohibits the manufacture, sale, purchase or possession of ghost guns, while HB 1630 prohibits the open carry of firearms at local government meetings and restricts them at school board meetings and election-related locations.\n\nThe third bill, SB 5078, prohibits high-capacity magazines, defined as an “ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 17 rounds of ammunition,” the bill states.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/04/22/iowa-legislature-adjourns-what-bills-passed-2017-session/98798986/", "title": "Iowa Legislature adjourns: What bills passed in 2017 session?", "text": "William Petroski, and Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nDes Moines Register\n\nRepublicans promised major policy changes after victories in Iowa House and Senate elections in November, and they delivered by approving a sweeping conservative agenda in the Legislature's 2017 session.\n\nThis year's session ended Saturday with the House adjourning at 7:14 a.m. and the Senate wrapping up at 7:16 a.m. The session, which began Jan. 9, lasted 104 days.\n\nKey lawmakers worked throughout Friday night and into Saturday morning to negotiate on bills and draft the details of final legislation. This included a compromise approved Saturday by the Legislature that will expand a state law allowing ailing Iowans to use a marijuana-derived oil known as cannabis oil. But a late, intensive lobbying campaign failed in a bid to win House approval of a Senate-passed bill that would have increased state funding for water quality projects by $27 million annually.\n\nThe legislation for medical cannabis oil, which is now available to Iowans with severe epilepsy, broadens the availability of the drug to patients with cancer, multiple sclerosis and other conditions. It will also allow the drug to be manufactured and sold in Iowa, and a medical advisory board will be able to recommend changes to the Iowa Board of Medicine.\n\nThe Legislature also approved the session's final spending bill of a $7.24 billion general fund budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 that will see cuts in many state programs because of a revenue shortfall. The budget bill includes a provision repealing a requirement in state law that public art be included in the construction costs for new state buildings.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“I think it has been a historic session,\" said Iowa Senate President Jack Whitver, R-Ankeny. \"We came in with a bold agenda. We came in with a plan to help grow the state of Iowa and create jobs, and we passed a lot of legislation this year in that area. But we have also done a lot of things for freedom in Iowa — Second Amendment rights, approving fireworks, and we have also done a lot of things to revitalize rural Iowa.\"\n\nSen. Joe Bolkcom, D-Iowa City, said it was the worst session in his 19 years in the Iowa Legislature.\n\n\"Republicans now in the majority campaigned on creating jobs, raising incomes, and most of the policy work that we saw in this session involving taking away from workers, making it harder for workers to make ends meet, making it harder for them to take care of their families,\" Bolkcom said. \"The largest problem that we hear from Iowa businesses is that we need trained, skilled workers, and we didn’t do anything to improve that. In fact, we raised college tuition for every Iowa kid trying to get a little more training and education, which is really taking us in the wrong direction.\"\n\nThis year's session marked the first time since 1998 that Republicans had majorities in the Senate and House and held the governor's office at the same time. It gave the the GOP full control over the state budget and other legislation and eliminated the possibility that Democrats could block conservative bills.\n\nAfter convening in January, Republican lawmakers placed a priority on limiting collective bargaining for Iowa's 184,000 public employees. After three days of contentious debate in the Senate, the bill received final approval in mid-February and was signed the next day by Gov. Terry Branstad. GOP lawmakers then approved a series of pro-business bills that nullified minimum-wage increases for workers in five Iowa counties, limited medical malpractice lawsuits; limited nuisance lawsuits against livestock operators; restricted asbestos-related liability lawsuits; and cut workers' compensation benefits.\n\nDespite lobbying by hundreds of pink-clad Planned Parenthood supporters who flooded the Capitol, the GOP majorities agreed to limit most Iowa abortions after 20 weeks and to shift public funding to medical clinics statewide that don't perform abortions. Gun owners were rewarded with pro-firearms legislation that includes a \"stand your ground\" provision that says a law-abiding person does not have a duty to retreat before using deadly force. In addition, retail fireworks will be legal in Iowa this Fourth of July for the first time in decades, assuming Branstad signs the fireworks bill, which appears likely.\n\nBranstad, a Republican who is expected to be confirmed soon as U.S. ambassador to China, said his 23rd legislative session as governor was one of the most productive sessions he's seen in terms of policy measures that will benefit the public, government and businesses.\n\n\"The Legislature has had to make a lot of tough decisions on the budget,\" Branstad said. \"But I think they have worked in a responsible way and not used a meat axe approach of across-the-board cuts that has been done in the past administrations. Instead, they have tried to set priorities for protecting things like school aid and property tax reimbursements.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Linda Upmeyer, R-Clear Lake, who has served in the Legislature since 2003, said the House was helped by a Republican-controlled Senate where legislative leaders could take ideas and build consensus.\n\n\"It’s not been an easy session because of the budget,\" she said. \"Despite that, I think the Legislature’s worked in a diligent and thoughtful way.\"\n\nHere are some of the bills passed in the 2017 session. Many have already been signed by Branstad, while others are still being reviewed by the governor. Most bills take effect on July 1, but some will become effective on other dates.\n\nMEDICAL CANNABIS OIL: This legislation is more narrow than a wide-ranging medical marijuana bill approved this session by the Iowa Senate. But it expands the list of debilitating medical conditions in Iowa eligible for a marijuana extract known as cannabis oil to include cancer, Parkinson's disease, AIDS or HIV, multiple sclerosis, terminal illnesses with severe pain, as well as epileptic seizures and some other ailments. Smoking of the drug is prohibited and only Iowa doctors will be allowed to recommend it. Patients and primary care givers may obtain a card from the Iowa Department of Health that must be renewed annually. House File 524\n\nPUBLIC ART/SUPREME COURT: A budget bill passed just prior to adjournment repeals an Iowa law that requires that at least one-half of 1 percent of the total estimated cost of the construction of a state building include fine arts in the plans and specifications of the building. Democrats criticized the action, saying art in public buildings is a matter of public pride. But Republicans said art is a frivolous expense in tough budget times and they complained state money was being spent on public art at places like highway rest stops and livestock buildings. Lawmakers also decided to require the Iowa Supreme Court to give up space it has controlled in the past under an agreement with the Legislature. This includes the Supreme Court's old chambers on the first floor of the Capitol and an adjacent consultation room that are regularly used by legislative committees, as well as a first-floor office still used by the judicial branch. However, the bill requires the Legislative Council to provide the judicial branch with the use of space in the Capitol for ceremonial purposes. Senate File 516\n\nMEDICAL MALPRACTICE: Lawmakers agreed to limit medical malpractice lawsuits, one of the key priorities of majority Republicans' policy agenda for the 2017 session. The measure includes provisions governing doctor-patient communications after adverse medical incidents; capping limits on noneconomic damages, such as pain and suffering, at $250,000; requiring a \"certificate of merit\" to screen out frivolous litigation; and establishing standards for expert witnesses. However, the $250,000 damages cap will not apply in cases involving permanent impairment, disfigurement or death under an amendment approved by the Iowa House. Senate File 465\n\nDRINKS AT CRAFT DISTILLERIES: Iowa's craft liquor distillers will be allowed to mix cocktails at their manufacturing facilities under a bill that both Democrats and Republicans praised as a good step for economic development. The issue has been under discussion in the Legislature for years as distillers tried and failed to advance legislation they say puts them on a level playing field with Iowa's craft breweries and wineries. House File 607\n\nVOTER ID: Lawmakers approved contentious legislation proposed by Republican Secretary of State Paul Pate that will require voters to show government-issued identification at the polls and will reduce the time period for early voting. The legislation makes changes to Iowa's elections laws that Republicans say are needed to ensure the honesty of the process and prevent fraud. Among them is a provision that would require every voter to present government-issued identification at the poll on Election Day. In addition, the bill shortens the time frame for casting absentee ballots and voting early at satellite polling sites from 40 days to 29 days. Democrats denounced the bill, calling it an effort to suppress voter turnout by minorities, older people and people with disabilities. House File 516\n\n24/7 SOBRIETY: Lawmakers agreed to require drivers arrested or convicted of being impaired while behind the wheel in Iowa to participate in a twice-daily sobriety monitoring program. The legislation envisions a program similar to one in South Dakota and four other states that would require impaired-driving offenders to travel twice a day to a monitoring center for a breathalyzer test. . The proposed legislation would also expand Iowa's homicide-by-vehicle statute to say that a person's use of a hand-held mobile phone or other electronic communications device to write, send or read an electronic text message while driving a motor vehicle that causes a fatality will be considered evidence that they were operating in a reckless manner. The provision also applies to web browsing, use of social media and playing electronic games. Senate File 444\n\nTEXTING WHILE DRIVING: Lawmakers approved a bill allowing police officers to stop drivers they suspect of texting while driving and issue $30 tickets. It's stricter than current law, which allows officers to issue tickets for texting only after drivers have been pulled over for some other offense, such as speeding or running a stop sign. But critics say they expect the law will be difficult to fully enforce. The bill allows drivers to still use cellphones for GPS purposes and to make phone calls. Senate File 234\n\nROLLBACKS FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING: After exhaustive debates that included an all-night Senate floor session, the Republican majority approved a proposal to dramatically scale back a four-decades-old collective bargaining law that governs union contract negotiations for the state’s 184,000 public employees. No Democrats supported the bill. Under the legislation, most public-sector union contract negotiations will be limited to base wages. Unions will be banned from negotiating with their employers over issues such as health insurance, evaluation procedures, staff reduction and leaves of absence for political purposes. However, public safety workers such as police and firefighters will have a broader list of issues to be considered in contract talks. All unions will be barred from having union dues deducted from public employees' paychecks and unions will need to be recertified prior to every contract negotiation. The legislation also changes the arbitration process when contract talks reach an impasse. Currently, the union and management will make their best offers and an independent arbitrator will be required to choose the most reasonable of the two. The legislation requires an arbitrator to consider the employer's ability to finance any wage increase. It also puts a cap on how much an arbitrator can raise wages. The wage increase could not exceed whichever is lower: 3 percent, or a percent equal to the cost of living increase outlined in the consumer price index. House File 291\n\nGUN RIGHTS: Rights of gun owners were expanded with an extensive list of changes in state laws. The legislation specifies that reasonable force, including deadly force, may be used even if an alternative course of action is available, if the alternative action entails a risk to life or safety, or the life or safety of a third party. In addition, the bill allows persons with permits to carry weapons to possess concealed handguns in the Iowa Capitol and strikes possible restrictions on firearms sales during an emergency. The bill also allows children to possess a pistol or revolver while under direct supervision of a parent or guardian who is at least 21 years old. Some other provisions will create a uniform permit to carry weapons and provide for five-year permits to acquire handguns rather than single-year permits. The bill also ensures permit-holder confidentiality, adds penalties for illegal sales and legalizes short-barreled rifles and short-barreled shotguns. House File 517\n\n20-WEEK ABORTION BAN: Most abortions in Iowa will be banned after 20 weeks under a bill supported by majority Republican lawmakers. The measure also establishes a three-day waiting period for women seeking any abortion. An abortion will be allowed after 20 weeks if doctors determine it's necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. But it does not include exemptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, or for pregnancies in which a genetic anomaly makes life after birth impossible. The new three-day waiting period is among the strictest in the nation. Senate File 471\n\nDEFUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD: The legislation, which was included in a budget bill, discontinues the Medicaid Iowa Family Planning Network Waiver, effective July 1, and replaces it with a state family planning services program. The new program will replicate eligibility requirements of the existing network, but funding could not be provided to any entity that performs abortions or maintains a facility where abortions are provided. Planned Parenthood of the Heartland is Iowa's largest abortion provider, although no public money is used for abortions. According to the Iowa Legislative Services Agency, there were 12,219 people participating in the existing family planning program in December 2016. The new program is expected to have about the same annual funding level as the existing program — about $3.3 million. The program is considered to be a form of limited insurance coverage for low-income Iowans. House File 563\n\nBAN ON BATHROOM CAMERAS: Lawmakers agreed to prohibit the use of video cameras in bathrooms and locker rooms in state and local government buildings.The measure prohibits the use of \"monitoring devices,\" meaning a digital video and audio streaming or recording device, in a toilet, bath or shower facility, locker room, diaper changing area, and certain other spaces. The legislation was introduced after the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa asked the Iowa City Public Library to remove security cameras from its bathrooms over privacy concerns raised by a patron. Senate File 499\n\nFIREWORKS: Iowans will be lighting fuses on firecrackers and bottle rockets for this year's Fourth of July celebrations under a hotly debated bill approved by lawmakers. The legislation ends a longstanding ban on retail fireworks sales in Iowa, making consumer fireworks available each year from June 1 through July 8, and again from Dec. 10 through Jan. 3. The legislation prohibits sales to minors, allows local governments to restrict fireworks use and provide fireworks safety education to the public. Senate File 489\n\nELIMINATING KIDS HEALTH CHECKOFF: Republicans agreed to eliminate a requirement that Iowans indicate on their state tax returns the presence or absence of health care coverage for their dependent children. They said the checkoff is no longer necessary on state tax forms because taxpayers are asked a similar question on their federal tax returns because of the federal Affordable Care Act. Democrats roundly criticized the bill, saying the only reason for removing the checkoff box from state tax form is because Republicans don't want Iowa children to receive health insurance to which they are entitled. House File 625\n\nNIXING FAMILY HOUSING RULES: Iowa cities will be prohibited from enforcing regulations related to the occupancy of residential rental property based on family or nonfamily relationships of the occupants. Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill to allow cities which already have housing regulations to continue enforcing them, saying they help regulate density and overcrowding, particularly in college towns. Supporters said the measure will protect private property rights and help reduce discrimination. House File 134\n\nDOMESTIC VIOLENCE: A bill was approved that expands the definition of stalking to include the unauthorized placement of a global positioning device and provides tougher criminal penalties for repeated incidents of domestic violence. The measure also reduces the standard for prosecutors to bring stalking charges. Previously, an individual would have to fear bodily harm or death. Under the legislation, a \"reasonable person\" would, more generally, have to feel terrorized, frightened or threatened, or fear bodily harm or death. In addition, if an offender is convicted of a third or subsequent domestic abuse assault, they are required to serve at least one-fifth of the maximum term, establishing a 20 percent mandatory minimum sentence. House File 263\n\nEQUIPMENT RENTAL THEFT: Lawmakers agreed to specifically include equipment rental property in the definition of theft. This legislation provides that theft occurs when a person obtains the temporary use of equipment rental property with the intent to deprive the owner of the property without consent, or lawfully obtains the temporary use of equipment rental property and fails to return the property by the agreed time with the intent to deprive the owner. Under current law, the penalty for theft ranges from a simple misdemeanor to a Class C felony depending on the value of the property and circumstances of the theft. Senate File 403\n\nRIGHT TO TRY: Iowans facing terminal illness would have access to medicines that have passed Phase I of the Food and Drug Administration’s approval process but are not yet on pharmacy shelves under a bill approved by lawmakers. Sen. Rick Bertrand, R-Sioux City, proposed the legislation in response to a friend's battle with Huntington's disease, which causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain. The bill is aimed at patients who are not eligible or are unable to get into clinical trials of drugs. In addition, an eligible patient's doctor must acknowledge the patient's illness is terminal and recommend the patient for an investigatory drug trial and receive the patient's written, informed consent. Senate File 404\n\nCIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE: Lawmakers agreed to tighten the state's controversial civil asset forfeiture law, which allows law enforcement officers to seize cash and property from people never charged with a crime. The intent is to protect property owners from having to prove their innocence when their property has been seized and is going through the forfeiture process. The measure says civil asset forfeiture for property valued at less than $5,000 will be prohibited unless the criminal charges resulted in a conviction. In addition, the bill increases the standard of proof required for asset forfeiture to \"clear and convincing evidence\" rather than a preponderance of evidence. Senate File 446\n\nSCHOOL AID INCREASE: Legislators approved a 1.1 percent increase in funding to K-12 schools for the 2017-18 academic year. It raises per-pupil state aid by about $40 million. According to the state's nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency, that equals an increase of about $73 for each student across the state. Legislators held a public hearing on the bill that drew concerned Iowans who flooded a meeting room at the Capitol and spilled into an overflow gallery in the rotunda. Nearly all of them called on legislators to increase funding to schools, citing growing pressure on teachers and parents to pay for supplies out of their own pockets and on administrators seeking to balance their budgets by cutting teachers and increasing class sizes. Senate File 166\n\nROAD FUND SWAP: State transportation officials will keep federal road and bridge money normally sent to Iowa's cities and counties and replace it with state dollars under a controversial bill backed by Republican lawmakers. The goal is to help local governments avoid federal paperwork and other requirements that drive up costs by an estimated 15 percent on city and county projects. Democrats contend the legislation will result in workers on some local road projects being paid lower wages by avoiding federal rules. They also said cities and counties won't be required to purchase American-made steel when building bridges and other structures. Republicans insisted that federal rules attached to the federal money will still have to be followed by the Iowa DOT as the money is spent on state highway projects. House File 203\n\nRED LIGHT TURNS: Iowa's law governing turns against red lights will be expanded. Under current state law, traffic is allowed to make a right turn from the right lane of traffic against a red light, or from the left lane on a one-way street to the left-most lane of traffic on another one-way street. The bill changes the law to allow a right turn from another lane designated for right turns, or a left turn from another lane designated for left turns on another one-way street. The bill also strikes a requirement that traffic turning left against a red light on a one-way street must turn into the leftmost lane of the other one-way street. House File 372\n\nLIMITS ON HOME DEFECTS LAWSUITS: Iowa homeowners will have less time to file lawsuits over hidden defects caused by contractors under a bill approved by lawmakers. Democrats characterized the changes to Iowa's \"statute of repose\" laws as anti-consumer, while Republicans argued the changes would reduce construction costs. A statute-of-repose establishes a time period after which a lawsuit based on negligence in an improvement can be filed, regardless of whether there was an injury to a person or property. The legislation changes the statute of repose from 15 years to 10 years for residential property and from 15 years to eight years for commercial property. Republicans said the changes bring Iowa into line with other states. Senate File 413\n\nLIMITS ON LIVESTOCK LAWSUITS: Lawmakers agreed to limit lawsuit damages in cases filed by unhappy neighbors against livestock producers. The bill allows for an affirmative defense when an animal feeding operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or otherwise interfere with a person's enjoyment of life or property. The legislation suggests the public interest is served by preserving and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production. The affirmative defense could be raised regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of an animal feeding operation. The affirmative defense limits compensatory damages, as opposed to punitive damages, and specifies three categories of awards. Senate File 447\n\nLIMITS ON ASBESTOS LAWSUITS: Legislation aimed at restricting asbestos-related liability lawsuits was approved by majority Republicans, despite heated complaints by Democrats the measure will hurt sick and dying Iowans. Democrats complained the measure reads almost identically to model legislation drafted by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a national conservative organization. But Sen. Brad Zaun, R-Urbandale, the Senate bill's floor manager, said he'd had no contact with the Virginia-based group, adding his goal is to avoid double-dipping by people who have already received an average of $600,000 in liability claims. The measure requires plaintiffs to meet deadlines within 90 days of filing an asbestos claim for disclosing certain information, including the disposition of each asbestos trust claim and a host of other information. The case may be dismissed for noncompliance. Senate File 376\n\nLYME DISEASE: Iowa doctors would be exempt from certain disciplinary actions based on their treatment of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. Several lawmakers told personal stories of family members and others who have been unable to obtain adequate treatment for Lyme disease in Iowa, which has resulted in Iowans traveling to doctors in Minnesota and Missouri. The treatment could be provided after the physician informs the patient about other recognized treatment options and describes the doctor's education, experience and credentials regarding treatment of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. House File 577\n\nDRUNKEN TEACHERS: Teachers who are disciplined for being intoxicated at school must now be reported to Iowa's licensing agency, resolving a loophole exposed by a high-profile case in Ankeny. The bipartisan bill requires school districts to report any licensed employee disciplined for possessing or being under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs at school or school events. The loophole came to light in 2015 after The Des Moines Register reported that Jennifer Lynn Rich, an Ankeny teacher, was caught with Busch Light during a school Valentine's Day party. House File 217\n\nWORKERS' COMPENSATION CUTS: Legislation was approved to reduce workers' compensation after a heated debate over the importance of Iowa's business climate versus the interests of injured workers. The bill will cut workers' compensation benefits, limit benefits, change the qualifications for benefits and reduce a key interest rate calculation, according to the Legislative Services Agency. House File 518\n\nMINIMUM WAGE HIKES NULLIFIED: Republican lawmakers agreed to nullify minimum wage increases already approved in five counties. The action effectively freezes the state's minimum wage at $7.25 an hour, and Democrats angrily denounced the bill, saying it fails to support poor Iowans. Republicans said the legislation will provide Iowa employers with certainty, predictability and uniformity by assuring the same minimum wage statewide. The bill also prevents cities and counties from exercising local control on some other issues that Republican lawmakers contend conflict with state law, such as paid family leave, implementing a soft drink tax or banning the use of plastic bags. House File 295\n\nAUTISM INSURANCE: Lawmakers agreed to require many employer-provided health insurance policies to include treatment of autism spectrum disorder for young people. The passage of the bill represents years of work by advocates for people with autism. The legislation will apply to employers of more than 50 full-time workers. It will require coverage of applied behavioral analysis for persons under age 19 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. House File 215\n\nDEER RIFLES: Straight wall cartridge rifles will be permitted for Iowa deer hunting under a bill that received bipartisan support. These rifles are the same caliber and use the same straight-walled cartridges legal for use in handguns. The bill is intended to attract more people to hunting and to offer additional options for hunters while bolstering sales for gun retailers. Straight wall cartridge rifles have reduced recoil compared with larger shotguns and are more accurate than similar caliber handguns. The rifles will be permitted during the youth and disabled deer hunting seasons and for the first and second shotgun deer hunting seasons by licensed deer hunters. House File 475\n\nLONGER STRAIGHT TRUCKS: Straight trucks on Iowa's roads can be 45 feet in length, 4 feet more than the current legal limit, lawmakers decided. A straight truck is one in which all axles are attached to a single frame. Iowa Department of Transportation officials said the legislation will not increase the legal weight of trucks. They noted that all of Iowa's surrounding states, except Nebraska, permit straight trucks at least 45 feet in length. House File 218\n\nRESTRICTIONS ON PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS: This measure prevents state and local governments from mandating the use of project labor agreements for public construction projects. The legislation addresses concerns raised by nonunion contractors about project labor agreements, which are a collective bargaining arrangement with one or more labor unions for a construction project. Supporters of project labor agreements say they ensure that workers are paid fair wages and that construction work is completed on time and on budget. Nonunion contractors contend project labor agreements impede open, fair and competitive bidding in taxpayer-funded construction projects by requiring union construction workers. Senate File 438\n\nJOINT CITY AND SCHOOL ELECTIONS: Iowa's city and school elections will be held on the same day under a bill approved by lawmakers, although critics said implementation will be difficult. The measure establishes school and city elections on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November during odd-numbered years. Poor turnout in school elections has been a longstanding concern throughout Iowa. According to the Secretary of State’s Office, in the last four school elections, the voter turnout average was 6.5 percent. In contrast, the average voter turnout for city elections in that same time frame was 21.3 percent. The administration of the combined elections takes effect on July 1, 2019. House File 566\n\nDEER TAGS: Lawmakers agreed to change the state's requirements for tagging deer carcasses. The legislation says a deer carcass may be moved away from an obstacle, entanglement, waterway, or another area, including a roadway, if it would be a safety hazard before the tag is attached to the carcass. However, the deer must be tagged as soon as possible after it is moved and before it is transported. House File 254\n\nLEGISLATORS' HEALTH INSURANCE: Iowa lawmakers approved a bill to increase their own contributions for their personal health insurance premiums. A February report from the Register found that 92 of 149 Iowa legislators pay as little as $20 a month toward their heath insurance premiums, rather than the $142 to $334 a month that those plans call for. The legislation clarifies existing law to ensure employees of the state's legislative branch will pay 20 percent of their health care premium costs. According to the Legislative Services Agency, the changes are expected to save the state $235,000 during the 2018 budget year and $470,000 annually beginning in 2019. Senate File 230\n\nBREAST DENSITY: A bill that some women say would have helped them detect their own breast cancer and enter treatment sooner was approved after years of opposition by medical groups that saw it as overly prescriptive. The legislation requires doctors to disclose to patients whether they have dense breast tissue that could make it more difficult to detect tumors through traditional mammograms. Lobbyists reached a compromise that is intended to be less prescriptive and allows medical groups to adapt more easily to new technology and information as it becomes available. Senate File 250\n\nCMV: Lawmakers approved a measure that requires if a newborn baby has hearing loss that the baby be tested for congenital cytomegalovirus before the child is 21 days old. The testing requirement would not apply if a parent objects and provides a written refusal that would be provided to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Cytomegalovirus, known as CMV, is a common virus that affects people of all ages, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, CMV infection can cause serious health problems for people with weakened immune systems, as well as babies infected with the virus before they are born. Babies born with CMV can have brain, liver, spleen, lung and growth problems. Senate File 51\n\nDES MOINES PENSION MERGER: The merger of a Des Moines school pension fund into the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System received legislative approval. The Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, known as IPERS, is authorized by the Iowa Legislature, but not required, to accept the proposal to merge subject to agreement by both parties of the terms and conditions of the merger. Des Moines Public Schools currently has more than 5,000 employees and most are already members of the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System. The merger would transfer 448 active teachers and other employees now served by the Des Moines Teachers Retirement System into the IPERS program. House File 89\n\nSUPER WEED: Palmer amaranth, a so-called \"super weed\" from southern states that has been invading Iowa farmland, was declared a noxious weed and eradication efforts were authorized by lawmakers. Palmer amaranth is a species of edible flowering plant that is aggressive and invasive, crowding out corn, soybeans, and other cash crops. The plant which can grow to 7-feet tall, has been found in at least 49 Iowa counties.

Ron DeSantis for his approval. Here are some of the most controversial changes coming Saturday that may affect you.\n\n1. You can carry a concealed weapon without a permit\n\nIf you are legally permitted to own a firearm, you can carry it concealed in Florida. You still must be a resident 21 or older to buy a weapon, unless you are a law enforcement or corrections officer or are in military service, and there still are restrictions on gun ownership for people convicted of a felony, dishonorably discharged, adjudicated mentally defective or involuntarily committed to treatment, convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor or other conditions recognized by the state.\n\nBut the Public Safety law (HB 543) removes the requirement for a concealed weapons license and its mandatory background check and firearms training course before you could carry hidden weapons or firearms on your person or in a vehicle in Florida.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe bill also adds private schools to the list of educational facilities that can ask the local sheriff for help establishing a guardian program and requires various agencies and offices to develop threat management policies.\n\n2. If you're an undocumented immigrant, it will be harder for you to find employment in Florida and criminal for anyone to transport you in or out of the state\n\nAs of Saturday, Florida will enact some of the harshest anti-immigration laws in the country.\n\nCS/CS/SB 1718 - Immigration makes the following changes:\n\nTransporting a minor or more than five undocumented people into the state carries a second-degree felony penalty.\n\nCompanies with 25 or more employees will have to use the federal E-Verify system when hiring workers. Penalties for employers who don’t verify their employees’ status could face suspension of their licenses to operate.\n\nLocal governments will be banned from contributing money to organizations creating ID cards for undocumented immigrants, and driver’s licenses issued to non-citizens will be barred from use in Florida. Illegal migrants also could face felony charges by displaying a false ID to obtain employment.\n\nHospitals receiving state and federal Medicaid reimbursements will be required to track how much money is spent on undocumented immigrants in emergency rooms and must ask if a patient is in the country legally.\n\nA 2014 law that allowed undocumented immigrants to be admitted to practice law in Florida will be repealed.\n\nThe Division of Emergency Management’s Unauthorized Alien Transport Program get $12 million to continue the migrant-relocation program of transporting asylum-seekers to different places around the country.\n\n'It's definitely chaos':How immigration law impacts Florida restaurants, construction\n\nWho can and can't buy land in Florida?DeSantis' new property laws take effect in July\n\n3. If you use a public bathroom in Florida, you are required to use the ones that line up with your sex assigned at birth\n\nTrans people are now barred from entering certain bathrooms that do not match their gender.\n\nCS/HB 1521 - Facility Requirements Based on Sex applies to bathrooms at facilities such as public schools, colleges, universities, state and local government buildings, prisons and jails.\n\nUnder the law, people who enter bathrooms designated for the “opposite sex” could face trespassing charges. The bill includes exceptions for situations involving bathroom use by children under age 12, seniors and people with developmental disabilities.\n\nThe Florida law also defines a female as a “person belonging, at birth, to the biological sex which has the specific reproductive role of producing eggs.” It defines a male as “a person belonging, at birth, to the biological sex which has the specific reproductive role of producing sperm.”\n\n4. Schools in Florida will be starting later\n\nAs of Saturday, July 1, middle schools may not begin the “instructional day” earlier than 8 a.m., and high schools will be barred from starting the school day before 8:30 a.m. according to the newly passed Middle School and High School Start Times bill (CS/HB 733).\n\nDon't turn off your alarms yet. School districts have until the 2026-2027 school year to make the change.\n\n5. Healthcare providers in Florida can deny you service based on their moral, ethical, or religious beliefs\n\nAccording to the Protections of Medical Conscience bill (CS/SB 1580), \"any healthcare provider or facility licensed under a dozen different statutes, including doctors, nurses, pharmacies, hospitals, mental health providers, medical transport services, clinical lab personnel, nursing homes, and more\" may refuse services if they have a \"conscience-based objection\" based on \"a sincerely held religious, moral, or ethical belief.\" The bill also adds the following protections:\n\nHealthcare payors such as employers, health insurers, and health plans may refuse payment.\n\nHealthcare providers and payors are protected from liability for providing ‘conscience-based’ health care.\n\nMedical boards and the Department of Health are prohibited from taking disciplinary action or denying licenses to such healthcare providers if they have publicly spoken or written about a healthcare service or policy. This includes but is not limited to social media, according to the bill.\n\n6. If you're a teenager, you can't drive a golf cart in Florida without a permit or driver's license\n\nStarting Saturday, if you're under 18 you have to be at least 15 with a learner's permit to drive a golf cart, or 16 with a driver's license. If you're 18 and older, you have to have valid government-issued identification.\n\nCS/CS/HB 949: Operation of a Golf Cart changes Florida law from the previous age limit — 14 — and defines a golf cart as “a motor vehicle that is designed and manufactured for operation on a golf course for sporting or recreational purposes and that is not capable of exceeding speeds of 20 miles per hour.”\n\n7. You can't use TikTok on campus Wi-Fi or on a school- or government-issued device\n\nUniversities around the state already were banning TikTok on school equipment due to personal security risks. CS/HB 379 - Technology in K-12 Public Schools makes it official, and Prohibited Applications on Government-issued Devices (CS/CS/SB 258) adds the app to the list of applications created and maintained by a “foreign country of concern” that are banned from city, county, and state-issued phones and devices.\n\n8. You can fly some flags and park your boat in back whether your HOA likes it or not\n\nIf you've been battling your local homeowners' association over the flag outside your house, you may see an end in sight.\n\nStarting Saturday morning, homeowners may fly portable, removable, official flags no larger than 4 1/2 feet by 6 feet, \"regardless of any HOA covenants, restrictions, bylaws, rules, or requirements to the contrary,\" according to CS/CS/HB 437: Property Owners' Right to Install, Display, and Store Items. You may fly up to two of the following:\n\nThe United States flag\n\nThe official flag of the State of Florida\n\nA flag representing the United States Army, Navy, 51 Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, or Coast Guard\n\nA POW-MIA flag\n\nA flag honoring first responders including law enforcement, firefighters, certain medical personnel, correctional officers, 911 operators, etc.\n\nYou're also allowed to put up a freestanding flagpole no more than 20 feet high anywhere on your property as long as it doesn't obstruct sightlines at intersections and isn't on an easement. You can put up to two flags on it, providing one of them (the top one) is the U.S. flag.\n\nThe bill also blocks HOAs from restricting homeowners or their tenants from putting anything in their yards which aren't visible from the front or from an adjacent parcel, \"including, but not limited to, artificial turf, boats, flags, and recreational vehicles.\"\n\nJames Call of the Tallahassee Democrat contributed to this article.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/state/2019/05/04/florida-session-ends-big-gop-wins-historic-91-1-billion-budget-republican-legislative/3641154002/", "title": "Florida session ends with big GOP wins, historic $91.1 billion budget", "text": "The first legislative session with newly elected Gov. Ron DeSantis turned out by most measures to be a rousing success for the Republican leadership despite a vibrant opposition from Democrats.\n\nBut what Republicans embrace as success, Democrats and civil rights groups condemn as an all-out assault on immigrants, minorities, working families and the will of Florida's voters.\n\nAnd despite the many controversial issues that deeply divided both chambers, the Republican-dominated Legislature got almost all of its major goals accomplished without much of the internal strife and bickering seen under the previous administration.\n\nThere were a few hiccups, some delays as negotiations went on behind the scenes, and a few last minute amendments to revive stalled bills, but in the end, the Republicans delivered.\n\nA little after 2 p.m. Saturday with the close of the 2019 session, the youthful, energetic governor got a $91.1 billion budget that comes close to funding his educational and environmental goals.\n\nMore:Straws, gardens and growth: A rundown of bills that strip local governments of powers\n\nDeSantis, who got a big boost from President Trump to win the governorship, also saw passage of a major immigration policy very much in line Trump Administration policy.\n\n“I thank the Florida Legislature for presenting me with a bill that upholds the rule of law and addresses sanctuary cities and counties in Florida,” DeSantis tweeted. “We are a stronger state when we protect our residents, foster safe communities and respect the work of law enforcement.”\n\nHe also got a sweeping expansion of school vouchers, as well as a prescription drug import plan — three of them, actually.\n\nThe budget includes a $783 million increase in K-12 funding, including $364 million districts can use for teacher pay raises. The budget also invests $682.6 million in water quality and protection, and $1.8 billion for Hurricane Michael recovery efforts. They also saved most of the money for the state's 28 so-called safety net hospitals, and extended the life of Visit Florida for one more year.\n\nAnd they approved a $300 million tax package which includes breaks for farmers whose fences and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Michael, a back-to-school and a disaster relief sales tax holiday, and a cut in business tax rent.\n\nIt also includes a deal for charter schools to share local tax money with school districts.\n\nSenate President Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, got his ambitious toll road package and House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes, got his sweeping healthcare reforms.\n\nThey saw a slew of other bills important to leadership make it through the sausage factory — changes to insurance regulations, a weakened criminal justice reform package and an increase in the penalties for texting while driving.\n\nAnd they saw a radical rewrite of the rules for citizens to bring constitutional amendments to the ballot take a detour but eventually pass.\n\nAs the minority party, Democrats did everything they could to gum up the works. They filed dozens of amendments to slow down discussion and tried to run down the clock on sanctuary cities, letting teachers carry guns in school, and forcing returning felons to pay off all their court-ordered financial obligations before they can vote again.\n\nTheir efforts managed to gain a few minor concessions here and there, but also gave them hope that they will one day be in charge again. “One day we will be back at the front of this chamber,” said Rep. Evan Jenne, D-Hollywood.\n\nThere were some notable failures to launch, too. An anti-fracking bill that didn’t ban fracking got lost in the shuffle. So did major abortion legislation. Raising the age for buying tobacco and e-cigarettes to 21 went up in smoke. And putting a cap on the amount of THC in smokable marijuana vaporized.\n\nAlso failing to cross the finish line were a number of bills to finance septic to sewer conversions as a way to improve water quality.\n\nOf the nearly 3,400 bills introduced this session, fewer than 200 survived. Here is a selective look at the more high profile issues that crossed the finish line.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nThe budget has an additional $783 million increase for K-12 public education. Nearly $330 million of that is for construction, repairs and maintenance – of which $158 million will go to charter schools. Teachers and school districts have fought this proposal.\n\nSchool districts will also have to share their local tax dollars with charter schools, after Democrats lost a battle to add language that would let school districts to decide how to spend their local tax referendum dollars.\n\nBack story:\n\nThe schools bill also expands the voucher program by creating a new scholarship program to send up to 18,000 more students to private schools. The Legislature has set aside $250,000 for legal fees, anticipating that it will be challenged in court.\n\nSANCTUARY CITIES\n\nThe debate over sanctuary cities was emotional and sometimes veered toward the personal as lawmakers on both sides recounted their own personal journeys to the U.S. or that of their parents and other relatives. The debate saw the emergence of new leaders among freshman Democrats in the House, including Rep. Anna Eskamani of Orlando, whose parents emigrated to the U.S. from Iran.\n\nIn the end, the Legislature passed out a measure that not only defines sanctuary policies but strips local governments of their autonomy over whether to cooperate with federal immigration authorities detain immigrants.\n\nBack story:Florida 'sanctuary cities' bill headed to governor as lawmakers race the clock\n\nA small compromise engineered by Sen. Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, eliminated specific fines for governments that don’t cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but still allows the governor to seek judicial action against local government officials who fail to help execute warrants.\n\nCRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM\n\nSen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, had to scale back his centerpiece legislation, the First Step Act into what he called his “first step” toward reforming the state’s criminal justice system.\n\nHe stripped provisions that would have allowed nonviolent felons to be released from prison earlier and language that would have given judges more leeway in sentencing nonviolent drug offenders.\n\n“It’s a very substantial criminal justice reform package; one of the largest we’ve seen in decades in the state of Florida,” said Brandes after he filed the amendments Tuesday.\n\nThe bill is the first change in the legal threshold for felony theft in 35 years, from $300 to $750. It also reduces some penalties for nonviolent offenses.\n\nAMENDMENT FOUR\n\nAfter cutting a deal late Thursday night, the Senate moved forward on an amendment by Brandes tacked onto an election administration bill that incorporates tough hurdles for ex-offenders who want their voting rights restored.\n\nOpponents said the bill was a slap in the face of the 65 percent of voters who said yes to Amendment 4.\n\nBack story:\n\nFelons would be required to pay all court costs, fees and fines and make restitution, unless they can persuade a judge to waive those payments.\n\nAny felon who registers to vote between Jan. 1 and July 1 would be held harmless by language in the bill that says they can't be prosecuted if they mistakenly say their rights were restored if in fact they weren't.\n\nThe same election bill expands the window for early voting and voting by mail.\n\nTOLL ROADS\n\nDespite widespread opposition from environmentalists, Galvano’s measure to create a $1.3 billion master road-building plan won approval by the House on the second-to-last day of session after clearing the Senate on April 24.\n\nThe bill creates three regional corridors – the Southwest-Central Florida Connector from Collier to Polk County; the Suncoast Connector from Citrus to Jefferson County; and the Northern Turnpike Connector from the north end of the Florida Turnpike to the Suncoast Parkway.\n\nThe state is allocating $45 million this year, $90 million next year, and $135 million the year after just for planning purposes.\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nSpeaker Oliva saw his goal come true of eliminating certificates of need for new general hospitals and “tertiary care” hospitals, a bill sponsored by Republican Rep. Heather Fitzenhagen of Fort Myers.\n\n“I think today is a monumental step in the right direction,” Oliva told reporters.\n\nThe Legislature also passed another key issue for DeSantis that would allow the importation of prescription drugs from Canada. The measure establishes three separate programs to import drugs from Canada.\n\nPharmaceutical companies have cautioned that the program will not save Floridians money and will result in people getting ineffective, substandard and possibly dangerous medicine because it sidesteps strict federal regulations.\n\nAlso, the state's 28 safety net hospitals will get all but $9 million of the $319 million they were slated to get.\n\nOFFICE SURGERY\n\nSweeping legislation approved by lawmakers near the end of session could prevent deaths documented in Florida’s cosmetics surgery centers by setting some of the strictest standards in the nation. If signed by the governor, the state for the first time could punish dangerous plastic surgery offices and shut down the worst offenders.\n\nThe effort to toughen the law began two months ago after an investigation by USA TODAY and the Naples Daily News that showed eight women died after procedures at a plastic surgery business owned by one doctor.\n\nBack story:\n\nIn April, a second story revealed the state tried unsuccessfully to pass legislation four times that would have cracked down on the centers, even as felony offenders opened their own facilities with no background screening by the state.\n\nTEACHERS WITH GUNS\n\nAnother deeply emotional battle was fought over whether the Legislature should expand the Guardian program approved last year to include teachers among the staff and faculty who can participate in the program and carry a gun on campus.\n\nTeachers were taken out of last year’s bill as a compromise, but the measure was reintroduced this year. Opponents said parents, teachers and students made it clear they don’t want to go to a school where teachers are carrying guns.\n\nBack story:\n\nIn supporting a measure to expand the Guardian program to include teachers, Rep. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, said, \"There is a fundamental difference between arming teachers and allowing teachers to be armed.”\n\nANTISEMITISM\n\nTwo days after a fatal shooting at a Southern California synagogue, the Florida Senate revived a languishing antisemitism bill and unanimously voted to send it to DeSantis.\n\nMore:Bill to combat antisemitism in public schools and colleges on way to Governor\n\nThe measure adds religion to the list of things that cannot be discriminated against. It also requires Florida public schools and colleges to treat incidents of antisemitism by students, teachers and other employees the same as racism.\n\nWhile it gives several examples of antisemitism, it does not mention other forms of discrimination.\n\nTEXTING WHILE DRIVING\n\nWhen DeSantis signs it into law, texting and driving will be a primary offense, and no longer take a back seat to other moving violations. It will also be illegal to use or hold your phone while driving through a school zone or construction zone.\n\nBack story: Florida's new stronger texting while driving legislation is overdue | Our opinion\n\nVOTER RECORDS\n\nA measure to exempt the phone numbers and emails of registered voters that initially died for lack of getting a two-thirds majority vote was revived and amended on the last day of session to exempt whether a voter was a prior felon whose voting rights were restored, as well as all preregistration information of applicants who are 16 and 17.\n\nPETITION DRIVES\n\nIn the last hours of the regular session Friday, Rep. James Grant, R-Tampa, slipped an amendment onto a surtax bill that resurrected a bill that greatly restricts the ability of grassroots organizations to gather petitions for constitutional ballot initiatives.\n\nBack story:Florida House plan targets ballot initiatives after voters OK'd 11 amendments in 2018\n\nThe main issue is that it prohibits using paid, out-of-state petition gatherers.\n\nINSURANCE REFORM\n\nA statute that has allowed lawyers to collect one-way legal fees related to assignment-of-benefits disputes got an overhaul by the Legislature this session. It is meant to curb personal and commercial property insurance abuse.\n\nWETLANDS MITIGATION\n\nThis measure allows developers who run into a situation where the state or private wetland mitigation bank is out of credits to go to the local government and buy mitigation credits from them or use local government conservation lands.\n\nUNDERGROUND UTILITIES\n\nThe state's five investor-owned electrical utilities would be able to come to the Public Service Commission each year to ask to raise rates to cover the cost of burying power lines underground and hardening utility poles for hurricane protection.\n\nBack story:'This is the next step': 10-year hurricane resiliency plans on path for passage\n\nVAPING\n\nThe Legislature passed enacting language for the voter-approved Amendment 9, which prohibits vaping or using E-cigarettes in enclosed work places.\n\nGROWTH MANAGEMENT\n\nIn the waning moments of the Legislature Friday, a measure passed that 1000 Friends of Florida calls the death knell to growth management by weakening local government's ability to enforce comprehensive plans.\n\nAnyone who challenges a plan amendment and loses would have to pay the opposing side's legal fees. It also takes away the right of local governments to require new developments to provide affordable housing and keep citizens from commenting on comprehensive plans.\n\nHEMP PROGRAM\n\nThe Legislature passed a measure to create a state hemp program within the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services – after the 2018 federal Farm Bill removed a ban on industrial hemp that had been in place since 1937.\n\nMore:FAMU trustees give green light to plans for hemp research; solar farm proposals\n\n“Florida is now on the verge of establishing a state hemp program and creating a multi-billion dollar industry. Our farmers have asked for alternative crops. Floridians want access to safe, tested cannabis and CBD,\" Florida Agricultural Commissioner Nikki Fried said in a news release.\n\nRED TIDE\n\nHelping DeSantis keep another promise, the Legislature approved a measure creating an initiative to combat Red Tide. It was one of the few bills dealing with water quality that was approved this session.\n\nThe Florida Red Tide Mitigation and Technology Development Initiative at Mote Marine Lab would get $3 million a year for red tide research.\n\nOPIOID WARS\n\nThe Senate on Friday unanimously approved a bill and sent it on the way to the governor that would strengthen the state's ongoing litigation against Walgreen's and CVS, according to Attorney General Ashley Moody.\n\nThe measure would allow the Attorney General’s Office to obtain patient information from Florida’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Database, which tracks distribution of painkillers and other legal drugs around the state.\n\nThe Attorney General would be able to use that information in active investigations and pending civil or criminal litigation against pharmacies and other dispensers of controlled, prescribed substances.\n\nHAZING\n\nOn the last official day of session Friday, Sen. Lauren Book's anti-hazing measure named in honor of late Florida State University student Andrew Coffey was revived and approved by the Senate and House.\n\nThe bill adds teeth to Florida's hazing statute by ensuring that those who authorize hazing but don't participate are also punished. It also allows bystanders to report hazing incidents without fear of repercussion and grants amnesty for people who seek help\n\n“Hazing is unacceptable, but no one should ever be afraid to call for help in a dangerous situation,” Book said in a news release. “I want to thank the Coffey family for lending their voices to support this life-saving bill, crafted in Andrew’s honor.”\n\n\n\nTHE DEAD ZONE\n\nThe majority of bills introduced for this session didn't survive. Here is a list of the more significant measures that died.\n\nParental notification: Rep. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, and Sen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, introduced this measure to require minors to get parents' consent before getting an abortion. It stalled, as did several other bills related to abortions.\n\nSafety of Religions Institutions: Also introduced by Grall, and Sen. Debbie Mayfield, R-Melbourne, this measure would have allowed churches and other religious institutions to authorize people licensed to carry a concealed weapon to have a firearm on property owned, leased or used by the institution. It also would have allowed a private or religious school to designate a person to carry a firearm on school property.\n\nFracking: Despite the governor's call to ban \"fracking,\" measures aimed at the controversial drilling procedure called hydraulic fracturing failed to move forward in the House and Senate. Environmentalists said the measures didn't go far enough.\n\nVacation rentals: A bill to take away local control of regulations of residential vacation rentals, especially those booked on Internet platforms like AirBnB.\n\nTobacco 21: A measure that would have raised the legal age for buying and smoking tobacco and vaping products died during the waning hours of session. It also would have preempted local governments from regulating sales and marketing.\n\nTHC cap: Thought to be dead, a bill that caps the amount of THC in smokable medical marijuana was revived during the last days of session as an amendment to a health bill in the House but it was killed in the Senates.\n\nB.K. Roberts Hall: Despite strong support in the Senate, a measure to remove the name of pro-segregation Florida Supreme Court Justice B.K.

Ron DeSantis, who has signaled his support for the measure.\n\nFlorida’s GOP-controlled Senate passed HB 1557, titled the Parental Rights in Education bill, in a 22-17 vote. The state House had approved the bill late last month.\n\nConservatives have argued that the bill is needed in order to give parents greater oversight over what students learn and discuss at school, stressing that LGBTQ-related topics should be left for families to discuss at home.\n\nOpponents, however, have dubbed it the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, arguing the ban it creates would negatively impact an already marginalized community. They’ve pointed to data showing that LGBTQ youth reported lower rates of attempting suicide when they had access to LGBTQ-affirming spaces.\n\nThe bill’s opponents have also decried a part of the legislation that allows parents to bring civil suits against a school district for any potential violation of its rules, arguing it would open educators up to an endless barrage of litigation. The legislation has drawn scrutiny from Democrats in the state and elsewhere, including from President Joe Biden, who vowed last month to protect LGBTQ youth from such measures.\n\nIf signed by DeSantis, a staunch conservative who has a history of supporting anti-LGBTQ measures in the state, the bill would take effect in July. His office declined CNN’s request for comment on the Senate’s passage Tuesday, instead pointing to remarks he made last week on the legislation.\n\n“To provide protections for parents, for preschoolers, kindergarteners, first graders, I mean that is something, I think, most parents would appreciate,” DeSantis told reporters. “And we send the kids to school – young kids – and we want them to learn the basics. Some of these issues that are just simply not age-appropriate, I think parents want to see protection for that.”\n\nBill seeks to limit classroom instruction\n\nThe bill states that “classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”\n\nIn addition, the measure would require districts to “adopt procedures for notifying a student’s parent if there is a change in the student’s services or monitoring related to the student’s mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being,” something LGBTQ advocates argue could lead to some students being outed to their parents without the student’s knowledge or consent. Advocates also fear the bill would restrict students’ ability to speak confidentially with school counselors – some of whom are a student’s sole resource for mental health services.\n\nMore than a dozen attempts by members of the Florida Senate to amend the bill on Monday failed, despite emotional pleas from some Democrats, including state Sen. Shevrin Jones, who brought some senators to tears as he spoke about his experience as a gay Floridian. State Sen. Jeff Brandes, a Republican, offered an amendment that would have broadened the legislation to prohibit all instruction of any sexual topics in an attempt to eliminate concerns from LGTBQ advocates that the bill stigmatized members of the community, but it failed.\n\nBrandes, along with one other Republican state senator, joined Democrats in voting against the measure Tuesday.\n\n‘There will be protests everywhere’\n\nDuring Monday’s debate, the bill’s Senate sponsor, Republican state Sen. Dennis Baxley, said that he was concerned that kids are “experimenting” with sexual orientation and that was part of his motivation for the legislation. The bill’s co-sponsor in the Florida House, Republican state Rep. Joe Harding, previously told CNN that the bill is meant to deter school staff from inquiring about a student’s gender identity or pronouns without including their parents in the conversation.\n\nHarding had said that he’d heard a few instances of parents complaining that school staff were discussing gender identity with their children without their input, though he didn’t get into specifics of where in the state such instances occurred.\n\nAfter “Saturday Night Live” poked fun at the bill, Christina Pushaw, the governor’s spokeswoman, posted on Twitter that anyone who opposes the bill is “probably a groomer,” in essence smearing those who’ve raised concerns about the bill as sexual predators. Her comments harken back to debunked arguments used by anti-gay activists in recent history to smear and marginalize members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nOpponents of the measure have pointed to research from the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization that works on suicide prevention among LGBTQ youth. The group said in a statement last month that “LGBTQ youth who had access to spaces that affirmed their sexual orientation and gender identity – including schools – reported lower rates of attempting suicide than those who did not.”\n\nStudents in Florida have been among some of the bill’s loudest opponents, with several high schools across the state having held walkouts in recent days in protest of the bill.\n\n“We wanted to show our government that this isn’t going to stop. There were walkouts all last week. This is going to continue. If this passes, there will be protests everywhere,” Will Larkins, a junior who helped organize a walkout at Winter Park High School in Orange County, told CNN on Monday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional background information and reaction.", "authors": ["Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/politics/republican-states-book-ban-race-lgbtq/index.html", "title": "Book bans move to center stage in the red state education wars ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe escalating red-state efforts to ban more books mark a new stage in the struggle to control the educational experience of America’s kaleidoscopically diverse younger generations.\n\nSince 2021, more than a dozen Republican-controlled states have passed laws or approved executive branch policies that restrict how public school teachers can talk about race, gender and sexual orientation, as in the case of the bill critics call “don’t say gay,” which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law last week. But now, even as National Library Week arrives this week, the attempt to limit what materials are available to young people is spilling out from the classroom into the library.\n\nThough battles over access to controversial titles traditionally have been fought district by district, and even school by school, Republican-controlled states including Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas are now pushing statewide rules that make it easier for critics to remove books they dislike from school libraries in every community.\n\nAt the same time, although none have yet passed, more red states are seriously debating proposals that would make it easier for critics to force the removal of books even from public libraries serving the adult population.\n\n“The primary target still is school libraries and school librarians, K-12 teachers, but we are seeing this bleed over to public libraries,” says Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association.\n\nTo the conservatives pushing this agenda, these new restrictions on libraries – like the parallel red-state laws limiting certain discussions in the classroom – are a means of protecting parental rights.\n\n“Parents want education for their kids: They are not interested in indoctrination through the school system,” DeSantis argued late last month when signing a bill facilitating efforts to remove books from school libraries.\n\nBut to a wide array of civil rights, civil liberties and free expression groups, these restrictions represent an effort to enshrine the values of one particular group of parents – conservative Whites – over the priorities and experiences of an increasingly diverse society in which kids of color now compose a clear majority of the public school student body nationwide.\n\nThere is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information. Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project\n\nThe parallel battles over how teachers address race, gender and sexual orientation and how libraries regulate access to books represent the broadest attempt to limit what students are taught since the “loyalty oath” demands on teachers during the red scare period of the 1950s, or even the “Scopes trial”-era laws banning the teaching of evolution during the 1920s.\n\n“There is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information,” says Vera Eidelman a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. On both fronts, she says, critics are “targeting the same set of viewpoints and experiences and aspects of education,” primarily materials relating to race, gender roles and the experiences of LGBTQ individuals.\n\n‘Parallel movements’\n\nThe torrent of laws approved in Republican-controlled states since 2021 to limit how teachers can discuss race, gender or sexual orientation has been part of a much broader current. Since the 2020 election, the 23 states in which Republicans control both the governorship and the state legislature have approved a surge of statutes restricting abortion rights, making it more difficult to vote, barring transgender girls and women from participating in grade school or college sports, banning transgender care for minors and increasing penalties for public protest. Cumulatively, as I’ve written, these proliferating red-state measures constitute an attempt to reverse what legal analysts call the “rights revolution” of roughly the past 60 years, in which Congress and the Supreme Court have generally expanded the circle of basic civil rights and liberties guaranteed to all Americans and reduced the ability of states to curtail those rights.\n\nCritics of the new wave of red-state measures see an especially powerful through line connecting the laws that make it more difficult to vote and increase the legal penalties for disruptive public protest with the bills that censor classroom instruction or empower critics to ban books in school libraries. All three thrusts make it more difficult for opponents to mobilize opposition to the agenda the red-state Republicans are advancing.\n\n“There are parallel movements across voting rights and protest rights and education rights,” says Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education at PEN America, a free-speech group founded by prominent authors. “In each case, you have a kind of flowering of experimentation of legislation to see what kind of things can fit to make it harder for people to vote, to make it more costly to protest and what would make it harder to access information in school.”\n\nThe restrictions on classroom teaching have exploded across the red states since 2021. Jeffrey Sachs, a political scientist at Acadia University in Nova Scotia who tracks these proposals for PEN America, counts at least 13 Republican-controlled states that have approved laws censoring how teachers talk about “divisive concepts,” such as systematic racial inequity, and five more states with GOP governors that have imposed administrative limits on such teachings through state boards of education or other bodies.\n\nThe conservatives pushing these bills portray them as a necessary barrier against liberal attempts to “indoctrinate” students through concepts such as critical race theory, an academic analysis of systemic discrimination, or the 1619 Project, a New York Times project that stressed the impact of slavery on American society. At a recent event with DeSantis, Alicia Farrant, a mother and school board candidate in Orange County, Florida, described her state’s version of these proposals as proof that parents “will not cower to the divisive agendas that are infiltrating our public schools in order to corrupt and destroy the educational foundations of our great nation.”\n\nThis wave does not appear to have crested. The Florida legislation barring discussion of sexual orientation in the youngest grades and limiting it in older grades has spawned copycat bills in other Republican-controlled states. More states are also considering laws that would extend the classroom censorship to public colleges and universities. Other GOP-controlled states, including Missouri, are considering their own bills on race and gender, and some of the states that have already passed such laws are doubling back with new proposals – such as a proposed amendment to the state constitution in Arizona to ban the teaching of critical race theory.\n\n“The level of focus and unity of language that we are seeing across all of these different bills is pretty extraordinary,” Sachs says. “There is an incredible amount of overlap, down to the punctuation of these bills, so we can definitely consider this a national campaign and not one that is responding to the specific context of each state.”\n\nPublic libraries are not immune\n\nThis campaign has developed so much momentum that it has overflowed the classroom to reach the library – particularly those in schools, but now also, for the first time, lapping at the doors of those that serve the public.\n\nIn recent decades, these fights have unfolded mostly locally, with challenges to specific books at individual libraries. Those fights are clearly intensifying: On Monday, the American Library Association reported that in 2021 it had recorded 729 such efforts to ban books at school or public libraries, the most since it began cataloging these efforts in 2000. The most-challenged books, the group reported, were from Black or LGBTQ authors or centered on characters from those communities.\n\nBut this struggle is also expanding to a new level, with multiplying red-state efforts to create statewide policies designed to lead to the removal of more books. In Texas, for instance, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is pressuring school boards to remove what he calls “pornography” from school libraries. Abbott’s letter followed a more detailed complaint from a Republican state legislator who sent districts a letter inquiring about the presence of 850 books, including several by prominent Black or LGBTQ authors.\n\nIn Florida, DeSantis signed a bill late last month that requires school libraries to post more information about their collections and seek community input on materials they acquire. Most importantly, the new law requires the state Department of Education to collect and publish a report on which books have been removed in any district across the state.\n\nAt the bill-signing ceremony, DeSantis said these provisions would ensure that students are exposed only to age-appropriate books. The new measures will increase schools’ “ability to choose what is appropriate for different age groups,” he argued. “Parents are going to have the ability to have their voices heard.”\n\nBut opponents of the legislation say the requirement for the state Education Department to publish a list of books removed in any district provides a road map for critics to demand the removal of such books in all districts.\n\nFlorida, as is the case with many of the cultural flashpoints now dominating red-state legislatures, has moved fastest and furthest. But Georgia’s Republican-controlled legislature last week passed its own bill facilitating challenges to books in school libraries; measures targeting school libraries have also passed one chamber in the GOP-controlled legislatures in Kansas and Tennessee, though they face uncertain prospects of final approval. Similarly motivated bills have surfaced in Nebraska and Oklahoma as well.\n\nIn another escalation to the book wars, red state proposals are now emerging to ease the removal of books even in public libraries serving the adult, as well as the youth, population. These proposals generally would strip away the protection for librarians (and educators) from state obscenity laws, allowing officials to criminally charge librarians if they stock materials that a prosecutor considers obscene.\n\nWe all live in diverse communities these days … and we firmly believe that as public institutions, both public libraries and public school libraries need to serve the needs of everyone and reflect everyone’s lives in the library collection. Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association\n\nRepublican legislators have introduced bills to eliminate those protections in more than half a dozen states, according to the American Library Association’s tracking. None have yet passed into law, though one has cleared the state House in Idaho. Yet given the pace at which ideas once on the fringe, such as bans on gender-affirming health care for transgender minors, are advancing through the red states, Caldwell-Stone says the library association is “deeply concerned that one of these bills will eventually pass and will be used as a means of both intimidating librarians or actually charging them with crimes – based on this falsehood that mainstream materials, published by mainstream publishers, are somehow illegal speech unprotected by the First Amendment.”\n\nLast fall, a library faced such an investigation in Campbell County, Wyoming, after a local church complained about the presence of LGBTQ and sexual education materials there; a special prosecutor appointed by the county ultimately decided not to press charges.\n\nAll these confrontations underscore the cultural chasm between increasingly diverse younger generations and the socially conservative, predominantly White and Christian, Republican coalition that holds power in the red states. Children of color have constituted a majority of the public school K-12 student body since 2014, according to federal statistics, and now make up nearly 55% of the total. Gallup recently reported that 1 in 5 members of Generation Z, as well as 1 in 10 millennials, identify as LGBTQ, far more than in older generations. And the Public Religion Research Institute has found that more than a third of young adults identify as secular, without affiliation with any organized religion.\n\nSupporters of the efforts to restrict classroom teaching and/or ban books, by contrast, often cite a threat to “traditional” morality as a justification. When DeSantis signed the bill easing challenges to school library collections, one of the speakers he brought to the podium was a mother who had been prominent in protests against school masking requirements in Volusia County. She said her concern about school libraries was prompted in part by a picture book called “Red: A Crayon’s Story,” in which a crayon labeled red discovers that it’s really blue. The mother, Rebecca Sarwi, said she objected to “subliminal messaging for kids that young” that “normalizes them to believe” that they may be “something other than the unique individual that God created them to be.”\n\nServing ‘the needs of everyone’\n\nSuch arguments highlight what may be the core issue in this intensifying dispute: Though the classroom and library restrictions are being portrayed as an effort to strengthen “parents’ rights,” in practice they mean giving one set of parents a veto over educational content not only for their own kids, but others’ as well.\n\nLibrarians “don’t disagree with parents who want to guide their children’s readings … but they stand firmly opposed to one family dictating what is available to everyone else in a school library or a public library,” Caldwell-Stone told me. “We all live in diverse communities these days … and we firmly believe that as public institutions, both public libraries and public school libraries need to serve the needs of everyone and reflect everyone’s lives in the library collection.”\n\nPolls have generally found broad skepticism about the new classroom and library restrictions. A recent CBS survey found that more than four-fifths of Americans opposed banning books because they criticized American history or discussed race. A recent Grinnell College national poll found more than 70% of Americans trusted school officials to decide what materials were appropriate for their libraries. In a recent CNN poll, only about 1 in 6 adults thought parents should have the principal say on how race is taught in schools.\n\nOne element is these (conservative) parents vs. all the other parents, and the other is the parents vs. the students. I don’t think it’s at all clear parents have rights to prevent their children from being exposed to the world. Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education at PEN America\n\nOpponents of the restrictive measures are trying to organize greater resistance to them. Red Wine and Blue, a nationwide group of suburban Democratic-leaning women fighting the red-state proposals, has organized a nationwide “read-in” of banned books on Thursday hosted by Dolly Parton’s sister Stella that features the authors of targeted books such as “I Am Rosa Parks” and “Heather Has Two Mommies.” That same day, a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee is holding a hearing on the book ban efforts, which could signal a turn toward greater attention to the issue from national Democrats.\n\n“After a long time of banging my head on the kitchen counter, I do feel like there’s progress and we are seeing some results,” says Katie Paris, Red Wine and Blue’s founder.\n\nParis says thousands of women have gone through the group’s training, which is designed to counter the organizing of the conservative organizations supporting the restrictions, such as Moms for Liberty. Though the number of proposed book bans continues to rise, Paris says, a smaller share of them have been approved in recent months by districts or school administrators, according to the group’s figures. In several cases, others note, students themselves are taking a more visible role in opposing these measures – as in the widespread walkouts in Florida against the “don’t say gay” bill and a lawsuit brought by Missouri students against a book ban in their school.\n\n“One element is these (conservative) parents vs. all the other parents, and the other is the parents vs. the students,” says Friedman. “I don’t think it’s at all clear parents have rights to prevent their children from being exposed to the world.”\n\nStill, even with occasional setbacks, the drive to control the flow of information to young people is demonstrating enormous energy in red states. With Congress unlikely to pass any national legislation combating this trend, opponents’ best chance to slow the tide are legal challenges, some of which are already working through the courts. In the 1982 Pico decision upholding the First Amendment rights of students, the Supreme Court ruled, as the ACLU’s Eidelman puts it, “schools cannot remove books from their shelves merely because they disagree with the ideas expressed in those books.”\n\nYet many observers note it’s unclear whether this more conservative Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority would uphold that standard. What is clear is that more of the red states appear intent on testing the boundaries of what the Supreme Court will allow through new laws facilitating the banning of books from school, or potentially even public, libraries.\n\n“This is one of the key characteristics of the era in which we live,” says Paris. “I think we’ve had to learn there are no bounds. That is what makes this a fight for democracy. This isn’t just a culture war sideshow.”", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/republicans-civil-liberties-abortion-voting-race/index.html", "title": "Red states are remaking the civil liberties landscape | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFrom Florida, Georgia and Tennessee through Texas, South Dakota and Montana, Republican-controlled states are approving a torrent of culturally conservative hot-button legislation at a pace unmatched in recent times, and probably ever.\n\nStates where the GOP controls both the governorship and state legislature are moving in unprecedented numbers to restrict abortion, limit access to voting, ban books, retrench transgender rights and constrain teachers’ ability to discuss race, gender and sexual orientation at public K-12 schools and increasingly at public colleges and universities.\n\nMany of the same states are simultaneously rescinding restrictions on gun ownership, stiffening penalties for people engaged in unruly public protests and, in a new twist, empowering private citizens to bring lawsuits to enforce many of these initiatives, as Texas Republicans did on their recent law banning abortion after about six weeks.\n\nRapidly spreading from state to state, these Republican-driven initiatives reflect the GOP coalition’s shifting center of gravity away from the small-government, low-tax agenda that long topped its priorities toward the roiling cultural anxieties and resentments that have become central to its messaging, especially in the Donald Trump era.\n\nYou have an emerging generation that is multiracial, multicultural, where no single ethnic or racial group is the majority, and it has struck an existential fear within those who are used to controlling everything, from the boardroom to the White House. So what we are seeing here is people playing on that fear of that graying generation that votes with regularity and feels as though something is slipping away. Nadine Smith, executive director, Equality Florida\n\nMore fundamentally, these red state moves are remaking the American civil liberties landscape at breathtaking speed – and with little national attention to their cumulative effect. Taken together, these moves amount to a stark reversal of what many legal scholars call the “rights revolution” beginning in the 1960s, in which Congress and especially the Supreme Court expanded the number of rights available to all Americans nationwide and struck down state laws that constricted those rights on issues from racial segregation to abortion and same-sex marriage. In many ways, the red states are attempting to tilt the nation back toward a pre-1960s model, when the basic civil rights and civil liberties available to Americans diverged far more depending on where they lived.\n\nFurther, with GOP senators wielding the filibuster and the Republican-appointed majority on the Supreme Court both providing powerful air cover for this red state ground offensive, Democrats and groups focused on defending civil rights, abortion rights and LGBTQ rights, among other issues, have not yet found any effective means of slowing the conservative onslaught. Even as the nation grows more racially, religiously and culturally diverse than ever, that means roughly half the states are on track to impose rules across this broad array of cultural flashpoints that primarily reflect the demands of one shrinking group: conservative and often older White Christians.\n\n“You have an emerging generation that is multiracial, multicultural, where no single ethnic or racial group is the majority, and it has struck an existential fear within those who are used to controlling everything, from the boardroom to the White House,” says Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, an LGBTQ advocacy group battling against the “don’t say gay” proposals from Florida Republicans that would severely restrict how teachers can talk about sexual orientation or gender identity in the classroom. “So what we are seeing here is people playing on that fear of that graying generation that votes with regularity and feels as though something is slipping away.”\n\nAnti-abortion activists protest outside of a Planned Parenthood clinic on January 20, 2022, in Washington. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nConservatives praise the widening divergence among the states on this broad array of issues as a vindication of the belief among the nation’s founders that states should have great leeway to set their own courses – a belief embodied in the 10th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\n“This is going to be a new test of federalism,” Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action, a conservative group that has promoted some of the conservative state initiatives, told me in a 2021 interview. “But I think it’s a good thing, and it’s largely how the founders envisioned this.”\n\nA wide array of groups that promote civil rights and liberties, however, see the red state moves as a fundamental assault on constitutional rights that should be available nationwide to all Americans.\n\n“We are absolutely seeing what feels like two countries – opposed on so many fundamental questions,” Deborah Archer, a professor at the New York University Law School and president of the American Civil Liberties Union, told me in an email. “That’s the reality we are facing with abortion rights – pregnant people with fundamentally different protection of their Constitutional rights based on geography. That’s the reality we may face with voting rights – Black voters with fundamentally different rights based on geography. That’s the reality we are facing with the censorship of discussions about race in the classroom – children getting wildly different opportunities to learn about the history and reality of racism and racial inequality based on geography.”\n\nThe one undisputed point: On a panoramic range of volatile issues revolving around cultural values and racial equity, Republican-controlled states are advancing the most aggressive conservative agenda in memory. In a comment echoed to me by analysts in other states, political scientist Richard Murray, a senior researcher at the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston, described last year’s Texas state legislative session as “the most extreme session in modern Texas history. I’ve been here since 1966 and nothing was comparable in all of those years.”\n\nFronts in the fight\n\nThe red state offensive is advancing across a wide range of fronts, including:\n\nAbortion: Anticipating that the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority later this year will strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion, GOP-controlled states are approving a raft of new restrictions on the procedure. Seven states in 2021 passed laws retrenching access to abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute; that list included total bans that Texas and Oklahoma approved to go into effect if the high court allows. Texas also passed its separate law banning abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, usually around six weeks of pregnancy, and empowering citizens to sue anyone involved in providing one; five GOP-appointed Supreme Court justices, over the vehement objections of Chief Justice John Roberts and the three Democratic appointees, have refused to block implementation of that law while lower courts debate its constitutionality.\n\nIn all, Guttmacher calculated, states approved 108 abortion restrictions of some sort in 2021 (such as constraints on access to abortion medication). The group says that’s by far the most that have been approved in any single year since Roe. And the wave has not yet crested: Just this month, GOP-controlled legislatures in Florida, West Virginia and Arizona, anticipating that the GOP Supreme Court majority will overturn Roe, have advanced bills to ban abortion after 15 weeks.\n\nVoting: Laws making it more difficult to vote, and in several cases increasing the opportunity for Republican partisans to exert more influence over election administration and vote tabulation, have been probably the most visible component of the red state push. In 2021, 19 states – including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Montana and Texas – passed a total of 34 laws restricting access to voting, according to tabulations by the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School. The center counts 250 bills to further restrict voting access that have been introduced this year or carried over from last year’s session and another 41 that could erode the integrity of election administration. Meanwhile, the new voter identification requirements in Texas have resulted in the rejection of so many mail ballots that local Democratic officials in Harris County have asked the US Justice Department to intervene.\n\nEducation: Nothing has spread more rapidly across the red states than the laws – dubbed “gag orders” by critics – restricting how public school K-12 teachers can talk about current and historic racial and gender inequities. In 2021, nine Republican-controlled states passed laws establishing such restrictions and four others imposed them through executive branch actions. This year, according to PEN America, a free-speech group founded by prominent authors, 112 similar bills have been introduced in 34 states.\n\nVariations on the theme are multiplying: Virginia’s newly elected Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, for instance, has created a “tip line” that residents can use to complain about teachers discussing supposedly “divisive” concepts. Iowa’s Republican-controlled legislature is considering legislation to install cameras in every classroom so that parents or others can monitor what teachers are saying.\n\nThis push to control what students are taught is also broadening in several ways. On one front, more of the red state bills would impose restrictions not only on K-12 teachers, but also on professors in public colleges and universities; PEN counts 48 such bills pending. Last week, Texas’ Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the leader of the state’s social conservatives, said he will push legislation to both end tenure for new hires at the University of Texas and make it easier to revoke tenure for professors who teach critical race theory, an academic analysis that explores structural racism.\n\nOn another front, Republican-controlled states are pushing beyond race and gender inequities to advance legislation that limits how public schools discuss sexual orientation and gender identity or bars it completely for younger students. The most prominent of these bills – the Florida legislation that critics have dubbed the “don’t say gay” bill – could receive approval from the full state House of Representatives this week, with the enthusiastic support of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. In all, nine states are considering 15 similar bills, according to PEN America.\n\nOn yet another front, more states and local school districts are banning books, including many by authors who are racial minorities or who identify as LGBTQ: The American Library Association told me in an email that its Office for Intellectual Freedom has received more than 330 reports of attempted book bans from just September through November 2021. Finally, several of the red state education proposals borrow from the new Texas abortion statute and empower private citizens to sue schools or school districts if they object to how teachers discuss the restricted topics.\n\nLGBTQ rights: The Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for the LGBTQ community, says 10 states in 2021 adopted 26 bills restricting their rights. One of the most common themes has been legislation prohibiting transgender girls and women from participating in high school and often college-level sports; among the eight states that approved such bans in 2021 were Arkansas, Florida, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. In Republican-controlled states, this wave also shows no sign of cresting: South Dakota recently approved its own ban, proposals are advancing in Kentucky and Utah, and the Human Rights Campaign counts 56 sports bans pending across the states.\n\nOn a parallel track, Tennessee last year approved legislation requiring students to use the bathrooms for their genders at birth, and Arkansas’ GOP-controlled legislature overrode a veto from Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to approve the nation’s first law prohibiting gender-affirming medical care for transgender people below age 18; Tennessee also approved such a ban. Texas’ GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton issued an opinion last Friday that such treatments constituted “child abuse” under Texas law.\n\nThe left with their defund the police, the mask mandate in schools and all that kind of stuff opened the door. People got tired of it. They got sick of it, and they are fighting back. They are not sitting back and just saying no. They are organizing and … they are pushing back aggressively. They feel it’s been in their face, so [if it’s] ‘good for the goose, good for the gander.’ Bill Miller, lobbyist and political consultant in Texas\n\nProtest rights: In the aftermath of 2020’s massive Black Lives Matter demonstrations, multiple Republican-controlled states – including Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas – have approved laws stiffening penalties on protesters accused of damaging property. In a few cases, red states have also approved laws immunizing drivers who run over protesters if they are caught in demonstrations. The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, which tracks these proposals, counts more than a dozen that have been approved since 2020, with 17 more pending this year, preponderantly in Republican-controlled states.\n\nGun rights: In sharp contrast to the laws limiting rights across all the arenas discussed above, red states are rushing to loosen restrictions on gun owners. In 2021, five Republican-controlled states, including Montana, Tennessee and Texas, eliminated requirements for gun owners to receive permits or undergo training before being allowed to carry concealed handguns – or in some cases before being allowed to openly carry weapons, according to tracking by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group. This year the group says seven more Republican-controlled states are moving to eliminate such requirements; three of them (Georgia, Indiana and South Carolina) would allow the open carrying of handguns without any training or permitting.\n\nThe sweep of this challenge has left civil rights and liberties groups gasping. “What is disturbing is how … many of the legal protections are falling at the same time,” says Archer, the ACLU president. “We have seen the protection of our civil rights and civil liberties being chipped away, death by a thousand cuts. Today, we are seeing more protections torn down all at once.”\n\nDemocrats in Washington have found no effective response. The House has passed legislation to reverse many of the state voting restrictions and to codify the national right to abortion, but a Republican Senate filibuster blocked the former last month and is expected to similarly doom the latter next week.\n\nNeither the Biden administration nor congressional Democrats have focused much attention on the other state restrictions (particularly the educational “gag orders”), much less devised an approach to resist them. While the red state offensive has advanced, Democrats have been much more consumed by the critique from party centrists that liberals are pushing excessively “woke” policies on public safety and schooling.\n\nWhy this is happening, and why now\n\nMultiple factors probably explain why Republican-controlled states are simultaneously moving so quickly across so many fronts. Anderson, from Heritage Action, says a key factor is that conservative activists have shifted their attention more to state and local governments. That shift has occurred, she says, both because they realize they have few opportunities to advance their priorities at the national level while Democrats control the White House and Congress and also because the Covid-19 crisis made them realize that local decisions “probably impact their day-to-day [life] more than even federal.”\n\nBill Miller, a lobbyist and political consultant who has worked for both parties in Texas, says the hard push from social conservatives there reflects a long-gestating backlash on the right to the left’s efforts to advance socially liberal causes, such as more explicit discussion of racial issues in the schools.\n\n“The left with their defund the police, the mask mandate in schools and all that kind of stuff opened the door,” he says in a view echoed by Anderson. “People got tired of it. They got sick of it, and they are fighting back. They are not sitting back and just saying no. They are organizing and … they are pushing back aggressively. They feel it’s been in their face, so [if it’s] ‘good for the goose, good for the gander.’ “\n\nOthers see the key factor as the shifting internal dynamics of the Republican coalition. Particularly in the Trump era, the GOP has become more dominant among the White voters who are the most uneasy about cultural and demographic change. Those voters, energized by Trump, are creating enormous demand in the party for hardline policies on race and culture.\n\nThere is definitely a difference between action and words. Lamenting the state of affairs in the Republican Party at a cocktail reception is not the necessary action that we need. … These folks are hoping they will wake up from this bad dream, but the better medicine is for them to pinch themselves that they are not dreaming. Democratic Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer\n\nThe widespread gerrymandering of state legislative disticts, experts say, has magnified the influence of those voters because it means that almost all GOP lawmakers are running in staunchly conservative districts where they face more risk of losing primaries to opponents on their right than they do of losing general elections to opponents on their left. Murray, the Texas political scientist, says Republican primaries there typically attract only about one-fourth as many voters as the party wins in presidential general elections and those who do turn out “are disproportionately the cultural warriors.”\n\nOther institutional factors have propelled the rapid dispersion of these ideas across red states. Conservative groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council and Heritage Action energetically encourage Republican legislators to adopt many of these proposals; Heritage, for instance, recently issued a strategy memo urging red state legislatures “to embrace the culture war” over the teaching of race and sexual orientation as a means of building support for vouchers that would provide parents public funds to send their kids to private schools, a perennial goal on the right.\n\nThe increasing reliance of right-leaning voters on explicitly conservative media sources that relentlessly stoke cultural and racial grievance, from Fox to talk radio, also provides a powerful transmission belt.\n\n“The nationalization of media, aided by social media and the internet, is part of the story,” says Jake Grumbach, a political scientist at the University of Washington and author of an upcoming book on the polarization of state policy. “This kind of environment means that agendas can be set, with similar talking points and framing, across states very quickly.”\n\nAnother factor has been the indications from the Republican majority on the Supreme Court that it is unlikely to resist many of these red state initiatives. The red states “feel completely emboldened by the Supreme Court,” says Jessica Post, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which focuses on state legislative races. In particular, she believes, the court’s “lack of action on the Texas case” authorizing private lawsuits against abortions “lit a wildfire of socially conservative legislation.”\n\nAlso critical, many analysts say, is the erosion of resistance from business groups. Under pressure from employees and consumers, business groups often pushed back forcefully during the early stages of this wave – for instance, with boycotts of North Carolina after Republicans there passed the original “bathroom bill” for transgender individuals in 2016.\n\nBut apart from modest public criticism of some of the voting laws, business has mostly stood to the side amid this new spasm of socially conservative legislation – even, critics note, when the bills directly contradict their public claims to support LGBTQ rights or racial equity. The journalist and activist Judd Legum, for instance, has documented that multiple companies that publicly proclaim their support for LGBTQ rights are heavily contributing to the Florida Republican legislators pushing the “don’t say gay” bill.\n\n“There is definitely a difference between action and words,” says Democratic Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer. “Lamenting the state of affairs in the Republican Party at a cocktail reception is not the necessary action that we need. … These folks are hoping they will wake up from this bad dream, but the better medicine is for them to pinch themselves that they are not dreaming.”\n\nRepublicans in these states also may have been emboldened because Democrats, after making gains in 2018, failed to flip any of the state legislative chambers they targeted in 2020. Now Republicans have been able to fortify their legislative majorities in many states with strong gerrymanders, while Democrats face the headwind of diminished approval ratings for President Joe Biden even among the suburban voters who powered their state-level wins during the Trump years.\n\nLike many red state GOP strategists, Austin-based Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak says, “I do not expect to see a suburban revolt due to the legislature’s [social issue] priorities.” He predicts that Republicans will actually gain in those areas “due to parental anger at school and Covid overreach.”\n\nBut perhaps the most powerful reason for this surge of culturally conservative legislation is the force and immediacy of the wave it seeks to counter. The evidence of irreversible demographic and cultural change continues to accumulate: The 2020 census, for the first time, recorded that kids of color now constitute a majority of the nation’s under-18 population; Gallup recently reported that a stunning one-fifth of Generation Z (as well as about 1 in 10 millennials) identifies as LGBTQ; and the latest figures from the Public Religion Research Institute show that White Christians, long the nation’s majority, now compose only a little more than two-fifths of the population.\n\nAll of that, critics argue, has created a sense of urgency for GOP state legislators responding to voters in their coalition uneasy about the “more diverse” future “that is around the corner,” as Martinez Fischer puts it. An America in which no single group makes up a majority “is arriving, and so there’s only two paths,” says Smith of Equality Florida. “One is division, chaos, suppression, censorship, surveillance and anti-immigrant sentiment. The alternative is a [way] forward, where regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation, there is a path here for everyone.”\n\nThe striking implication of the GOP’s ongoing revolution from below is that the coming decade may see the nation’s 50 states diverge between those two paths more than they have at any point since the Supreme Court and Congress began nationalizing more civil rights and liberties over half a century ago.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/09/kentucky-legislature-general-assembly-bills-to-watch-2024/72014842007/", "title": "Kentucky legislature: General Assembly bills to watch in 2024", "text": "The 2024 General Assembly will help shape the future of Kentucky, with a two-year budget and several other key pieces of legislation set to be heard in Frankfort before potentially going into law.\n\nTo help you follow the action, we've assembled this list of noteworthy bills.

This double emergence is the first time this has happened in 221 years. According to ScienceAlert.com, this won't happen again until 2245.\n\nOf all the states where the broods will emerge this year, they are expected to overlap in Illinois and Indiana.\n\nYou may remember the last brood of cicadas, Brood X, which emerged in the summer of 2021 across multiple Eastern, Southern and Midwestern states.\n\nHere's what to know about this year's two cicada broods.\n\nWhat are Brood XIX cicadas?\n\nBrood XIX (19) is estimated to emerge in these states beginning mid-May and lasting through late June:\n\nAlabama.\n\nArkansas.\n\nGeorgia.\n\nIllinois.\n\nIndiana.\n\nKentucky.\n\nLouisiana.\n\nMississippi.\n\nMissouri.\n\nNorth Carolina.\n\nOklahoma.\n\nSouth Carolina.\n\nTennessee.\n\nVirginia.\n\nThe brood last emerged in 2011, and has a 13-year life cycle.\n\nAccording to Cicada Mania, they will begin to emerge when the soil 8 inches underground reaches 64 degrees, and are often triggered by a warm rain.\n\nWhat are Brood XIII cicadas?\n\nBrood XIII (13) will emerge these states in mid-May and ending in late June:\n\nIllinois.\n\nIndiana.\n\nIowa.\n\nWisconsin.\n\nThe brood may also appear in Michigan, Cicada Mania says. Like Brood XIX, they will begin to emerge when the soil 8 inches underground reaches 64 degrees, and are often triggered by a warm rain.\n\nUnlike the other brood, these cicadas have a 17-year life cycle, and last emerged in 2007.\n\nWhat is the life cycle of a cicada?\n\nCicadas have the longest life cycle of any insect, waiting 13 or 17 years to emerge, but once they're above ground, things move pretty fast. Female cicadas lay eggs in trees, which drop to the ground and burrow, waiting for years to emerge, depending on their brood.\n\nOnce they emerge, adults cicadas will mate, lay millions of eggs and die, all in about five weeks.\n\nWhat is the difference between annual and periodical cicadas?\n\nThere are two types of cicadas that are common in Eastern U.S. states: Annual and periodical cicadas. Annual cicadas emerge every year, while periodical cicadas emerge every 13 or 17 years, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nWhat is a brood?\n\nAccording to the University of Connecticut, broods are classified as \"all periodical cicadas of the same life cycle type that emerge in a given year.\"\n\nA brood of cicadas is made up of different species of the insect that have separate evolutionary histories. These species may have joined the brood at different times or from different sources. These different species are lumped together under the brood because they are in the same region and emerge on a common schedule.\n\nThe two cicada broods set to emerge this summer are both periodical broods, which the University of Connecticut says fits together \"like puzzle pieces, in both time and space.\"\n\nWhy do cicadas make so much noise?\n\nYou'll have to thank the male cicadas for all that screeching. Male cicadas synchronize their calls and produce congregational songs, according to Britannica, which establish territory and attract females. There is also a courting call that they make before mating.\n\nUnluckily for us, the 13-year and 17-year brood cicadas are the loudest, partially because of the sheer number of them that emerge at once.\n\nAre cicadas harmful to humans or pets?\n\nCicadas are not harmful to humans, pets, household gardens or crops, the EPA says, and despite their overwhelming numbers, can actually provide a few environmental benefits.\n\nThey provide a valuable food source for birds or other predators, can aerate lawns, improve water filtration and add nutrients into the soil as they decompose.\n\nAre cicadas dangerous?Here's what's fact and fiction with cicada bites, stings and more.\n\nContributing: Joyce Orlando, Nashville Tennessean", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/01/25/map-states-brood-of-cicadas-will-emerge/72354174007/", "title": "Cicada map: States where historic broods will emerge this spring", "text": "More than a dozen states across the U.S. are set for a once-in-a-lifetime experience this spring, though it's one most people would probably prefer to do without.\n\nThis year, 16 states across parts of the South and the Midwest will see the emergence of two different cicada groups in tandem, a crossover that hasn't happened in 221 years and won't again until 2245.\n\nPeriodic cicadas, the winged insects best known for the distinctive screeching and clicking noise that males make when attempting to attract females, have an abnormally long life cycle, with different groups lying dormant for 13 to 17 years before emerging to reproduce, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThese groups, or broods, are categorized based on the length of this life cycle, with the 13-year group dubbed Brood XIX and the 17-year group called Brood XIII.\n\nMore often than not, the broods emerge at different times, quickly mating, laying millions of eggs and then dying within a roughly five-week period. In that time, female cicadas lay up to 400 eggs, which start in trees then drop to the ground and burrow in for their long wait.\n\nThis year, however, both massive broods will emerge simultaneously, starting in mid-May and ending in late June.\n\nSee the map of states where the different cicada broods will emerge\n\nAffected states include Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Virginia.\n\nCicadas 2024:2 broods to emerge together in US for first time in over 200 years\n\nShould I be concerned about cicadas?\n\nCicadas don't carry disease, bite or sting, but they also cannot be effectively controlled by pesticides. For those in affected states, this may mean a particularly loud spring and early summer to come with a side of sweeping bug corpses off of sidewalks, roads and driveways.\n\nThey can be harmful to the growth of some young trees but can also be beneficial to the ecosystem's health, aerating soil and providing nutrients.\n\nOf course, that doesn't make their mating calls, which can produce sounds as high as least 90 decibels, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, any more pleasant to the human year.

While underground in the 13 or 17-year period, life continues.\n\n“When they went underground, it might have been a forest or open landscape,” Skalicky said. “In the meantime, they could have a parking lot built on top of them or a home or a highway, which obviously impacts their emergence.”\n\nMore:Bears are on the move in Missouri.

So it would come as no surprise that the maps were incomplete, said Edwards with Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania.\n\nBut with tens of millions of Brood X cicadas set to reemerge this year, 17 years later, there will be something a little different: Everyday citizens can take part in recording this event in history.\n\nCitizen science is going to be a particular focus this year, said Elizabeth Barnes, an exotic forest pest educator at Purdue University.\n\n\"That's because 17 years ago, we didn’t have the same ability we do today where everyone has a smartphone and can take a picture of the cicada and log where they are,\" she said. \"This will let us see if there are different pockets of cicadas in areas we didn’t previously know.\"\n\nThe swarms of red-eyed bugs that are soon to be buzzing through the air have some enthralled, some intrigued, some disgusted and some terrified — but everyone can help better understand the periodical creatures.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the importance of getting involved, or how to do it, keep reading.\n\nPast citizen science efforts\n\nCitizen science has been part of periodical cicada emergences since the very beginning, said John Cooley, an ecology and evolutionary biology professor at University of Connecticut who studies cicadas.\n\n\"Previously it happened by postcards, reports to agents in extension offices, telephone calls, etc.,\" Cooley said.\n\nEdwards echoed that, describing how researchers used to send postcards to city workers in different parts of the state, asking them to send back the postcard with some information if they saw cicadas.\n\nBut that method created gaps in information about where exactly the cicadas came out, he said.\n\n\"That's why you see these super inaccurate maps that might show the entire state of Indiana as being covered with one big wall of cicadas,\" Edwards said, \"because people didn't really keep very close records and they weren't really mapped in a way that the public could have access to.\"\n\nCicada swarm: Cicadas turned into zombies and cicada killer wasps, here's 10 things to know about Brood X\n\nThen in the 2004 emergence, researchers asked people to send email reports, Cooley said: \"But that turned out to be a big mistake because we got an awful lot of emails,\" but didn't have a good way to catalog them.\n\nNearly a decade later, a website was developed where people could input addresses on a map for emergences of other cicada broods across the country. That worked for a period of time, until the last couple years.\n\n\"Now it's an app,\" Cooley said. \"Citizen science has been there from the beginning, but more and more people get involved as the technology gets more and more convenient.\"\n\nPut on your citizen science cap\n\nThe two main apps that will be used this year are called Cicada Safari and iNaturalist. Cicada Safari is out of Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, and iNaturalist is a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society.\n\nBoth apps are free and are available on both iPhone and Android devices. The first step is simple: Download either or both apps. You will need to sign up and when prompted, also enable your phone to record the date and location of where you take you cicada photographs.\n\nYou will take your photographs through the app, and can also enable your microphone to be able to record and log the cicada's characteristic song.\n\nThat photograph will serve as a \"voucher specimen,\" as the Cicada Safari app calls it. It will confirm that you saw a cicada (or many), and help researchers identify its species as well as when and where your observation occurred.\n\nNow it's time to go on the hunt! Whenever you spot one, make sure you take as sharp and close up of a photograph as possible so researchers can make out distinguishing features — don't be afraid to get close, they don't bite or sting. Then submit the photo for verification.\n\nCitizen scientists can also check out the maps on the app to see where other sightings have been reported. Whether you're out on a walk or hike, or just relaxing in your own backyard, it takes no more than a minute to participate in this \"unprecedented biological phenomena.\"\n\nWhy citizen science is important\n\nWith more and more people getting involved, as Cooley said, the science and information keeps getting better and better.\n\nEdwards agrees, adding that citizen science is particularly helpful in situations like this when the window for research and to gather data is so small: Just about six weeks every 17 years.\n\n\"Science is learning a ton from the public, because there's not enough scientists to get this type of information,\" the Pennsylvania professor said. \"But with the help of the public, we can have super detailed maps that were completely not possible before. You know 17 years ago, we all had flip phones.\"\n\nThe cicada expert recalls a time during a past emergence for a different brood that scientists actually discovered a whole new area of cicadas that they didn't know about. That discovery was because of citizen scientists that started to notice large numbers of cicadas coming out around a city that was not previously known to be home to cicadas.\n\nIn Indiana, cicadas are largely thought to exist predominantly in the southern and central parts of the state, said Barnes with Purdue University. But this year's citizen science effort could help researchers get a better idea of how much of a presence cicadas actually have in the northern part of the state.\n\nCicada swarm: Your trees may be at risk from cicadas, here's how to protect them\n\nWith more detailed information, that means scientists will have a better idea of where to expect Brood X cicadas during their next emergence in 2038. Cicadas usually lay their eggs close to where they emerge.\n\nSuch better records will help researchers see, over the long-term, what is happening to cicada populations, Edwards said. That includes where they are growing, where they are shrinking, and if they've migrated at all.\n\n\"That's going to be a really great kind of canary in the coal mine, long-term measure of environmental health,\" Edwards said. \"And this citizen science is just incredibly awesome because we can crowdsource where the cicadas are actually coming out.\"\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Sarah Bowman at 317-444-6129 or email at sarah.bowman@indystar.com.

The spotted lanternfly may be running out of steam or simply experiencing an off year. Populations in 2023 have been lower than in each of the last two years, Hamilton said.\n\n\"Possible reasons could be the hot dry weather we had last summer, the severe cold we had in January or the relatively warm weather we had during most of the winter,\" he said. \"It could also be that the high populations have severely damaged or killed their host plants, causing them to move on.\"\n\nWhere did the spotted lanternfly come from?\n\nHarmless to people and pets, yet destructive to plants, the spotted lanternfly made its way into the United States from Asia via Pennsylvania, where established colonies were first reported in 2014. In 2018, the species made a home in New Jersey. Since, it has since spread statewide.\n\nThis past winter, New Jersey Department of Agriculture officials added the last eight of the state's 21 counties into their spotted lantern quarantine zone. Accompanying regulations require residents to check outdoor items, such as building materials, firewood and camping gear, for live insects or egg masses prior to moving them outside the quarantine area.\n\nHow expensive is it to live in New Jersey? We break it down, state-by-state\n\nThe quarantine coupled with its educational campaign and herbicide treatments on the tree of heaven have shown promise in combating the spotted lanternfly, said Anne Nielsen, also an entomologist at Rutgers. Still, to manage the species over the long term, Nielsen said a multi-stage approach is required. That could mean future biological control with species that target lanternflies, she said. Natural predators, such as spiders, birds and the praying mantis, have proven formidable.\n\nThough poor-flying, the spotted lanternfly has already spread to much of the Northeast and established colonies as far west as Indiana, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture records. To help reduce the spread, officials at the department's spotted lanternfly unit this June released a five-year plan that prioritizes strategies to limit the insect's advancement, develop a unified educational campaign and support scientific research to manage the species and its impacts.\n\nWhy is the spotted lanternfly bad?\n\nOutside of being a widespread annoyance, the spotted lanternfly's ability to devastate the agricultural industry has been a major concern in New Jersey. The insect feeds on plants and leaves covered in sugary waste that attracts other insects and molds. Thus far, it has found hosts in key cash crops, including grapes, apples, hops and walnuts. Its preferred food, however, is sap from another invasive and locally prevalent species from Asia, the tree of heaven, according to USDA records.\n\nThis new Jersey City restaurant has stunning views and 'coastal' menu from celeb chef\n\nNielsen said the insect has a wider range of domestic host species than experts first expected. Most of the more than 70 species are hardwood trees. As a result, Nielsen said the spotted lanternfly’s impact on agriculture has not been as widespread as initially predicted.\n\n\"We are seeing impacts to grape production and some nursery crops, but agricultural impacts are mostly limited to these commodities,\" she said.\n\nIn the more immediate future, control efforts will likely involve trapping for spotted lanternflies in their nymphal stage on preferred host trees: the red maple, black walnut and tree of heaven, Nielsen said.\n\n\"The United States Department of Agriculture-developed circle trap is easy to make and can remove thousands of young nymphs,\" she said. \"Adult management likely requires insecticide treatment by trained professionals on hardwood trees and by commercial grape growers. Scraping of egg masses may help but will only remove about 10% to 20% of eggs on a tree.\"\n\nEgg masses typically begin to appear in September and, unlike the adults, survive the winter. The egg masses can produce about 30 to 50 nymphs that hatch in late April or early May and grow to adulthood by late July or early August. Most of New Jersey's spotted lanternfly are now in the adult stage, Hamilton said.\n\nWhat kills spotted lanternfly?\n\nTo remove the insects, a variety of tactics have been employed throughout the region this year. They include removing the insects with vacuums and blasting egg masses with power washers. Vineyards outside of New Jersey are hiring professionals to administer insecticides, such as natural neem oil, to kill the insects after they hatch.\n\nEradicating an invasive species with a wide range of hosts is a difficult task, Nielsen said. Controlling and managing the population will likely be required in the extended future, she said.\n\nNorth Jersey Simon mall owner lowers annual forecast for net income\n\n\"We will have years of high populations and years of low populations, but this is likely a pest that will remain at some level in our landscape, farms and yards for many years,\" Nielsen said. \"It is hoped that effective biological control solutions will be identified and this will provide long-term control.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/27/brood-x-cicadas-2021-climate-change-deforestation/7463959002/", "title": "Will cicadas survive threats from climate change and deforestation?", "text": "Periodical cicadas date back to the time when humans split from the apes, according to researchers, making them more than 5 million years old. So it goes without saying that they’ve seen and survived changes to the climate and their habitat.\n\nBut what about severe and rapid climate change? Or sweeping and swift development and deforestation?\n\nResearchers are studying these questions in an effort to unlock the mystery that are periodical cicadas. They hope that this year’s emergence of Brood X – one of the largest populations of periodical cicadas expected to appear across 15 states for the first time in 17 years – will provide one more piece to the puzzle.\n\nOne thing is clear, however: Humanity poses a threat to these ancient red-eyed bugs, and one of nature’s most dependable delegates. As people have moved in, the cicadas are being forced out.\n\n“Anything that threatens the forest will threaten cicadas,” said Cliff Sadof, a Purdue University researcher who studies cicadas. “That could be climate change. It could be development.”\n\nEither way, they are human-made issues.\n\nPeriodical cicadas – some on 13-year cycles and others, such as Brood X, emerging every 17 years – spend the majority of their lives underground sipping the sap of tree roots. This is different from their annual cousins, which are green and a bit smaller, that appear every year or so.\n\nThe periodical critters make their aboveground, clockworklike debut for only a few weeks to mate before dying. Things kicked off in Tennessee and Georgia a couple of weeks ago, and they've just recently made their Midwest debut.\n\nTheir only evolutionary defense is their numbers: At sometimes more than a million cicadas per acre, predators can’t possibly eat them all, meaning many will survive to reproduce. Still, they don’t stand a chance when the trees they rely on face harsher seasons or a saw blade.\n\nCicadas:Tens of millions of cicadas are coming to Indiana. Here's how you can help track them.\n\nIn just the past century, cicadas have all but disappeared from certain historical breeding grounds as forests made way for development. Other groups of cicadas are emerging years early and without protection in numbers, which many scientists attribute to warmer summers and harsher winters that disrupts the cicadas' sense of timing.\n\n“We have habitat preservation, which is the conservation issue,” Sadof said. “And we’ve got climate change, which is the timing issue.”\n\nThe future of periodical cicadas hangs in the balance.\n\nDevelopment drives cicada demise\n\nEven though the various cicada broods populate pockets across nearly one-third of the continental United States, they claimed a far more vast territory before the arrival of European settlers. Hundreds of years ago, almost every acre of land buzzed with the insect’s shrill chirp. Now, many places are silent.\n\n“The range of cicadas that we see now is a fraction of what it would have been, when the Native Americans were the only people around,” said Martin Edwards, a professor of biology at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania. “And that was before so many of our forests were cleared for farming and for wood.”\n\nThere’s no secret to how that works: If the forests in which the cicadas live are cut down, the cicadas themselves are doomed.\n\nCicada nymphs are actually busy feeding the whole time they are underground, Edwards said, “they’re not just sleeping or inert.” The roots of trees and plants have fluid flowing through them that cicadas sip out with a straw-like tongue, growing bigger over the years until it’s their time to tunnel out.\n\n“So if the trees are gone,” Edwards said, “there they go, as well.”\n\nBut 17 years is a long time, and the world above is less patient.\n\nAs trees are felled for roads and buildings, cicadas get trapped underground. That’s what happened in Long Island – once New York State’s last remaining stronghold and the country’s easternmost domain for Brood X. And more than 30 years ago, the island’s air vibrated with the deafening shrill of thousands of chirping cicadas.\n\nHowever, the population has declined over the decades and had all but vanished during the brood’s most recent 2004 emergence. One Long Island location where the insects once thrived is now silent of cicada chirps. Instead, it is replaced with the hum of car engines and occasional honking horns. That's because it's now a “Walmart with a big parking lot,” Chris Simon, a University of Connecticut professor who has studied cicadas for decades, told The New York Times.\n\nThe coming weeks will reveal whether Long Island’s population is still hanging on, but Simon told the Times she worries they are completely gone.\n\nDipping into dangerous numbers\n\nSuch changes are not exclusive to Long Island, Edwards said. He points to other broods that have declined on Long Island as well as in New Jersey and Massachusetts, falling victim to the toll of human activity.\n\nThe issue is also a bit more subtle, and even cicadas that live near newly developed areas can suffer, according to John Cooley, an ecology and evolutionary biology professor at the University of Connecticut and a colleague of Simon’s. That’s because cicadas depend on an interconnected network of forests to survive and thrive.\n\n“If there is a break in the network, then cicadas are at risk of dipping below a threshold number,” Cooley said.\n\nThey rely on a high density to avoid being eaten by predators. If they don’t have those numbers, then they will be vulnerable to hungry birds, squirrels, dogs and other animals looking for a snack. Cooley said that threshold number is a bit of an unknown, but it’s a question researchers are trying to answer.\n\nHe points to Raccoon Grove, an Illinois nature preserve that sits 40 miles southwest of Chicago. The preserve has a history with cicadas: Previous studies at this site served as the origin for estimates that dense areas of cicadas can have as many as one to two million per acre.\n\nStill, several decades later, less than a handful of chirping cicadas could be heard during the most recent emergence. Though Raccoon Grove, as a preserve, is protected, the area around it has been encroached on and developed, Cooley said. Now, the patch is too small and too isolated from nearby wooded areas, and the population has died away.\n\n“In that situation, it wasn’t enough,” he said. “The vast number of cicadas lulls people into a sense of complacency that makes them think the critters are invulnerable. But that’s not the case.”\n\nA matter of timing\n\nWhen it comes to cicadas, much is still a mystery to scientists. Because the insects emerge only every 17 years, and previous technology was limited in recording their whereabouts – when Edwards last recorded Brood X in 2004, it consisted of driving around a forest with a GPS mapping system and a pencil – data on cicada emergences is spotty.\n\nThat said, scientists have recorded climate changes’ impacts on forests and suspect it may be affecting cicadas as well.\n\nFor one, the warming world is set to increase the frequency of major storms that, in some cases, can level entire parts of forests. The coming years are also predicted to bring increased flooding, drought and extreme heat, all of which stress trees and may result in habitat loss for cicadas in the long run.\n\n“Climate change,\" Sadof said, \"means climate chaos, basically.\"\n\nNo, they won't bite:Debunking 8 common myths about cicadas and the incoming Brood X\n\nThe changes in climate may also impact the times that cicadas emerge.\n\nScientists believe cicadas measure the seasons through the fluids they drink from trees, and use that to count the number of years before they emerge above ground. If climate change affects the weather enough that those tree fluids appear to signal two seasons instead of one, or skip a season altogether, then those cicadas may emerge at the wrong time.\n\nSometimes, enough will emerge to create a new brood – but that’s not usually the case.\n\n“Those cicadas, almost all of the time are doomed to failure,” Edwards said, “because their reproductive strategy requires huge numbers.”\n\nDave Shetlar, professor emeritus at Ohio State University, said a significant shift in climate could also cause cicada broods to shift farther north, as those regions become more temperate. There are very few periodical cicada broods in Canada, he said, but over time, more might extend in that direction. But, he added, “it has to be a real dramatic change” to cause that to happen.\n\nNot only might they shift in region, but in the date of their debut, as well. As temperatures warm from climate change, cicadas may emerge earlier in the year, said Gene Kritsky, dean of the School of Behavioral and Natural Sciences at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nThis year may be an anomaly due to a cold spell delaying the periodical cicada arrival in Ohio and Indiana. Some had even started tunneling to the surface as early as the end of April, Sadof said, before a late spring snow forced them back down. However, in other parts of the country, periodical cicadas have emerged as early as May 16 – almost two weeks earlier compared to when Brood X emerged in 1902, Kritsky said.\n\nIt’s worth noting that scientists need more data and research before they can definitively prove any of these potential connections, Edwards said.\n\n“It’s important not to draw a straight line between two things, and call it science,” Edwards said. “That being said, there’s lots of evidence where climate change has had direct effects on forest health, and cicadas are part of that forest health. They’re there; we just can’t see them.”\n\nLong-lasting impacts\n\nBrood X cicadas are aboveground for only, at most, six weeks every 17 years. So what’s the most they can be doing for the environment? A lot, it turns out.\n\nFor one, cicadas aren’t just sleeping underground during that period. They’re actually aerating the soil, which helps roots absorb water and nutrients and also reduces runoff. And during the four to six weeks that they emerge, their numbers are a natural feast for wildlife, who see population numbers boost after a summer of cicada munching.\n\nWhen cicadas die, they’re also a strong fertilizer for the same trees they just spent nearly two decades latched onto. In fact, they increase the nitrogen content in the soil by as much as 200% or 400%, said Robin Ganzert, president and CEO of animal wellbeing organization American Humane.\n\n“As we’re looking at issues of climate change and losing trees and losing so much of nature, this cycle is particularly important,” Ganzert said. “We really are adding nature’s fertilizer to our forest floors and hopefully growing many more trees to again be that counterbalance to climate change.”\n\nCoincidentally, the best way to protect cicadas is also one of the strongest tools for fighting climate change: protecting trees.\n\nCicadas can’t travel far during their lifetime, only about 50 to 100 meters or so, Sadof said. As such, even if people planted new forests to make up for old ones torn down, the likelihood of a cicada group being able to migrate to different patches of trees in one generation is unlikely. Given that their lifespans are so long, it could take centuries for them to populate a new patch of woods.\n\n“(They’re) just a lot slower,” Sadof said, “so the changes that happen are more long-lasting.”\n\nBrood X:Cicadas are here in Cincinnati. See photos of Brood X\n\nAlthough the bumbling, winged creatures pop into the public eye only once every other decade, it’s important for humans to understand the impact they’re having on their populations, Edwards said.\n\nAfter all, a cicada year has long been considered a symbol of nature’s bounty and reminder of the forest’s wellbeing.\n\n“Cicadas are in some ways a long-term barometer of environmental health,” Edwards said. “If we see the cicadas declining, then over time that tells us that something’s wrong. We need to really be paying attention.”\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Sarah Bowman at 317-444-6129 or email at sarah.bowman@indystar.com.

It was tied for second with the winter of 2015-2016 and was four-tenths of a degree from eclipsing the record set in 2001-2002.\n\nMeteorologists observe winter from Dec. 1 through Feb. 28.\n\nIt was an unusual winter, with January being the warmest of the three months, according to Robinson's report, titled \"Normally Abnormal.\"\n\nMore:Warm winter in NJ means less maple sap, and sugarhouses can't make enough syrup\n\nDecember was the coldest month by far this season. January and February's average of 40 degrees easily surpassed the next warmest average of the two months: 39 degrees in 1998.\n\nSnow totals for North Jersey\n\nNorthern New Jersey had 8.4 inches of snow through the end of February, which is more than 18 inches below normal.\n\nHowever six stations had more than a foot of snow through the end of February. Those included Vernon with 25.3 inches, Wantage with 16.4 inches, Sparta with 16.3 inches and Hardyston with 14.3 inches, all in Sussex County. In Morris County, Jefferson had 13 inches. In Warren County, Frelinghuysen had 12.1 inches.\n\nThe general lack of snow this winter could be a savings to municipalities since they won't be paying for salt used to prep roadways or overtime for plow crews. Many snowstorms are overnight and plow crews need to be on the road before morning rush hours.\n\nSussex County Administrator Ron Tappan said county calls were only about 40 percent of average. A \"call\" is when crews are sent out for plowing as requested by police or other local officials on the roads. He hasn't translated that into actual dollar savings, since those numbers — such as amount of salt delivered to storage sheds — aren't tabulated until the end of the season.\n\nAccording to Robinson's office, snow may fall from about Oct. 15 to April 30 in the highlands of northern New Jersey and from about Nov. 15 to April 15 in southern counties, so snowfall amounts could still increase.\n\nThe downside to a warm winter\n\nWhile many people may have enjoyed the winter's warm temperatures and lack of snow, Robinson said there are several drawbacks. While ski areas have been able to make snow for recreation, the warmer temperatures have disrupted the natural order of plants and animals.\n\n\"There are plants which need the cold weather to harden off. That cold weather kills some insects,\" he said. With later freezes in early winter, insects will live longer, causing more damage to fruit trees and other plants.\n\nIn addition, warmth at the end of winter may trick plants into thinking spring has arrived, causing them to develop flower buds and new growth. Then if a hard freeze comes along, many types of plants and seasonal vegetation could be destroyed.\n\n\"Cold weather is good,\" Robinson said.\n\nRanking the warmest NJ winters\n\nNine of the top 10 warmest winters in New Jersey since record-keeping began in 1895 have occurred since 1990, according to data from the Office of the State Climatologist.\n\nBelow are the average temperatures for winters observed from Dec. 1 through Feb. 28.\n\n2001-02: 38.8 2022-23: 38.5 2015-16: 38.5 2011-12: 38.3 1997-98: 38 1931/32: 37.9 2019/20: 37.7 2016/17: 37.6 1998/99: 36.2 1990/91: 36.1\n\nSpring outlook\n\nDespite a chilly start to March, the spring months will likely be slightly warmer than usual for much of the Northeast, including New Jersey, according to long-range outlook by the National Weather Service.\n\nBut Accuweather meteorologists say March could still bring more snow in the New York metropolitan area.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2013/04/02/cicada-brood-emergence/2043031/", "title": "Waiting in the wings this spring: Cicadas!", "text": "Doyle Rice, USA TODAY\n\nThis should be the biggest cicada influx since 2004\n\nThe bugs are mostly harmless%2C but they can pose a threat to tree branches\n\nCicadas are likely in New York City by May\n\nThey're baaaa-aaack! A big \"brood\" of 17-year cicadas -- which has been biding its time underground since the first Clinton administration -- is forecast to emerge from the ground this spring along the East Coast, and will pop up as far north as New York City.\n\n\"Spectacular\" and \"amazing\" are two of the words used by University of Maryland entomologist Michael Raupp to describe the East's biggest influx of the annoying but mostly harmless bugs since a separate brood emerged in 2004.\n\nThis year's \"emergence\" should be quite extensive, as the critters will likely come out all the way from the Carolinas to the Hudson Valley of New York, says John Cooley, a research scientist from the University of Connecticut.\n\n\"All the East Coast cities are in the path of the cicadas,\" says Cooley, who runs the magicicada.org website, and requests reports from people who see cicadas this spring.\n\nThe emergence could include parts or all of the New York metropolitan area, whose nearly 20 million inhabitants might have to contend with swarms of cicadas, which can number as many as 1 billion bugs per square mile. Historically, this brood has been seen in the Bronx, Cooley says, and the bugs could also come out in Central Park.\n\n\"The greater New York metro area is going to rock with cicadas,\" according to Raupp.\n\nThey should emerge in the South in late April or May and in the cooler states in the North by the latter half of May and into early June, he adds. Unfortunately, this is just in time for prime wedding season.\n\n\"The timing depends on the weather,\" says Dan Mozgai, a cicada enthusiast from Metuchen, N.J.. \"They typically emerge when the soil temperature reaches 64 degrees.\" Mozgai is the founder of the website cicadamania.com.\n\nThere are at least 15 cycles, or \"broods,\" of periodical cicadas, some of which emerge every 17 years, while others emerge every 13 years. Different broods of cicadas emerge in different parts of the eastern half of the USA in different years. Other species of cicadas show up every summer. The bugs have only been seen as far west as Texas and Oklahoma and have not been spotted in the Far West.\n\nThis year's group is known as \"Brood II.\" The previous big cicada emergence in the East was 2004's \"Brood X.\" (Like Super Bowls, entomologists like using Roman numerals to label the different broods.) Brood X will emerge again in 2021.\n\nCicadas are harmless bugs, though males can make a loud buzz when they're alarmed, and they're big enough to startle humans in return. The largest can have three-inch wingspans. Young, small trees can also be damaged when females deposit their eggs inside branches, so they can be a problem for fruit orchards, Cooley says.\n\nAn adult cicada usually lives for about two to four weeks, Mozgai says. This is a long time to wait after spending 17 years underground: They admittedly have \"a pretty dismal life,\" Cooley says. The bugs only come above ground to breed for the next batch of cicadas.\n\nAccording to the Penn State University Entomology Department, cicadas stay alive underground by drawing fluid from the roots of plants during those 17 (or 13) years.\n\nAnd they do serve a purpose: Cicadas aid their host trees by aerating the soil when they emerge, as well as by trimming weaker branches when they lay their eggs, Morzgai notes on his website. \"They also form a vital link in the food chain between trees and literally hundreds of carnivores and omnivores.\"\n\nThe uniqueness of cicadas has given them a special appeal and cultural status, Cooley writes on the magicicada.org website. \"Members of the Onondaga Nation near Syracuse maintain the oral tradition of being rescued from famine by periodical cicadas,\" he adds. \"Early European colonists viewed periodical cicadas with a mixture of religious apprehension and loathing.\"\n\nAnd who or what eats them? \"Anything with a mouth,\" says Cooley, including deer, squirrels, house pets, birds, and yes, people:\n\n\"Whether they're curious or doing it for the shock value, people are eating cicadas,\" Mozgai writes. \"Asian peoples have eaten cicadas for centuries, and there are records of Native Americans eating cicadas. I've heard they taste like asparagus, popcorn, minty shrimp, and piney shrimp.\"\n\nIf you're not into eating cicadas, you can always listen to them: In order to attract females, male cicadas emit a deafening chorus, which can reach 90 decibels -- as loud as a lawnmower.\n\nAll this to ensure that this brood's children will be around to bug us again ....in 2030.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/04/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2017/09/06/iconic-but-depleted-monarchs-make-comeback-least-summer/599079001/", "title": "Iconic but depleted monarch butterfly makes a summer comeback", "text": "Monarch butterfly numbers have improved this year because of great weather\n\nOverwintering populations have declined by 90 percent over the past 20 years\n\nA great place to spot them this time of year is at DeKorte Park in Lyndhurst\n\nMarie Longo was a hunter out for prey.\n\nWith a tiny net held aloft like a spear, Longo inched toward a clump of prairie coneflowers. She hesitated, then swept the net down over a monarch butterfly perched on a yellow flower. She scooped up the black-and-orange monarch and snapped a lid over the net. The butterfly fluttered furiously, then calmed.\n\nLongo let out a victorious giggle, stepped to a table, extracted the insect from the net, and deftly tapped a tiny round tag onto the butterfly’s wing.\n\nShe recorded the monarch’s sex and tag number, then opened the hand that held the insect. A streak of orange flashed up into the blue sky.\n\nLongo has tagged monarchs for five years at Overpeck County Park, and this summer has been the most prolific for spotting the iconic species. “This is an exceptional year for them,” she said.\n\nOther butterfly watchers across North Jersey agree — and their anecdotal observations have been confirmed nationally.\n\n“It’s been clear since June that monarch numbers really improved,” said Chip Taylor, an insect ecologist at the University of Kansas who founded Monarch Watch, a conservation program. “It’s one of the better years in the Northeast.”\n\nThat’s good news, since overwintering monarch butterflies in Mexico’s forests have declined by 90 percent over the past 20 years.\n\nTaylor said prime weather conditions this summer helped. “It’s like Goldilocks and the three bears — when everything is just right, things will go well for the monarchs,” he said. “If it’s too dry, or too wet, or too cold, they don’t do well.”\n\nConcern about the monarch has mobilized conservation groups, including the Bergen County Audubon Society, to encourage schools and homeowners to plant milkweed, the monarch’s only host plant. They have also prodded highway and parks departments to stop mowing stands of milkweed.\n\nBut Taylor said this year’s strong monarch population was due primarily to good weather.\n\n“This year was unusual — and it’s not sustainable,” he said. “The only way to sustain it would be to have a lot more milkweed out there.”\n\nSTATE'S BUTTERFLY:Unfluttering support for N.J. native — the black swallowtail\n\nNONSTOP:This endangered bird flies for 6,600 miles, then hits Jersey beaches to bulk up\n\nMonarchs migrate south each fall to forests in the mountains of central Mexico. In the spring, they head north again and spread across the United States.\n\nThe generation that spends the winter in Mexico flutters back as far as Texas, and lays its eggs on milkweed plants. The eggs become caterpillars, which eat the host plant’s leaves. Then each caterpillar attaches to the underside of a branch and becomes a green chrysalis.\n\nAfter metamorphosis, the full-grown monarch emerges and continues the trip north. Monarchs go through four generations during the northward migration. The last generation, emerging now in North Jersey, will head back to Mexico for the winter.\n\nSeveral factors have disrupted the monarch, from extreme weather to illegal logging in their wintering grounds.\n\nPerhaps most significant has been the loss of milkweed, as commercial farms use herbicide on farmland. Without milkweed, the monarchs have no place to lay eggs, and their caterpillars have no food.\n\nDuring migration, monarchs also rely on other wildflowers for nectar to fuel their journey. Herbicides have knocked out wildflowers, cutting the monarchs' nectar supply.\n\nDon Torino, president of the Bergen County Audubon Society, said planting milkweed in suburban gardens is something people can easily do to make an environmental difference, without waiting for government action.\n\nBergen Audubon created a pollinator garden at Overpeck Park in Leonia, filled with swamp and common milkweed, and other plants that provide nectar for butterflies, including hyssop, Joe Pye weed, buttonbush, sneezeweed, senna, cardinal flower, ironweed, bee balm, butterfly weed and aster.\n\nSome conservationists, including Longo, tag monarchs to help researchers learn more about their migration. Last year she tagged 100 monarchs, though none was recovered in Mexico.\n\nOne day she saw a tagged monarch in her Hackensack yard, and assumed it was one of hers. But when she saw the tag number, she realized it wasn’t. She learned that a fellow Bergen Audubon member, Jimmy Macaluso of Palisades Park, also tags.\n\n“We figured out it took that monarch two weeks to make it from his yard to mine,” Longo said. The distance is about 4 miles.\n\nDuring fall migration, monarchs on average fly a marathon each day — 26 miles — in four or five hours. With the right tailwind, they can make 100 miles some days. They gain elevation as the sun warms the air and creates thermal updrafts, Taylor said. Some reach altitudes of 800 to 1,200 feet, and travel 10 to 12 miles per hour.\n\nNaturalists with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority are also tagging monarchs in the Meadowlands. They say a great place to spot them this time of year is at DeKorte Park in Lyndhurst.\n\nTaylor said Monarch Watch has distributed 300,000 tags this year, and has recorded data from 1.4 million tagged monarchs since 1992. About 17,000 tags have been recovered in the Mexico wintering grounds.\n\nRiver Vale resident Tom Daurizio takes a different approach. He raises monarchs as a hobby — and to help them survive.\n\n“I was a typical kid, playing with bugs, so I’ve always had an interest in butterflies,” said Daurizio, a retired letter carrier. When his daughter, now 23, was born, he thought it would be fun to raise monarchs, but never took it further until his wife brought home a milkweed plant one year.\n\nIt has since seeded and spread across a 50-foot area. Daurizio keeps his garden tidy, but if milkweed is growing in the middle of the lawn, he mows around it.\n\nStarting in June, he checks milkweed leaves for monarch eggs. He tears off the section of leaf, stores it in a container, and puts plastic wrap on top to keep the eggs moist.\n\nRARE:The wildflower that only blooms in North Jersey\n\nCOMEBACK:N.J. has bobcats? Yep – and here's a way to save them\n\nWhen the eggs hatch, Daurizio transfers the caterpillars to fish tanks with screens on top. The caterpillars attach to the screen and form a chrysalis. When they emerge as butterflies, Daurizio releases them.\n\nIn nature, only about 10 percent of monarch eggs survive to become adult butterflies. Daurizio said he gets 95 percent to reach adulthood.\n\nTo help the depleted monarch population, he said, “We don’t need miracles — we need people to get involved.”\n\n“Monarchs have a genetically programmed navigation system,” said Taylor. “They have a time-compensated sun compass, which helps them know time of day. They can respond to magnetic fields. And they probably can respond to changes in the polarization of light as the sunlight changes in the fall. All of that points them in a certain direction.”\n\nMonarch fan Daurizio puts it more simply.\n\n“These butterflies born in my yard in River Vale will make every effort to find a hillside in the middle of Mexico, never having been there — and they will find it,” he said. “It’s incredible.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/06"}]}

On Friday, Jan. 15, 2016, John Robinson and Lisa Robinson of Munford, Tennessee, appeared on the \"Today\" show with Savannah Guthrie and Carson Daly, claiming to win the Powerball, before they'd appeared in person at the Tennessee Lottery office. (Big-prize winners must appear in person at the official lottery headquarters in their state within a certain timeframe.)\n\nThe Robinsons decided to contact \"Today\" to go public and then planned to stay as private as possible. Their lawyer had advised them to appear on national TV even before presenting the ticket to lottery officials as a way to \"control\" the story, they said.

They appeared with their daughter, Tiffany, and their rescue dog, Abby, on Jan. 15, 2016, at the Tennessee Lottery headquarters. During the press conference that day, the Robinsons asked the public for their privacy, admitting they are \"common folk from a small town.\"\n\nJohn Robinson and Lisa Robinson took the lump sum − a little more than $327 million before taxes − though they posed with a giant $528.8 million check, Tennessee Lottery officials said. They received a couple million dollars immediately and about 10 days later, they were to receive the remainder of the prize, according to a 2016 USA TODAY story.\n\nWhere did the Robinsons of Tennessee buy their winning Powerball ticket?\n\nThe Robinsons bought their winning Powerball ticket at Naifeh's Food Market, one of three lottery retailers in their hometown of 6,000 residents about 30 miles northeast of Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nThough the couple had triple-checked their winning numbers, John Robinson told news media that he wouldn't officially believe it until state lottery officials reported a winning ticket was purchased in Munford. By early Thursday, Jan. 14, 2016, state lottery officials announced that Naifeh's in Tennessee sold one of the three winning tickets.\n\nAlly, Abby and Oney Naifeh took a selfie with their family's Tennessee lottery check that was presented at their family's store, Naifeh's Food Mart, that Thursday in Munford.

In fact some lottery winners have experienced bankruptcy, divorce, prison time and have even been murdered.\n\nExperts say if you win and don't contact a reputable tax professional and a reputable investment adviser, you could land yourself in big financial trouble. If your first step is to tell family and friends you won, it could lead to close people in your life demanding money. Lottery winners who aren't equipped with how to wisely save their millions often blow through their cash.\n\nAlthough it may seem impossible to blow a billion or millions of dollars, below are some of the worst U.S. lottery winner horror stories.\n\nSomeone struck gold in California:Nearly $700M lottery ticket sold at Calif. supermarket\n\nVaccine lottery:Missouri launches vaccine lottery to boost shots\n\n1. William Bud Post. Post won Pennsylvania's $16.2 million jackpot in 1988, the Beaver County Times reported. This was the start of a series of unfortunate events for Post. His ex-girlfriend sued him for a share of the winnings and won, and his brother hired a hitman in an effort to inherit part of the cash. Other relatives spent months demanding money. Within a month of winning, Post filed for bankruptcy and had $1 million in debt.\n\n2. Janite Lee. The St. Louis Post Dispatch reported Janite Lee, an immigrant from South Korea, worked in a wig shop before she won $18 million in the Illinois Lottery in 1993. Lee was set to receive an annual payout of $620,000 and took the opportunity to buy a million-dollar home for her family. But she later sold her rights to her annual checks for a lump-sum amount. Ten years later at 60, Lee filed for bankruptcy and was left with $2.5 million in debt.\n\n3. Abraham Shakespeare. In 2006, Shakespeare won $30 million in a Florida lottery, and three years later he was murdered. The 47-year-old was shot twice in the chest by DeeDee Moore, who befriended Shakespeare after his lottery win, according to ABC News. Moore was found guilty of first-degree murder in 2012.\n\n4. Denise Rossi. In 1997, Rossi won $1.3 million in the California lottery and immediately filed for divorce from her husband, People reported. Two years later, Rossi's husband discovered she won the lottery and took her to court. He sued Rossi for not disclosing her winnings in the divorce, and the judge awarded him every cent.\n\n5. Jack Whittaker. Before winning $315 million in West Virginia in 2002, Whittaker was already a millionaire, according to TIME. Just four years later, the then-construction company president claimed he went broke. Tragedies swarmed his life. His granddaughter and daughter died soon after from drug overdoses. Then Whittaker was robbed of $545,000 while sitting in his car at a strip club.\n\nFollow Gabriela Miranda on Twitter: @itsgabbymiranda", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/11/08/midterm-elections-powerball-jackpot-winner-fifa-chris-evans-its-tuesdays-news/8290692001/", "title": "Midterm elections, Powerball jackpot winner, FIFA, Chris Evans.

The winning ticket was sold at a service center in Altadena in Los Angeles County, according to a tweet from the California Lottery.
