Johnson Presidential Library that marked the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\"I have great respect for our institutions, the separation of powers laid out in our Constitution. What's happening now is not consistent with that doctrine of separation of powers,\" Biden said during his remarks in Austin, Texas. \"Extremism is undermining the public's confidence in the Court's decisions.\"\n\nThe moves mark a seismic shift for Biden, who had previously resisted a structural overhaul of the nation's highest court.\n\nAlthough he's no longer a candidate himself, Biden is making the nation's high court a central issue for his final six month months as president − and handing Vice President Kamala Harris, the new presumptive Democratic nominee, a hot-button topic to hit on the campaign trail and energize progressive voters and others increasingly skeptical of the court.\n\nYet Biden stopped short of calling for expanding the size of the Supreme Court − a proposal that is popular among progressives as a way of counteracting the current conservative supermajority.\n\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents cannot be prosecuted for \"official acts\" during their time in office. The court's ruling stemmed from the Justice Department's case against former President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Presidents can still be prosecuted for unofficial criminal behavior, the court ruled.\n\nThe “No One Is Above the Law Amendment” will state that the Constitution does not confer immunity from federal criminal indictment, trial, conviction or sentencing by virtue of having been president.\n\nBiden, a U.S. senator for 36 years, wrote that he had overseen more Supreme Court nominations as senator, vice president and president than anyone living today.\n\nSupreme Court:In defending gifts from a GOP billionaire, Clarence Thomas raises more questions among his critics\n\nBiden during his speech at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library specifically criticized the recent Supreme Court ruling that said “official” acts taken by a president are protected - but not steps taken as a candidate.\n\n\"We're a nation of laws,\" Biden said. \"Not kings and dictators.\"\n\nNone of the legislative proposals, however, have a likely chance of passing in a divided Congress. The measures would need 60 votes in the Senate to block a Republican filibuster.\n\nHarris, who is on track to formally be nominated the Democratic nominee next month, said in a statement Monday that she supports the proposed changes because the Supreme Court faces a “clear crisis of confidence” from the American people.\n\n\"In the course of our Nation’s history, trust in the Supreme Court of the United States has been critical to achieving equal justice under law. President Biden and I strongly believe that the American people must have confidence in the Supreme Court,” she said. “These popular reforms will help to restore confidence in the Court, strengthen our democracy, and ensure no one is above the law.”\n\nRepublicans were quick to denounce the president's proposal.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement that the amendments would be \"dead on arrival in the House.”\n\n“It is telling that Democrats want to change the system that has guided our nation since its founding simply because they disagree with some of the Court’s recent decisions,\" he said in a statement.\n\nDuring his remarks in Austin, Biden slammed back at the House Speaker, saying \"I think his thinking is dead on arrival.\"\n\nA conservative supermajority\n\nBiden's push is a salvo by the Democratic president amid an increasingly tense relationship with a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court that has angered the left with recent decision overturning the decision that made abortion legal nationwide, ending affirmative action in college admissions, blocking Biden's action to cancel student loan debt for college students and limiting federal authority to combat climate change.\n\nTrump appointed three justices to the court while Biden appointed only one, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nCongress approved term limits for the presidency more than 75 years ago, and Biden said it should do the same for the Supreme Court.\n\nTerm limits would help ensure that the court’s membership changes with some regularity and reduce the chance that any single presidency imposes undue influence for generations to come, he says.\n\nBiden said he supports a system in which the president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in active service on the court.\n\nA third proposed change includes a binding code of conduct for the high court.\n\nThis would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity, and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest.\n\nIn July, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., filed articles of impeachment against Supreme Court justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito over accusations of ethics violations and political bias.\n\nThomas pulled the court into an ethics firestorm last year after it was revealed he had failed to disclose millions of dollars in luxury travel and other gifts from billionaire friends.\n\n“Justice Thomas and Alito’s repeated failure over decades to disclose that they received millions of dollars in gifts from individuals with business before the court is explicitly against the law,\" the Bronx Democrat said.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

Wade, scaled back gun control laws, and raised questions about the future of same-sex marriage.\n\nHere is what to expect from Biden's Supreme Court overhaul package.\n\nMore:'No one is above the law': Biden calls for sweeping Supreme Court changes\n\nCan Biden do anything to take away Supreme Court power?\n\nIf you're catching up with Biden's plan, keep in mind that he didn't endorse a proposal that has long been on the liberal wishlist: expanding the size of the nine-member Supreme Court.\n\nNone of his proposals − which Harris quickly endorsed − are likely to pass in a divided Congress. Yet Biden is igniting what could be a defining issue in the 2024 campaign while setting off a debate that will last much longer.\n\nIt's also a salvo by the Democratic president amid an increasingly tense relationship with a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court that has angered the left with recent decision overturning the decision that made abortion legal nationwide, ending affirmative action in college admissions, blocking Biden's action to cancel student loan debt for college students and limiting federal authority to combat climate change.\n\nA constitutional amendment on presidential immunity\n\nBiden's constitutional amendment on presidential immunity makes clear \"no President is above the law or immune from prosecution for crimes committed while in office,\" according to the White House.\n\nIt's a direct response to the Supreme Court's ruling this month that former President Donald Trump is protected from criminal prosecution for actions taken in his \"official\" capacity as president. The decision was a significant blow to the Justice Department's case against Trump over efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMore:'Terrible disservice': Biden denounces SCOTUS decision giving Trump partial immunity\n\nAs an amendment to the Constitution, the measure would need support from two-thirds of the House and Senate for approval, making it dead on arrival without support from Republicans.\n\nTerm limits for justices\n\nIf you're appointed to the Supreme Court and approved by the Senate, you've got job security for life. Biden is urging Congress to end lifetime seats for the Supreme Court's nine justices with term limits that would mean future justices could not serve beyond 18 years.\n\nUnder the change, the president would appoint a new justice every two years to replace the justice whose term ends.\n\nIt would mark a seismic change for an institution that was founded on giving individual justices enormous power though lifetime appointments. Term limits would mean the court's current 6-3 conservative majority could change composition significantly sooner than if justices served out their lifetime terms.\n\n\"Term limits would help ensure that the court’s membership changes with some regularity,\" Biden wrote in a Washington Post op-ed announcing his endorsement. \"That would make timing for court nominations more predictable and less arbitrary. It would reduce the chance that any single presidency radically alters the makeup of the court for generations to come.\"\n\nA code of conduct for the Supreme Court?\n\nA third proposal is for Congress to pass a \"binding, enforceable\" conduct and ethics rules for justices.\n\nIt would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest.\n\nThe proposed ethics changes follow reports last year that detailed lavish travel that Thomas accepted from GOP donor Harlan Crow, as well as revelations that Justice Samuel Alito flew to Alaska for a fishing trip on a private jet in 2008 that belonged to a hedge fund manager who repeatedly brought cases before the high court.\n\nMore recently, Alito has faced scrutiny from Democrats following news reports that two controversial flags that are symbols in right-wing circles were flown at his family residences.\n\n\"President Biden and I strongly believe that the American people must have confidence in the Supreme Court,\" Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said in a statement. \"Yet today, there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court as its fairness has been called into question after numerous ethics scandals and decision after decision overturning long-standing precedent.\n\nBiden says no to expanding court\n\nSome progressives have long pushed for Biden to get behind a proposal to expand the size of the Supreme Court as a way to quickly eradicate conservatives' current hold.\n\nBut Biden isn't going that far.\n\nThe issue of \"court packing\" was explored by a 36-member commission Biden appointed after he entered office in 2021 to explore structural changes to the Supreme Court. But the panel of legal experts warned of \"considerable drawbacks\" in a lengthy report that issued later that year.\n\nIn contrast, the panel was more bullish on the idea of 18-year term limits for justices.\n\nPlaying to Democratic voters\n\nBiden was already planning to get behind a Supreme Court overhaul before he dropped out of the election after resisting structural changes for his first three years in office.\n\nIt is a way to energize the progressive flank of his party for the November election after liberals have watched in dismay as the Supreme Court has moved sharply to the right.\n\nMore:'A daughter of California': How a Kamala Harris presidency could shake things up\n\nBiden and Democrats have become increasingly vocal with their criticism of the court, which has overturned many long-held precedents in recent years − most notably upending Roe v. Wade by ruling that there is no constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nBiden and Harris have aggressively blamed Trump for the overturning of Roe, reminding voters repeatedly of his three Supreme Court justice appointments that swung the court.\n\nNow, with less than 100 days until Election Day, Harris can point to a plan to reshape the Supreme Court.\n\n\"These popular reforms will help to restore confidence in the Court, strengthen our democracy, and ensure no one is above the law,\" Harris said.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/biden-laws-passed-priorities-to-get-done-executive-orders/index.html", "title": "5 significant bills and 5 executive orders Biden signed in his first ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden took the oath of office a year ago with the country facing challenges not seen in generations.\n\nOn top of a once-in-a-century pandemic, the new President inherited an economy that had crumbled as Covid-19 cases rose and a nation so divided that his predecessors supporters had stormed the US Capitol two weeks prior in a bid to stop his ascent. Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden signed the American Rescue Plan, a sweeping $1.9 trillion package, into law in early March. The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/07/16/biden-supreme-court-reform-term-limits-ethics/74433291007/", "title": "Biden to back Supreme Court reform on term-limits, ethics: report", "text": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is planning to support major changes to the Supreme Court, according to multiple media reports, including backing term-limits for lifetime-appointed justices and an aggressive ethics code.\n\nThe moves would mark a seismic shift for Biden − who until now has resisted a structural overhaul of the nation's highest court − while he looks to energize the left progressive flank of his party before the November election.\n\nYet each of the measures will likely have no shot of passage in a divided Congress. The measures would need 60 votes in the Senate to block a Republican filibuster.\n\nThe Washington Post, citing two people briefed on the plans, was the first to report on the moves. The proposals could also include calling for a constitutional amendment to eliminate broad immunity for presidents and other federal officeholders. It would be a response to the Supreme Court's ruling this month that Trump is protection from criminal prosecution for actions taken in his \"official\" capacity as president.\n\nMore:In historic ruling on presidential immunity, Supreme Court says Trump can be tried for private acts\n\nBiden, in a phone call Saturday with member of the House Progressive Caucus, relayed his plans to back the changes, according to a transcript obtained and reported by the Post.\n\n'I'm going to need your help on the Supreme Court'\n\n\"I’m going to need your help on the Supreme Court, because I’m about to come out − I don’t want to prematurely announce it − but I’m about to come out with a major initiative on limiting the court. … I’ve been working with constitutional scholars for the last three months, and I need some help,” Biden told the progressive House members, according to the Post.\n\nWhile about two dozen House Democrats have called for Biden to withdraw from the election after his disastrous June 27 debate, progressive lawmakers have stood behind Biden. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, a leading progressive, last week filed articles of impeachment against conservative Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito over alleged ethics violations and political bias.\n\nCNN, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the deliberations, reported Biden is \"seriously considering\" pursuing the Supreme Court changes.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlthough the details of the proposed term-limits aren't clear, eight Democratic senators have proposed legislation that would limit Supreme Court terms to 18 years, with a new justice being appointed every two years.\n\nThe proposed ethics changes follow reports last year that detailed lavish travel that Thomas accepted from GOP donor Harlan Crow, as well as revelations that Justice Samuel Alito flew to Alaska for a fishing trip on a private jet in 2008 that belonged to a hedge fund manager who repeatedly brought cases before the high court.\n\nMore recently, Alito has faced scrutiny from Democrats following news reports that two controversial flags that are symbols in right-wing circles were flown at his family residences.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., last year introduced legislation with other Democrats that would require the Supreme Court to impose the code of conduct for federal judges to Supreme Court justices, ban justices from owning conflicting assets and cap the monetary value of gifts justices can receive.\n\nBiden not pushing expanding the Supreme Court\n\nOne hot-button proposal that has long been kicked around is not on Biden's agenda, according to the reports: expanding the size of the nine-member Supreme Court, which many liberals have long supported.\n\nThe court is currently a 6-3 conservative majority after Trump appointed three justices to the court while Biden appointed only one, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nMore:Biden says he knows what a ‘Black job’ is. It’s vice president of the United States.\n\nBiden and Democrats have become increasingly vocal with their criticism of the court, which has overturned many long-held precedents in short order − most notably, the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade's constitutional right to an abortion.\n\n\"There has never been a court that’s so far out of step,\" Biden said at a June 16 Hollywood fundraiser with former President Barack Obama and several celebrities.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/08/02/biden-supreme-court-reform-term-limits-constitution/74588423007/", "title": "Biden Supreme Court reforms are terrible – and reek of desperation", "text": "I almost feel bad for President Joe Biden.\n\nAfter he was pushed out of the presidential race by Democratic Party bosses last month, Biden has become – simply put – irrelevant as he waits out the end of his one term in office.\n\nIn a desperate ploy to remind people he’s still president (as all eyes have shifted to Vice President Kamala Harris), Biden penned an opinion column in The Washington Post this week, laying out several “reforms” for the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe president's ideas should be shelved as quickly as his relevance.\n\nBiden has joined the chorus of Democrats and their media allies saying there is a “crisis” at the highest court, with faux ethics scandals and “flag-flying” controversies.\n\nThis is a false narrative, and it’s a dangerous message to spread in an already polarized country. It probably wouldn’t surprise you that the only justices who have come under Democrats’ scrutiny are the ones appointed by Republican presidents.\n\nDemocrats are always smugly telling us how they are the only ones who can preserve democracy – while they back ideas that would undermine one of our nation’s most esteemed institutions.\n\nRewriting history:To prove fealty to Kamala Harris, the media gaslights voters by rewriting her past\n\nBiden wrote: “What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms.”\n\nWhat isn’t normal is the level of orchestrated attacks on one branch of government by another one. The steady drumbeat of negative attention on the conservative majority of the nation's highest court is what has caused public confidence to drop – not its actions.\n\nDemocrats throw a tantrum because they don't like court's decisions\n\nLet’s be real about what’s going on. Biden and Democrats are angry about decisions the court has made in recent years. First and foremost, they are aghast that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and returned limits on abortion to the states.\n\nThey want retribution.\n\nPlus, the court has slapped down Biden’s numerous attempts at executive overreach throughout his presidency – most notably last year when it ruled that his efforts to “cancel” hundreds of billions in student debt were unconstitutional.\n\nBiden strikes out:Courts keep telling Biden his student loan scam is illegal. Will it stop him? Nah!\n\nBiden claims he has “great respect for our institutions and the separation of powers,” yet he has flaunted his disdain for the court’s decisions and specifically said its ruling on student loans wouldn’t “stop” him from similar efforts.\n\nIn other words, the Supreme Court did its job by serving as a check on another branch of government.\n\nBiden’s proposed changes would blur the lines of the government’s separation of powers and the independence the court has enjoyed since its inception.\n\nOne upside: They are not likely to go anywhere soon. Republicans in Congress strongly oppose Biden’s blueprint, and any amendment to the Constitution would first need approval from two-thirds of the House and Senate, a high bar.\n\nYet, Harris – the likely Democratic presidential nominee – has embraced the reforms, meaning these are talking points that we will keep hearing about through the election.\n\nTerm limits for justices? Bad idea.\n\nThe worst idea is to impose term limits for justices. Biden proposes 18-year term limits for the nine justices, meaning a president would be able to appoint a new justice every two years.\n\nIt’s hard to miss the hypocrisy of Biden, who spent nearly four decades in the Senate, arguing passionately for term limits.\n\nIdentity politics:‘White women’ and ‘white dudes’ pledge their allegiance to Kamala Harris. Talk about weird.\n\nWhile terms limits may sound nice – and offers Democrats a way to offload the sitting justices they despise – it goes against what our founders envisioned in the Constitution when they clearly wrote that justices and federal judges “shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour.”\n\nIn other words, these are lifetime appointments, until death, retirement or impeachment intervene.\n\nBiden once opposed meddling with the high court, including efforts to “pack” the court to dilute justices whom one may not like. What Biden is proposing now is not unlike what President Franklin Roosevelt tried to do in 1937, when he was perturbed that the Supreme Court had blocked some of his big-government expansion.\n\nAdam White, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who served in 2021 on Biden’s Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States, has closely studied policies such as term limits and court-packing. While he came into the assignment open to term limits via constitutional amendment, White told me he concluded that they'd be unwise in part because of fundamental shifts they'd spur in presidential power and the role of the Senate in confirming judicial nominations.\n\nPlus, various term-limit proposals are really just “court-packing by another name,” White observed.\n\nBiden may desperately want to stay relevant, but misguided proposals to shake up the Supreme Court aren’t the way to go about it.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

The news was first reported by The Associated Press.\n\nThe Department of Justice will send its recommendation to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug to the White House Office of Management and Budget, according to the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The Justice Department is expected to transmit the recommendation today, the source said.\n\nMore:Trucker failed drug test after taking CBD supplement. Supreme Court to decide if he can sue\n\nThe plan wouldn't legalize marijuana at the federal level outright, but it would reclassify it from a Schedule I drug – believed highly dangerous, addictive and without medical use – to a Schedule III drug that can be lawfully prescribed as medication. Marijuana has been a Schedule I drug since the Controlled Substances Act was signed in 1970.\n\n“It is significant for these federal agencies, and the DEA and FDA in particular, to acknowledge publicly for the first time what many patients and advocates have known for decades: that cannabis is a safe and effective therapeutic agent for tens of millions of Americans,\" said Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML, which advocates for cannabis to be removed altogether from the list of controlled substances.\n\nThis bureaucratic move is only a small step toward what advocates hope will be full legalization of the drug. However, the new proposed classification does not fully address the inconsistencies between federal restrictions and the laws in a growing number of states that have authorized medical and recreational use of pot.\n\nTwenty-four states and Washington, D.C., have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, and 14 other states authorize it for medical use, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\n“Rescheduling the cannabis plant to Schedule III fails to adequately address this conflict, as existing state legalization laws – both adult use and medical – will continue to be in conflict with federal regulations, thereby perpetuating the existing divide between state and federal marijuana policies,\" Armentano said in a statement.\n\nThe federal proposal to reschedule marijuana would have broad support among voters. A nationwide survey last fall commissioned by the Coalition for Cannabis Scheduling Reform found nearly 60% of likely voters supported rescheduling, with 65% of younger voters 18 to 25 favoring it, the highest of any demographic group polled. Overall, the number of Americans who think marijuana should be legal reached a record high at 70%, according to a Gallup poll in the fall.\n\nFor decades, marijuana has been listed under the Controlled Substances Act as a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin, LSD and ecstasy. The act categorizes drugs based on their potential for abuse, addiction and medical use. Schedule I drugs are outlawed under federal law level and deemed to be without accepted medical use.\n\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a review of how marijuana is classified; and last year HHS recommended it be rescheduled to Schedule III, alongside drugs like Tylenol with codeine and anabolic steroids. The Justice Department did its own analysis and reached the same conclusion, the source said.\n\nThe proposal will undergo a public review period; the source did not say when the proposed rule would be open to public comment.\n\nRep. Andy Harris, R-Md., has previously criticized federal efforts to change Marijuana's classification. Harris was a physician at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, according to his online biography.\n\n\"Removing restrictions on an addictive gateway drug like Marijuana is a dangerous mistake. Numerous studies, including a recent and reputable study published by JAMA, points to the negative impact recreational marijuana has on the body and brain,\" Harris said in a Tuesday social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nExperts previously told USA TODAY that marijuana’s placement on Schedule I was not based on credible scientific evidence of its perils, but once it was listed, researchers and advocates faced a heavy burden trying to prove it shouldn’t face such stiff restrictions.\n\nWhat exactly does rescheduling cannabis mean?\n\nPlacing marijuana in Schedule III puts it on par with drugs, such as ketamine, testosterone, anabolic steroids or Tylenol with codeine, that have “moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence,” according to the DEA.\n\nSchedule III drugs can be legally prescribed by licensed health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies. Rescheduling could also help resolve a massive federal tax burden that has been placed on cannabis companies – which were effectively seen as drug traffickers for tax purposes.\n\nBut rescheduling marijuana doesn’t make it legal to use recreationally, and it doesn’t change much about current state cannabis programs, said Jay Wexler, who teaches a seminar about marijuana laws at Boston University. It would still a controlled substance even with the new announcement\n\nWexler and other policy experts and advocates say rescheduling is not a solution, but it could be a sign the federal government is catching up with public opinion and consensus in the medical field that there are therapeutic benefits to marijuana, along with some risks.\n\n\"Rescheduling is a step forward, but it is not nearly enough. And there's no reason to keep cannabis in the Controlled Substances Act,” Wexler previously told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat are the possible risks of marijuana?\n\nBecause of its classification, marijuana has been hard to study. But the move to reschedule marijuana is due in large part to its lower public health risk, federal scientists have said.\n\nIn a leaked HHS document, officials wrote to the DEA to support lowering its classification to Schedule III. Its risk for addiction was lower than other drugs and it had medical benefits, unlike Schedule I and II drugs, HHS researchers said.\n\nStill, scientists said, users develop moderate to low physical dependence on it, and there is some risk of psychological dependence. However, they noted, the withdrawal symptoms are “relatively mild” compared with alcohol. Marijuana is more comparable to tobacco, they said.\n\nThere are no known deaths from a marijuana overdose, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA. But it does affect physical and mental health.\n\nMarijuana can cause permanent IQ loss for people who begin using it at a young age, the institute said. Additionally, long-term use has been associated with temporary paranoia and hallucinations, and it can exacerbate symptoms with disorders such as schizophrenia, NIDA said.\n\nMarijuana smoke has a similar health impact to tobacco smoke. NIDA found people who smoke marijuana frequently develop issues with breathing, akin to tobacco smokers.\n\nSmoking cannabis, the most common way to consume the drug, may have additional risks because of particulate matter a person inhales, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Heart Association. Researchers noted cannabis smoke isn’t all that different than tobacco smoke, the only difference being the added effect of the psychoactive drug THC in marijuana rather than nicotine in tobacco.\n\nRespiratory issues include daily cough, phlegm and a higher risk of lung infections, however, the institute said it’s unclear if marijuana causes a greater risk of lung cancer.\n\nSmoking marijuana also increases heart rate, which can increase the chance of heart attack, especially among older people and people with heart conditions. The Heart Association journal study linked increased cannabis use with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\n“Despite common use, little is known about the risks of cannabis use and, in particular, the cardiovascular disease risks,” the study’s lead author, Abra Jeffers, a data analyst at Boston’s Massachusetts General Hospital, said in a statement. “The perceptions of the harmfulness of smoking cannabis are decreasing, and people have not considered cannabis use dangerous to their health. However, previous research suggested that cannabis could be associated with cardiovascular disease.” She noted that smoking cannabis, which is the predominant way it is used, could pose other risks because it involves inhaling particulate matter.\n\nIn the study published in late February, researchers examined Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey data of over 400,000 adults from 2016 to 2020, looking at self-reported cannabis use with cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart disease, heart attacks and strokes.\n\nPeople who used marijuana daily had a 25% higher chance of having a heart attack and a 42% higher chance of stroke than those who didn’t use it at all.\n\nProposal reflects potential for health benefits\n\nThe cannabis plant has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries if not millennia. It appears to help with treating pain, insomnia, anxiety, and glaucoma, among other health conditions. Still, evidence is mixed and more research into its health benefits is needed, researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health said in August.\n\nWhile the FDA hasn’t approved the cannabis plant for any medical use, federal regulators have approved several drugs containing cannabinoids, or substances such as THC or CBD found in the cannabis plant, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThese include Epidiolex, a purified form of CBD ingested orally, that is FDA-approved to treat seizures associated with two severe forms of epilepsy. Marinol and Syndros both contain synthetic THC and are used to treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Nabilone, another synthetic similar to THC, is approved as the brand name drug Cesamet for people with HIV/AIDS who experiencing weight loss and appetite loss.\n\nA 2017 federal report found cannabis or cannabinoids were more likely to reduce pain symptoms for patients with chronic pain. Additionally, there is some evidence that cannabis is effective in treating symptoms of multiple sclerosis, particularly addressing the stiff or rigid muscles caused by the disease. One cannabinoid drug, nabiximol, a mouth spray that has both THC and CBD, has been approved in several countries but not in the U.S. Under the brand name Sativex, it has shown pain relief for people with cancer or multiple sclerosis.\n\nOther research has examined cannabis’ uses to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, but the NIH said the evidence is mixed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/14/what-we-know-senate-republicans-student-loan-reform/70321736007/", "title": "What we know about Senate Republicans' student loan reform ...", "text": "Senate Republicans have unveiled their plan to address America's student debt crisis as a Supreme Court decision on President Joe Biden's forgiveness plan is expected any day.\n\nThe GOP package, called the Lowering Education Costs and Debt Act, is made up of five bills meant to target issues that are driving \"skyrocketing\" higher education costs, according to Sen. Bill Cassidy, R.-La., who introduced the legislation Wednesday alongside four other Republicans.\n\nRoughly 45 million Americans have federal student debt, amounting to more than $1.6 trillion in borrowed money. Even if Biden's student loan forgiveness plan is upheld by the Supreme Court, outstanding debt will return to its current levels in just five years, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nStudent loan forgiveness \"is not a fix; this is merely a Band-Aid, and the Band-Aid saddles taxpayers with a burden again in five years,\" Cassidy said at a news conference Wednesday. \"That's why this morning we introduced the Lowering Education Costs and Debt Act ... and unlike President Biden's plan, this actually addresses the root causes of the student debt crisis.\"\n\nRepublican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, John Cornyn of Texas, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Tim Scott of South Carolina joined Cassidy in introducing the legislation.\n\nWhat's in the Republican student debt legislation?\n\nThe first bill, dubbed the College Transparency Act, would reform the college data reporting system to make information about outcomes at universities − such graduation rates and debt after graduation − more accessible.\n\nCassidy noted Wednesday that Americans don't buy cars or houses without comparing prices, quality and financial operations options. He suggested that similar resources for higher education should be readily available.\n\nThe second bill, titled the Understanding the True Cost of College Act, would require colleges and universities to use uniform financial aid letters that are clear on the costs associated with attending the institution.\n\nGrassley, who first introduced the bill in 2019, said Wednesday that uniform letters would make it easier for prospective students to compare offers across schools.\n\nThe third bill, called the Informed Student Borrowing Act, would require prospective students to be provided with additional information about their loans, including the duration of their loan, their expected monthly payment and how much money they’re likely to make after attending their school and program of choice, according to Daines, who introduced the measure Wednesday.\n\nStudents would be required to acknowledge they received counseling material or participate in entrance counseling each year.\n\nThe fourth bill, the Streamlining Accountability and Value in Education (SAVE) for Students Act, introduced by Cornyn, would reduce the nine student loan repayment options offered by the Department of Education to two options: the standard 10-year repayment plan and the REPAYE program, which allows low-income borrowers with low balances on their loans to receive forgiveness sooner.\n\nThe bill would also limit loans for undergraduate programs where former students can't earn more than a high school graduate, or graduate programs where former students can't earn more than a bachelor's degree recipient.\n\nCornyn argued that the legislation would not disadvantage liberal arts educations, which can correlate with lower income after graduation.\n\nThe fifth bill, the Graduate Opportunity and Affordable Loans, would end graduate PLUS loans, which have higher borrowing limits than undergraduate loans. They are limited to a school’s cost of attendance minus any other financial assistance students received.\n\nTuberville, who introduced the bill, called those loans \"inflationary\" and said they have contributed to the increased costs of college.\n\nFate of student debt relief with Supreme Court\n\nIn August 2022, Biden announced he would cancel at least $10,000 in student loan debt for millions of borrowers, as well as $20,000 to Pell Grant recipients. The plan was quickly met with several legal challenges, two of which landed before the Supreme Court.\n\nA decision on Biden's plan is expected this month. But if the Supreme Court doesn't rule on Biden's plan before June 30, interest will begin adding up again on Sept. 1, and borrowers can expect to resume payments on their loans in October.

Summers and Steve Rosenthal\n\nGuest Columnists\n\nThere is no more fundamental issue at stake in the 2024 election than whether America will preserve an independent U.S. Supreme Court that protects our constitutional rights. Democracy in our constitutional republic is at stake.\n\nThe Constitution does not prescribe the number of U.S. Supreme Court Justices, and Congress can change that number. So, if one party wins control of Washington, it can manipulate the number of Justices on the Supreme Court to enhance its own power.\n\nWhen it does, another party, when it wins control, would almost inevitably retaliate by doing the same thing. In 40 years we could then have 31 Justices on the Supreme Court.\n\nBoth parties have “packed” or attempted to “pack” the Court to get decisions they liked. We have had nine Justices for 155 years. We simply want an independent Court which upholds the rule of law and not the demands of politicians. We desire to keep a Supreme Court which is a check and balance against abuse of power.\n\nWhere is the support for the Keep Nine Amendment?\n\nNevertheless, a growing number of major national interest groups have called for expanding the number of Supreme Court Justices. They apparently believe that enacting legislation to advance their goals is not enough.\n\nLeading Democrats have each said that all Supreme Court reform options are on the table. More than 60 members of Congress have supported the proposed “Judiciary Act” to expand the number of Supreme Court Justices.\n\nNot a single Democrat in the current Congress has chosen to back the proposed “Keep Nine” Amendment, first introduced in Congress by a Democrat in 2020, that has since been backed by 200 members of Congress. It simply states: “The Supreme Court of the United States shall be composed of nine Justices.”\n\nEven House and Senate Democrats who say they oppose Court expansion have declined to back a measure to ensure neither party could ever do so.\n\nTrump and Biden say they are against packing, but what actions have they taken?\n\nPresident Biden compellingly stated his position in 2019 when he said: “I would not get into Court packing. We add three Justices; next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.\"\n\nBut Biden’s handpicked 2021 Supreme Court Commission was supposed to consider a broad range of options for Supreme Court reform. The Commission declined to consider the “Keep 9” Amendment. It was then, and still is, the specific Supreme Court reform with the most support in Congress.\n\nRecently, Biden announced a proposal applying to the high court that includes term limits and instituting an enforceable ethics code in addition to pushing for a constitutional amendment ending presidential immunity. He did not endorse expanding the size of the court but did not endorse an amendment to keep the size the same.\n\nFormer President Trump has alleged that President Biden wants to “pack” the Court. To our knowledge, Trump has not stated his support for the “Keep 9” Amendment.\n\nThis constitutional amendment revolutionvoting in U.S. and preceded women's suffrage\n\nIt is only fair to question the sincerity of a candidate who says he/she opposes something but won’t back a measure to ensure it never happens.\n\nPresident Biden now is no longer running for re-election. Former President Trump is the Republican nominee for President. Sen. J.D. Vance is the Republican nominee for vice president. The Democrats will officially select nominees soon. We assume that both the presidential and vice presidential candidates will debate.\n\nAt all future 2024 debates, when the Democratic and Republican nominees debate, perhaps the moderator should ask both candidates a simple question:\n\n\"You both have stated that you oppose increasing the current number of nine Supreme Court Justices. What is your position on the proposed “Keep 9” Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states: “The Supreme Court of the United States shall be composed of nine Justices.”\n\nAnd what would happen if either of them challenged the other to join in supporting this amendment?\n\nThe answers would be quite illuminating.\n\nPaul G. Summers, an Independent, is the former attorney general of Tennessee. Steve Rosenthal, a Democrat, is the former attorney general of Virginia.

Her narrow approval gave conservatives a 6-3 advantage, the most lopsided split since the 1930s.\n\nSeveral progressives said they remain hopeful about the commission's work but are also sounding early alarms over its composition and timeline. The panel itself was widely seen as a way for Biden to punt on a proposal that has been politically poisonous since President Franklin D. Roosevelt's failed attempt to \"pack\" the court in his second term.\n\n\"The commission has an opportunity to do something important,\" said Aaron Belkin with Take Back the Court, a group that advocates for adding justices. \"At the same time, we are very concerned because commissions are often places ideas go to die.\"\n\nNew justice:Barrett steers the Supreme Court to the right, but not toward Trump\n\nThe push for change – more justices or term limits or a code of ethics are among the ideas the groups are seeking – has put a squeeze on the Biden White House, emphasizing the gap between liberals who want the new president to mitigate the outsized impact former President Donald Trump had on the federal judiciary and a new administration that won power in part on a promise of moderate leadership.\n\nAfter Senate Republicans stymied President Barack Obama's 2016 nominee for the court, Merrick Garland, Trump managed to seat three associate justices in four years: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett. Biden has since nominated Garland, a federal appeals court judge, as his attorney general.\n\nThe pressure for some kind of overhaul has not come exclusively from left-leaning groups. Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under Obama, said during a recent Brookings Institution event that federal courts \"badly need reforms\" and asserted that Democrats are \"uncomfortable\" with using their power in a way that Republicans have not been.\n\nBiden's last substantive remarks on the issue came just before the election. He told CBS News in October that the process of confirming justices was \"getting out of whack\" but added that \"the last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football.\"\n\nBarrett took her seat on the court days later.\n\nShort on time\n\nLeaders at a half dozen progressive groups said that they are mostly withholding judgment on the commission until more details are clear. Still, some are casting sideways glances at a few details that have emerged. Biden set a six-month deadline for the panel's recommendations – a timeline some say is far too long.\n\nExpanding the size of the Supreme Court won't win Republican support and it has already made some centrist Democrats squeamish. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a key swing vote, said in October that he opposes adding justices. If Republicans recapture control of either the House or Senate in 2022, they will almost certainly shelve the idea.\n\n\"We don't have six months to study a question whose answer is already known,\" Belkin said.\n\nMore:Biden's influence on judiciary may be limited despite talk of 'court-packing'\n\nMore:The Kamala Harris-Joe Manchin dust-up explained - and why it matters for Biden\n\nAnother factor, experts said, are the justices themselves. If the new 6-3 majority moves quickly to assert itself on divisive issues such as abortion or guns, that could galvanize support on the left for change. On the other hand, if it pumps the brakes on those controversial cases, that could make it harder for progressives to organize.\n\n\"What political science has said is that when Congress introduces bills – when there's political pressure to reform the court – in general, the court backs down,\" said Joshua Braver, a University of Wisconsin law professor who has studied past campaigns to change the court. \"As a matter of institutional heft, Congress has so many ways to strip its power.\"\n\nWho will serve?\n\nThe sense of urgency has set off a scramble among progressive groups to assess who will serve on the commission, and what its mission will be.\n\nBiden campaign lawyer Bob Bauer, a former Obama White House counsel, will serve as co-chair, along with Cristina Rodríguez, a Yale Law School professor and former official in the Obama Justice Department. A Biden administration source familiar with the details of the commission confirmed the appointments on the condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly announced.\n\nNeither Bauer nor Rodríguez responded to questions about the commission.\n\nThe administration source said recruitment for other seats has \"progressed significantly\" but was not yet complete. Biden \"remains committed to an expert study of the role and debate over reform of the court\" the person told USA TODAY, adding that the president will have more to say \"in the coming weeks.\"\n\nBiden had previously said he would name progressives and conservatives to the group. But some progressives are grumbling about the names Biden is reportedly considering, including Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law professor who worked in the Bush administration. Goldsmith, whose name appeared as a potential pick in a recent Politico article, has drawn the ire of liberals in part for a 2018 magazine piece in which he praised conservative Kavanaugh, then a high court nominee, for his \"careful, honest, detached interpretation of the Constitution.\"\n\n\"The fact that someone like that is put on suggests we're going to have some real problems; I hope I'm wrong,\" said Molly Coleman, executive director of the People's Parity Project, a group of law students and lawyers aiming to change the judiciary.\n\nGoldsmith did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nColeman's concerns aren't limited to the appointment of a single conservative member. Like other progressives, she wants the commission to have a diversity of legal experts, including some who have advocated on behalf of the issues before the court rather than a group of high-powered political and corporate attorneys.\n\n\"This isn't an academic project,\" she said. \"We don't want to end up with a commission that only reflects the best that Harvard, Yale and Georgetown have to offer.\"\n\nTerm limits? Adding more lower court judges?\n\nAdvocates for expanding the court note the number of Supreme Court justices isn't set in the Constitution and frequently changed in the past – often for political reasons. Congress expanded the court to 10 during the Civil War to ensure a majority for Union policies, cut the nation's highest bench to seven to deny President Andrew Johnson nominations, and ratcheted it up to nine to give President Ulysses S. Grant majority support on the court for his monetary policies.\n\nOpponents, including the late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, say adding justices would harm the court, which draws authority and respect from the notion that it operates independently and above the fray of partisan politics. Ginsburg, a progressive icon, died last year.\n\n\"If anything would make the court look partisan,\" Ginsburg told NPR in 2019, \"it would be that – one side saying, 'When we're in power, we're going to enlarge the number of judges, so we would have more people who would vote the way we want them to.'\"\n\nProgressive groups are also pushing for a number of slightly less politically charged ideas: Term limits for justices, set perhaps to 18 years; a code of ethics; a more formal and enforceable process for recusals; and an expansion of lower courts, not only to offset the barrage of Trump appointees, but also to deal with growing caseloads.\n\nBrett Edkins, political director at the advocacy group Stand Up America, said he was encouraged that Biden \"recognizes there's a problem.\"\n\nBut recognition alone, he said, won't satisfy progressives.\n\n\"The commission is the start,\" he said. \"We expect results at the finish.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/08"}]}

Reuters could not immediately confirm that.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer for Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man held in the United States, declined to confirm the whereabouts of his client to the state RIA news agency \"until the exchange takes place.\" But the lawyer, Arkady Bukh, was quoted by RIA as saying he'd been told by lawyers representing people imprisoned in Russia that they were \"en route.\"\n\nShrouded in secrecy\n\nRIA also reported that four Russians jailed in the United States had disappeared from a database of prisoners operated by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons. It named them as Vinnik, Maxim Marchenko, Vadim Konoshchenko and Vladislav Klyushin.\n\nThe U.S. is also holding at least two other Russian nationals, Vladimir Dunaev and Roman Seleznev, convicted of serious cybercrimes, who could also figure.\n\nThe Kremlin has declined to say whether an exchange is looming as has Russia's embassy in Washington, and there has been no comment from Western countries. Such exchanges are typically shrouded in secrecy until they happen.\n\nDissidents inside Russia whose supporters say they have been told that they have been suddenly moved in recent days include opposition politician Ilya Yashin, human rights activist Oleg Orlov and Daniil Krinari, who was convicted of secretly cooperating with foreign governments.\n\nOthers to have abruptly gone missing in the prison system include German-Russian citizen Kevin Lik, convicted of treason, opposition activists Liliya Chanysheva and Ksenia Fadeeva, and anti-war artist Sasha Skochilenko.\n\nIvan Pavlov, a prominent Russian human rights lawyer now living in Prague, said the disappearance of so many people with similar profiles suggested the authorities were gathering them, probably in Moscow, for the exchange.\n\nHe said President Vladimir Putin would need to pardon them before their exchange, a necessary formality.\n\nIn December 2022, Russia traded basketball star Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years for having vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage, for arms dealer Viktor Bout, serving a 25-year sentence in the U.S.\n\nThe biggest prisoner swap since the Cold War took place in 2010, involving 14 people in total.\n\nWest sees detainees as political prisoners\n\nIn the West, the dissidents are seen by governments and activists as wrongfully detained political prisoners. All have, for different reasons, been designated by Moscow as dangerous extremists.\n\nThe exchange is also expected to include two journalists.\n\nOn July 19, American journalist Evan Gershkovich was convicted unusually swiftly on espionage charges that he denies. He was handed 16 years in jail and Russia has already confirmed talks about his possible exchange.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also convicted in unusual haste in a secret trial the same day and sentenced to 6-1/2 years, accused of spreading false information about the Russian army. She denies wrongdoing.\n\nOther U.S. nationals behind bars in Russia include former schoolteacher Marc Fogel, convicted in 2022 for possessing marijuana, which he said he used for medical reasons.\n\nIn Belarus, meanwhile, President Alexander Lukashenko, a close Putin ally, on Tuesday pardoned Rico Krieger, a German sentenced to death on terrorism charges, again with unusual haste and state media coverage.\n\nAmong those Moscow has signalled it wants is Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving life in Germany for murdering a former Chechen militant.\n\nA Slovenian court on Wednesday sentenced two Russians to time served for espionage and using fake identities, and said they would be deported, the state news agency STA reported, a move a Slovenian TV channel said was part of the wider exchange.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm that.\n\nReporting by Andrew Osborn in Moscow and Filipp Lebedev and Lucy Papachristou in London; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Kevin Liffey, Alexandra Hudson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/08/01/evan-gershkovich-paul-whelan-russia-prisoner-swap-updates/74628748007/", "title": "Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan freed by Russia in prisoner swap", "text": "WASHINGTON − Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan were released from Russian custody Thursday as part of a six-nation deal that was the biggest prisoner exchange between Washington and Moscow since the Cold War.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, speaking from the White House, thanked U.S. allies Germany, Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Turkey for helping in what he described as a “feat of diplomacy.”\n\n“They stood with us,\" Biden said. \"They made bold and brave decisions, released prisoners being held in their countries who were justifiably being held and provided the logistical support to get the Americans home.\"\n\nThe exchange of 24 prisoners follows months of negotiations and marks a rare moment of cooperation between Russia and its geopolitical adversaries in the West after more than two years of Russia's war in Ukraine. The prisoner swap involves the release of 16 individuals previously detained in Russia in exchange for eight people held in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Slovenia and Poland. Turkish intelligence had announced it agreed to provide logistical support to facilitate the swap.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, a Russian-American journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty who was arrested in Russia in 2023, and another journalist, Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian-British dissident, were also released from Russian prisons in the exchange.\n\nAmong those returned to Russia was hitman Vadim Krasikov, who had been jailed in Germany since 2021. The release of Krasikov was the biggest concession to bring Gershkovich, Whelan and others home. The Russian Security Service issued a statement saying eight Russian citizens \"who had been detained and imprisoned in a number of NATO countries, as well as minor children, were returned to their homeland.\"\n\nStanding with the families of the released Americans at the White House on Thursday, Biden called their convictions “show trials” and said they were held for “absolutely no legitimate reason.” Whelan, Gershkovich and Kurmasheva were “falsely accused of being spies,” Biden said.\n\nKara-Murza, who Biden said was a pallbearer at John McCain’s funeral alongside him, was convicted of treason, Biden said, for speaking out against Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s regime. “And now, their brutal ordeal is over. And they’re free,” the president said.\n\nBiden said he and the families had just spoken to the freed prisoners by telephone in the Oval Office. They were flown to Turkey from Russia earlier Thursday, he confirmed, and they will soon be on their way back to the United States.\n\n“This is an incredible relief for all the family members gathered here,” he said.\n\n'Their brutal ordeal is over':Biden addresses largest prisoner swap since Cold War\n\nHarris was a 'core member' in efforts to free prisoners, White House says\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris will greet Gershkovich, Whelan and others when they land at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C., on Thursday night, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.\n\nHarris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, played an important role in the prisoner swap, Sullivan said, pointing to discussions she had with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during this year's Munich Security Conference about the release of prisoners in February.\n\nHarris was “very much a core member of the team that helped make this happen,” Sullivan said.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nRussian dissidents among those being freed\n\nBiden said some political dissidents in Russia were being released and can now live safely abroad, and that should make Americans proud. He also took a dig at his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, saying that one of his first acts as president-elect was to dig into the cases of wrongfully detained Americans he was inheriting from the prior administration.\n\nAsked later about Trump's claim that he could have gotten the prisoners released without providing anything in return, Biden said: \"Why didn’t he do it when he was president?''\n\nIn all, Biden said, more than 70 Americans who were wrongfully detained or held hostage have been released during his administration. Biden, who is leaving office in January, said he would continue to work to bring wrongfully detained Americans home.\n\nThe families, he said, never gave up hope. Turning to Whelan’s sister, he said the public “can’t imagine” what the families have been through.\n\nMurdered Kremlin critic reportedly would have been released\n\nIn addition, five wrongfully detained German citizens and seven other Russian citizens − each political prisoners in their own country − will be released and allowed to leave Russia.\n\nSullivan said opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in a Russian prison in February, was supposed to be among them.\n\n“We had been working with our partners on a deal that would have included Alexei Navalny, and unfortunately he died,” Sullivan said at a White House press briefing.\n\nLeonid Volkov, the former chairman of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, wrote on social media that the organization \"rejoiced at the release of political prisoners, Putin’s hostages, who suffered in Putin’s GULAG,\" but it is \"joy with tears in our eyes.\"\n\nVolkov alleged the exchange was originally set to take place in February but was delayed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who then ordered the killing of Navalny, one of his most outspoken critics and a popular figure in the West. USA TODAY could not independently verify Volkov's claims.\n\nWho is Evan Gershkovich?\n\nGershkovich, who speaks fluent Russian, was based in the Wall Street Journal's Moscow bureau. The Journal says he had accreditation from the Russian Foreign Ministry to work as a journalist in the country.\n\nGershkovich, 32, was detained in early 2023, during a time of heightened tensions between the West and Russia over the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin was cracking down on opposition activists, independent journalists and civil society groups. Russian prosecutors accused the New Jersey native of gathering information on behalf of the CIA. Gershkovich, the Journal and the U.S. government denied the charges, saying he was doing his job as a journalist. On July 19, Gershkovich was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges. The WSJ and the U.S. condemned the proceedings as a sham trial.\n\nSullivan, during a press briefing, teared up as he discussed the return of Gershkovich, Whelan and others. He called the historic prisoner swap “a feat of diplomacy that, honestly, could only be achieved by a leader like Joe Biden.”\n\n“This was vintage Joe Biden: rallying American allies to save American citizens,” Sullivan said.\n\n− Kinsey Crowley and Wyatte Grantham-Philips\n\nWho is Paul Whelan?\n\nPaul Nicholas Whelan was born in March 1970 in Ottawa, Ontario, and grew up with his sister and two brothers in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He testified in a 2013 court deposition that he worked as a police officer in Chelsea, Michigan, for over a decade before he joined the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves.\n\nHe received a bad-conduct discharge from the Marines after he was convicted in a special court-martial of attempting to steal more than $10,000 while at Al Asad Airbase in Iraq. Other related convictions included dereliction of duty, making a false official statement, wrongfully using other people's Social Security numbers and bouncing checks.\n\nHe was arrested in Russia on Dec. 28, 2018, on espionage charges. At the time of his arrest, Whelan was working as the head of global security for the consulting firm BorgWarner. The Russian Foreign Ministry alleged Whelan was caught \"red-handed\" in an act of espionage, while Whelan insisted that he was set up and that he was simply a tourist. He was sentenced to 16 years of hard labor at the end of a closed-door trial.\n\n− Kristen Jordan Shamus\n\nFor Marc Fogel, Russian nightmare is not over\n\nAnother American still remains in Russian custody. Marc Fogel is a history teacher from Pennsylvania who taught for nearly a decade at a Russian school. Fogel was arrested at a Moscow airport in August 2021 for possession of medical marijuana prescribed to treat spinal pain. In 2022, he was sentenced to a 14-year prison sentence at a Russian penal colony.\n\nFogel, in his early 60s, grew up in Butler, Pennsylvania. He attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania and went on to teach history courses at schools attended by children of U.S. diplomats around the world, including places such as Colombia, Malaysia, Oman, Venezuela and Russia.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has not declared Fogel wrongfully detained, which has frustrated his family and lawmakers petitioning to get Fogel out of Russian custody.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nHappy birthday for freed detainee's daughter\n\nBiden said Friday will be the 13th birthday for Kurmasheva's daughter Miriam. He reached out his hand and invited her to the lectern, then led those in attendance in singing her happy birthday.\n\n\"Remember, no serious guys until you're 30,\" he said, causing Miriam to laugh before she walked back to her family and embraced them.\n\n\"Now she gets to celebrate with her mom,\" Biden said. \"That's what this is all about − families, able to be together again, like they should have been all along.\"\n\nFinally a swap:Russia prisoner swap brings Whelan, Gershkovich home. US should have done more, sooner.\n\nReceive USA TODAY's Russia-Ukraine newsletter to get the context on the war beyond the headlines.\n\nSigns of a pending release emerged Sunday\n\nFamilies of Gershkovich, Whelan and others gathered at the White House on Thursday to learn about the long-awaited release of their loved ones.\n\nSigns of an imminent exchange began emerging Sunday after lawyers and representatives for prisoners reported some of their clients missing from detention centers and prisons throughout Russia.\n\n\"Today, we celebrate the return of Paul, Evan, Alsu and Vladimir and rejoice with their families,\" Biden said in an earlier the statement. \"We remember all those still wrongfully detained or held hostage around the world. And reaffirm our pledge to their families: We see you. We are with you. And we will never stop working to bring your loved ones home where they belong.\"\n\n'Painstaking, extraordinary':Prisoner swap negotiations with Russia over Brittney Griner\n\nThe U.S. State Department says Russia weaponizes political prisoners, wrongfully detaining them for various reasons. Russia disputes this and either designated them as dangerous extremists or claims they are spies.\n\nThe previous largest prisoner swap with Russia took place in 2010, involving 14 people.\n\n\"Some of these women and men have been unjustly held for years,\" Biden said. \"All have endured unimaginable suffering and uncertainty. Today, their agony is over.\"\n\nRussia in 2022 traded basketball star Brittney Griner, sentenced to nine years for having cannabis oil vape cartridges in her luggage, for arms dealer Viktor Bout.

Today, their agony is over.”\n\nWho is Evan Gershkovich?\n\nGershkovich is an American journalist at the Wall Street Journal who covers Russia and Ukraine and is a former national of the Soviet Union. He was based in the newspaper’s Moscow bureau and had accreditation from the Russian Foreign Ministry to work as a journalist in the country.\n\nArrested in March 2023 during a time of heightened tensions between the West and Russia over the war in Ukraine, Gershkovich was recently sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges, convictions which he, the Journal, and the U.S. government denied.\n\nAfter his sentencing, Biden said in a statement that Russia was “wrongfully detaining Evan” and that the government “will not cease in our efforts to bring him home.”\n\nBy the time of his release, he had been held in Russia for 17 months.\n\nWho is Paul Whelan?\n\nWhelan was born in March 1970 in Ottawa, Ontario, and grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

She holds citizenship in Russia and the U.S. and lives with her husband and two children in Prague.\n\nKurmasheva had traveled to Russia in May of 2023 for a family emergency. On her way home, she was detained initially for failing to register her U.S. passport with Russian authorities. In October, she was then detained for failing to register as a foreign agent. If found guilty, she would face up to five years in prison.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists called the charges against Kurmasheva “spurious” and “more proof that Russia is determined to stifle independent reporting.” Her employer called for her return. She was the second U.S. journalist after Gershkovich to be detained in Russia since the start of the Ukraine War.\n\nWho is Vladimir Kara-Murza?\n\nKara-Murza is a journalist and prominent Putin critic. He is Russian-born but has dual citizenship with the U.K. and is a U.S. green card holder.\n\nKara-Murza had been imprisoned since 2022 on charges of treason and spreading false information about the Russian military, which he has rejected.

The two embraced and exchanged words before the Wall Street Journal reporter turned to Biden to shake his hand and speak with the president.\n\nGershkovich then walked towards his family.

The president appeared to take his American flag pin off and affix it to Whelan's lapel.\n\n\"The deal that made this possible was a feat of diplomacy and friendship,\" Biden said earlier Thursday as he announced the swap. \"For anyone who questions whether allies matter, they do.

In the summer of 2021, Fogel told his wife that he would retire after one more year teaching in Moscow, according to The Washington Post. It was upon their return to Moscow from a summer vacation that Fogel would be detained.\n\nWhy was Marc Fogel arrested?\n\nOn Aug. 14, 2021, Fogel was taken into custody at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport on a cannabis possession charge. Fogel and his family have said the cannabis was used to treat his chronic back pain.\n\nHis case would draw comparisons with that of WNBA All-Star Brittney Griner, who was arrested in February 2022 at a Russian airport for possession of vape cartridges containing cannabis oil. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine years at a labor camp. In December of the same year, she was released in a prisoner exchange.\n\nUnlike Griner, the U.S. Department of State has not declared Fogel as wrongfully detained, which has frustrated his family and lawmakers petitioning to get Fogel out of Russian custody.\n\nEfforts to bring Fogel home\n\nSince his arrest, Fogel's family have petitioned the U.S. government to free the longtime teacher and have been critical of the response they've received from the State Department and the Biden administration.\n\n\"I don't think the administration has helped us one bit,\" Fogel's mother, Malphine Fogel, told CBS Pittsburgh in early July. Days later, Malphine Fogel told The New York Post that former President Donald Trump promised to bring her son home when they spoke just before Trump took the stage at a rally in Butler and was wounded in an assassination attempt.\n\nAlso in July, Malphine Fogel filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the U.S. Department of State for not designating Fogel as wrongfully detained, reported local television station WTAE.\n\nThe effort to free Fogel has also been taken up by lawmakers, especially Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Kelly.\n\nKelly as well as a group of bipartisan lawmakers in December 2023 wrote a letter to Blinken urging the government to classify Fogel as wrongfully detained, saying he meets at least six of the 11 established criteria for the classification.\n\nKelly and Pennsylvania representatives Chris Deluzio and Brendan Boyle also introduced the Marc Fogel Act, which would require the State Department to submit documents and communication to Congress about how it determines whether a U.S. citizen is being wrongfully.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Sens. Bob Casey and John Fetterman as well as Kelly and other lawmakers again asked the Biden administration to include Fogel in prisoner exchanges with Russia.\n\n“As news of a potential prisoner exchange is being reported, we urge that any swap include Pennsylvania’s Marc Fogel, along with Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich,” they wrote in a letter. “Marc is a Pennsylvania teacher with severe health issues who has been unjustly imprisoned in a Russian prison for three years, and as the congressional members who represent Marc and his family, we have been pushing to bring Marc home as quickly as possible. As negotiations are ongoing with the Russian Federation, we respectfully request that any potential prisoner swap include Marc Fogel.”\n\nFogel's family 'heartbroken' and 'outraged' by prisoner swap\n\nFogel's family said they \"are completely heartbroken and outraged\" that Fogel was not among the Americans who was freed from Russian captivity on Thursday, according to a statement shared with USA TODAY through the family's lawyer, Sasha Phillips.\n\nWhile the family sent well wishes to the families of Gershkovich and Whelan, they said the U.S. government's handling of Fogel's case has been a \"glaring injustice,\" adding, \"It is wrong, unfair, and not the America we know and love.\"\n\n\"Marc is not rich, a celebrity, or connected to powerful patrons. All he has is his family, led by his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, who is fighting for her son’s rights. This fight has been met not with support and understanding, but with stonewalling, double standards, and—today—abandoning Marc to die in prison for less than an ounce of medical marijuana prescribed to manage his severe decades-long spinal disease,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We demand immediate action to secure Marc’s release and call on President Biden, Secretary Blinken, Deputy Secretary Verma, and National Security Advisor Sullivan to say Marc Fogel’s name, designate him as wrongfully detained, and bring him home.

Krasikov shot a Chechen dissident in a park in 2019, at the behest of Russia’s intelligence agency. For months, Putin has expressed his willingness to cut a deal.\n\nA previous deal this year was in the works to free Alexei Navalny, the now-deceased leader of the Russian opposition, but it failed before Navalny was killed in a Russian prison.\n\nTiming is everything, and now that President Biden is no longer seeking reelection, he’s willing to take more risks and intent on shoring up his legacy. One hour before he announced on July 21 that he's dropping his campaign and backed Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden greenlighted the complex deal, The Wall Street Journal revealed.\n\nWhat makes a martyr?Alexei Navalny shines a light on Vladimir Putin's evil tyranny.\n\nWho are Gershkovich, Whelan and other prisoners freed in the swap with Russia?\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva, not a household name, was the last innocent to be captured and released by Moscow on Thursday. After a secret trial, the 47-year-old Russian American journalist at the Washington-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison on charges of spreading false information about the Russian army.\n\nBefore her arrest last October, Kurmasheva lived in Prague with with her husband and two daughters. She traveled from the Czech Republic to Russia to care for her elderly mother.\n\nIn February, Russia named RFE/RL as an undesirable organization. Kurmasheva’s crime? She failed to register her U.S. passport with the Russian authorities. In reality, Kurmasheva helped edit a book about the war in Ukraine that likely triggered the Kremlin.\n\nLast summer, her family had purchased tickets to see Taylor Swift perform.

Absolutely not.\n\nThe swap was nothing more than a temporary moment of convenience when Putin and Biden’s narrow political interests overlapped.

Biden, recovering from COVID-19 at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, had been under siege for weeks from Democrats who wanted him to drop out of the presidential race.\n\nHis own future now in doubt, Biden concentrated on the fate of the prisoners in Russia. His administration had been working for months and in some cases years, to bring them home. With an agreement finally within reach, Biden phoned one of his counterparts, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golog, to work out the final pieces of a deal that would set the prisoners free.\n\nAn hour later, Biden informed the world he was abandoning his campaign for a second term. Eleven days after that, the now lame-duck president stood in the White House State Dining Room, with some of the prisoners’ families by his side, and announced that their loved ones had been freed from Russian custody and were on their way home.\n\n“Their brutal ordeal is over,” Biden said, “and they are free.”\n\nThe deal that freed the Americans and others held in Russia – announced Thursday and finalized during a period of political and personal turmoil for Biden – is the largest prisoner exchange between Washington, Moscow and four other governments since the Cold War.\n\nAnalysts credited the Biden administration and U.S. allies with pulling off a historic agreement that involved months of delicate negotiations with Russia amid the ongoing fury over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine. Biden called the deal “a feat of diplomacy.”\n\n“I’ve done a lot of these operations, and I can tell you this stuff is extremely delicate, very, very hard and takes a lot of care and thought and talking to people who may not have our interests in mind,” said Bryan Stern, who has successfully negotiated the rescue of numerous hostages but was not involved in the prisoner swap discussions.\n\nFreed as the result of the deal were Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who Russia convicted of espionage charges in July, and former Marine Paul Whelan, who had been imprisoned in Russia on espionage charges since December 2018. The U.S. says the charges against both men were baseless.\n\nAll told, 24 prisoners were released under the agreement. They include 16 people previously detained in Russia in exchange for eight individuals held in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Slovenia and Poland.\n\nFor the families of the Americans detained, the nightmare was finally coming to an end.\n\n'Their brutal ordeal is over':Biden hails largest prisoner swap since Cold War\n\nBiden on prisoner swap: 'Get it done'\n\nSince taking office, the Biden administration had been working to free Whelan, who had been detained in Russia while Donald Trump was president. The arrests of Gershkovich in March 2023 and Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva the following October complicated the negotiations.\n\nPutin, it seemed, had made an art of kidnapping innocent civilians and then attempting to use them as bargaining chips to persuade other governments to return violent criminals to his regime.\n\nRussia would not agree to release any of the three Americans without an exchange that included Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin who had been jailed in Germany since 2021, said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nBecause he was in German custody, Krasikov was not someone the U.S. could offer to free as part of a prisoner swap.\n\nBiden reached out directly to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. But Germany was initially reluctant to help. Krasikov was serving a life sentence in Germany for killing a Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany. Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was gunned down by Krasikov in Kleiner Tiergarten, a central Berlin park, in 2019.\n\nWitnesses said Krasikov killed Khangoshvili by using a handgun with a silencer fitted onto it, which he then threw into the nearby Spree River, along with a bike and a dark wig he'd been wearing to disguise his identity.\n\n\"Germany was hit hard in the center of its capital when that thug ruthlessly killed a human being. No country can accept this and let this easily go,\" said one German official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the topic.\n\nThe German official said there was reluctance to free Krasikov as part of the prisoner swap with Russia. Doing so, Germany feared, would send a message that it cannot always protect its citizens or refugees who reside within its borders.\n\nThe shooting had represented a \"humiliation\" for Germany's security services, the German official said.\n\nMeanwhile, another influential party, Gershkovich's mother, Ella Milman, was working behind the scenes to get the negotiations moving.\n\nMilman, who was raised in Leningrad around the same time as Putin but who now lived in Philadelphia, continuously contacted Biden administration officials about her son's case, according to an account published by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nShe worked backchannels and official channels on her son's behalf. She traveled to Moscow for his appeal hearing. She walked up to Scholz at a gala dinner in New York and pressed him to help free Gershkovich. She approached Biden in a photo line at the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner in Washington and urged him to call the German leader to speed things along.\n\nA visit by Scholz to the White House on Feb. 9 helped move negotiations forward. During their meeting, Biden again implored Scholz to help. Scholz relented.\n\n“For you, I will do this,” Scholz told Biden, the senior U.S. administration official recalled.\n\nBiden then turned to National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and said: “Get it done.”\n\nNegotiators had originally hoped a deal would include the release of Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader and outspoken Putin critic. Navalny, arrested in what was widely viewed as an act of retribution by Putin and the Kremlin, died in February while serving a 19-year prison sentence.\n\nOn the day the U.S. learned of Navalny’s death, Sullivan held a previously scheduled meeting with Gershkovich's parents. The White House team working to free the prisoners worried that Navalny’s death was a blow to their efforts to free Gershkovich and Whelan. Sullivan, though, thought a deal was still possible. It would be a rocky path and would take longer – but it was still possible, the administration official said.\n\nSullivan instructed his team to come up with additional options to make a deal politically viable, particularly for the Germans.\n\nA few months later, roughly in April, Biden sent Scholz an outline of the proposal, drafted by Sullivan, that reflected more than a year of work. The deal would include the release of the Russian assassin Krasikov.\n\nKeep up with the political stories that matter in Washington and around the world. Sign up for our OnPolitics newsletter.\n\nMore:Beyond Paul Whelan, who else was released in the US-Russia prisoner swap\n\nThe deal is done\n\nThere were clues that a final deal was close.\n\nRep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., who represents the district in which Whelan lived and has advocated for his release, said she heard earlier this week that his whereabouts were unknown.\n\n“Is he getting punished? Are the Russians playing games? What's going on?” she recalled. “And then we started to hear some rumblings.”\n\nStevens, who co-chairs the Congressional Task Force on American Hostages, was at the White House on Thursday morning for an unrelated meeting when she heard of the impending exchange before it was made public, she said.\n\nStevens said her office is working to ensure Whelan can find a new home in Michigan and rebuild his life. She called for continued efforts to deter such wrongful detentions.\n\n“The pressure only remains. Foreign actors are going to continue to use Americans as pawns and target Americans to take them prisoner wrongfully,” she said, adding: “And we have to continue to push for the release of those remaining.”\n\nThe prisoner exchange came nearly a decade after the U.S. undertook a hostage policy overhaul that created a hostage envoy and recovery team. In 2022, Biden declared hostage-taking and wrongful detention a national emergency, adding new tools such as financial sanctions and visa bans.\n\nIn recent years, families have more publicly pressed the U.S. government to find ways to return their loved ones.\n\nA report earlier this year from the Foley Foundation, which advocates for the freedom of Americans held captive abroad, found there were more than 40 American nationals known to be held captive unjustly in 16 countries. The foundation was created by Diane Foley less than a month after her son, James Foley, an American freelance journalist, was beheaded by ISIS in Syria in 2014.\n\nThe foundation's report noted that the number of U.S. nationals in detention, after peaking in 2022, has fallen amid efforts to secure their freedom.\n\nThe key complication in the latest prisoner swap – Russia’s demand to release a prisoner held by Germany, not the United States – required “painstaking conversations, not just between adversaries, but also between allies,” said Danielle Gilbert, a professor at Northwestern University who researches hostage policy.\n\nGilbert is part of a commission at the Center for Strategic and International Studies working to develop strategies to disincentivize the practice without closing the door to exchanges, such as by enlisting pressure from third-party countries. But it’s a challenge, she said, in part, because such governments are often already under U.S. economic sanctions.\n\n“It's heartening news to know that even in the midst of war and tensions that these backchannels do exist and the negotiations are possible,” she said. “But it also leaves open the question of how do governments like the United States try to curb this practice going forward and ensure that they don't have to make these deals so often?”\n\nWhile successful exchanges often come with worries they will “embolden some bad actors to imprison another journalist or traveler,” the difficult calculus should favor detained Americans, said Cameron Hume, a former U.S. ambassador and consultant with the Richardson Center, which has advocated on behalf of Whelan’s family for his return but was not involved in Thursday’s prisoner swap.\n\n“I think our society has a duty to bring folks home that, on balance, outweighs the merit of another year in prison for an assassin,” Hume said.\n\nMore:Brittney Griner on Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich being released: 'It's a great day'\n\n'Everybody stepped up'\n\nAt the White House on Thursday, with the prisoners' family members by his side, Biden thanked U.S. allies for their role in making the prisoner swap happen. He specifically cited German chancellor Scholz.\n\nRussia's demands that the assassin Krasikov be released as part of a deal required \"some significant concessions from Germany, which they originally concluded they could not do because of the person in question,\" Biden said.\n\nThe final agreement \"is a powerful example of why it’s vital to have friends in this world – friends you can trust, work with, and depend upon, especially on matters of great consequence and sensitivity like this,\" Biden said.\n\nNear the end of his remarks, Biden brought to the lectern Miriam Butorin, the young daughter of Kurmasheva, the Russian American journalist who was among those prisoners freed.\n\nMiriam turns 13 on Friday. And Biden had a surprise for the young girl.\n\nHe hugged her and then asked the room to sing \"Happy Birthday.\" Biden led the singalong in a grandfatherly voice that was at times slightly off-key.\n\n“Remember, no serious guys till you're 30,” he teased.\n\nTurning serious, Biden said Miriam will now get to celebrate her birthday with her mom − like they should have been able to do all along.\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook, Francesca Chambers and Joey Garrison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/12/10/brittney-griner-exchanged-viktor-bout-history-prisoner-swaps/10865122002/", "title": "From 'Bridge of Spies' to Brittney Griner, tense prisoner exchanges ...", "text": "After the two prisoners walked past each other on the airport tarmac in Abu Dhabi – American basketball star Brittney Griner and Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, nicknamed the \"Merchant of Death\" – this week's high-stakes exchange between the U.S. and Russia was finally complete.\n\nThat tense moment came just eight months after the Biden Administration swapped Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot and drug smuggler, for ex-U.S. Marine Trevor Reed, who had been held in Russia on espionage charges since 2018.\n\nBoth became part of a history of delicate and difficult prisoner swaps with Russia, Iran and other adversarial nations. Such swaps, including the one for Griner, have been deeply controversial, yet the tradition in the modern era stretches back to the return of a downed U-2 spy plane pilot in 1962.\n\nMore:Prisoner swap negotiations were 'painstaking, extraordinary'\n\nExperts say each case is unique and often requires intricate negotiations and difficult choices.\n\n“Often, the price we pay for bringing our fellow Americans home to their families is unseemly, but it is the right thing to do,” Bill Richardson, a former United Nations ambassador who has helped secure the release of U.S. detainees in Cuba, North Korea and elsewhere, said in a statement.\n\nMore:A complete timeline leading up to WNBA star's release\n\nHow do prisoner swaps work?\n\nPrisoner exchanges have occurred throughout history with soldiers captured during war.\n\nBut peacetime swaps of civilians, like the one involving Griner, are far less predictable.\n\nThey may involve Americans held hostage by terrorist groups or U.S. residents deemed to have been wrongly detained under foreign criminal charges.\n\nDetainees, such as two U.S. veterans captured while volunteering in Ukraine this year, are viewed as bargaining chips, according to Melvyn Levitsky, a professor of international policy at the University of Michigan and a retired U.S. ambassador.\n\nMore:Americans held captive by Russian separatists in Ukraine have returned to the US\n\nThe U.S. State Department's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs handles cases of Americans who are kidnapped and those the U.S. considers to be detained wrongfully or unlawfully overseas, Danielle Gilbert, Dartmouth College professor and top expert on international hostage situations, told USA TODAY.\n\nAlso helping is a coordinated response team of diplomats, intelligence agents and law enforcement officials. That team was put in place beginning after prisoners including journalist James Foley and others died as captives of the Islamic State. In that case and others, relatives of detained Americans had complained that American policies prevented them from effectively working to free their loved ones.\n\nMore:An American is detained or goes missing abroad. What happens next?\n\nIndependent negotiators or well-connected intermediaries can also work on behalf of the captured Americans.\n\nFor example, Richardson's nonprofit agency, the Richardson Center, has worked to win the release of detainees including several Americans held by Colombia’s Revolutionary Armed Forces and the 2009 release of a U.S. journalist sentenced to prison in North Korea.\n\nUltimately, the State Department and White House often make the decisions about the trades, Levitsky said.\n\n“It depends upon what country we’re dealing with and what that relationship looks like. There’s not a cookie-cutter solution,” he said.\n\nHow common are prisoner swaps today?\n\nGilbert said situations where the U.S. is trying to free an American from wrongful criminal detention by a nation, rather than a terrorist group, have increased since 2015.\n\n“The phenomenon is growing,” she said, estimating there are now a handful of prisoner exchanges each year.\n\nFormer President Trump made several high-profile efforts to free Americans. In 2019, for example, Trump publicly pushed Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan to release North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson.\n\nThat same year, the State Department said it had helped release more than 180 Americans since 2015.\n\nToday there are 60 U.S. nationals and U.S. lawful permanent residents held in publicly disclosed hostage and wrongful detention cases in 18 countries including Russia, Iran, China, Venezuela and Mali, according to the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation.\n\nAmong them is Paul Whelan, an ex-Marine from Michigan, arrested in Moscow in 2018 and accused of spying for the U.S. government. His family has said he was a security director for an automotive-parts company and was in Russia for a wedding.\n\nExperts said that while Russia refused to include Whelan in the swap for Bout, the publicity surrounding the case may increase pressure and efforts to win his release through some kind of exchange.\n\nWhat are some notable prisoner exchanges?\n\nOne of the best-known happened in 1962, a swap later portrayed in the Steven Spielberg Cold War movie “Bridge of Spies.”\n\nIn that case, the U.S. won the release of U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers, who was shot down and captured by the Soviet Union, in exchange for Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, a Soviet intelligence officer.\n\nOther Cold War exchanges included trading U.S. reporter Nicholas Daniloff, then a Moscow-based reporter for U.S. News & World Report, for Gennadi Zakharov, the Soviet employee of the United Nations arrested for allegedly handing over money to a contact for classified U.S. Air Force documents.\n\nMore recently, in 2014 during the war in Afghanistan, the Obama administration released five Taliban prisoners for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held by the Taliban after leaving his base.\n\nTwo years later, in the context of the U.S.- Iran nuclear deal, the U.S. won the release of journalist Jason Rezaian, imprisoned on espionage-related charges, in exchange for Iranians who had been charged with violating U.S. sanctions.\n\nIn September, two American veterans held captive by Russian separatists in Ukraine since June returned after a Saudi-brokered swap with Russian-backed separatists that included eight other prisoners from four countries.\n\nAre prisoner swaps controversial?\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in July said the U.S. had made a \"substantial offer\" in exchange for the Griner and Whelan.\n\nBut White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and senior administration officials said this week that Russia would not engage in good faith negotiations for Whelan.\n\n\"It was either Brittney or no one at all,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nSome critics have argued that Bout’s crimes are mismatched with Griner’s alleged crimes – possessing cannabis vape cartridges. Bout, 55, a former Soviet military officer, was serving a 25-year prison sentence for conspiring to kill Americans, acquiring and exporting anti-aircraft missiles, and providing material support to a terrorist organization. Bout claimed he was innocent.\n\nGilbert said while Bout is very prominent, others traded by the U.S. in exchanges have been convicted of crimes such as violating sanctions against other nations or involvement in cybercrimes.\n\nSome also argue that exchanging prisoners could encourage other countries to detain Americans, she said. While it’s not clear yet that’s happened, she said, “that’s a live debate, and I think that’s a legitimate concern.\"\n\nTulane University political science professor Chris Fettweis said in a statement that – despite the criticism by some – he believes Griner's release was a positive outcome.\n\n“Griner was a political prisoner.

At least 14 Americans are among the dead, U.S. officials said.\n\nIsraeli Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said the bodies of 1,500 militants were found around southern Israel. Another 900 people have been killed and 4,500 injured in Israeli strikes in Gaza, Hamas health officials said.\n\n“There is no safe place in Gaza right now. You see decent people being killed every day,” Hasan Jabar said after three fellow journalists were killed in the ferocious bombardment.\n\nMore than 200,000 people in Gaza have fled their homes, the U.N. said, as the violence shows no sign of abating. Three militants were killed after a gun battle in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, which was also the site of a rocket attack, Israel's military said.\n\nIsrael's overwhelming response may foreshadow a concerted attempt to end Hamas' reign, some experts believe, in contrast to the four previous conflicts since 2008, which essentially ended with the sides deadlocked and the militant organization still in power.\n\n“The objective is for this war to end very differently from all of the previous rounds,'' said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy national security adviser in Israel. \"There has to be a clear victory.”\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to arrive in Israel on Thursday to \"engage our Israeli partners directly about the situation on the ground\" and offer U.S. help, the State Department said.\n\n∎ Israel's mobilization has grown to 360,000 reservists.\n\n∎ The United Nations health agency says the medical supplies pre-positioned in seven Gaza hospitals have already been used. Humanitarian organizations are asking for corridors to get aid into Gaza.\n\n∎ Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday blamed U.S. foreign policy for the war. Moscow has been talking to both Israel and the Palestinians to help seek a settlement, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.\n\n∎There are 20 Thai nationals feared dead, 13 injured and 14 kidnapped, the country’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said Wednesday during a news briefing, citing reports from workers and their employers.\n\nIsraeli retaliation:Could be felt 'for generations'; FBI searching for Americans impacted by attack\n\nFirst plane carrying US armaments lands in Israel, IDF says\n\nA plane carrying advanced armaments designed to \"facilitate significant military operations\" landed Tuesday evening at the Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel, the Israel Defense Forces said.\n\n“We are grateful for the US backing and assistance to the IDF, and to the State of Israel in general, during this challenging period,\" the IDF said in a statement. \"Our common enemies know that the cooperation between our militaries is stronger than ever, and is a key part in ensuring regional security and stability.\"\n\nBiden says Hamas atrocities like 'the worst rampages of ISIS'\n\nPresident Joe Biden expressed the United States' unequivocal support for Israel in the crisis while denouncing the \"pure, unadulterated evil'' Hamas unleashed in its attack.\n\nIn a Tuesday afternoon address, Biden also updated the U.S. death total to 14 and confirmed Americans were among the hostages taken in Saturday's assault. The number remains unclear, but national security adviser Jake Sullivan said 20 or more Americans remain unaccounted for, though that doesn't mean all are being held captive.\n\nBiden spared no detail in outlining the atrocities committed by Hamas militants as they \"slaughtered'' more than 1,000 civilians.\n\n“Parents butchered using their bodies to try to protect their children,'' Biden said. \"Stomach-turning reports of babies being killed. Entire families slain. Young people massacred while attending a music festival to celebrate peace – to celebrate peace. Women raped, assaulted and paraded as trophies. … These traumas never go away.’’\n\nThe president branded those actions as terrorism, said they evoked thoughts of \"the worst rampages of ISIS'' and vowed Israel will have the tools necessary to respond.\n\nWhite House committed to Ukraine funding while aiding Israel\n\nThe White House said Biden’s push for additional aid for Israel won’t deter from efforts to secure more U.S. funding for Ukraine.\n\nBiden said Tuesday he plans to ask Congress to take \"urgent action to fund the national security requirements” of allies after last weekend’s brutal Hamas attack in Israel. The U.S. has already provided Israel with additional ammunition and interceptors to replenish Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, Biden said.\n\n\"We're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens,\" he said.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas conflict comes as the U.S. is also asking Congress to approve additional U.S. aid for Ukraine in its war against Russia. Sullivan said the administration remains committed to both Israel and Ukraine, although details of the funding package remain unclear.\n\n\"The notion that we're going to go up and ask for Israel aid and Ukraine aid, that's unequivocal,\" Sullivan said. \"We are going to do that.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison and Maureen Groppe\n\nHamas overwhelmed Iron Dome with thousands of rockets\n\nHow did Hamas beat Israel's vaunted Iron Dome? By overwhelming it.\n\nThe militant group's Saturday incursion into Israeli soil was accompanied by a barrage of between 2,200 and 5,000 rockets − the sides differ on the number − launched from Gaza in a mere 20 minutes. The Israeli defensive system, with an accuracy rate of up to 96%, couldn't keep pace.\n\n“With thousands of rockets in the air in a very short period of time, there is not a single air defense system in the world that's going to be able to cope with that,\" Ben Barry, Senior Fellow for Land Warfare at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, told thenationnews.com.\n\nIran denies playing a role, praises attack\n\nTehran was not involved in the attack by Hamas, but Israel is to blame for the war, Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Tuesday. Iran, however, also has denied providing drones to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine despite extensive evidence that the armed drones were Iranian-built.\n\nThe Tehran Times said Khamenei, at a graduation ceremony for military cadets, praised the Hamas militants and said Israel and its supporters must know that Israel's retaliatory bombardments targeting Gaza will lead to “a heavier slap on their ugly face.\"\n\n“When injustice and crime exacerbate, when savagery reaches its height, one should wait for a storm,” Khamenei said.\n\nIran involvement could have significant impact on crisis\n\nThe U.S. and Israeli governments say they don’t – as of yet – have any direct evidence the Tehran government was behind the Hamas terrorist attacks. But a senior U.S. official said Monday night that Iran certainly is complicit in funding Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement, providing it weapons and training its paramilitary forces.\n\nAnalysts say direct Iranian involvement could have a significant impact on a rapidly intensifying crisis that until now has been limited to battles between Israeli and Hamas forces.\n\nIran \"has historically been the largest state sponsor of terrorism,\" said Andrew Borene, former senior executive in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \"And they are the most active state sponsor of terrorism. So it's not without cause that people are investigating that thread.\"\n\n− Josh Meyer\n\nIsrael kills two senior Hamas officials\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces said it killed Hamas Minister of Economy Jawad Abu Shamala. The IDF said he funneled money for financing and directing terrorism inside and outside Gaza. Abu Shamala previously held security positions and led several operations aimed at Israeli citizens, the IDF said.\n\nAn IDF aircraft also killed Zakaria Abu Ma'amr, a senior member of the Hamas Political Bureau and the head of the Ministry of National Relations, the military entity said. Abu Ma'amr \"did a lot of work to incite and act against the sovereignty of the State of Israel and endanger its residents,\" the IDF said, adding that he also belonged to the organization's senior forum and was involved in decision-making and planning of terrorists attacks.\n\n'The sound of revenge': Israeli strikes raze parts of Gaza City\n\nThe Israeli retaliation has not been limited to the border towns from where the Hamas attack was launched but has also targeted the heart of Gaza City, the upscale Rimal neighborhood that's home to shopping malls, restaurants and residential and office buildings − but also the Hamas government ministries.\n\nThe extent of the destruction from hundreds of airstrikes Monday is astonishing. From demolished mosques and university buildings to ruined luxury apartment towers and high-rise offices − including those for the Gaza Bar Association − the Israeli fury was felt far and wide.\n\n“Israel has destroyed the center of everything,” Palestinian businessman Ali al-Hiyak said from his home near Rimal. “That is the space of our public life, our community.”\n\nResidents said the Israeli bombing was more powerful and destructive than anything they had experienced over four previous wars with Hamas, which assumed power in 2007.\n\n“These sounds are different,” Saman Ashour, 30, texted from north of Rimal as she listened to explosions. “It’s the sound of revenge.”\n\nRed Cross attempting to visit hostages, prisoners\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it was attempting to gain access to people being held on both sides to provide medical care and learn news of their fate for their loved ones. Fabrizio Carboni, regional director for the Near and Middle East, said kidnapping is prohibited under international humanitarian law and that anyone detained, including combatants, must be treated \"humanely and with dignity.\" Health care workers must be protected to ensure people needing help can receive treatment, he said.\n\n“The violence directed against civilians is appalling and cannot be justified,\" Carboni said in a statement. \"If the situation continues to escalate, then civilians on both sides will suffer immensely.\"\n\nIs Iran behind Hamas terrorist attacks?What it would mean for US and Middle East security\n\nWar hits home: American family mourns loss of soldier\n\nAryeh Ziering was raised Israeli but had American parents. He lived in a mixed Hebrew- and English- speaking neighborhood. He spent summers in Maine, loved baseball and hiking and felt a sense of duty as a soldier in the Israeli Defense Forces. Ziering, 27, a captain in a canine unit who served in the Israeli military for six years, was killed Saturday.\n\n\"We're shattered,\" said his aunt Debby Ziering, who lives in Connecticut. \"I know they prepare for war but you never really think that it'll be your family. It's just so hard.\" Read more here.\n\n− Alexandra Rivera, Rockland/Westchester Journal News\n\nChaos at Florida vigil for Israel\n\nMore than 30 University of Florida students were sent to a local hospital late Monday after a vigil for victims in Israel erupted in chaos with students trampling over others. Rabbi Berl Goldman with Chabad UF said he was with school President Ben Sasse at the “United with Israel” candlelight vigil at UF's Turlington Plaza when someone in the crowd fainted or fell, and people began yelling \"911,\" campus police said. Earlier accounts of the incident included some fearing they heard gunshots, though no shots were fired. It is believed that the person's bag or items dropped to create a loud noise.\n\n− Andrew Caplan, Gainesville Sun\n\nWhat started the war in Israel?\n\nThe Israeli military estimated 1,000 Hamas fighters crashed across the Israeli border Saturday, igniting a rampage that included shooting hundreds of civilians and kidnapping dozens who were transported back to Gaza. Hamas, the largest Palestinian militant group, also has fired rockets from Gaza that have riddled Israeli cities.\n\nMohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ military wing, said “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm,” was a response to activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem that is the third holiest site in Islam. The site, which is also located on the holiest site for Jews − who refer to it as the Temple Mount − has long been a flashpoint between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli security services routinely raid the compound.\n\n“Enough is enough,” Deif, said in a recorded message. “Today the people are regaining their revolution.”\n\nDiplomatic connections developing between Israel and some Arab nations have also been a concern to Hamas and to Iran. The war could compel those Arab nations to choose a side.\n\nJews, Palestinians in US fearful after Hamas attack\n\nRipples of fears and countless prayers for an end to the violence traveled through Jewish, Israeli and Palestinian-linked communities in the United States this week. Some groups held prayer meetings while others worried about local attacks, immediately beefing up security and urging community members to be vigilant as the death toll from the battle overseas climbed.\n\nThe attacks came toward the end of Sukkot, a weeklong celebration marking the time Jews lived in the desert after escaping slavery in Egypt. As news of the tragedy spread, many Jewish and Israeli communities in the United States shifted from celebrating to holding vigils and protests.\n\n“There’s an unspoken deep bond and connection that no matter where we are, we have this shared pain,” said Melissa Chapman, chief executive officer of the Jewish Community Center in Berkeley, California.

The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho controls the Gaza Strip?\n\nHamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.\n\nWho is Hamas' leader?\n\nDeif leads the military wing while Yahya Sinwar and Ismail Haniyeh are the senior leaders of Hamas. Haniyeh has warned Arab countries against making diplomatic inroads with Israel.\n\n“We are on the verge of a great victory and a clear conquest on the Gaza front,\" he said in a speech broadcast Saturday on Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV. \"Enough is enough, the cycle of intifadas and revolutions in the battle to liberate our land and our prisoners languishing in occupation (Israeli) prisons must be completed.”\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or Islamic resistance movement. The group’s charter calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel. The militant organization is committed to the destruction of Israel and has been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., the EU and various nations. The political wing of Hamas has controlled Gaza since 2007.\n\nIt was founded by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Islamist organization with ties to Egypt. Iran provides Hamas with financial, material and logistical support. Hamas also cooperates with Hezbollah, another Iran-backed, U.S.-designated terrorist group, based in Lebanon.\n\nClash dates to ancient times\n\nThe dispute is rooted in pre-biblical times. Though its borders have shifted over the years, Palestinian territories used to be what is now Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Both Israeli Jews’ and Palestinian Arabs’ history, culture and identity are linked to the Palestinian territories. Jewish migration from eastern and central Europe surged from 1922 to 1947 as Jews fled persecution and the destruction of their communities, most notably during World War II. As the number of Jewish immigrants increased, many Palestinians were displaced. They began pushing back and violence resulted.\n\nIn 1948, the Jewish People's Council met in Tel Aviv and established the State of Israel. The U.S. officially recognized the new nation later that day; the USSR acknowledges it three days later.

For the latest, view our file for Thursday, Aug. 1.\n\nHamas' top political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed Wednesday in an apparent assassination at his residence in Tehran, drawing reprisal pledges from the militant group and Iran and fueling deeper concern that Israel's war in Gaza could rapidly expand across the Middle East.\n\nHaniyeh and his bodyguard were killed after attending an inauguration ceremony for the new Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, Hamas and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard announced.\n\nHamas and Iran immediately blamed Israel, which has pledged to take down Hamas leaders responsible for the Oct. 7 attack that left almost 1,200 people dead and about 250 taken hostage.\n\nSpeaking to the nation in Hebrew, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not address Haniyeh's death but said, according to a translation: \"We are not going to be silent. We'll make everyone pay the price, everyone that murders us, anyone that takes our children.''\n\nHaniyeh's death took place just hours after Israel confirmed its \"intelligence-based elimination\" of top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr outside the Lebanese capital of Beirut.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. was not involved and stressed the \"imperative of getting a cease-fire\" in Gaza.\n\nWho was Ismail Haniyeh?What to know about the Hamas leader killed in Iran\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The U.S. State Department is advising Americans not to travel to Lebanon in light of \"rising tensions'' between Israel and Hezbollah. On Wednesday the department increased its Lebanon travel advisory to four, the highest level, and said U.S. citizens in Lebanon should be prepared to shelter in place if hostilities grow.\n\n∎ Khaled Meshaal, the Qatar-based second-in-command who in 1997 survived an assassination attempt by Israel, is expected to succeed Haniyeh, according to Hamas officials and regional analysts.\n\n∎ United Airlines confirmed to USA TODAY that it's suspending daily flights to Israel, beginning with the scheduled Wednesday night flight from Newark Airport in New Jersey to Tel Aviv, for security reasons.\n\n∎ Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas declared a day of mourning for Haniyeh's death and called his killing \"a cowardly act and a dangerous development,'' the state-run Wafa news agency reported. The PA, which controls part of the West Bank, has a longstanding rivalry with Hamas. However, the PA's leading faction, Fatah, reached a deal with Hamas last week to form a Gaza government together at an unspecified point.\n\nHamas, Iran pledge retaliation\n\nAl-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, promised a strong response to Haniyeh's death, calling the assassination \"incentive for everyone to back and support the resistance\" in Gaza and elsewhere. The group said in a statement that Israel \"miscalculated\" by killing resistance leaders and violating the sovereignty of Iran and Lebanon.\n\n\"The criminal assassination of leader Haniyeh in the heart of the Iranian capital is a watershed and dangerous event that takes the war to new levels and will have enormous consequences for the entire region,\" the statement said\n\nPezeshkian, Iran's president, said Israel would regret its \"cowardly action.\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, said it was his nation's responsibility to take action since the attack took place in Iran. Khamenei ordered Iranian forces Wednesday to hit Israel directly, the New York Times reported, although the scope of the attack and whether it would trigger an escalation remain unclear.\n\n\"The criminal and terrorist Zionist regime martyred our beloved guest inside our house and made us mournful, but it paved the way for a harsh punishment to be imposed,\" Khamenei said in a statement.\n\nEven less-directly impacted Middle East nations like Qatar and Egypt were critical of the killing. Both have been playing a mediating role in the negotiations for a cease-fire and the release of hostages.\n\n\"Political assassinations and continued targeting of civilians in Gaza while talks continue leads us to ask, how can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?\" Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on social media.\n\nHow will Iran retaliate?\n\nRegional analyst Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official, told USA TODAY he expects Iran will use its proxies, including Hezbollah, to target Israel in retaliation for both attacks. Likely targets would be significant Israeli military installations rather than civilians or civil infrastructure, he said.\n\n\"The calculation against a direct response likely includes the understanding that a direct attack on Israel could potentially reinitiate the U.S.-led defensive coalition,\" Melamed said. \"Iran is walking a tightrope in needing to respond without sucking itself and Israel into a broader pattern of escalation that brings a significant Israeli response to its homeland.”\n\nMideast war concerns:Hezbollah and Israel trade attacks, raising fears of a wider war\n\nNetanyahu defiant against 'pressure from many places'\n\nNetanyahu’s defiant address appeared to be aimed not only at Israeli citizens, of whom he requested patience as they clamor for the hostages’ return, but also likely the Biden administration, which has publicly supported Israel while demanding Netanyahu curb the assault on Gaza.\n\n“People said to me, ‘Finish the war,’’’ Netanyahu said, according to a translation of his Hebrew-language speech. “We exhausted what we could do, and we can’t win. I wasn’t giving in to these voices then or today. If I was giving in, we would not get rid of (Hamas).’’\n\nNetanyahu touted the successes of the Israeli attacks, particularly the killing of Shukr, and said Israel is closing in on the framework of a hostage deal while making sure Gaza will no longer present a threat.\n\n“All these achievements in the last few months we managed because we took brave decisions, and it wasn’t easy,’’ he said. “I had to make sure not to be under pressure from many places.’’\n\nKilling could doom cease-fire talks\n\nAt the time of his killing, Haniyeh was playing a leading role in negotiations to reach a cease-fire with Israel in exchange for freeing hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, where they have been for nearly 10 months.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters it was too soon to know how Haniyeh's death will impact efforts to reach an agreement, which have stalled for months.\n\n\"It was always complicated. It remains complicated,'' Kirby said. \"And the reports coming out of the region, as we've seen over the last 24 to 48 hours, certainly don't make it less complicated.\"\n\nIran has long accused Israel of carrying out targeted assassinations on its soil, including of its top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2021. The adversaries have also long fought a so-called shadow war, which spilled out into the open for the first time in April when they shattered a taboo by directly attacking each other with limited strikes.\n\nIran expert Trita Parsi, who is the co-founder of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington think tank, said if it's confirmed Israel killed Haniyeh, it may \"end serious expectations of a cease-fire deal,\" damage renewed U.S.-Iran diplomacy expected with Pezeshkian's administration and \"trigger an escalatory spiral.\"\n\nNetanyahu accused of intentionally expanding war\n\nMichael DiMino, a former CIA intelligence analyst and military expert at Defense Priorities, a Washington think tank, said Iran and Hezbollah will be \"under immense pressure\" to respond forcefully. DiMino added that the U.S. will likely \"reflexively\" send more assets to the region.\n\nIranian Abbas Aslani, a senior research fellow at the Tehran-based Center for Middle East Strategic Studies, told Al Jazeera he expects a harsh response from Iran. He, like Hamas and others, accused Netanyahu of trying to expand the war in Gaza, where nearly 40,000 Palestinians have died in Israel's retaliatory attacks.\n\n\"Over the past nine months, Israel has been making efforts to extend and escalate the war to a broader regional scale,\" Aslani said. \"They also aim to involve the U.S. in this conflict.\"\n\nWashington working to ease tensions\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, on a trip in the Philippines, said Wednesday the U.S. is trying to \"take the temperature down.\" He said he had no additional information on the reports of Haniyeh's death.\n\nHaniyeh, the former prime minister of Gaza, was Hamas' top leader, known for his tough-talking rhetoric as the face of the group. From his headquarters in Qatar he was in charge of the group's international relations. Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, the Gaza-based leaders of Hamas' military wing, are believed to be the masterminds behind the group's Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nHaniyeh's killing makes hostage deal 'more challenging,' Sen. Cardin says\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Haniyeh's killing \"makes it much more challenging\" to secure an agreement for a truce and release of the hostages, pointing out Haniyeh was one of Hamas' lead negotiators.\n\nCardin was not surprised Israel would target Shukr, saying the Hezbollah commander had \"blood on his hands,\" but expressed concern that Shukr's assassination taking place deep into Lebanon could escalate a simmering conflict.\n\n\"Escalation is not in Israel's interest, it's not in the United States' interest, it's not in the region's interest,\" Cardin said.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nServices Thursday in Tehran, Friday in Doha\n\nA funeral service will be held for Haniyeh in Tehran on Thursday, Hamas said in a statement. Iran' Mehr News Agency said Khamenei will lead prayers in a ceremony at the University of Tehran before a funeral procession in the capital city. Haniyeh's body will then be transferred to the Qatari capital of Doha for services Friday, and he will be buried there. The services are expected to draw thousands of mourners.\n\nShukr's body was found Wednesday underneath rubble from Tuesday's strike in the outskirts of Beirut. Also Wednesday, services were held for two children killed in the blast, with mourners chanting \"death to Israel\" and \"America is the Great Satan.\" Israel said that attack was in retaliation for a rocket attack on a soccer field in the Israel-occupied Golan Heights on Saturday that killed 12 people, mostly children.\n\nContributing: Joshuan Rivera, USA TODAY; Reuters.

What it would mean for US and Middle East security\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered a “complete siege” on Gaza, pledging to cut electricity and cut off food and fuel into the impoverished home to more than 2 million Palestinians. The Israeli military, which called up 300,000 reservists, pounded Gaza with an aerial assault aimed at halting Hamas rockets toward Israel's border towns. In response, Hamas threatened to kill hostages if attacks targeted civilians without warning.\n\nIn a short evening address to the nation in Hebrew, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the retaliatory strikes in Gaza were merely a starting point.\n\n“What will be done to our enemies in the coming days will resonate with them for generations,'' he said, according to a CNN translation. \"At the end of the campaign, all our enemies will know it was a terrible mistake to attack Israel.’’\n\nNetanyahu also visited towns bordering Gaza, where thousands of Israelis were evacuated, and pledged the government's help to local leaders.\n\nPalestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, in a social media post Monday, said there were \"massacres taking place and entire families wiped out\" in Gaza, and more than 100,000 have been displaced. He again blamed Israel for the war, claiming years of \"occupation and aggression.\"\n\nEmerging reports indicate Iran, a longtime Hamas backer, was behind the attacks, but a White House adviser said the administration has no \"direct information'' about such involvement.\n\nMore than 123K displaced in Gaza:US sending warships, ammunition to Israel\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Israeli Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the military has taken full control of communities bordering Gaza and that only sporadic fighting was ongoing.\n\n∎ The death toll includes about 900 in Israel and more than 680 in Gaza, home to 2.3 million Palestinians. Hamas claimed four hostages it kidnapped were killed by Israeli airstrikes, which the Health Ministry in Gaza said have injured more than 3,700. Israel has reported more than 2,500 injured.\n\n∎ Rescue workers found 100 bodies in the farming village of Beeri – about 10% of its population – after a long hostage standoff with gunmen east of the Gaza Strip.\n\n∎ The White House said President Joe Biden is having his team coordinate with Israel \"on all aspects of the crisis and to continue their work with regional partners to warn anyone who might seek to take advantage in this situation.''\n\n∎ The Biden administration said the White House will be illuminated in the blue and white of the Israeli flag Monday night \"as a symbol of the United States’ 75-year relationship'' with Israel and the American support in the wake of the attacks.\n\n11 Americans killed in Israel, others may be hostages\n\nThe known U.S. death toll has been rising. Biden said in a statement Monday afternoon that the total is up to 11. \"It’s heart-wrenching,'' he said. \"These families have been torn apart by inexcusable hatred and violence.''\n\nThe president also said some U.S. citizens remain unaccounted for, and \"it is likely that American citizens may be among those being held by Hamas,'' adding his administration is working with Israeli officials to free the hostages.\n\nIt's not clear how many Americans may have been kidnapped. Hamas and other militants claim to have more than 130 hostages, and Abu Obeida, the spokesman for Hamas’ armed wing, said a captive Israeli civilian will be killed any time Israel targets civilians in their Gaza homes “without prior warning.”\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby was asked if the administration would involve U.S. troops in a war between Israel and Hamas, especially if Iran or the militant group Hezbollah were found responsible for the attacks.\n\n\"There's no intention to put U.S. boots on the ground,'' Kirby said, adding that the president would do whatever is necessary to protect the nation's security.\n\nFBI searching for Americans impacted by attack\n\nThe FBI announced late Monday that it had personnel on the ground in Israel to investigate, locate, and identify Americans impacted by the conflict.\n\nThere is no specific or credible threat to the United States related to the Hamas attack on Israel, the agency said in the statement.

We've obviously seen it. We're looking into it, but we do not have the ability to corroborate it at this time.”\n\n− Josh Meyer\n\nMaps and graphics show how Hamas militants' deadly raid unfolded – and how fighting will get worse\n\nIsrael requests weapons from US\n\nIn his speech, Netanyahu thanked the Biden administration for its support, and privately his government has asked the Pentagon for a number of weapons, including missile interceptors for its Iron Dome system and artillery rounds. The White House has already responded by saying that the first installment of weapons is on the way.\n\nIsrael is also requesting precision-guided arms, which typically use satellite or lasers to direct explosives to the target to minimize harm to civilians and infrastructure. The weapons include missiles, multiple-launched rockets and bombs that can be fired form aircraft, ships or on through artillery or rocket launchers.\n\nThe anticipated request from the White House for supplemental funding faces uncertainty in Congress, where the House lacks a permanent speaker after Republican Kevin McCarthy was deposed last week.\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nUS and European allies back Israel, condemn Hamas\n\nThe U.S. and four of its European allies − the U.K., Germany, France and Italy − issued a statement supporting Israel and denouncing Hamas' \"appalling acts of terrorism.''\n\n\"In recent days, the world has watched in horror as Hamas terrorists massacred families in their homes, slaughtered over 200 young people enjoying a music festival, and kidnapped elderly women, children, and entire families, who are now being held as hostages,'' the statement said.\n\nIt went on to acknowledge the Palestinians' aspirations and the equal right for them and Israelis to pursue freedom and justice, adding, \"Make no mistake: Hamas does not represent those aspirations, and it offers nothing for the Palestinian people other than more terror and bloodshed.''\n\nThe statement, which also pledged help for Israel in defending itself, did not qualify as coming from the G7 nations because it lacked the signatures of Japan and Canada, though both countries have condemned the attacks.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the White House lit up in blue and white in \"enduring support and solidarity\" with Israel.\n\nIsrael says it is not conducting hostage negotiations\n\nHamas has said militants are holding about 130 hostages but said an update on the number would be released soon. Hamas has demanded that all Palestinians held in Israeli prisons be released. Hossam Badran, a Hamas official, told Agence France-Presse the militants won't negotiate a prisoner exchange while the \"military operation is still continuing.\"\n\nIsrael said it was not involved in negotiations aimed at securing the release of any hostages. The Egyptian news website Al-Ahram, citing \"informed sources,\" said Egyptian authorities were trying to arrange a deal to secure the release of Palestinian women and children prisoners held in Israeli custody in exchange for Hamas releasing Israeli \"civilian women\" who were taken captive since the violence began Saturday.\n\n“The Egyptian government is presently awaiting responses from both parties regarding the proposed prisoners exchange and a temporary cease-fire,” Al-Ahram said.\n\nGaza takes a beating from Israeli retaliation, 187,000 displaced\n\nThe Gaza Ministry of Public Works and Housing estimated hundreds of housing units have been destroyed and more than 1,200 severely damaged.

It’s estimated that about 3,000 Palestinians are displaced in the region from previous conflicts.\n\nThe United Nations humanitarian affairs office said Israeli strikes have targeted houses and apartment buildings in Gaza, sometimes without warning for residents to evacuate.\n\nFour large residential towers with multiple floors in Gaza city were destroyed. Israeli forces reportedly provided prior warnings in these cases, the agency said, and there were no fatalities reported. Damage to infrastructure from Israeli airstrikes has undermined the provision of water, sanitation and other services to more than 400,000 people, the agency said.\n\nSince the conflict began, four schools and eight healthcare facilities in Gaza have been damaged, according to the UN report. More than 900 Israelis were killed and at least 2,616 were injured in the conflict, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs cited local media in its latest report.\n\nThe UN, citing the Ministry of Health in Gaza, said at least 687 Palestinians were killed and about 3,800 injured.\n\nAt least 50 civilians and military personnel have been taken captive, according to the Ministry of Health in Israel.

The group’s charter calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel. The militant organization is committed to the destruction of Israel and has been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., the EU and various nations. The political wing of Hamas has controlled Gaza since winning elections in 2007.\n\nThe Israeli military estimated 1,000 Hamas fighters crashed across the Israeli border Saturday, igniting a rampage that included shooting hundreds of civilians and kidnapping people who were transported back to Gaza. Hamas, the largest Palestinian militant group, also has fired rockets from Gaza that have riddled Israeli cities.\n\nTimeline of conflict:Why the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian fighting is among the most brutal in years\n\nClash dates to ancient times\n\nThe dispute is rooted in pre-biblical times. Though its borders have shifted over the years, Palestinian territories used to be what is now Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Both Israeli Jews’ and Palestinian Arabs’ history, culture and identity are linked to the Palestinian territories. Jewish migration from eastern and central Europe surged from 1922 to 1947 as Jews fled persecution and the destruction of their communities, most notably during World War II. As the number of Jewish immigrants increased, many Palestinians were displaced. They began pushing back and violence resulted.\n\nIn 1948, the Jewish People's Council met in Tel Aviv and established the State of Israel. The U.S. officially recognized the new nation later that day; the USSR acknowledges it three days later. Read more here.\n\n− George Petras, Janet Loehrke and Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nSen.

Israel says most of those killed in airstrikes were militants.\n\nIn one incident Saturday, four children were among seven people killed in an explosion in Jabaliya. The Palestinian Health Ministry initially said the blast was caused by an Israeli airstrike. Israel rejected the claim and said it was the result of errant rocket fire, and released a video showing what it said was the Islamic Jihad rocket sharply changing course in the air and hitting the building.\n\nIslamic Jihad, which is the smaller of the two main militant groups in Gaza, has responded to the Israeli campaign with sustained rocket attacks, mainly launched toward Israeli communities living close to the Gaza Strip, but also firing several longer-range rockets.\n\nWarning sirens on Saturday could be heard as far away as Modiin, about halfway between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and about 70 kilometers from Gaza.\n\nBy Saturday evening, the Israeli army said more than 450 rockets and mortars had been launched from Gaza. Almost 30% had landed inside Gaza, the army said.\n\nMost of the rest were intercepted by the Iron Dome aerial defense system, though one rocket hit a high-rise apartment building in Sderot.\n\nTwo Israeli soldiers received minor injuries when a mortar shell exploded close to the Gaza fence, the army said. Israeli emergency services said they treated 21 people for their injuries, including two with minor injuries caused by shrapnel.\n\nThe United Nations has said it is “gravely concerned” by the fighting and appealed to both sides for an immediate de-escalation, warning it was regular civilians who would bear the brunt if it continued.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates mission to the United Nations, along with France, Ireland, Norway, and China, requested “a closed-door meeting” of the Security Council on Monday to discuss the developments in Gaza.\n\nA Palestinian Health Ministry official told CNN they were seeing shortages in medical supplies, adding hospitals were coming under strain due to electricity outages caused by shrinking fuel stocks.\n\nGaza has only one power plant and Israel controls the entry of fuel into the territory. An Israeli army spokesman, speaking to journalists on Friday, said a fuel shipment had been due to enter Gaza, but the transfer had been scrapped when the military operation against Islamic Jihad began.\n\nThe UN, through its regional humanitarian coordinator, Lynn Hastings, urged Israel to open the crossings it controls, to allow people and goods to move in and out: “Movement and access of humanitarian personnel, for critical medical cases, and for essential goods, including food and fuel into Gaza, must not be impeded so that humanitarian needs can be met.”\n\nThe violence, which is the most serious in the region since the Israeli military and Hamas fought an 11-day war in May 2021, began Friday afternoon when Israel launched what it characterized as a preemptive strike against an Islamic Jihad commander, Tayseer Al Jabari.\n\nThe opening salvos of Israel’s operation, which it has called Breaking Dawn, also included hits on two anti-tank squads, which Israel said were about to launch an attack on its forces close to the Gaza fence.\n\nSince then, the Israeli military says it has hit dozens of additional targets including rocket launching sites, weapons manufacturing facilities and military posts.\n\nPalestinians gather next to the site of an Israeli strike in Gaza City on Friday.

But he cautioned that a ground offensive could harm peace efforts with the Palestinians.\n\n\"Let's understand what the precipitating event here that's causing the current crisis and that was an ever-escalating number of missiles that were landing not just in Israeli territory but in areas that are populated, and there's no country on earth that would tolerate missiles raining down on its citizens from outside its borders,\" Obama said at news conference in Thailand.\n\nHamas is a designated terrorist entity by the United States and European Union, and Obama urged Egypt and Turkey -- countries that have backed Hamas -- to urge the Palestinians to end the violence.\n\n\"Those who champion the cause of Palestinians should recognize that if we see a further escalation of the situation in Gaza then the likelihood of us getting back on any kind of peace track … is going to be pushed off way into the future,\" he said.\n\nAmong the victims of the Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed 11 people were five women, including one 80-year-old, and four small children, al-Kidra said. The claim could not be verified.\n\nThe Israeli military said the target of the attack was Yahiya Abiya, the head of the rocket program for Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a terrorist group that has conducted many attacks against Israel. The deaths brought to 66 the number of Palestinians killed in the Israeli offensive, including 32 civilians, said al-Kidra.\n\nIsrael has said that Hamas bears responsibility for inadvertent civilian deaths for placing rocket batteries and depots in residential areas and because Hamas terrorists are using homes for their operations. The IDF said it is trying to minimize civilian casualties, but that Hamas is intentionally targeting civilians in Israel.\n\nThree Israelis were killed last week from a rocket that slammed into their home.\n\nIn Gaza City on Sunday, streets were filled with men and thousands of children attending the funerals of the recently killed. Women, who cannot attend the mosque, looked on from windows and balconies above the streets.\n\nEvery neighborhood showed signs of Israeli missile strikes. Hamas flags that have appeared everywhere in the last few days provided the only bright color on gray, dust-covered buildings.\n\nA strike Sunday on a three-story home in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya killed a 3-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy from the same family. Hamas security officials said three missiles struck the house, owned by a family that has members who are involved in militants' rocket squads. It was not known if any militants were in or near the house at the time of the strike.\n\nAnother strike in the city brought down a home near a Hamas police station in the Tufah neighborhood. Rescue workers pulled out the body of a dead woman, along with several surviving members of her family.\n\nIn the Shatire fugee camp near Gaza City, a missile struck the car of a Hamas militant outside his home, killing him and an 11-year-old girl passing by at the time, al-Kidra said.\n\nIn Israel, one rocket damaged a home in the southern city of Ashkelon, punching a hole in the ceiling.

Yoav Mordechai, said Sunday the military had been ordered to go after Hamas commanders, in addition to rocket squads.\n\n\"I imagine in the next few hours, we will see ongoing targeted attacks on gunmen and Hamas commanders,\" Mordechai told Army Radio. \"More targeted, more surgical and more deadly.\"\n\nThe strikes included hits on the top floor offices of the Hamas TV station, Al Aqsa, and a Lebanese-based broadcaster, Al Quds TV, seen as sympathetic to Hamas. Six Palestinian journalists were wounded, including one who lost a leg, a Gaza press association said.\n\nForeign broadcasters, including British, German and Italian TV outlets, also had offices in the high-rise. Building windows were blown out and glass shards and debris were scattered on the street below. Some of the journalists who had been inside the building at the time took cover in the entrance hallway.\n\nLt. Col. Avital Leibovich, an Israeli military spokeswoman, said the strikes targeted Hamas communications equipment on the building's rooftop. She accused the group of using journalists as \"human shields,\" and urged journalists to stay clear of Hamas bases and facilities.\n\nLeibovich said the military has identified \"hundreds\" of additional targets as it pressed forward. She acknowledged that civilians were in danger, but said that Gaza militant groups bore the blame.\n\n\"One of the strategies of Hamas, not only Hamas, but Islamic Jihad as well, is locating large amounts of munitions underneath civilian homes. Many times this is the reason for this big damage or collateral damage,\" she said.\n\nNetanyahu said at his Sunday Cabinet meeting broadcast on Israeli news media that the IDF has struck \"1,000 terrorist targets\" and that Israel \"is prepared to expand its operations in Gaza.\"\n\nNetanyahu said the air force's airstrikes have hurt Hamas' ability to launch rockets against Israel. Defense Minister Ehud Barak said the IDF is \"primed and ready to do whatever it takes to remove the (rockets) threat, strengthen Israeli deterrence and hit Hamas and the Islamic Jihad hard.\" He thanked Obama for his support for Israel.\n\nThe repeated militant rocket fire on Tel Aviv and Friday's attack toward Jerusalem have significantly escalated the hostilities by widening the militants' rocket range and putting 3.5 million Israelis, or half the country's population, within reach. The attempt to strike Jerusalem also has symbolic resonance because both Israel and the Palestinians claim the holy city for a capital.\n\nIsraeli radio stations repeatedly interrupted their broadcasts to air \"Code Red\"alerts warning of impending rocket strikes.\n\nYitzak Bazal, a 57-year-old taxi driver in Beersheva, had a passenger in his car as the sirens began wailing. He stayed close to his taxi as his fare disappeared in search of safety.\n\n\"I wish we could have a cease-fire but not one that's going to land us back in the shelters in a month or two,\" he said.\n\nEgyptian President Mohammed Morsi continued to host talks with Hamas as well as leaders from Hamas allies Turkey and Qatar. He also held contacts with Western leaders.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius visited Israel on Sunday to offer his country's help toward forging an \"immediate cease-fire,\" the French government said.\n\nMeeting with Fabius, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman thanked him for \"France's efforts to prevent casualties\" but said \"the moment that all the terror organizations announce a cease-fire, we can consider all the ideas that French foreign minister and other friends are raising.\"\n\nSeveral buses carrying Egyptian activists traveled to the Gaza-Egypt border Sunday to show solidarity with their Palestinians neighbors.\n\n\"We have some medical aid and student doctors, and a lot of people full of love and solidarity for Gaza\" read a Tweet by activist Gigi Ibrahim, headed north on Sunday in attempt to cross the border.\n\nBut the mood in Egypt was generally calm as the nation continued to face a slew of domestic concerns.\n\n\"I don't think Israeli is just defending itself,\" said Mina Thabet, a Christian activist in Cairo. \"It's always attacking.\"\n\n\"I don't like Israel,\" Thabet said. \"We have blood between us and Israel.

Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the militants were making a clear statement. \"There's no intention whatsoever to stop firing into Israel,\" he said.\n\nThree days of fierce fighting between Israel and Gaza militants has widened the instability gripping the region, straining already frayed Israel-Egypt relations. The Cairo government recalled its ambassador in protest.\n\nEgypt said Kandil's three-hour visit Friday was meant as a show of solidarity with the Palestinian territory's militant Hamas rulers.\n\nEgyptian intelligence officials involved in negotiations to end previous rounds of fighting are accompanying Kandil on his visit, an Egyptian diplomat said, suggesting it was more than a display of support.\n\nThe diplomat said Gaza militants have told Egyptian intelligence officials they would be willing to hold their fire if Israel would commit to mediation to stop its military operation and targeted killings.\n\nWord of the possible pause in the fighting came after a night of fierce exchanges and signals that Israel might be preparing to invade Gaza. Overnight, the military said it targeted about 150 of the sites Gaza gunmen use to fire rockets at Israel, as well as ammunition warehouses, bringing to 450 the number of sites struck since the operation began Wednesday.\n\nIsraeli troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers massed near the Palestinian territory, signaling a ground invasion might be imminent.\n\nMilitants unleashed dozens of rocket barrages overnight.\n\nFighting between the two sides escalated sharply Thursday with a first-ever rocket attack from Gaza on the Tel Aviv area, menacing Israel's most densely populated area. No casualties were reported there, but three people died in the country's rocket-scarred south when a projectile slammed into an apartment building.\n\nThe death toll in Gaza was 19, including five children, according to Palestinian health officials.\n\nEarly Friday, 85 missiles exploded within 45 minutes in Gaza City, sending black pillars of smoke towering above the coastal strip's largest city. The military said it was targeting underground rocket-launching sites.\n\nOne missile flattened sections of the Interior Ministry, leaving a huge pile of rubble, and another hit an uninhabited house belonging to a senior Hamas commander. Those strikes, together with an attack on a generator building near Haniyeh's home, signaled that Israel was expanding its offensive beyond military targets.\n\nTen-month-old Haneen Tafesh was killed Thursday when flying shrapnel from an air attack on a field next to her family's shack struck her in the head.\n\n\"What did she do? Did she fire any rockets?\" asked her 23-year-old father, Khaled Tafesh, as he waited outside the Shifa hospital morgue in Gaza City, waiting for the funeral of his only child to begin.\n\nIsrael and Hamas had largely observed an informal truce since Israel's devastating incursion into Gaza four years ago, but rocket fire and Israeli airstrikes on militant operations continued sporadically.\n\nThe Israeli offensive has not deterred the militants from firing more than 400 rockets aimed at southern Israel, the military said. On Thursday, they also unleashed for the first time the most powerful weapons in their arsenal — Iranian-made Fajr-5 rockets capable of reaching Tel Aviv.\n\nThe two rockets that struck closest to Tel Aviv on Thursday appeared to have landed in the Mediterranean Sea, defense officials said, and another hit an open area on Tel Aviv's southern outskirts.\n\nNo injuries were reported, but the rocket fire sowed panic in Tel Aviv and made the prospect of a ground incursion more likely. The government later approved the mobilization of up to 30,000 reservists for a possible invasion.\n\nNetanyahu said the army was hitting Hamas hard with what he called surgical strikes, and warned of a \"significant widening\" of the Gaza operation. Israel will \"continue to take whatever action is necessary to defend our people,\" said Netanyahu, who is up for re-election in January.\n\nAt least 12 trucks were seen transporting tanks and armored personnel carriers toward Gaza late Thursday, and buses carrying soldiers headed toward the border area.\n\nAn Israeli ground offensive could be costly to both sides. In the last Gaza war, Israel devastated parts of the territory, setting back Hamas' fighting capabilities but also paying the price of increasing diplomatic isolation because of a civilian death toll numbering in the hundreds.\n\nIn the current round of fighting, the civilian casualties have been relatively low and the Israeli strikes seem to be more surgical.\n\nIn other ways, the latest hostilities are reminiscent of the first days of that three-week offensive against Hamas. Israel also caught Hamas off guard then with a barrage of missile strikes and threatened to follow up with a ground offensive.\n\nSince then, Israel has improved its missile defense systems, but it is facing a more heavily armed Hamas. Israel estimates the militants have 12,000 rockets, including more sophisticated weapons from Iran and from Libyan stockpiles plundered after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi's regime there last year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/02/26/israel-hamas-war-gaza-live-updates/72742803007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war updates: Signs of hope, 'proximity talks' in Qatar", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Israel-Hamas war for Monday, Feb. 25. For the latest news on the conflict in the Middle East, view our live updates file on the war for Tuesday, Feb. 27.\n\nIsrael sent a delegation to Doha, Qatar, on Monday to continue negotiating an extended cease-fire and the release of hostages, and while its officials did not appear encouraged a deal would materialize, there are optimistic signs.\n\nIsraeli media reported the progress made during weekend talks in Paris has stalled in part because Hamas demands troop withdrawal and a major increase in the amount of humanitarian aid going into war-battered Gaza, where a large segment of the population is facing famine.\n\nBut Israel has made a major concession, indicating a new willingness to trade the freedom of Palestinian prisoners convicted of major terrorist acts for the release of some Israeli soldiers captured in the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, the New York Times reported.\n\nAt a public appearance in an ice cream shop Monday, President Joe Biden was asked about a possible start date for a truce and said, “I hope by the end of the weekend. My national security adviser tells me that we’re close, we’re close. We’re done yet. My hope is by next Monday we’ll have a cease-fire.’’\n\nReuters reported the presence of both quarreling sides in the same location even when they're exchanging proposals through mediators instead of face-to-face − so-called proximity talks − is a sign of movement toward an agreement.\n\nReuters also reported Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, whose nation has played a key role brokering talks along with the U.S. and Egypt, met Monday with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nPublicly, both sides remain far apart, as exemplified by Haniyeh accusing Israel of stalling while Palestinians die in Gaza, saying, \"We will not allow the enemy to use negotiations as a cover for this crime.\" Netanyahu has called Hamas' demands \"delusional.''\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister, said \"only after all the hostages are released\" will the hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza be able to return to their homes in the north, Al Jazeera reported.\n\n∎ The number of trucks bringing humanitarian aid into Gaza has dwindled from a daily average of 139 in the first six weeks of the year to 70 over the last 2 1/2 weeks, according to U.N. figures. Truck influx has been sporadic in the last 10 days, with as many as 220 one day as as few as four another.\n\n∎ The Jordanian Armed Forces on Monday carried out four airdrops of aid for civilians in Gaza, according to Al-Mamlaka TV, a Jordanian public news channel.\n\n∎ Across northern and central Gaza, Israeli forces have killed over 40 militants, a statement from the military said. In Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza where the military has focused its offensive for weeks, an Israeli fighter jet struck a Hamas compound.\n\n∎ The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said on Monday morning that over the last 24 hours, 90 Palestinians were killed and 164 were injured across the territory. Since the war began, more than 29,700 Palestinians have been killed.\n\nIsraeli War Cabinet sees Rafah plans\n\nThe Israeli military has presented the War Cabinet with its plan to evacuate Rafah − the city in southern Gaza where more than a million displaced civilians are sheltering − and details of its imminent invasion to dismantle what Israeli leaders have called Hamas' final stronghold, authorities said Monday.\n\nThough the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the developments, specifics of the plan have not been released. It's also unclear whether the War Cabinet approved the long-awaited plan, which has been the concern of humanitarian aid groups, the U.N. and the Biden administration. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the administration has yet to see a strategy for Rafah it would support.\n\nThe statement from Netanyahu's office added that the War Cabinet approved a \"plan for providing humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip in a manner that will prevent the looting that has occurred in the northern Strip.\" Last week, the World Food Program suspended aid deliveries to northern Gaza, citing \"violence and chaos due to the collapse of civil order.\"\n\n\"Gaza is hanging by a thread and WFP must be enabled to reverse the path toward famine for thousands of desperately hungry people,\" a statement from the U.N. group said.\n\nHouthis wreak havoc again, damage communications cables, report says\n\nThe Houthi rebels in Yemen, who for months have been attacking merchant ships in the Red Sea, have found another way to disrupt Western commercial endeavors.\n\nThe Iran-backed militant group has damaged four underwater communications cables in the Red Sea linking Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Djibouti in east Africa, the Israeli Globes news platform reported Monday.\n\nThe sabotage of cables belonging to the Seacom, TGN, AAE-1 and EIG companies is \"causing serious disruption of Internet communications between Europe and Asia,'' Globes reported, adding that the biggest impact has been felt in the Persian Gulf countries and India.\n\nThe report also said it will take at least eight weeks to repair the damage, and that communications to the affected continents will be impaired but not cut off because other cables in the area connecting Asia, Africa and Europe remain intact.\n\nThe Houthis say their assaults on commercial shipping are meant to show solidarity with Palestinians in embattled Gaza, and they have not desisted in their missile and drone campaign despite the U.S. and U.K. striking several of their launch sites.\n\nPalestinian aid group suspends missions in Gaza, blames Israeli forces\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent Society, an independent aid group, announced Monday that it will suspend coordinating medical missions throughout Gaza for at least 48 hours, saying Israeli forces have on multiple occasions detained medical personnel and delayed urgent transports of patients.\n\nThe PRCS said Sunday that its workers evacuated patients from Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis and took them to Rafah because they required specialized medical treatment. The group said that despite its members and the U.N. humanitarian coordination office receiving clearance from the Israeli military for the evacuation and providing the convoy route, Israeli forces stopped them for more than seven hours, mistreated medics and arrested three of them. One of them was released several hours later, the PRCS said in a post on X.\n\nThe group called for the international community to compel Israel to \"respect and protect medical personnel and facilities and to provide a safe humanitarian space that is essential for the survival of Palestinians in Gaza.\"\n\nUS serviceman dies after setting himself ablaze in protest of war in Gaza\n\nThe active duty U.S. Air Force member who set himself on fire in front of the Israeli embassy in Washington while shouting, \"Free Palestine,\" died from his injuries, the Metropolitan Police Department confirmed Monday.\n\nAaron Bushnell, 25, of Whitman, Massachusetts, doused himself in liquid and lit himself Sunday afternoon after saying in a video livestreamed on Twitch that he \"will no longer be complicit in genocide.\"\n\nThe Air Force confirmed on Monday that Bushnell was an active duty member. he was a cyber defense operations specialist with the 531st Intelligence Support Squadron at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland, Texas. He served on active duty since May 2020.\n\nThe MPD said police are working with the Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to investigate the incident.\n\n“When a tragedy like this occurs, every member of the Air Force feels it,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Celina Noyes, 70th Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Wing commander. “We extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Senior Airman Bushnell. Our thoughts and prayers are with them, and we ask that you respect their privacy during this difficult time.”\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook, Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nIsraeli jets strike Hezbollah targets 'deep inside Lebanon,' military says\n\nIsraeli fighter jets on Monday struck what the military said were Hezbollah targets \"deep inside Lebanon,\" the latest escalation in fighting since cross-border exchanges became near daily occurrences after Oct. 7.\n\nThree airstrikes hit the outskirts of the Buday village, near the Hezbollah stronghold of Baalbek, according to Lebanese security officials. At least two people were killed, a Hezbollah official told reporters. Israel later said one of its strikes hit a car in the southern village of Majadel, near the countries' border, killing Hezbollah field commander Hassan Salami.\n\nFollowing the strikes near Baalbek, Hezbollah fired about 60 rockets at an Israeli military base in Syria’s Golan Heights, which Israel occupies. The Israeli military said on a post on X that the strikes were in response to a missile fired at Israel from Lebanon. A missile also reportedly downed an Israeli drone operating inside Lebanon.\n\nThe Israeli strikes on Monday were the most significant escalation in fighting since Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas leader, was killed in January when an apparent Israeli strike hit a Beirut suburb.\n\nHuman rights groups say Israel noncompliant with UN order\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International on Monday accused Israel of failing to comply with an order by the U.N.'s top court to provide humanitarian aid to the more than 2 million people in the war-torn enclave.\n\nIn January, the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands, ordered Israel to take measures to limit death and destruction in Gaza as part of a case brought by South Africa alleging Israel’s military campaign amounts to genocide.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said the number of aid trucks that have entered Gaza in recent weeks has dropped by 30% and that Israel has not facilitated fuel deliveries to the northern part of the territory. On Sunday, the Gaza Health Ministry said a lack of fuel has forced several hospitals in the north to cease operations and has put intensive care patients at risk.\n\n\"The Israeli government has simply ignored the court’s ruling, and in some ways even intensified its repression, including further blocking lifesaving aid,\" said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nIsraeli leaders have denied the allegations and blamed humanitarian organizations, saying hundreds of trucks filled with aid sit idle on the Palestinian side of the main crossing. The U.N. says it can’t always reach the trucks at the crossing because at times it's too dangerous.\n\nPalestinian prime minister, government resign\n\nPalestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh and his government resigned Monday in a move that could signal a willingness by Palestinian leadership to back reforms seen as necessary by the U.S. to revitalize the governing body for a role in Gaza after the war ends.\n\nAuthority President Mahmoud Abbas must still decide whether to accept the resignation of Shtayyeh, who has been in the role since 2019, and his Cabinet. The authority was ousted from Gaza in a Hamas coup in 2007. It still has administrative control over some parts of the West Bank.\n\n“The next stage and its challenges require new governmental and political arrangements that take into account the new reality in the Gaza Strip,” Shtayyeh said at a Cabinet meeting in Ramallah in the West Bank. Abbas is expected to choose Mohammad Mustafa, chairman of the Palestine Investment Fund, as the next prime minister.\n\nAbbas, 88, and his Fatah political party have dominated the Palestinian Authority since 2005. However, polls show many Palestinians regard his administration as corrupt, undemocratic and out of touch. Abbas has not held elections since 2006. After U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Abbas late last year, he told reporters they discussed reforms to combat corruption, empower civil society and support a free press.\n\n– Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/01/02/israel-hamas-gaza-war-live-updates/72081870007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war updates: Shipping giant Maersk pauses Red Sea ...", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here.\n\nShipping giant Maersk said its vessels will stop sailing on the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden “until further notice” after one of its cargo ships was attacked by Houthi militants from Yemen over the weekend.\n\nAn extended pause in the Danish company’s operations in the Red Sea, which is linked to the Mediterranean Sea by the Suez Canal in the shortest maritime route between Europe and Asia, could increase the cost of delivering goods and possibly drive up inflation.\n\n“An investigation into the incident is ongoing and we will continue to pause all cargo movement through the area while we further assess the constantly evolving situation,” Maersk, the world's largest container shipping company, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nGermany's Hapag-Lloyd, a Maersk competitor, said it would also avoid the key shipping lane at least until Jan. 9 for security reasons, Reuters reported.\n\nHouthi rebels have launched tens of drone and missile assaults on ships in the area since November, purportedly because they have links to Israel. The container ship Maersk Hangzhou was initially hit by a missile Saturday, then fired upon hours later by four boats in an attempted boarding.\n\nHelicopters from two U.S. ships responded to a distress call, sinking three of the boats and driving away the fourth, the U.S. Central Command said.\n\nIsrael plan scuttled:Court nixes key part of Netanyahu judicial reform amid troop pullout\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ The U.S. State Department issued a statement Tuesday condemning the \"inflammatory and irresponsible'' comments by two far-right Israeli officials − Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir − who recently advocated for Palestinians to leave Gaza.\n\n∎ Secretary of State Antony Blinken has delayed his latest trip to Israel by a few days to early next week, the Times of Israel reported.\n\n∎ The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford will leave the Middle East and return to its homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, in the \"coming days,\" the Navy says. President Joe Biden ordered the ship to the Mediterranean Sea the day after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel. The amphibious assault vessel USS Bataan and accompanying warships will take the place of the carrier.\n\n∎ Palestinian health workers were vaccinating children in Gaza’s southern city of Rafah after UNICEF said it delivered at least 600,000 doses of vaccines. UNICEF estimated that over 16,600 infants have missed one or more routine vaccinations because of fighting and evacuations.\n\n∎ Heavy fighting was reported Tuesday in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was withdrawing thousands of troops but would continue fighting until Hamas was eliminated.\n\n∎ A majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have fled to the southern part of the region since the start of the war. More than 21,900 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead. In Israel, about 1,200 people have been killed, with around 240 people taken hostage.\n\n∎ Following an Israeli drone strike in Lebanon that killed a senior Hamas leader, protests broke out Tuesday in Ramallah in the West Bank. Palestinians marched through streets after numerous factions called for protests in response to the strike, NBC News reported.\n\nSaleh al-Arouri, top Hamas leader,reportedly killed in Israel strike\n\nDeputy military chief of Hamas killed in drone strike\n\nSaleh al-Arouri, deputy leader of the Hamas military wing, was among six people killed in an Israeli drone strike in Lebanon, according to multiple reports from the region. The attack in the suburbs of Beirut would mark a major escalation in the Israeli-Hamas war. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has repeatedly vowed to retaliate against any Israeli effort to target Palestinian leaders in Lebanon. The Biden administration has been laboring to keep the war in Gaza from spreading into Lebanon and across the Middle East.\n\nThe strike targeted an office belonging to Hamas in Mushrifiyah in the southern suburbs of Lebanon's capital, the Jerusalem Post reported. Arouri, the highest-ranking Hamas figure killed in the war so far, reportedly was a prime target for Israel because of his alleged role in organizing terror attacks in the West Bank.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari did not directly mention Arouri’s death but said, “We are focused and remain focused on fighting against Hamas.” And Israeli lawmaker Danny Danon congratulated Israeli security forces in a social media post for killing Arouri, adding, \"Anyone who was involved in the (Oct. 7) massacre should know that we will reach out to them and close an account with them.\"\n\nArouri spent many years in Israeli prisons before being released in a 2010 swap. In October, Israeli forces demolished his home near Ramallah. The U.S. government has designated him as a “global terrorist.\"\n\nSurvivors of Hamas massacre sue Israeli forces for $56 million\n\nSurvivors of the massacre by Hamas-led militants at a rave concert Oct. 7 have filed a $56 million lawsuit against Israel’s security forces, accusing them of negligence and claiming the deadly rampage could have been averted.\n\nThe 42 plaintiffs allege the Shin Bet security service, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the Israel Police and the Defense Ministry failed in their duties. Haaretz has reported that top defense officials held urgent meetings Oct. 6 to discuss a possible Hamas attack. The next day militants crashed across the border from Gaza, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostages.\n\n“A single phone call by IDF officials to the commander responsible for the party to disperse it immediately in view of the expected danger would have saved lives and prevented the physical and mental injuries of hundreds of partygoers, including the plaintiffs,” the lawsuit claims. “The negligence and the gross oversight is beyond belief.”\n\nForeign minister: Israel 'at the height of World War III'\n\nIsrael is “at the height of World War III against Iran and radical Islam,” Israel's new foreign minister said Tuesday at a Jerusalem ceremony marking his ascension to the post. Israel Katz said his top priority is bringing home the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Katz wrote on social media that \"my message to the (foreign ministry) employees was succinct. ... Order of priority: hostages, hostages, hostages. This is our commitment to the people and families.\"\n\nKatz also emphasized the importance of gaining global support for the war with Hamas that started after the militants' brutal border attacks on Oct. 7, pledging that “we will achieve our goal of toppling Hamas.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant made it clear the war will continue for a long time, even if the Israeli military plans to reduce the number of its troops in Gaza by several thousand as it enters a lower-intensity phase in the conflict.\n\n“The feeling that we will stop soon is incorrect,” Gallant said. “Without a clear victory, we will not be able to live in the Middle East.”\n\nContrasting reactions to South Africa's genocide accusation\n\nIsraeli spokesman Eylon Levy said Israel will go before the U.N.'s International Court of Justice to challenge South Africa's \"absurd\" claim accusing Israel of genocide. Levy chastised South Africa for providing \"political and legal cover\" to Hamas for the attack on Israel Oct. 7.\n\nIn a televised address, Hamas supreme leader Ismail Haniyeh thanked South Africa for bringing forth the case and rejected the Israeli and U.S. demands that Hamas not be part of Gaza's future as \"mere illusions.''\n\n“We are the ones who decide our present and future,” Haniyeh said.\n\nHamas denies reports that militants assaulted Israeli women\n\nA high-ranking Hamas political leader dismissed a New York Times report accusing militants of sexual assaults against Israeli women during the Oct. 7 attacks. Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, accused the Times and other Western media of being biased to \"what the Israeli propaganda says\" and against the Palestinians and their resistance to Israeli occupation.\n\nUSA TODAY has also published a report chronicling similar claims against the militants. The Times report was based on a two-month investigation it said showed \"the attacks against women were not isolated events but part of a broader pattern\" of violence targeting women on Oct. 7.\n\n\"We ask the New York Times to revise such misleading report, and to distance itself from the Israeli propaganda and to preserve its professionalism and reputation,\" Naim said.\n\nIsrael captures Hamas stronghold in Gaza City\n\nThe Israeli military has seized the primary Hamas intelligence and control stronghold in Gaza City, military officials said Tuesday. The \"Mizrachi Outpost,\" which included operations rooms to manage the fighting in the entire Gaza Strip, was spread over 37 buildings near residential structures, schools and hospitals, the Israeli military said in a statement. A network of tunnels and an underground control bunker on the site held long-term living spaces used by Hamas military commanders and an armory of weapons, the statement said.\n\n\"All the terrorists were eliminated,\" the statement said. \"The 601st Engineering Battalion and the Yalam unit destroyed the entire route of the tunnels.\"\n\nIsraelis seize long-range rockets found in Gaza home\n\nThe Israeli military said it seized long-range rockets inside a family home in central Gaza and that dozens of rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons were found in civilian buildings nearby. The rockets were destroyed and the weapons were confiscated, the Israeli military said in a statement that included photos and videos of the weaponry. Israeli officials have defended their assault on Gaza − which has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians − by saying Hamas militants use civilians as human shields.\n\n\"We are here in a house of a family that lives up here with a living room, a kitchen and a children's room and a first floor − a military warehouse,\" the statement said. \"You can see here this beehive of more long-range rockets, mortars and other equipment that was used against our forces.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/05/13/israel-gaza-ground-invasions-death-toll/5082277001/", "title": "Israel threatens Gaza ground invasion despite truce efforts; death ...", "text": "Josef Federman and Fares Akram\n\nAssociated Press\n\nJERUSALEM – Israel on Thursday said it was massing troops along the Gaza frontier and calling up 9,000 reservists ahead of a possible ground invasion of the Hamas-ruled territory. Egyptian mediators rushed to Israel for cease-fire efforts but showed no signs of progress.\n\nThe stepped-up fighting came as communal violence in Israel erupted for a fourth night, with Jewish and Arab mobs clashing in the flashpoint town of Lod. The fighting took place despite a bolstered police presence ordered by the nation’s leaders.\n\nThe four-day burst of violence has pushed Israel into uncharted territory — dealing with the most intense fighting it has ever had with Hamas while simultaneously coping with the worst Jewish-Arab violence inside Israel in decades. A late-night barrage of rocket fire from Lebanon that landed in the sea threatened to open a new front along Israel’s northern border.\n\nSaleh Aruri, an exiled senior Hamas leader, told London-based satellite channel Al Araby early Friday that his group has turned down a proposal for a three-hour lull to allow for more negotiations toward a full cease-fire. He said Egypt, Qatar, and the United Nations were leading the truce efforts.\n\nAlso early Friday, the Israeli military said air and ground troops struck Gaza in what appeared to be the heaviest attacks yet. Masses of red flames illuminated the skies as the deafening blasts from the outskirts of Gaza City jolted people awake. The strikes were so strong that screams of fear could be heard from people inside the city, several kilometers away.\n\n“I said we would extract a very heavy price from Hamas,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a videotaped statement. \"We are doing that, and we will continue to do that with heavy force.”\n\nDelta, United, American Airlines suspend flights to Israel amid violence\n\nThe fighting broke out late Monday when Hamas, claiming to be the defender of Jerusalem, fired a barrage of long-range rockets toward the city in response to what it said were Israeli provocations. Israel quickly responded with a series of airstrikes.\n\nSince then, Israel has attacked hundreds of targets in Gaza. The strikes set off scores of earth-shaking explosions across the densely populated territory. Gaza militants have fired nearly 2,000 rockets into Israel, bringing life in the southern part of the country to a standstill. Several barrages targeted the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) away.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said the death toll has climbed to 109 Palestinians, including 28 children and 15 women, with 621 people wounded. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant groups have confirmed 20 deaths in their ranks, though Israel says that number is much higher. Seven people have been killed in Israel, including a 6-year-old boy.\n\nIn Washington, President Joe Biden said he spoke with Netanyahu about calming the fighting but also backed the Israeli leader by saying “there has not been a significant overreaction.”\n\nHe said the goal now is to “get to a point where there is a significant reduction in attacks, particularly rocket attacks that are indiscriminately fired into population centers.” He called the effort “a work in progress.”\n\nThursday’s visit by Egyptian officials marked an important step in the cease-fire efforts.\n\nEgypt often serves as a mediator between Israel and Hamas, and it has been a key player in ending past rounds of fighting. The officials met first with Hamas leaders in Gaza before holding talks with Israelis in Tel Aviv, two Egyptian intelligence officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. Hamas' exiled leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was also in touch with the Egyptians, the group said.\n\nDespite those efforts, the fighting only intensified. Israeli aircraft pummeled targets in Gaza throughout the day. And late Thursday, Israel fired tank and artillery shells across the border for the first time, sending scores of terrified residents fleeing for safety.\n\nThe airstrikes have destroyed scores of buildings, including three high rises. Israel says the buildings housed Hamas militants or facilities, but civilians were inside as well.\n\nIn the northern Gaza Strip, Rafat Tanani, his pregnant wife and four children were killed after an Israeli warplane reduced the building to rubble, residents said.\n\nSadallah Tanani, a relative, said the family was “wiped out from the population register” without warning. “It was a massacre. My feelings are indescribable,” he said.\n\nIsrael has come under heavy international criticism for civilian casualties in Gaza fighting. It says Hamas is responsible for endangering civilians by hiding and launching rockets from civilian areas.\n\nLate Thursday, Israel’s Defense Minister Benny Gantz ordered the mobilization of an additional 9,000 reservists.\n\nThe chief military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Hidai Zilberman, said troops were massing along the Gaza border for a possible ground operation. He said tanks, armored vehicles and artillery were being prepared “for mobilization at any given moment.”\n\nWhat to know about the Israel, Hamas escalation as Biden faces pressure on Palestinian rights\n\nHamas showed no signs of backing down. It launched several intense barrages of rockets throughout the day and fired its most powerful rocket, the Ayyash, nearly 200 kilometers (120 miles) into southern Israel. The rocket landed in the open desert but briefly disrupted flight traffic at the southern Ramon airport. Hamas also launched a drone that Israel said it quickly shot down.\n\nHamas military spokesman Abu Obeida said the group was not afraid of a ground invasion, saying any invasion would be a chance “to increase our catch” of dead or captive soldiers.\n\nThe fighting cast a pall over the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, normally marked by family gatherings and festive meals. Instead, the streets of Gaza were mostly empty.\n\nHassan Abu Shaaban tried to lighten the mood by passing out candy to passers-by but acknowledged “there is no atmosphere” for celebrating. “It is all airstrikes, destruction and devastation,” he said. “May God help everyone.”\n\nThe current eruption of violence began a month ago in Jerusalem, where heavy-handed Israeli police tactics during Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers ignited protests and clashes with police. A focal point of clashes was Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque, built on a hilltop compound that is revered by Jews and Muslims.\n\nIsrael regards Jerusalem in its entirety as its capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state.\n\nThe violent clashes between Arabs and Jews in Israel resulted in scenes not witnessed in more than two decades.\n\nThe confrontations erupted again late Thursday. Jewish and Arab mobs battled in the central city of Lod, the epicenter of the troubles, for a fourth consecutive night, despite a state of emergency and heavy police presence. A Jewish man was shot and seriously wounded, and Israeli media said a second Jewish man was shot.\n\nIn the Tel Aviv neighborhood of Jaffa, an Israeli soldier was attacked by a group of Arabs and hospitalized in serious condition.\n\nThe fighting deepened a political crisis that has sent Israel careening through four inconclusive elections in just two years. After March elections, Netanyahu failed to form a government coalition. Now his political rivals have three weeks to try to do so.\n\nThose efforts have been greatly complicated by the fighting. His opponents include a broad range of parties that have little in common. They would need the support of an Arab party, whose leader has said he cannot negotiate while Israel is fighting in Gaza.\n\nNaftali Bennett, leader of a small right-wing party, was quoted as saying he did not believe an alternate coalition could be formed in the current atmosphere.\n\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid, who is leading the coalition-building efforts, said the country was facing an “existential threat” and urged Bennett to join him to help rescue the country.\n\n“We are on the brink of the abyss,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2024/03/23/mlb-top-prospects-2024-names-to-know-stats/73042691007/", "title": "MLB's 100 Names You Need To Know For 2024: Dodgers ...", "text": "The annual list of USA TODAY Sports' 100 Names You Need to Know has an appropriately 2024 look to it.\n\nIn short, it's got a bunch of Baltimore Orioles, and a bunch of dudes named Jackson, and even an Oriole named Jackson.\n\nModern naming conventions aside, the group of top prospects and recently-debuted big leaguers expected to make the greatest impact on the upcoming Major League Baseball season reflect the evolution of player development and the unprecedentedly advanced play at the amateur game's highest levels.\n\nHard-throwing pitchers. Tooled-up outfielders ready to make a leap from campus to crushing big league pitches. And international stars well-equipped to transfer their skills from Asia or Latin America.\n\nThis group, representing all 30 teams, reflects not necessarily the top prospects, but rather those likeliest to make a big league impact this season. The players are ranked by both prospect pedigree and path to find a significant role this season.\n\nFollow every MLB game: Latest MLB scores, stats, schedules and standings.\n\nPlayers are eligible if their 2023 minor league plate appearances or innings pitched exceed their career major league total entering this season. A top prospect buried deep in this list may be heading it up in 2025. They are ranked in order of anticipated impact this season:\n\n1. RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Dodgers: The Dodgers’ $325 million import is expected to pitch like an ace immediately. One of the most hyped Japanese players in history, the 25-year-old Yamamoto had a stunning 1.82 ERA in seven NPB seasons, winning three Pacific League MVP awards.\n\n2. OF Evan Carter, Rangers: We got a taste of Carter’s high-end profile last September (1.058 OPS in 23 games) and during the Rangers’ postseason run (.917 in 72 plate appearances). He also hit six home runs and provides speed and defense. We’ll see what he can do for a full season with the regular left-fielder’s job and a prominent spot in the batting order.\n\n3. OF Jung Hoo Lee, Giants: The Korean slugger’s six-year, $113 million deal was the first domino in a transformative Giants offseason, with the team ultimately signing Matt Chapman, Jorge Soler and Blake Snell as well. The 25-year-old was a .340 hitter in seven KBO seasons, winning the MVP award in 2022.\n\n4. OF Wyatt Langford, Rangers: The 22-year-old and fourth overall draft pick hit the longest home run on record at the 2023 College World series (456 feet), tore through the minors and has won a job hitting in the middle of the Rangers' lineup. His bat should keep him in at least a regular DH role and maybe an everyday spot. Over 200 plate appearances last season between rookie ball and Class AAA (but more than half of them in high A) here are the numbers: .360 BA, 1.157 OPS, 10 homers, 30 RBI, 12 steals.\n\n5. OF Jackson Chourio, Brewers: One of the game’s top prospects, Chourio hit .280 with 22 homers and 42 stolen bases last season as a 19-year-old at Class AA. But after signing an eight-year, $80 million contract this winter, he’s the Brewers’ opening day center fielder.\n\n6. OF/SS Jackson Merrill, Padres: The 20-year-old’s ascent to the bigs was swift. Merrill, who had never played above Class A made his major league debut in the South Korea series. A shortstop by trade, Merrill's bat earned the left-handed hitter a spot on the Opening Day roster. The only concern facing Merrill will be on the defensive side.\n\n7. SS/2B Jackson Holliday, Orioles: Holliday, the son of former All-Star Matt Holliday, is the industry's consensus No. 1 prospect. A shortstop by trade, he will likely shift to second in the majors with the presence of Gunnar Henderson. He dominated at three levels last season before finishing at Class AAA, and the 20-year old will soon be a Baltimore fixture, though not by Opening Day.\n\n8. Zack Gelof, Athletics: The 24-year-old created instant impact with 14 homers and 32 RBI in 69 games for Oakland last season after hitting .304 with a .929 OPS in Class AAA. It’s going to be an ugly year for the Athletics, but there’s hope that Gelof can be a regular contributor in Oakland, wherever the team calls home the next few years and eventually Las Vegas.\n\n9. LHP Kyle Harrison, Giants: San Francisco’s Snell signing takes some pressure off the lefty, who impressed in seven starts after debuting days after his 22nd birthday last season. Harrison averaged 14.6 strikeouts per nine innings in 69 minor-league starts.\n\n10. OF Parker Meadows, Tigers: The leadoff spot in Motown awaits Meadows, 24, after a 14-game cameo in 2023. Meadows, younger brother of former Tiger Austin Meadows, has 20-homer, 20-steal potential, at the least.\n\n11. LHP Shota Imanaga, Cubs: The 30-year-old doesn’t have as impressive a resume in Japan as Yamamoto does, but his four-pitch repertoire does result in plenty of strikeouts. He had 174 of them (and a 2.80 ERA) in 148 innings last season. Home runs could be an issue though, especially if the wind is blowing out at Wrigley Field.\n\n12. C Bo Naylor, Guardians: Cleveland’s offensive woes can in part be addressed by the Naylor brothers, and now Bo is ready to follow up Josh’s emergence. Naylor, 24, produced an .809 OPS in 230 plate appearances and is slated to bat sixth, two spots behind his big brother.\n\n13. 2B Colt Keith, Tigers: Money can guarantee opportunity and now, Keith must justify it with production. The Tigers signed Keith, 22, to a six-year, $28.6 million deal before he played a minute in the majors – but he did produce a .937 OPS and 26 homers between Class AA and AAA last year.\n\n14. 1B Nolan Schanuel, Angels: The 11th overall pick in last year’s draft, Schanuel was in the majors 40 days later, ultimately batting .275 with a .402 OBP in 132 at-bats for the Angels. He’s expected to be the everyday first baseman for Los Angeles and the organization wants his power to continue developing after just one homer in 29 big-league games last season.\n\n15. RHP Gavin Stone, Dodgers: After making four starts and eight big league appearances last year, Stone, 25, will slot into the Dodgers' rotation at least at the season's outset. While the availability and performance of veterans like Walker Buehler, Clayton Kershaw and James Paxton might alter his role going forward, Stone's stuff is good enough to stick around.\n\n16. RHP Paul Skenes, Pirates: The No. 1 overall pick in last year’s draft has not disappointed in his brief pro career. Skenes, 21, hit 102 mph in a breakout series game before being sent to minor-league camp. It shouldn’t be long before the 6-6 right-hander is in Pittsburgh for good. Many scouts feel the LSU product is the best college pitching prospect since Stephen Strasburg.\n\n17. 3B Junior Caminero, Rays: The latest jewel from Tampa Bay's farm system, Caminero, 20, debuted late last year and received two playoff plate appearances. He'll start the season in the minor leagues, but is highly expected to impact this year's ballclub, thanks to his tremendous power that should eventually transfer to a middle-of-the-lineup presence.\n\n18. RHP Jordan Wicks, Cubs: A first-round pick in 2021, Wicks made six solid starts for the Cubs late last season before getting roughed up in his final outing. Otherwise, his 4.41 ERA would’ve been much better. The southpaw, 24, seems to have locked up a rotation spot this spring.\n\n19. SS Masyn Winn, Cardinals: The rocket-armed Winn, 21, is in line to be the Cards’ opening day shortstop, despite struggling at the plate in his first taste of the majors late last season. He did hit 18 homers and steal 17 bases in 105 games at Class AAA Memphis, so there is offensive upside.\n\n20. 1B Kyle Manzardo, Guardians: Acquiring Manzardo for Aaron Civale was a step toward balancing the always pitching-centric Guardians. Now Manzardo, 23, will see if his .926 minor league OPS translates to the big leagues.\n\n21. OF Johan Rojas, Phillies: He debuted at age 22 in July and by October, was playing center field in three playoff rounds. Rojas is a gallant defender - his glove likely will keep him in the lineup - but the Phillies are hoping he can enhance his offensive approach this spring.\n\n22. RHP Jared Jones, Pirates: Jones, 22, has been masterful this spring, allowing no earned runs in his first 11 ⅓ innings. He can hit 100 with his fastball and has a plus slider – tools that have him potentially earning a spot in the Pirates’ opening day rotation despite just 82 innings of Class AAA experience.\n\n23. OF/SS Ceddanne Rafaela, Red Sox: An outstanding defender in center field who can also play the infield, Rafaela, 23, earned a late-season call-up after hitting 20 homers and stealing 37 bases in the minors. A solid spring has him on the verge of shipping up to Boston on opening day.\n\n24. 1B Michael Busch, Cubs: Acquired from the Dodgers after raking at Class AAA (.323, 27 HR, 90 RBI in 98 games), Busch, 26, has the inside track to be the Cubs’ opening day first baseman. Expect some growing pains defensively since he played mostly second and third last season.\n\n25. INF Justin Foscue, Rangers: Nathaniel Lowe’s oblique injury opens the door for playing time at first base in a platoon situation or better if Foscue, 25, can hit at the big league level. The 2020 first-round pick has an .878 OPS over 285 minor league games, most of those in Classes AA and AAA.\n\n26. OF Dominic Canzone, Mariners: Canzone, 26, has 59 big-league games with Seattle and Arizona and a strong spring has put him in line for playing time in left field with the Mariners. Canzone has a .933 OPS across 302 minor league games although that number has dropped considerably in major league action. Canzone also got experience in a pennant race last September, including a four-RBI game.\n\n27. RHP Clayton Beeter, Yankees: An injury to Gerrit Cole has opened up a chance for Beeter, 25, to land the final spot in the rotation. Beeter has 12.8 strikeouts per nine innings in 216 minor league innings and performed well this spring, including four shutout innings in a start against Phillies regulars. There should be opportunities for the 25-year-old until least sometime in June to make an impression in the majors.\n\n28. INF Curtis Mead, Rays: Acquired from Philadelphia for Cristopher Sanchez in 2019, the Australian who can play all infield positions should get at least part-time starts at second or third. Mead, 23, got 83 at-bats last year and has an .890 career minor-league OPS.\n\n29. OF Dominic Fletcher, White Sox: Younger brother of longtime Angel David Fletcher, the 26-year-old can leverage the opportunity a February trade from Arizona to Chicago offers. A little bit of power and speed and a .350 career minor-league OBP.\n\n30. 3B Jace Jung, Tigers: Blocked for the moment by Gio Urshela and a gaggle of utility fellows, Jung, 23, hit 28 homers across high-A and Class AA and cracked the consensus top 50 prospects. Will start at Class AAA but should soon join older brother Josh holding down the hot corner at the highest level.\n\n31. OF Colton Cowser, Orioles: The No. 5 overall pick in the 2021 draft had a breakout spring that should translate to the big leagues better than last year. He struggled when he was called up, going 7-for-61 with 22 strikeouts.\n\n32. INF Davis Schneider, Blue Jays: The begoggled, mustachioed Schneider, 25, gets tossed into the corner infield-utility mix, where anything goes in Toronto. He produced nearly 2 WAR in just a 35-game debut after hitting 21 homers at Class AAA, and is a nice option if Isiah Kiner-Falefa or Cavan Biggio struggle at the plate.\n\n33. RHP Max Meyer, Marlins: The third overall pick in 2020, Meyer missed all of 2023 due to Tommy John surgery, after making his big-league debut in 2022. Miami's rotation has been hit hard by injuries but the Marlins will be careful bringing along Meyer, who starts the season in the minors.\n\n34. Chase DeLauter, Guardians: Jose Ramirez’s long-awaited running mate in the middle of the lineup may soon arrive: DeLauter, 22, backed up a wild 57-game rise from rookie ball to Class AA with an excellent spring and figures to be one of the last camp cuts. Yet nobody has suggested he’s not ready; that debut will happen, probably soon, in 2024.\n\n35. RHP Yariel Rodriguez, Blue Jays: Signed to a four-year, $32 million deal, the Cuban native was plucked from Japan to backfill a rotation spot or fortify the bullpen. While Rodriguez, 27, might not snag a roster spot out of camp, he’s shown encouraging stuff in spring training and will figure in their plans soon.\n\n36. SS/2B Marco Luciano, Giants: Entering his fifth year ranked as a top-40 prospect by MLB.com, the 22-year-old Luciano made his big-league debut last season. He should get some opportunities at shortstop this season after competing with veteran Nick Ahmed for the starting job in spring training.\n\n37. LHP Cody Bradford, Rangers: Bradford, 26, threw 56 innings for the Rangers last season, and in postseason, he allowed one run over 7 ⅔. He will begin in the rotation with a chance to audition to stay there after the expected returns of Max Scherzer and Jacob DeGrom this summer, Scherzer potentially sooner. He was exclusively a starter in the minors with a 9.9 strikeout rate, which also helps him to stick as a reliever.\n\n38. 3B Joey Ortiz, Brewers: Acquired from Baltimore in the Corbin Burnes trade, Ortiz, 25, has shown mostly extra-base power in the minors. However, he’s a defensive whiz at second, third and short – and those skills should earn him an opening day roster spot, possibly as Milwaukee’s starting third baseman.\n\n39. SS Jordan Lawlar, Diamondbacks: Lawlar made it to the major leagues at 21 and was part of Arizona’s run to the World Series as a pinch-hitter and pinch-runner. His speed (76 steals in 207 minor league games) and defense play but Lawlar didn’t hit enough in the big league last season or in spring training to justify him unseating Geraldo Perdomo as Arizona’s starter. But Lawlar might be a longer-term answer and he could be back for another big-league chance if he continues to hit for power in the minors and/or Perdomo falters.\n\n40. RHP Orion Kerkering, Phillies: The right-hander began last year in Low-A Clearwater and had a rapid rise through the minor leagues before making his MLB debut on September 24. Ten days later he was pitching in the NL wild card game. Kerkering, who hasn't pitched since March 1 because of the flu, could be the future closer.\n\n41. RHP Emerson Hancock, Mariners: Seattle’s top pitching prospect got a taste of the big leagues (12 IP) last season. The 2020 sixth overall draft pick’s stint was ended by a shoulder strain and he’ll begin the season in Class AAA, where he hasn’t pitched yet. When healthy, Hancock, 24, throws in the mid- to upper 90s and should get another chance to try and settle into the inexperienced back end of the Mariners rotation.\n\n42. Ricky Tiedemann, LHP, Blue Jays: He's Toronto's No. 1 prospect, but arm problems last season limited Tiedemann, 21, to 44 innings last season and he was not in the running for temporary rotation openings this spring. Still, Tiedemann has touched Class AAA and should start there this season. Good health will put him on the radar for rotation depth.\n\n43. 2B Vaughn Grissom, Red Sox: Acquired from Atlanta in the Chris Sale trade, Grissom, 23, was a great fit for the vacant second base job in Boston. Except a groin injury will force him to start the season on the injured list. His bat (.307 career average in minors) should play in Fenway.\n\n44. RHP James McArthur, Royals: The 6-7, 250-pound closer finished 2023 with 16 1/3 scoreless innings, 19 strikeouts and no walks, giving him the inside track to Kansas City’s closer role. The Royals’ off-season investments should give him a decent amount of save chances, too.\n\n45. OF Victor Scott, Cardinals: Scott, 23, stole an eye-opening 95 bases across High-A and Class AA last season, and his great speed also makes him a very good defender. He’s seen extensive playing time this spring due to several injuries in the outfield, leaving open the possibility he could make the opening day roster.\n\n46. RHP Nick Nastrini, White Sox: Nastrini, 24, has taken advantage after he was dealt from the Dodgers to the South Side in the Joe Kelly deal, posting a 0.82 Cactus League ERA and gaining the inside track to the No. 5 starter job. Nastrini struck out 139 in 114 1/3 innings across three minor league levels, and in his career gives up just 1.1 homers per nine innings.\n\n47. OF Heston Kjerstad, Orioles: A medical condition kept the second overall pick in the 2020 draft out of baseball until 2022. Since his return, he's posted an .887 minor-league OPS and earned a 2023 Baltimore cameo.\n\n48. RHP Ronel Blanco, Astros: The spate of Astros pitching injuries (Justin Verlander, Jose Urquidy, Lance McCullers Jr., Luis Garcia) has opened up an opportunity for the 30-year-old at the back in the rotation. He was dominant in spring training and has been overpowering at times, striking out more than 10 hitters per nine innings in the minors and holding his own in 17 games as a starter and reliever. He swingman status increases his ability to stick around when the regulars start returning.\n\n49. OF Pete Crow-Armstrong, Cubs: An outstanding defender in center field, Crow-Armstrong’s chances of making the opening day roster took a hit when the Cubs re-signed Cody Bellinger. However, he’s still just 21 and he’ll benefit from everyday playing time in the minors until he’s needed.\n\n50. OF Richie Palacios, Rays: Palacios, 26, had a 120 adjusted OPS with six homers in 102 plate appearances for St. Louis last season, and has an early-season opportunity in Tampa Bay due to Josh Lowe's oblique injury. He does not have significant power but offers speed, the ability to make contact and a .392 minor league OBP.\n\n51. INF Jordan Westburg, Orioles: Westburg is projected to be the starting third baseman on Opening Day. He has excellent bat-to-ball skills and can lurk toward the end of a stacked lineup in his first full year in the majors.\n\n52. C Ivan Herrera, Cardinals: A native of Panama, Herrera took a major step forward last season, posting a .297/.451/.500 slash line at Class AAA Memphis. After getting a taste of the majors the past two seasons, he’s in line to take over as Willson Contreras’ backup in St. Louis.\n\n53. INF Osleivis Basabe, Rays: Basabe, 23, batted .218 in an 87 at-bat debut but figures to stay on the 2024 radar due to Wander Franco's status. At his best, Basabe brings a decent hit tool, a reliable glove and 20-steal potential.\n\n54. SP AJ Smith-Shawver, Braves: The 20-year-old right-hander began last season at High-A Rome and ended up in the majors by the end of May. Quite a remarkable feat for throwing less than 200 innings in the minors. His improved changeup should get him positioned to help the Braves rotation.\n\n55. RHP Keaton Winn, Giants: The 26-year-old got a late start in spring training, but is expected to be in the team’s rotation to start the season. He made nine appearances (five starts) down the stretch in a pennant race for San Francisco in 2023 and could transition to the bullpen as the Giants expect several starters back from injury.\n\n56. OF Wilyer Abreu, Red Sox: The lefty-swinging Venezuelan, 24, hits the ball hard and he posted a strong .316/.388/.474 slash line in 85 major-league plate appearances last year. But he’s struggled at the plate this spring, putting a potential starting job in jeopardy.\n\n57. 3B Coby Mayo, Orioles: While Mayo isn't making headlines like teammates and former high school draft picks Holliday and Gunnar Henderson did, scouts have taken notice. He's an imposing 6-5 presence in the batter's box with raw power -- Mayo led the O's farm system with 29 home runs -- and a plus arm will get him to the next level soon enough.\n\n58. RHP Jordan Leasure, White Sox: Another harvest from the Joe Kelly trade, Leasure, 25, punched his way into Chicago’s closer conversation until Steven Wilson was acquired from San Diego in the Dylan Cease deal. Leasure’s averaged 13.5 strikeouts per nine in his minor-league career and is slated to make the club as a non-roster invitee.\n\n59. OF Lawrence Butler, Athletics: Butler, 23, made a 42-game debut last season, reaching base at a .240 clip that belied his .350 mark in his final two minor-league stops. His power has receded as he's ascended levels, and may not profile as a major league regular, but a decent set of all-around tools give him something to build upon.\n\n60. 1B/3B Jared Triolo, Pirates: Triolo, 26, has played mostly third base during his pro career, but after finding himself blocked in Pittsburgh by Ke’Bryan Hayes, will open the season as the Pirates' starting second baseman. His defensive versatility around the infield and his keen batting eye (.418 OBP in the minors, .388 in majors last season) should help his roster security.\n\n61. RHP Mitch Spence, Athletics: A Rule 5 pick from the Yankees, the 25-year-old could be deployed in a swingman role for Oakland this season. He made 29 starts with a 4.47 ERA in Class AAA last season and is averaging a strikeout per inning since making his pro debut in 2019.\n\n62. SS/2B Jacob Amaya, Marlins: Acquired from the Dodgers for Miguel Rojas last winter, Amaya will begin the season in the minors after making his big-league debut in 2023. Miami brought in Tim Anderson to play shortstop, blocking Amaya’s path to at-bats in the near term.\n\n63. RHP Jackson Jobe, Tigers: There’s a pretty good 1-2 of Rust Belt power pitchers, and Jobe, 21, could be Detroit’s worthy answer to the celebrated Paul Skenes in Pittsburgh. The third overall pick in 2021 has big league-ready stuff, just in need of refining and innings under his belt. A 2024 debut seems likely, framed by Jobe’s health and Detroit’s needs at the big league level.\n\n64. 2B Liover Peguero, Pirates: Called up after last year’s All-Star break, Peguero split his time evenly between second base and shortstop, hitting .237 with seven homers and six steals in 59 games. With Oneil Cruz healthy, Peguero, 23, will concentrate on the keystone.\n\n65. INF/OF Xavier Edwards, Marlins: A .312 career hitter in the minors, Edwards played his way to a big-league debut in 2023 by posting a .351 average in Triple-A. The 24-year-old has experience at three infield positions and center field, the kind of versatility that should earn him playing time in the majors sooner rather than later.\n\n66. Owen White, Rangers: White, a 2018 second-round pick, has steadily climbed to the forefront of Texas pitching prospects, and made a two-game relief debut last season. White wasn't as dominant last year as his 2022 season, when he struck out 104 batters in 80 1/3 innings, but has positioned himself as the next man up in the Rangers' rotation.\n\n67. RHP Cade Horton, Cubs: The Cubs’ top pitching prospect, Horton has only thrown 27 innings above High-A. But it’s quite possible the 22-year-old could reach reach the majors this summer. He can hit the upper 90s with his fastball, but his best pitch is his slider.\n\n68. INF Brooks Lee, Twins: Already an advanced prospect when he was drafted eighth overall in 2022, Lee has an .868 OPS in two minor league seasons and is knocking on the door in Minnesota. Currently blocked at all four infield positions, but a good enough athlete to plug and play if an opening emerges.\n\n69. C Tyler Soderstrom, Athletics: The 22-year-old played 45 big-league games last season and will begin 2024 in the minors – but could be back up soon as incumbent catcher Shea Langeliers hit .205 last season. Soderstrom was Oakland's first-round pick in 2020 and hit 29 home runs with 105 RBI across three levels in 2022.\n\n70. OF Hunter Goodman, Rockies: Goodman has positional versatility (he has played corner outfield, first base and catcher in the minor leagues) and a potent bat, two assets for a rebuilding team playing in Coors Field. The 24-year-old led the organization in home runs (34) and RBI (111) in Classes AA and AAA in 2023 and got a 23-game stint in Colorado. He needs to shake the 4-A label but will surely get a chance to do so on a club that’s going nowhere this season.\n\n71. 1B/OF Michael Toglia, Rockies: Toglia tore it up this spring but will have to keep doing it in Class AAA to earn a spot in Colorado. Originally a first-round pick in 2019 out of UCLA, the 27-year-old has seen his prospect status fade a bit but has carried a .826 OPS over 348 minor league games. His numbers have gone down drastically over 76 big-league games but he’s likely to get another look this summer, likely shorter than the one Goodman gets.\n\n72. OF Drew Gilbert, Mets: The 35th overall pick in 2022 turned Justin Verlander trade bait, Gilbert, 23, is a potential 20-homer, 20-steal guy whose speed and arm strength means he could likely man both center or right field at Citi Field. His first full year in the Mets organization could culminate in Queens.\n\n73. RHP David Festa, Twins: In just three years, Festa, 24, has gone from 13th-round pick to, possibly, the first Twins starter called up due to injury. At 6-6, 185, Festa is a lanky figure who punched out 11.6 batters per nine innings at Class AA and AAA last year and has a career 3.30 ERA.\n\n74. RHP Mason Black, Giants: The 24-year-old had a nice minor-league season in 2023 with a 3.71 ERA in 29 starts. Averaging 11.1 strikeouts per nine innings in his pro career, Black should see some starts for San Francisco this year.\n\n75. OF Jasson Dominguez, Yankees: Dominguez was the talk of the organization last year when, as a 20-year-old, he hit a homer off Justin Verlander on Sept. 1 with his first major league swing. He clubbed three more homers and held down center field before it was revealed 10 days later he had been diagnosed with a torn UCL that required Tommy John surgery. He was still working his way back and his age is on his side but more competition for playing time exists if he can return this summer.\n\n76. OF Jordan Beck, Rockies: Beck, a first-round pick in 2022, has hit his way in the minor leagues (.874 OPS) and in spring training into consideration for a prominent role at some point this season. The 22-year-old still needs to play in Class AAA, and he could be a candidate for a call-up as a part of the team’s season-long auditions for future regulars.\n\n77. C Diego Cartaya, Dodgers: Nobody is dislodging Will Smith as LA's starting catcher and backup Austin Barnes is eternal, but the 22-year-old Cartaya could make his big-league debut some time in 2024. He was MLB.com's No. 14 prospect heading into 2023, but hit just .189 in 354 at-bats at Double-A.\n\n78. OF Dylan Crews, Nationals: Crews, the second overall pick in July, spent most of his pro debut in Class AA Harrisburg in 2023 and should move quickly. His ability to play all three outfield positions only complements his elite hitting skills.\n\n79. OF Andy Pages, Dodgers: After totaling 57 minor-league home runs in 2021 and 2022, Pages underwent surgery in May of last year and only played 34 games. He’ll start the year in Class AAA but is already on the Dodgers’ 40-man roster and could see a decent number of at-bats for Los Angeles in 2024.\n\n80. INF Orelvis Martinez, Blue Jays: Martinez, 22, was an early cut in camp with no foreseeable space in Toronto on the dirt. He's still hanging on to top 100 prospect status after 28 homers and an .835 OPS at Class AA and AAA.\n\n81. SS Colson Montgomery, White Sox: With the rebuild enduring in Chicago, Montgomery’s arrival is one of the few developments Sox fans can herald – and it should happen in 2024. Montgomery, 22, had a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League to back up his top prospect status, with only a mastery of Class AAA between him and the shortstop job.\n\n82. LHP Robert Gasser, Brewers: Gasser, 25, could be a rotation option at some point this season. He posted a 3.79 ERA and led all of Class AAA in strikeouts last year with 166 (11.0 K/9).\n\n83. 2B Nick Gonzales, Pirates: The seventh overall pick in 2020, Gonzales reached the majors last season, but hit just .209 in 115 at-bats. He lost a battle with Jared Triolo for an infield job this spring.\n\n84. RHP Hurston Waldrep, Braves: The right-hander can reach the upper 90s with his fastball, but he's been plagued by command concerns. In 29 1/3 innings in the minors, he's walked 13% of the batters he faced.:\n\n85. 3B Noelvi Marte, Reds: After posting an impressive .316/.366/.456 slash line as a 21-year-old in his first taste of the majors, Marte was in line to be the Reds’ everyday third baseman until a hamstring injury – and an 80-game suspension for a positive drug test – derailed those plans. He’ll now be out until mid-June.\n\n86. RHP Jacob Misiorowski, Brewers: Misiorowski, 6-7 with a triple-digit fastball, missed the final month of last season with arm fatigue. Misiorowski, 21, needs to work on his control, but his live arm could make him an asset out of Milwaukee's bullpen at some point this season.\n\n87. RHP Mick Abel, Phillies: Abel, who was selected in the first round of the 2020 draft, rose to Class AAA Lehigh Valley last fall. His curveball is one of the best among minor league prospects, and should position himself as a call-up option later this year for the pitching-deep Phillies.\n\n88. OF James Wood, Nationals: Wood, a focal point of the Juan Soto trade, hit 26 homers, the second most to Lane Thomas (28) in the Nationals organization, and had a loud performance in the Grapefruit League. The 6-6 slugger, just 21, must cut down on his 173 strikeouts at Class AA and AAA last season, but could knock down the door in D.C. soon.\n\n89. INF Luisangel Acuña, Mets: \"Little brother of Ronald Acuña Jr.\" is both factually correct and a decent descriptor. At 5-8 and 180 pounds, Acuña will not match his brother's historic 41-homer, 73-steal season but does bring similarly electric speed and an elite glove to the infield. He's possibly the club's second baseman of the future.\n\n90. OF Brennen Davis, Cubs: Davis has seemed on the verge of making his MLB debut ever since being named MVP of the 2021 Futures Game. But injuries and an inability to make consistent contact have held him back. Perhaps his age-24 season will be the charm.\n\n91. RHP Matt Sauer, Royals: Sauer, 25, is a Rule 5 pick from the Yankees who has a shot to stick in the Royals bullpen. He’s pitched well in the Cactus League, with 10 strikeouts to three walks in eight innings, but with no experience above Class AA, he’d likely remain in a low-leverage situation should the Royals keep him.\n\n92. RHP Slade Cecconi, Diamondbacks: Cecconi, 24, debuted in August and pitched as a starter and reliever, finishing with a 4.33 ERA. Manager Torey Lovullo says his fastball-slider-changeup repertoire makes the 2020 first-round pick a viable option to call on again, though he’ll start the season in the minors. He ability to go multiple innings in both roles also suggests he’ll play a role with Arizona this season.\n\n93. INF Deyvison De Los Santos, Guardians: Plucked from the Diamondbacks in the Rule 5 draft, De Los Santos, 20, is a stocky (5-11, 185) corner infielder who hit 20 home runs in 113 games in Class AA. His 26% strikeout rate in the minors would be hard to improve upon at the big league level, but De Los Santos’s age and power potential make it easy to understand why Cleveland would hold onto him.\n\n94. LHP Cade Povich, Orioles: Acquired from Minnesota for Jorge Lopez in 2022, Povich and Chayce McDermott now comprise the likeliest call-ups should Baltimore need rotation depth. Povich, 23, reached 126 2/3 innings between AA and AAA last year and struck out 170, though his 4.7 walks per nine innings will need to improve.\n\n95. 3B Tyler Black, Brewers: The 33rd overall pick in 2021, Black, 23, broke out last season with 18 home runs and 55 stolen bases at the Class AA and AAA levels. He’s seeing a lot of time at first base this spring.\n\n96. OF Justyn-Henry, Malloy, Tigers: Malloy, 24, led the minor leagues with 110 walks last season, displaying the strike zone control that Detroit GM Scott Harris says he covets. A gaggle of versatile bench players will send Malloy back to Class AAA Toledo, where he hit 23 homers with a .417 OBP, but struck out 152 times. He’s getting closer.\n\n97. RHP Drew Thorpe, White Sox: “Traded for Juan Soto and Dylan Cease” is a pretty good line on a resume and now Thorpe, 23, has likely found his forever home. His stock rose in his first pro season, posting a 2.52 ERA and 0.83 WHIP for two Yankee minor league affiliates, touching Class AA for five starts. A 2024 debut is possible, but building up workload is a greater priority.\n\n98.C Kyle Teel, Red Sox: The 14th overall pick in the 2023 draft out of Virginia, Teel made an instant impact in his first 29 games as a pro. The 22-year-old could possibly start the season at Class AAA and be ready for a call to the majors sometime over the summer.\n\n99. OF Spencer Jones, Yankees: Jones, 22, is making a play to replace Jasson Dominguez as the jewel of the Yankees system after his huge spring that has played him out of trade discussions. His 6-7, 235-pound frame, left-handed swing and ability to play center field gives him a dream profile for Yankee Stadium when his chance arises. He only played 17 games above Class A last season, meaning his shot this year, if it happens, will come in the mid- to late summer.\n\n100. C Ethan Salas, Padres: Salas doesn't carry himself like a normal 17-year-old. He held his own this spring before an early reassignment. He reached Class AA San Antonio last year and the Padres might make him a late-season call-up this season.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/23"}]}

Strike captains at both sites referred requests for comment to the local union president.\n\nOccasionally, drivers passing by those sites would honk as they passed the strikers.\n\nUnion President Shawn Fain said in a letter to Mack parent company Volvo Trucks that 73% of workers voted against the deal in results counted Sunday.\n\nGrowth and development series:These Washington County developers are putting old buildings back to work.\n\nThe UAW represents Mack workers in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Florida.\n\nUnion leaders had reached a tentative agreement on the deal on Oct. 1.\n\nNegotiations for a new labor deal began July 11, said Robert Keller, president of UAW Local 171. The local union represents workers at the Volvo facility north of Hagerstown. The previous contract expired at 11:59 p.m. Oct. 1.\n\nThe deal included a 19% pay raise over the life of the contract with 10% upon ratification, The Associated Press reported. There also was a $3,500 ratification bonus, no increase in weekly health care contributions, increased annual lump sum payments for retirees and a $1,000 annual 401(k) lump sum to offset health care costs for employees who don't get health insurance after retirement.\n\nFain said in his letter to Volvo Trucks' head of labor relations that employees working early Monday would exit the factories after performing tasks needed to prevent damage to company equipment.\n\nFain wrote that UAW members and workers across the country are seeking their fair share in wages and benefits. \"The union remains committed to exploring all options for reaching an agreement, but we clearly are not there yet,\" he wrote.\n\nThe company and union are still apart on work schedules, health and safety, pensions, health care, prescription drug coverage, overtime and other issues, he noted.\n\nKeller told The Herald-Mail there are around 1,400 full-time union members who work at the Hagerstown-area facility. That includes assembly, machining, skilled trades, engineering and office personnel.\n\nThe last time union members at the local facility went on strike was in 2019, Keller said.\n\nAs for the current situation, Keller said, \"We followed the process of the bargaining procedure and the memberships have the ultimate say in their contract approval or denial. As you can see, the membership is upset with the company's offer.\"\n\nKeller said he would not disclose what the membership wants because of \"going back in negotiations.\"\n\nAsked about the status of negotiations, Keller said he was waiting Monday morning on the international union for next steps.\n\n\"We're eager to get back to the table and try to get something ratified for the memberships' approval,\" Keller said.\n\nThe contract might have been sunk by high expectations Fain has set in bargaining with Detroit's three automakers. In those talks, the UAW has asked for 36% raises over four years, while Ford has offered 23% and the other two firms are at 20%.\n\nMack Trucks President Stephen Roy said in a statement Sunday night that the company is \"surprised and disappointed\" that the union chose to strike. The union, he wrote, called the tentative agreement a record for the heavy truck industry. \"We trust that other stakeholders also appreciate that our market, business and competitive set are very different from those of the passenger car makers,\" the statement said.\n\nMack, he wrote, is part of the only heavy truck manufacturing group that assembles all of its vehicles and engines for North America in the U.S., competing against trucks built in lower-cost countries.\n\nThe company is committed to collective bargaining and is confident both sides will reach a deal that delivers competitive wages and benefits while safeguarding the company's future, the statement said.\n\nThe UAW went on strike at selected factories run by automakers General Motors, Ford and Jeep maker Stellantis on Sept. 15. It started with one assembly plant for each company, then spread to 38 GM and Stellantis parts warehouses. Two additional assembly plants at Ford and GM were added later.\n\nOn Friday, the union decided not to expand the strikes to any more plants for the time being after GM agreed to bring its electric vehicle battery factories into the UAW's national contract, assuring that they'll be unionized.

MV Transportation officials said they are still in discussions with their employees' union to find answers. The union is called Amalgamated Transit Union, which is headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland. Calls to the union were unanswered.\n\nWill Devine, Jackson resident and JTRAN rider, said he spoke with other riders who were forced to wait at the bus stop for more than three hours.\n\n\"On our way back we happened to go by several bus stops and there were still people stranded there,\" Devine said. \"You could see the grocery bags in-front of them where they had been shopping and stuck. It's bad because if you're riding the bus and something's going on you don't know, you're just sitting there waiting for your expected ride … I totally depend on JTRAN for my transportation.\"\n\nAnother Jackson resident, JTRAN rider and local activist for those with disabilities, Scott Crawford, told council members the experience has left him and other riders anxious about the future.\n\n\"I'm an activist at heart and I'm very familiar with organized actions. This one makes no sense at all. It only harmed hundreds of vulnerable people who couldn't get to their jobs, medical appointments or other important obligations,\" Crawford said. \"It's left the ridership scared.\"\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba addressed it during his Monday press conference, but like everyone else, he said he hadn't heard from anyone from JTRAN or MV Transportation as to what the \"sick-out\" was called for.\n\n\"I have never been a part of a demonstration where the person I was demonstrating against didn't even know what we were demonstrating about,\" Lumumba said.\n\nWard 2 Councilwoman Angelique Lee, as with other council members, wanted some answers saying this was the first time anything like this has ever happened in Jackson.\n\nAll of this comes weeks after Lumumba and other JTRAN officials celebrated the relaunch of the city's bus system, including new buses, new routes and new bus signs.\n\nStatement from MV Transportation\n\nTerry Thompson, the vice president for customer success for MV Transportation, shared a statement with council members, saying they were unaware of the mass call-outs and are in talks with the union. The company also shared that the union is in violation of the collective bargaining agreement in a statement released Tuesday.\n\n\"MV is deeply disheartened by the recent actions of several union employees that participated in the mass call-outs that adversely impacted the para-transit and service. As of this morning, the company still doesn't know exactly why the employees chose to violate the collective bargaining agreement and participate in an unsanctioned labor action. However, in a recent meeting with the local union they raised issues with MV's safety adherence. There was no mention of MV not honoring the collective bargaining agreement or the financial terms contained within it. Please note, that the previous contractor's collective bargaining agreement with the union allowed for unsafe behaviors, which endanger passengers, employees and the community. MV made the union aware months ago that we would implement our industry leading safety standards and training program. It's important to understand that MV will never compromise on our commitment to deliver world class safety and customer service to the Jackson community and our employees.\"\n\nThe statement continued:\n\nNow what we do know about the mass call-outs, there was a zoom call handled by local union members to coordinate the call-outs. The employees that engaged in this activity did not follow the bargaining process, which their international reps also agreed to. Now what we're doing to prevent this from happening again, first, we've taken legal action against the union to prevent this type of activity from reoccurring, secondly, we'll continue to monitor the situation, refine our operational ready program and to keep the staff, city, as well as our staff involved and up to speed on everything. We will also continue to meet with the union to foster healthy labor relationships that will allow us to provide the kind of transit service the community of Jackson deserves and one that you can be proud of.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/10/02/kaiser-permanente-labor-strike-update-2023/71035191007/", "title": "Why are Kaiser Permanente workers going on strike?

The contract ended Saturday and the two sides have not reached a new deal despite talks in recent days.\n\nThe unions accuse Kaiser executives of bad faith bargaining, which they say interferes with solutions to Kaiser's staffing crisis. Unless the two sides reach an agreement, workers will organize strike lines Wednesday morning at Kaiser hospitals and medical offices in the six states and Washington, union officials said.\n\nThe strike will involve a range of positions, including vocational nurses, nursing assistants, emergency department technicians, radiology technicians, ultrasound sonographers, respiratory therapists, X-ray technicians, dietary services, behavioral health workers, surgical technicians, pharmacy technicians, transporters, home health aides, phlebotomists, medical assistants, teleservice workers and housekeepers. About 400 registered nurses at Kaiser's Moreno Valley Medical Center location in Southern California plan to strike as well, according to Renée Saldaña, a spokeswoman for SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, one of the unions.\n\nKaiser Permanente officials said the two sides have made progress in certain areas and have agreed to continue talks through Tuesday.\n\n\"We continue to make progress on key issues such as a redesigned performance sharing plan with updated payout opportunities,\" Kaiser said in a statement. \"We reached tentative agreements in four key areas: travel for continuing education, the use of temporary workers such as traveling nurses, tracking of staffing vacancies and dispute resolution.\"\n\nWhat would a strike mean for patients?\n\nKaiser said operations remain normal at hospitals and health facilities even though the contract has lapsed.\n\nShould workers strike this week, Kaiser said hospitals and emergency departments will remain open and the health provider will enact contingency plans \"to ensure members continue to receive safe, high-quality care for the duration of the strike.\"\n\nLooming health care walkout:Kaiser strike authorized by unions in 4 states; 3 more may follow\n\nWorker demands: Better pay, shared bonuses\n\nThe unions want Kaiser to improve staffing levels that worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic and address demands on wages and benefits, union officials told USA TODAY.\n\nThe Kaiser unions seek a four-year contract with pay hikes of 7% during the first two years and 6.25% in years three and four. The unions want workers to be eligible for an annual performance bonus that would equal a percentage of their annual wages if goals are met. In past years, workers have been eligible for bonuses of up to 3% of wages if all performance goals are met.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Kaiser said it has proposed a minimum bonus payment \"to protect our employees from receiving no payout.\" Bonuses are based on performance measures such as quality, patient safety and financial performance. Over the past three years, Kaiser said it paid $276 million in bonuses and another $800 million in housing and child care aid and COVID-19 paid leave for illnesses and exposure.\n\nWhat to know about COVIDas hospitalizations go up and some places bring back masks\n\nKaiser and the unions formed a labor-management partnership about 25 years ago after contentious bargaining and strife in the 1980s and 1990s, with the goal of smoother negotiations. That partnership worked well for years, said Dave Regan, president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, but front-line workers say the partnership has deteriorated over the past five years.\n\nThe union proposed managers and front-line workers annual bonuses be evaluated on similar criteria. Over the past year, managers received bonuses while front-line workers did not, union officials said.\n\nOn Labor Day, nearly two dozen union members were arrested and released after a march and protest that ended at Kaiser Permanente hospital in Hollywood.

Or a line in your biography.\"\n\nTrumka's words opened the state AFL-CIO's annual convention in Altoona in front of more than 200 union members — and before 15 Democratic presidential candidates addressed the union crowd.\n\nMost of the candidates, vying for Iowa's more than 100,000 union-member votes, used their 10 minutes to talk about their broader vision for America, instead of providing detailed plans for workers.\n\n► More:Recapturing the union: Democrats fight to bring back labor voters who jumped ship to Trump\n\nThe candidates with plans\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, however, rolled out what he called the \"strongest pro-union platform in the history of American politics\" Wednesday, promising to double union membership in four years, allowing workers to unionize with half the workforce's support, and blocking companies from federal contracts if they move operations offshore.\n\n\"For 45 years, there has been a war waged by the corporate elite against the working class of America,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"What we've seen is the decimation of working families all across the country, while the wealthiest people and corporations have done phenomenally well,\" he said.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg told the crowd he, too, wants to double the number of union workers in America by raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, imposing multi-million dollar penalties for companies that interfere with union elections, and giving federal preference to employers who have unionized labor.\n\n\"I'm also going to expand who can unionize, guaranteeing bargaining rights for all American workers, whether you drive an Uber, work at a McDonald’s franchise or mop the floors at Google,\" Buttigieg said. \"Because it's time in the 21st Century for us to acknowledge that a gig is a job and a worker is a worker, whether you call them a contractor or not.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio pledged to create a chief manufacturing officer in his administration to ensure the United States is creating jobs in burgeoning industries, like electric vehicles and solar panels.\n\nAnd U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado called for expanding apprenticeship programs, the on-the-job training programs typically used by unions.\n\n►More: Iowa caucuses: Michael Bennet wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 in parts of US, expand tax credits\n\nRebuilding the middle class\n\nMost of the candidates preached the union gospel, telling union members that labor is the best way to rebuild the middle class.\n\nU.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who says she has spoken at 126 town halls in 26 states since announcing her campaign for president, pledged to have union members \"at the table\" for big decisions at the White House. She said it's the only way the country will fix \"what's broken in our economy.\"\n\n\"Every single time I've appeared at one of these town halls, I have uttered this sentence: Unions built America’s middle class, and unions will rebuild America’s middle class,\" Warren said. \"I don't just say it when I show up in this room, I say it every time. Because I believe it.\"\n\nThe message comes as Iowa has lost 69,000 union members in the last three decades. The U.S. shed nearly 2 million members over the same time.\n\n\"I've seen my neighbors working full-time jobs and then going to my corner bodega or the shopping center and have to use food stamps, because in this country we've so stripped the dignity of labor that one job is not enough,\" said U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, who is from Newark, New Jersey.\n\nExpanding health care\n\nAll presidential candidates said they supported ensuring health care for all Americans, with Warren, Sanders and others supporting universal health care called \"Medicare for All.\" That proposal, however, concerns union members who fear the universal health care plan could eliminate hard-fought medical benefits leaders say they've negotiated over decades.\n\nMembers would be more likely to support Medicare for All proposals that allow Americans to keep their private medical insurance, leaders have told the Des Moines Register.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock argued Wednesday that unions' health insurance benefits should be protected.\n\n\"You've negotiated really hard for your benefits, with your union, with the employer. In my plan, you get to keep it. You don’t have to give it up,\" said Biden, who supports expanding the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"You worked like hell, you gave up wages for it. And it’s better — many of them are better — than the plans that are out there now,\" he said.\n\nBiden's plan would give Americans the option for a public insurance plan, or keep their employers' insurance.\n\nRepealing Iowa's collective bargaining changes\n\nSanders, Biden and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota took aim at Iowa's 2017 law that gutted protections previously afforded to most public-sector union workers, limiting their collective bargaining powers to wages. Unions previously were able to bargain for other benefits, including health insurance, holidays and overtime pay.\n\nThe law, signed former Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, was deeply controversial and sparked massive protests by labor leaders at the Iowa Capitol.\n\nSanders' said his new \"Workplace Democracy Plan\" would \"essentially repeal\" those changes, which drew perhaps the loudest applause of his speech.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Ken Sagar, president of Iowa AFL-CIO, said the repeal of those collective bargaining rights had a terrible impact on Iowa’s workers. He called it Branstad’s \"final flipping-off of workers in Iowa\" before he left to become the U.S. ambassador to China.\n\nKlobuchar also pledged to repeal \"right-to-work\" laws, which in 26 states prohibits a company and a union from signing a contract that requires workers to pay union dues or fees. Iowa's \"right-to-work\" law was enacted in 1947.\n\nAre ties to labor a done deal?\n\nSeveral candidates spoke of their families' ties to unions, explaining how it helped give them better opportunities in life.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. John Delaney of Maryland said his father's local union gave him a college scholarship that changed Delaney's life.

The agreement, coming after nearly two years of often tense negotiations, represents a milestone for the nonprofit, which has waged legal fights against racial discrimination and for workers rights for five decades but has long faced allegations of internal discrimination against minority employees, especially for leadership roles. In a joint statement Monday, SPLC President and CEO Margaret Huang and Cet Parks, the executive director of Washington-Baltimore News Guild Local 32035, TNG-CWA, which represented SPLC employees, said the contract could “be a catalyst for economic and racial justice in the South and beyond.” The contract covers about 250 employees. The nonprofit’s 2020 990 form, the most recent one available, said SPLC employed 475 people on Oct. 31, 2020. Huang said in a statement in March that SPLC had “nearly 400” employees. Messages seeking more recent numbers were sent to SPLC on Monday morning. The SPLC did not voluntarily recognize the union, and hired a law firm that specialized in “union avoidance” strategies. But nearly 76% of the SPLC’s employees voted to organize in December 2019.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: More than 530 wildfires have burned an area the size of Connecticut in Alaska this year and the usual worst of the fire season lays ahead. Although there has not been much property damage, some residents have been forced to evacuate and one person was killed – a helicopter pilot died last month when he crashed while attempting to carry a load of equipment for firefighters. Recent rains have helped but longer-term forecasts are showing a pattern similar to 2004, when July rains gave way to high-pressure systems, hot days, low humidity and lightning strikes that fueled Alaska’s worst fire year. In 2004, the acreage burned by mid-July was about the same as now, But by the time that fire season ended, 10,156 square miles were charred.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A pedestrian suffered life-threatening injuries after being struck by a train Sunday, authorities said. Police said the incident occurred about 10:30 a.m. The name and age of the injured person haven’t been released yet. Police said they are investigating the incident and so is Union Pacific. The spokeswoman for the railroad company said the crew was not injured in the incident and train traffic has resumed in the area.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Senate stripped two senators of their committee leadership posts for the rest of the year after one sought reimbursement for a meeting at the Capitol that he did not attend. The Senate approved the sanctions against Republican Sens. Alan Clark and Mark Johnson after finding the two violated the chamber’s ethics rules. The Senate also prohibited the two from receiving per diem or mileage payments for the rest of the year. Clark sought reimbursement for attending a Boys’ State meeting at the Capitol last month, even though he didn’t attend it. Johnson signed in Clark’s name on the sign-in sheet at Clark’s request, but Senate leaders decided to deny the $155 per diem for attending that meeting after staff said they did not see him there. Speaking to the Senate separately before the votes Thursday, Clark and Johnson apologized for the violations and said they accepted the sanctions against them.\n\nCalifornia\n\nVandenberg Space Force Base: SpaceX launched 46 more Starlink satellites into orbit Friday aboard a Falcon 9 rocket that blasted off from Vandenberg Space Force Base at 10:39 a.m. The satellites were deployed from the rocket’s second stage to join the Starlink constellation, a space-based broadband internet system with hundreds of satellites in low Earth orbit. The Falcon 9’s reusable first stage returned from space and successfully touched down on a seagoing landing platform in the Pacific Ocean. It was the stage’s fourth flight. The launch occurred 24 hours after an initial attempt was scrubbed seconds before liftoff when the flight computer detected a problem with the position of a valve in one of the rocket’s engines, according to the SpaceX launch webcast.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man who had been charged in the presumed death of his missing wife has pleaded guilty to forgery for casting her 2020 election ballot for Donald Trump. Barry Morphew pleaded guilty Thursday and was fined and assessed court costs of $600, The Denver Post reported. He avoids jail time as part of a plea agreement. Suzanne Morphew was reported missing on Mother’s Day in 2020 after she did not return from a bicycle ride near her home in the Salida area in southern Colorado. Barry Morphew, who pleaded for help finding his wife, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in 2021, but prosecutors dropped the charges in April. Suzanne Morphew’s body has not been found.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDanielson: In its July “Best of” issue, Connecticut Magazine named Pouring & Passages as its editor’s pick for best used bookstore in the state, with voters selecting the store as the first runner-up in the readers’ choice category. “I didn’t expect to even be in the top three in the readers’ choice voting, let alone the editor’s pick for the entire state,” owner Jim Weigel, 71, said. Weigel said the magazine article is paying dividends with new customers coming in from across the state to check out the award-winning store.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Republicans in Delaware are challenging two new laws that allow for same-day voter registration and mail-in ballots. Party officials announced the lawsuit Friday, just hours after Democratic Gov. John Carney signed legislation enacting the changes. Republicans contend the state constitution prohibits those changes, which they said could open the door to election fraud. Proponents of the changes said they improve ballot access without opening the door to fraud. The two laws passed the Democratic-controlled Legislature with just one GOP vote for each. The lawsuit is filed in Delaware Chancery Court on behalf of two plaintiffs with GOP ties. State GOP Chair Jane Brady, a former attorney general, is representing the plaintiffs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:DC Health officials were scheduled to hold a public town hall Monday night to answer questions about the spread of monkeypox, WUSA-TV reported. The District is one of the hot spots in the U.S., with the most monkeypox cases per capita. “We have seen significant interest among D.C. residents in getting vaccinated,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. D.C. currently has enough vaccinations for 70% of its eligible population to receive one dose.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: A 70-year-old woman was stabbed by the bill of a 100-pound sailfish that leaped out of the water and attacked her as her companions were trying to reel it in on a boat near the Atlantic coast, authorities said. The sailfish stabbed the woman from Arnold, Maryland, in the groin area with its pointed bill on Tuesday while she was standing in the boat as two companions tried to bring it in on a fishing line about 2 miles offshore from Stuart, according to a report from the Martin County Sheriff’s Office. The companions applied pressure to the wound, and the woman was taken to Stuart for medical treatment. The woman told deputies the attack happened so fast that she didn’t have time to react, according to the sheriff’s office report. Sailfish are among the fastest fish species in the ocean and, like swordfish, are recognizable by their extended, pointed bills.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Federal Highway Administration has designated two Georgia highways as “alternative fuel corridors” for facilitating the construction of electric vehicle charging stations. U.S. Highway 441 from Cornelia in Northeast Georgia south to Dublin and U.S. 82 from Brunswick west to Albany will add 25%, or approximately 330 miles, to the state’s EV charging network. The highways were selected based on such factors as their location near major job clusters, access to tourism sites, the high share of EV sales in nearby counties and their proximity to hurricane evacuation routes. The designations also are expected to enhance Georgia’s chances of landing federal funds from the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure spending bill Congress passed last fall. The legislation earmarked $5 billion in grants to support EV charging stations.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Police are investigating after a man’s left hand was severed by a sword at a Waikiki 7-Eleven. Honolulu Emergency Medical Services responders were called to the convenience store just after midnight Friday. EMS spokesperson Shayne Enright said they found the man with a severed left hand. The 40-year-old man was taken in critical condition to a hospital. A tourist from Switzerland told Hawaii News Now he witnessed the attack and saw half the man’s hand on the floor. The TV station reported police later arrested a 46-year-old man and launched an attempted murder investigation.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little has ordered that flags be flown at half-staff in honor of the two pilots who died after their firefighting helicopter crashed in Idaho. Killed were 41-year-old Thomas Hayes of Post Falls, Idaho, and 36-year-old Jared Bird of Anchorage, Alaska. Mary Cernicek with the Salmon-Challis National Forest said the CH-47D Series “Chinook” helicopter crashed Thursday in the Salmon River near the small town of Salmon. The pilots were employees of the Anchorage-based ROTAK, which owned the aircraft and was contracted to help fight the Moose Fire burning about 21 miles north of Salmon. Cernicek said both pilots were military veterans.\n\nIllinois\n\nPeoria: The city has purchased three blocks of vacant land, about 3.75 acres, in the Warehouse District for $1.7 million to be used for future parking. Last fall, the City Council voted to allocate just over $5 million to purchase the land and build the parking lot that will sit behind several buildings on the east side of the 800 to 1000 blocks of Southwest Washington Street and west of the railroad track. Pat Sullivan, who owned the land, said he sold the property to the city at fair market value, and he believes it will help spur development within the Warehouse District. At-Large City Councilman Zach Oyler, who serves on the Downtown Development Corporation, said this will cause a significant expansion within the Warehouse District.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: Mayor Jim Brainard accepted the resignation of Police Chief Jeff Horner, the city announced Monday. Former Police Chief Jim Barlow is expected to act as interim chief of police until the city finds a replacement, according to the city’s news release. Horner was police chief for about six months after Barlow retired in January. The city did not provide a reason for Horner’s resignation.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Central Iowa doctors said they have seen an increased demand for vasectomies after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, even though abortion is still legal in Iowa. As more states restrict or ban abortion procedures, doctors said more men are seeking sterilization. Dr. Esgar Guarín, founder of SimpleVas, a Pleasant Hill clinic that exclusively performs vasectomies, said traffic to his website more than doubled following the Supreme Court decision, and more people requested an appointment in a single weekend than would usually sign up in weeks. Dr. Fawad Zafar of the Lakeview Center for Urology also noticed a “phenomenal” increase in patients. Demand for vasectomies took over the office, he said, to the extent they extended hours and started offering procedures on Saturdays. Zafar estimated the clinic received 90% more emails than usual after the Supreme Court decision.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Work will begin in mid-August to identify and fix whatever is causing small amounts of water to leak through the earthen dam at Westlake in Gage Park. Tim Laurent, the Shawnee County parks and recreation director told The Capital-Journal there’s no reason to be alarmed. He said his department has learned from two contractors that “we’re not in any immediate danger of the dam breaking.” He said it’s his understanding that all dams leak, to some degree. Shawnee County earlier this year paid Topeka-based Emcon Inc. $25,820 to fix a leak in that same dam. The work began in February and ended in March, Laurent said. But soon afterward, a different leak showed up elsewhere in the dam, he said. “Obviously, we didn’t solve the problem,” Laurent said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Kentucky’s largest school district will require universal masking on school property as Jefferson County moves into the highest level of COVID-19 community spread. The change began Monday and lasts until Jefferson County comes out of the red level, media outlets reported. It came a little more than two weeks before classes resume in Jefferson County Public Schools. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, will be required to wear a mask on district property or on school buses. District policy automatically requires universal masking whenever the county has a high level of COVID-19 community spread. When community spread in Jefferson County drops, masks in JCPS become optional.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Chief Justice John Weimer of the Louisiana Supreme Court won re-election to another 10-year term. Weimer was automatically reelected when no one signed up to challenge him by Friday’s qualifying deadline for the Nov. 8 ballot, The Advocate reported. Weimer, 67, a former professor at Nicholls State University, first won election to the state’s high court in 2001. He won reelection in 2002 and 2012. In the latter race, he ran unopposed and returned campaign checks to contributors to his campaign. Last Wednesday, he was one of the first candidates to pay the qualifying fees and file the paperwork for the fall election. Weimer’s current term ends Dec. 31.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The federal government is conducting a review of four dams on the Kennebec River that could result in a lifeline for the last wild Atlantic salmon in the U.S. The wild salmon live in a group of rivers in Maine and have been listed under the Endangered Species Act since 2000. One of the rivers is the Kennebec, where Brookfield Renewable U.S. owns dams. Brookfield wants to amend federal licenses for four dams and receive a new 40-year operating license for one of them. That requires a review of the dams’ impacts on salmon, said representatives for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The federal review could result in mitigation measures Brookfield would need to take to protect the salmon, NOAA officials said. The review comes as the Biden administration is also eyeing changes to dams in other parts of the country. The administration released reports earlier this month that said removing dams on the lower Snake River in eastern Washington might be needed to adequately restore salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nMaryland\n\nColumbia: A 12-year-old girl died after the car she was driving ran off the road and struck a tree. Howard County Police said the girl was driving a Toyota Corolla on Broken Land Parkway about 2 a.m. Sunday when the accident occurred. The girl was pronounced dead at the scene. A male passenger, 36, was taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center with serious injuries. Police were investigating why the 12-year-old was behind the wheel.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A humpback whale breached out of the water and landed on the bow of a 19-foot boat Sunday morning. The boat operator reported no injuries and no major damage that affected the seaworthiness of the vessel following the incident, city officials said. Humpback whales can grow up to 62-feet long and weight up to 53 tons. They are popular with whale watchers because of their acrobatic displays – including spectacular breachings in which they launch their bodies out of the water and slap the surface with their pectoral fins or tails. At the time of Sunday’s incident, several boats were around the whale. Video footage from the scene showed the animal launching its body out of the water and its head slamming onto the front of a nearby boat, tipping the rear of the vessel out of the water as it slid back into the ocean. The Plymouth Harbormaster said such incidents are rare, but they can be dangerous for boaters and whales. The harbormaster recommended boaters stay at least 100 yards away from humpback whales to minimize such incidents.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Attorneys for Michigan’s former health director asked a judge Monday to sanction prosecutors who are trying to instantly turn invalid indictments into a fresh round of charges in the Flint water scandal. It’s the latest salvo since the Michigan Supreme Court in June said a one-person grand jury had no authority under state law to return indictments against Nick Lyon, former Gov. Rick Snyder and seven other people. The attorney general’s office insists the indictments can be reinstated as common criminal complaints in Genesee County. That request by prosecutors is pending. A judge has set a Sept. 13 hearing for Lyon and others. Snyder faces a different judge on Aug. 23. They will be the first hearings since the state Supreme Court unanimously said the indictments were invalid.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Metro Bus CEO Ryan Daniel was named the Gerald Anderson Member of the Year Award at the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials. The award recognized Daniel for showcasing dedication to the philosophy “the success of one is contingent upon the success of all,” Metro Bus said in a news release. Metro Bus provides fixed route, dial-a-ride and commuter bus services in St. Cloud, Sartell, Sauk Rapids and Waite Park.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:The state welfare department has fired Brad Pigott, a former U.S. attorney it contracted to claw back millions in misspent federal funds from dozens of people in the state’s sprawling welfare scandal. The termination came about a week after Pigott filed a subpoena on the University of Southern Mississippi Athletic Foundation for its communication with several notable people, including former Gov. Phil Bryant, to get to the bottom of why it received $5 million in welfare funds to build a volleyball stadium. It is unknown how Pigott’s termination will affect the welfare agency’s civil lawsuit, which promised to investigate players in the welfare scheme and answer questions that current criminal proceedings wouldn’t. Last week, Pigott had scheduled depositions with key players in the scheme, including former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. Pigott said he was not given a reason for his termination, but that Mississippi Department of Human Services officials told him it was not related to the quality of his legal work.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Charles: Roughly 2,500 Boeing workers are expected to go on strike next month at three plants in the St. Louis area after they voted Sunday to reject a contract offer from the plane maker. The strike is planned to begin Aug. 1 at Boeing manufacturing facilities in St. Charles County, St. Louis County and Mascoutah, Illinois, after the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 union voted down the contract, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Boing said in a statement it is disappointed in the vote but it will now use its “contingency plan to support continuity of operations in the event of a strike.” A Boeing spokesman said the company’s contract offer included competitive raises and a generous retirement plan that included Boeing matching employee contributions up to 10% of their pay.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is offering up to a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the production and placement of two homemade pipe bombs in Great Falls. On July 4, the ATF, Great Falls Police Department, and United States Air Force Explosives Ordinance Disposal Unit responded to the 2000 block of 9th Avenue South to investigate a homeowner’s discovery of two suspected pipe bombs in their residential backyard while mowing the lawn. The pipe bombs were made of metal pipe containing nuts, screws, bolts and other shrapnel. They were wrapped in cellophane with an exposed fuse. Fortunately, neither device detonated, and no one was injured. Evacuations and shelter-in-place orders were in effect until the devices were rendered safe. It is believed the devices might have been placed anytime between mid-June and July 4. Tipsters should contact the ATF at (888) ATF-TIPS. Information can also be sent to ATFTips@atf.gov or through ATF’s website at www.atf.gov/contact/atftips.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific’s second-quarter profit improved a bit, but the Omaha-based railroad’s expenses jumped as it tried to reduce delivery delays that have left its customers waiting for trains at times. The railroad said its profit grew 2% to $1.84 billion, or $2.93 per share, in the quarter. That’s up slightly from last year’s $1.8 billion, or $2.72 per share. The results beat Wall Street expectations even though Union Pacific’s performance disappointed with two key performance measures – the speed of its freight cars and locomotive productivity – down 12%. CEO Lance Fritz said the railroad’s performance improved throughout the quarter after it imposed limits on the number of cars some customers could ship to help clear backlogs, and he said he expects that improvement to continue gradually as the railroad hires and trains more workers to handle the demand. Union Pacific is one of the nation’s largest railroads, with a network of 32,400 miles of track in 23 Western states.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities said they still are investigating the reported theft of an ancient Torah from a man who was staying at a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Metro Police said the item was reported stolen from The Venetian last month. They said a man told detectives he left his Torah inside of a convention room that had been converted into a synagogue. Police said the Torah had been used in the convention room since June 8 and had remained in that location until it was reported stolen two days later. Hotel video surveillance showed a man walking through the property pulling a suitcase on wheels, but police said Friday they have not been able to identify the suspect.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nExeter: The city recently joined 50 other communities in the Granite State to impose outdoor water use restrictions amid a statewide drought. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the state and more than half of Maine is under a “moderate drought” and communities along the state’s border with Massachusetts are enduring a “significant drought.” Data from the National Integrated Drought Information System showed all of Strafford and Rockingham counties are in a or moderate drought. However, 13% of Rockingham is experiencing severe drought. The dry conditions affecting the state are tied to low snowpack this past winter, an early spring melt and below-average rainfall over the past few months.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Gov. Phil Murphy announced $60 million in incentive programs designed to increase the number of electric vehicles and charging stations in the Garden State. “There is no doubt that the tide has turned and electric vehicles are now a legitimate alternative, equal to their internal combustion competitors in price, if not superior in performance,” Murphy said during a stop in Asbury Park’s municipal building. The Charge Up New Jersey program offers up to $4,000 in incentives for New Jersey residents who purchase or lease electric vehicles. The state Board of Public Utilities’ program previously provided residents up to $5,000 off the purchase or lease of new, eligible zero-emission vehicles, including battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric models retailing for less than $55,000. The incentive was changed to $4,000, according to the board, to “allow the existing funding to go further and provide more incentives for EVs in New Jersey.” Murphy said in its first two years the program was “maxed out” and helped put 13,000 new EVs in New Jersey garages.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Vegas: The search continued Sunday for a man reported missing after flash floods hit a wildfire burn scar in northern New Mexico. Authorities said the bodies of two women were recovered Thursday west of Las Vegas after the Cabo Lucero Volunteer Fire Department responded to a call of a vehicle being washed away by floodwaters. Officials with the San Miguel County Sheriff’s Office said the bodies were found in different places along a creek. A search began Friday for a missing man who was in the vehicle with the women, according to authorities. The names, ages and hometowns of the women and man haven’t been released yet. The flooding occurred in the “burn scar” area from the Hermits Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. The combined wildfire has burned 533 square miles and has yet to be fully contained after more than three months.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: By the thousands, revelers recently returned to Havemeyer Street in the city’s Williamsburg neighborhood to celebrate the annual Giglio Feast following its first-ever cancellation in 2020 because of the pandemic, and then downsized crowds in 2021. The feast, first held in Williamsburg in 1903 by immigrants from Nola, Italy, combines two celebrations. One, typically held on June 22, is dedicated to St. Paulinus, the Bishop of Nola from 409 AD to 431 AD, and the other, celebrated on July 16, to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, the name given to the Virgin Mary by the Catholic Church’s Carmelite Order. Although the feast used to span several weeks between the holidays, it has since been combined into one 12-day event. Throughout the festivities, people from the Catholic church and the surrounding community walk the streets, savoring food from pop-up stands and playing carnival games. The highlight of the feast is the lifting of the Giglio, an 80-foot, 4-ton tower crowned with a life-size St. Paulinus figurine. As 100 to 150 men struggle to walk with the Giglio on their shoulders, an older man takes the lead, clearing the way and waving a cane while shouting directions.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Officials said an environmental cleanup company violated a county’s “objectionable odor rule” when it accidentally released a smelly chemical that offended nostrils and caused alarm across Charlotte earlier this month. The Charlotte Observer reported the area’s 911 system was flooded with calls July 14 from people who thought they smelled a leak of natural gas. Climate conditions across the city seemed to spread the smell broadly. In fact, though, a company called Legacy Environmental Services accidentally released a chemical called mercaptan while it was recycling four metal tanks. Mercaptan is a harmless chemical added to natural gas that smells like rotten eggs so that people can detect a possible leak. The Observer reported Friday that Mecklenburg County officials said the release has been classified as a violation and they are seeking more information from the company to determine next steps. The company said it is cooperating with regulators.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State officials said taxable sales and purchases for the first quarter of 2022 were up 13.2% compared to the same period last year. State Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus reported taxable sales and purchases for January, February and March totaled $4.7 billion, with all industry sectors seeing an increase, the Bismarck Tribune reported. All of the 15 major industry sectors reported increases over the first quarter of 2021. The mining and oil extraction sector rose 37%, and the wholesale trade sector was up 27.5%. Counties with the highest percentage increases were Williams at 32.1% and Renville at 34.5%. Morton County had an increase of 5.1% and Burleigh County experienced a decrease of 0.4%.\n\nOhio\n\nPlain City: A recent study said a new state permit that would allow Plain City to treat more sewage should include tougher standards to better protect the Big Darby Creek and its watershed. The assessment, conducted by the Hilliard-based Midwest Biodiversity Institute for the nonprofit Darby Creek Association, in particular cited concerns about ammonia, and the monitoring under a state draft permit is inadequate to protect the diverse wildlife in the watershed. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s rules regarding ammonia are not as stringent as the U.S. EPA’s regulations, said Ed Rankin, senior research biologist for the institute. He said he is concerned about the effects of ammonia on about 40 species of mussels in Big Darby Creek. Dissolved oxygen reductions from the use of ammonia in wastewater treatment can decrease species diversity in water downstream of treatment plants and result in fish kills, according to the U.S. EPA. The nutrients in ammonia also can feed plant growth along waterways, feeding algae and creating other problems, the EPA said. Rankin said any new permit for Plain City’s wastewater treatment plant should include federal standards for ammonia.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A nonprofit will open a transition home for human trafficking victims later this year, with organizers hoping to serve those affected while also educating the public about sexual exploitation. The Dragonfly Home started as a crisis center in 2016, aiding sex and labor trafficking victims by providing resources such as legal assistance and therapeutic services. Now, the nonprofit has a nine-bedroom house for women who have experienced human trafficking and need shelter, becoming the first and only transitional house in Oklahoma City certified by the Oklahoma attorney general’s office. All services provided by the Dragonfly home are free. The Dragonfly Transition Home is opening as reports of sex trafficking and forced labor multiply across the country. In 2020, the National Human Trafficking Hotline reported 10,583 reported trafficking cases, a 37% increase in just five years. In May, Oklahoma legislators approved using $5.3 million from the state budget to to create a human trafficking response unit. For more information about The Dragonfly House, go to https://www.thedragonflyhome.org.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:Backyard burning, agricultural burning and land clearing burns are restricted in Polk County starting Monday. In a news release sent Friday, Dallas Fire and EMS announced the ban, which is effective through late September. The burn ban was issued by the Polk County Fire Defense Board. The decision was made after the Oregon Department of Forestry’s fire season declaration and the upcoming higher summer temperatures. Under the ban, all backyard and agricultural burning will be prohibited. The ban does not apply to the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management regulated lands that have independent jurisdiction and regulations. More information is available at the Burn Information Line at (503) 838-2020. Anyone in violation of the ban might be held liable for the cost of putting out a fire and for any property damage that results, according to the release. There is currently no burn ban in Marion County.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nFogelsville: A man taken to an eastern Pennsylvania hospital last week after police shot a boa constrictor that was around his neck has died of his injuries, authorities said. The Lehigh County coroner’s office said Monday that 27-year-old Elliot Senseman died Sunday morning at Lehigh Valley Hospital, Cedar Crest. The cause of death was was listed as anoxic brain injury due to asphyxiation by constriction and the manner of death was ruled accidental. “A boa constrictor-type snake approximately 18 feet in length constricted around the neck of Mr. Senseman, thus causing the anoxic brain injury (complete lack of oxygen to the brain),” the coroner’s office said. Police were called to the Fogelsville home shortly after 2 p.m. Wednesday on a report of a man in cardiac arrest with a snake wrapped around his neck. Police said an officer was able to shoot the snake’s head without hurting Senseman, who was given medical aid and taken to the hospital. Upper Macungie Township police and the coroner’s office are investigating. Police told WTXF-TV the snake was the man’s pet and several other snake enclosures were found inside the home. Lt. Peter Nickischer said Monday that investigators don’t know the circumstances of the attack because “the dire situation” precluded “extended interviews … about the snake, its origin, or anything along those lines.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A high school basketball coach has been criminally charged by authorities who said he asked male student-athletes to remove their clothes so he could check their body fat. Aaron Thomas was charged Thursday with child molestation and sexual assault involving two students. Thomas coached boys at North Kingstown High School since the 1990s until he resigned last year. An attorney for Thomas said his client denies wrongdoing and the tests bettered the athletic performance of many students. Arraignment is scheduled for Aug. 19.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAnderson:More than 400 friends and family enjoyed food and an evening of live music at the 80th birthday celebration for blues great Dr. Mac Arnold on Wednesday at the Anderson Civic Center. In between performances, Arnold’s family presented him with a white cowboy hat as a birthday gift and as an alternate option to the signature black hat he is known to wear. “Words can’t express it,” Arnold said. “The people who are here, most of them, I’ve known over 70 years.” Earlier on Wednesday, Arnold received the Jo Brown Senior Citizen of the Year Award from the Anderson County Senior Citizens Program – an accolade that commemorates his Hall of Fame Blues career and local, Upstate impact.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Tim Giago, the founder of the first independently owned Native American newspaper in the United States, has died at age 88, his former wife said. Giago, who died at Monument Health in Rapid City on Sunday, created an enduring legacy during his more than four decades of work in South Dakota journalism, his colleagues said. Giago founded The Lakota Times with his first wife, Doris, in 1981, and quickly showed that he wasn’t afraid to challenge those in power and advocate for American Indians, she said. Launching the paper, even years after the 1973 Wounded Knee siege between U.S. marshals and the American Indian Movement, was challenging because wounds still existed on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and in South Dakota, Doris Giago said. Tim Giago blamed the American Indian Movement for violence on the reservation. Windows at the paper were broken and the office was firebombed. “And through it all, Tim never backed down,” said Doris Giago, who was married to him from 1979 to 1986. The Lakota Times was renamed Indian Country Today. Giago founded the Native American Journalists Association and served as its first president. He was also the first Native American to be inducted into the South Dakota Newspaper Hall of Fame.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State attorney general Herbert Slatery’s office on Monday said it’s still unknown when the state’s anti-abortion “trigger ban” will go into effect, but some state lawmakers are raising alarm the ban has no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Tennessee has been limiting abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion rights case in June. However, the state also has another abortion ban designed to restrict abortion almost entirely. But that law can’t be enacted until the Supreme Court enters a judgment on the Roe ruling, which is expected soon. Doing so will start the clock on Tennessee’s trigger law and allow it to be implemented within 30 days. Idaho and Texas have similar timelines, and a handful of other states’ trigger laws have been delayed because of legal challenges. Slatery’s office initially said the state could begin enforcing the trigger law in mid-August, but nearly a month after making that estimate, a spokesperson said they were “not sure” if that timeline was still in place.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Muhammad Ali’s championship belt from his 1974 “Rumble in the Jungle” heavyweight title fight was sold at auction on Sunday for $6.18 million. The winner of the heated competition for the belt was Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, according to Heritage Auctions in Dallas. In a tweet Sunday, Irsay confirmed he acquired the belt for his collection of rock music, American history and pop culture memorabilia that is touring the country. The belt will be displayed on Aug. 2 at Chicago’s Navy Pier and on Sept. 9 in Indianapolis. The 1974 fight was one of boxing’s most memorable moments. Ali stopped George Foreman to recapture the heavyweight title in the African nation of Zaire. Ali won the fight with a knockout in the eighth round.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The city opened its ninth fire station that will serve the growing population on its southern edge. Fire Station 9 is located at 2225 East Commerce Drive. The city has been planning for the fire station for seven years and the newest addition is one of three fire stations in the works, Mayor Michele Randall said. The public was invited to tour Fire Station 9 on Friday during a ribbon-cutting ceremony and fire truck push. A fire hose was used in place of a ribbon and those in attendance were offered refreshments and small gifts. St. George Fire Department Chief Robert Stoker said the new facility would make responses to fires in Little Valley much quicker.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:Ice Cream Bob’s, a canary-yellow kiosk on the Burlington waterfront, is open again after supposedly shutting down after Memorial Day. “I realized I maybe retired too soon,” owner Bob Saffi, 80, said. “I missed it, I really did.” Saffi reopened the shop on July 1 so a potential buyer could see the operation. Those talks stalled after July 4, but Saffi said he was having so much fun – and receiving so much traffic – that he decided to keep the stand open for another summer. Saffi began running the stand in 2002 as a converted ticket booth. Ice Cream Bob’s sells an assortment of hot food and ice cream and is best known for its maple creemees and sprinkles.\n\nVirginia\n\nStaunton: The Central Shenandoah Health District has temporarily discontinued clinical services offered by the Waynesboro-Augusta Health Department as it prepares to move to a new location. A reopening date is scheduled for the spring of 2023. Health department staff will still be available until Aug. 12 at the Waynesboro-Augusta Health Department for inquiries regarding vital records or other documents. During this transition, arrangements for services can be made with the Staunton-Augusta Health Department. Information on the new site for the Waynesboro-Augusta Health Department will be shared with the public as soon as additional logistics are completed, according to a news release.\n\nWashington\n\nKitsap:A carving studio that will become part of the Chief Kitsap Academy campus is under construction, opening the way for the Suquamish Tribe’s compact school to display various projects by students. The studio is planned to include a classroom for teaching Salish-style art and carving techniques, according to a statement. One-third of the building is set up as classroom space in which students and teachers can conduct educational projects, and two-third of the building would be a shop area, according to Rex Green, the principal of Chief Kitsap Academy. The studio is expected to be completed in mid-August, Green said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Monday abruptly added state abortion law to the agenda for a special session of the Legislature he called to focus on his plan to reduce the state’s income tax. The Republican governor announced last week he was calling legislators to Charleston on Monday to weigh his plan for a 10% tax reduction. He made no mention of abortion in that announcement, though he has hinted in recent days that it might be the subject of a special session as well. The Senate had gaveled in for the day and the House was preparing to start work when Justice announced abortion was being added to their agenda. In his announcement, Justice asked legislators to “clarify and modernize” the state abortion laws in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last month ending federal protection for abortion. West Virginia has a state law on the books dating to the 1800s making performing or obtaining an abortion a felony, punishable by up to a decade in prison. It provides an exception for cases in which the mother’s life is at risk. A week ago, a Charleston judge blocked enforcement of the ban, saying the recent laws enacted by the Legislature “hopelessly conflict with the criminal abortion ban” and that it would be “inequitable” to allow conflicting laws to remain on the books. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democrat Tom Nelson dropped out of Wisconsin’s U.S. Senate race on Monday and endorsed Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes ahead of next month’s primary. Nelson announced his decision in a tweet. The Outagame County executive didn’t elaborate on why he was suspending his campaign, but he has trailed in polls behind front-runners Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski. The Democrats are vying to take on Ron Johnson, who is seeking a third term.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A Morning Consult poll released July 19 showed Republican Gov.

Journal News\n\nWHITE PLAINS, N.Y. — A&P has asked a bankruptcy court judge to set aside two key union provisions — bumping rights and full severance pay — after reaching a negotiation impasse with labor groups, officials said in court documents.\n\nThe supermarket wants to completely eliminate bumping rights, saying the administrative burden and costs associated with allowing workers to do that are too high and undesirable to would-be buyers of its stores. Bumping rights allow employees who work the longest for the company and at a store slated to close to take the job of a less senior worker at a supermarket that will continue to operate.\n\nThe other sticking point is the amount of severance pay A&P will pay and when, the documents filed late Tuesday indicate.. The supermarket has proposed paying employees who will lose their jobs as part of the bankruptcy 25% of the severance they are entitled to on a \"timely basis\" with a maximum cap of $10 million for all workers. The rest of the severance would be paid later, depending on how much remains after the stores have been sold and what other A&P creditors are due as part of settling the bankruptcy case.\n\nBesides these two sticking points, both parties appear to have reached an agreement on most of their other issues. A hearing on the matter is scheduled Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here.\n\nJohn Niccollai, head of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 464A, which has an office in Tarrytown, N.Y., said union members are circulating a petition opposing A&P's request, which they will present to the bankruptcy court judge. When A&P last filed for bankruptcy in 2010, the union agreed to concessions that it valued at $625 million in exchange for reassurances that A&P would honor union provisions going forward.\n\n\"Now they're looking to knock all of that out,\" Niccollai said.\n\nUnion leaders have pledged to fight for all the provisions in their collective bargaining agreements, he said.\n\n\"It's a question of who's going to take the hit,\" Niccollai said. \"Why should the working people take the hit?\"\n\nA&P filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy July 20, seeking to close at least 25 stores as soon as possible and sell the rest of its about 300 stores — branded as A&P, Food Basics, Food Emporium, Pathmark, Superfresh and Waldbaum's — in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nAcme, Stop & Shop and Key Foods have put in bids for 118 stores though A&P said those offers don't include union provisions, such as bumping rights and assumption of pension plans.\n\nA&P called it \"a certain deathblow to the hopes of an orderly Chapter 11 liquidation\" if the company were to lose those three bids with an estimated potential loss of $213 million. Other would-be buyers also would be dissuaded from putting in a bid, the company said in documents.\n\n\"The threat of such bumping would likely drive down the price of bids, as potential purchasers would not know with any certainty what they would be buying or whom they would employ,\" A&P said.\n\nSeverance pay also is crucial because A&P estimates costs will be as high as $54 million — and as high as $90 million if the 118 stores with bids also are affected.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/08/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/18/he-opposed-union-ended-up-member-anyway-because-his-boss-insisted-mark-dantonio-davis-ruark-da/1687572002/", "title": "Davis Ruark opposed union, ended up a member anyway because ...", "text": "LAS CRUCES - Davis Ruark did not think a union was a good idea.\n\nThe former Deputy District Attorney for New Mexico's 3rd Judicial District had a 24-year run as an elected State's Attorney in Maryland as a Democrat, but he felt a union in the Doña Ana County DA's office was not the best way for prosecutors to address their concerns.\n\n\"I didn't think it would be in the best interest of the attorneys,\" he testified on Wednesday in a hearing before New Mexico Public Employee Labor Relations Board director Thomas Griego.\n\nRuark recalled the November 2017 afternoon that a group of prosecutors working under Third District Attorney Mark D'Antonio delivered a letter to D'Antonio to request voluntary recognition of a collective bargaining unit.\n\n\"It was a very tense time for Mr. D'Antonio,\" Ruark testified. \"He was very upset that this was kind of delivered to him out of the blue.\"\n\nIt also came as a surprise to Ruark, who learned of the union campaign when D'Antonio called him back to the office from a lunch break.\n\n'Lead from the courtroom'\n\nDavis knew staff attorneys had concerns.\n\nHe began working for D'Antonio in 2015, having previously worked for the Fifth District Attorney's office in Carlsbad. In 2016, he was promoted to deputy, and testified on Wednesday that in addition to prosecuting cases, he considered mentoring younger attorneys to be part of his role. He said his preferred approach as a supervisor was to \"lead from the courtroom.\"\n\nIn 2017, some of the office's prosecutors sought to organize with Communications Workers of America after efforts to address issues — including attorney salaries, excessive caseloads, funds for expert witnesses, and the management by Chief Deputy Gerald Byers — had gone unresolved.\n\nRuark testified that he was sympathetic to their concerns but felt a union would be problematic. His advice for D'Antonio and Byers, he said, was that if employees were trying to organize, management should \"take a look at themselves first and see how they are performing.\"\n\nMore:Labor board hears complaint of discrimination and union-busting in DA's office\n\nD'Antonio, per Ruark's testimony, had other ideas.\n\n\"Mr. D'Antonio has knee-jerk reactions sometimes,\" Ruark said, as he described the DA considering options as drastic as summarily firing all pro-union attorneys before calming down.\n\nRuark said that he advised D'Antonio about concerns attorneys had conveyed to him, particularly about hostility toward women and retaliatory conduct. He said he recommended that, as DA, he make himself more visible and accessible to the staff.\n\nIn his own testimony on Wednesday, D'Antonio said he maintains an \"open door\" policy for his attorneys, and that he never seriously considered firing pro-union employees, although he felt a union would be disruptive to office discipline.\n\n'We had to tell him he was in the union'\n\nRuark acknowledged helping D'Antonio gather information about which attorneys supported a union and which did not.\n\nMeanwhile, as winter progressed, an election was scheduled where employees would vote up or down on forming a union. CWA staff representative Robin Gould facilitated talks with the office about who would be included in the bargaining unit if it passed.\n\nGould told the Sun-News that Ruark, along with Deputy District Attorney Daniel Sewell, were included in the bargaining unit at the insistence of the employer. Both men were functioning in supervisory capacities that led the union to consider them part of management, but Gould said the union ultimately agreed to include them.\n\n\"We had to tell him he was in the union,\" Gould said of Ruark.\n\nMeanwhile, Ruark said D'Antonio instructed him to \"do what you need to do in order to secure a negative vote.\"\n\n\"I ignored that request,\" he said.\n\nRuark also demurred on an order to unload most of the cases he was carrying, he told the hearing.\n\nDeputies were asked to lighten their caseloads so they could focus on supervisory duties, Ruark said, but he was concerned that attorneys carrying excessive caseloads already \"were going to get dumped on.\"\n\nKelly Herson testified during Tuesday's hearing — the first day of testimony — that when she resigned in June, she was carrying 206 felony cases.\n\nRuark fired ahead of vote\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 25, D'Antonio held a \"captive audience\" meeting during which an employer may require staff to attend a presentation preceding their vote on whether to unionize.\n\nRuark testified that D'Antonio's address to prosecutors that morning, during which he suggested racial animus might be motivating the union effort, damaged his case and likely secured a vote in favor of the union.\n\nHe said he was surprised the following day when D'Antonio asked him directly: \"I assume you are voting against the union — are you?\"\n\nAs it happened, Ruark never got to vote. The Jan. 26 union election was rescheduled for February, by which time Ruark would be fired.\n\nRuark testified that Byers asked him to investigate prosecutor Rebecca Duffin's conduct on a murder case, which he did and concluded that Duffin had done nothing wrong. He also recalled defending Herson during a discussion amid D'Antonio and Byers about terminating her.\n\nFinally, on Jan. 29, Ruark said Byers asked him to determine whether Duffin had taken a long lunch break. Ruark said he interviewed her, took a statement from her that she had been gone for one hour, and filed a memo with Byers.\n\nLater that day, Ruark was placed on administrative leave. He was then terminated, with his last day of employment Feb. 1.\n\nTwo weeks later, employees voted to form a union. Ruark has since joined the 12th Judicial District Attorney’s Office in Alamogordo.\n\nIn an interview with the Sun-News, Gould said, \"We believe he was fired for not providing information the employer wanted about what was going on with unionizing or, in my opinion, for spying on what was going on.\"\n\nOn Ruark's behalf, the union filed a prohibited practices complaint challenging his termination. The complaint was settled in August, although Ruark and the union did not disclose the terms.\n\n'To this day, I am still hurt'\n\nBefore leaving the stand on Wednesday, Ruark asked to make a parting comment. He then paid tribute to the Third Judicial District and the prosecutors with whom he worked, and said, \"To this day, I am still hurt that I no longer work there.\"\n\nHis final statement, with Byers as well as several present and former employees of the office in the hearing room, was: \"I think the office has become dysfunctional.\"\n\nAs Ruark approached the door to leave the room, attorney Jeffrey Toppell, representing the employer, called for the remark to be stricken from the record.\n\nHearing officer Thomas Griego agreed, as Ruark walked through the door, and headed for a trial taking place downstairs.\n\nAlgernon D'Ammassa can be reached at 575-541-5451, adammassa@lcsun-news.com or @AlgernonActor on Twitter.\n\nREAD MORE", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2019/02/14/gm-offers-canadian-union-worker-benefits/2874046002/", "title": "GM details benefits it will offer Canadian union workers at Oshawa", "text": "General Motors Canada has asked the Canadian autoworkers union, Unifor, to start a discussion with workers at Oshawa Assembly plant about the benefits GM is prepared to offer them as it idles the plant later this year.\n\nIn a short press release Thursday, GM Canada noted a performance that day by singer and songwriter Sting in Oshawa, Ontario, in support of the Unifor workers.

And that makes my job easier and harder at the same time.\"\n\nWait, Johansson can’t even say how she feels about the idea of Black Widow finally getting her own film? Or if she's ramping up workouts to prepare? “No, I can’t!” she says, fully under the scrutiny of a Disney representative sitting on the floor behind her. “Really.”\n\nSorry, Black Widow! Scarlett Johansson's daughter loves princesses the most\n\nScarlett Johansson slams paparazzi: 'Just a waiting game' until someone gets killed\n\nJohansson, along with Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Chris Evans (Captain America), Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) and Chris Hemsworth (Thor), is one of the O.G. Avengers, having arrived in the Marvel Cinematic Universe way before the new kids like Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) came around.\n\n“It’s been a very transformative decade,” says Johansson. “When my character started in 'Iron Man 2,' she was like a souped-up secretary with a skill set on the side.”\n\nIndeed, her character has weathered the best and worst of Marvel, including blatant sexism: \"Avengers: Endgame\" co-director Joe Russo found a “disturbing” lack of Black Widow toys available for kids around 2015's \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" and consequently she was included in the first action-figure wave for 2016's \"Captain America: Civil War.\"\n\nExperts are surprised it's taken so long for Johansson, who drove the 2014 action film \"Lucy\" to $463.4 million worldwide at the box office, to be granted a Marvel spinoff. But while her Widow waited, \"female superheroes have evolved into being far more than just a pretty face or a hypersexualized presence,\" says Karie Bible, box office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \"They have ample power and agency of their own and don't require a romantic interest. Times have changed and these movies are changing with them.\"\n\nJohansson agrees that the MCU has evolved.\n\n“I look around today at the universe and how diverse it is and the fact that the audience and the fans drove the studios in general, not just Marvel, to represent what was going on in the zeitgeist. And that they wanted to look up on the screen and see stories and fully developed characters that represented how they felt and what they wanted to aspire to. It’s really impactful.”\n\nA lot has changed for Johansson in real life since she became a superhero. Five years ago, she welcomed her first child, a daughter named Rose Dorothy, with ex-husband Romain Dauriac. (She's dating \"Saturday Night Live\" star Colin Jost.)\n\nAlas, Black Widow isn't the No. 1 toy in her household. \"My daughter loves fairy tale things,\" she says. \"She loves girl things, princess stuff. And I love it, too! I love all the Disney princesses from back in the day. Now they’re much more empowered than some of the older, classic ones. But you’re sort of battling that a little bit, and you start to see how the dynamic of those classic fairy-tale stories affect the way that your children think about the male/female roles in society. It’s very black and white.\"\n\n'One for the ages': First reactions to 'Avengers: Endgame' hail Marvel 'epic'\n\nAvengers assemble! See the 'Avengers: Endgame' stars' #7YearReunion photo\n\nAlong her superhero trajectory, she's also suffered some cultural missteps: Outcries of whitewashing arose after she starred in the Japanese manga adaptation “Ghost in the Shell” in 2017, and criticism from the LGBTQ community drove Johansson to drop out of playing a trans character just last year in the movie \"Rub & Tug.\"\n\nBut she’s also become a vocal member of the Time’s Up initiative in Hollywood and has earned a no-nonsense reputation in the industry. In a sense, onscreen or off, you don’t mess with the woman the media has dubbed ScarJo.\n\nAhead of “Endgame,” Johansson exudes the confidence of feeling “more like I belong here. I’ve worked to get here,\" she says. \"I can stand among my cast and crew and feel like I have a decade of work under my belt and it’s meaningful. I didn’t start that way on 'Iron Man 2.'\n\n“I didn’t know how the audience was going to respond to my take on the character – it was a beloved character forever and I felt like it was huge shoes to fill. And now I feel like Black Widow is mine. I feel ownership of that character and I feel confident about it.”\n\nWho lives or dies in 'Avengers: Endgame'? Every hero's chance of survival, ranked\n\n'Avengers: Endgame':Everything you need to know going into the epic final battle\n\nOK, so back to the “Black Widow” spinoff. Johansson obviously won’t comment on casting rumors for a movie she can’t confirm is being made (cough, Rachel Weisz and “Stranger Things” star David Harbour, cough). She does “love” Harbour’s Netflix show, for the record.\n\nSimilarly, she won’t get near salary negotiations for a movie she’s not allowed to confirm, but for Johansson, parity was a strategy from the start.\n\n“I feel very fortunate to be able to say this, but I fought that battle really early on, and set a precedent for myself in my career and just stuck to it really strongly,” she says, noting that her manager mom insisted upon parity since she was a child actor.\n\n“Now I even have, like, surpassed my male co-stars,” she says with a chuckle. “But I have my mom to thank for really pushing that, being like, 'It’s about screen time. You guys are both leads (and should be paid equally).' It was never even a male/female thing.”\n\nContributing: Brian Truitt", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/24"}]}

Authorities have secured 140 fire engines, dozens of bull dozers and at least six helicopters, Cal Fire said. Zero percent of the blaze has been contained as of Friday morning, according to Cal Fire.\n\nLongtime resident evacuates home after authorities issue order\n\nIn a frenzy, Anasyua Basil packed her Honda Fit with clothes, paintings, framed pictures and her cat, Half Stash – everything she wanted to be safe in case the explosive Park Fire reaches her home.\n\n\"I didn't pack as well as I would have liked to,\" Basil, 63, told USA TODAY. \"Under an emergency it's very hard to think clearly.\"\n\nBy Thursday afternoon, the heavy smoke from the blaze, which had ripped across thousands of acres of brush and timber, had partially blotted out the sun, she said. Shortly before she left her home in northern Butte County, the fire had crossed the nearby highway, forcing Basil and other residents to take a narrow, winding backroad instead.\n\nBasil slept at her friend's home in Chico, where she plans on staying until the evacuation order is lifted.\n\n\"Fire season is the hardest time of the year,\" she said.\n\nButte County has a history of historic wildfires\n\nThe residents in Butte County and surrounding areas are all too familiar with rapidly spreading wildfires.\n\nIn 2018, the Camp Fire devastated the area, particularly the town of Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying 14,000 homes. It remains the deadliest wildfire in California history, the deadliest wildfire in 100 years in the U.S. and it was the costliest natural disaster in the world in 2018.\n\nThe fire was eventually tied to power lines maintained by Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which pleaded guilty to one count of gross negligence and 84 individual counts of involuntary manslaughter – one for each person who was killed in the wildfire.\n\nIn 2021, the Dixie Fire stretched across Butte and several other counties, burning nearly 1 million acres and more than 700 homes, the largest single wildfire in state history. The historic wildfire was eventually tied to Pacific Gas & Electric Co. power lines.\n\nProsecutor: Man pushed flaming vehicle off embankment\n\nStout was arrested around 2 a.m. Thursday after police had surrounded his trailer in Chico, Ramsey, the Butte County district attorney, said at a news conference.\n\nRamsey said Butte was being held in Butte County jail with no possibility of bail until he's arraigned on Monday afternoon, \"undoubtedly under a count of arson.\"\n\nRamsey said it was a witness account that had tied Stout to the fire. The witness saw Stout standing by his mother's vehicle, watching it as a fire appeared under the car's front-left side, Ramsey said. Stout then, according to the witness, got in the vehicle for a short period of time before he got out and pushed it off the embankment.\n\n\"We are here today because of that,\" said Ramsey, whose family has been evacuated because of the blaze.\n\nOver a million acres burning in active wildfire\n\nFirefighters are monitoring 89 large active wildfires across 10 western states and Alaska, encompassing 1.2 million acres. The size and severity of the fires are driven largely in part by climate change as warmer temperatures, high winds and dry conditions help fuel fires.\n\n\"Climate change is leading to larger and more severe wildfires in the western United States,\" the National Climate Assessment reported.\n\nAt least 26,825 wildfires have been reported in the U.S. this year, 6,000 fewer fires than the 10-year average year to date, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. However, the total acreage burned as of Thursday morning – 3,633,567 – is almost 300,000 acres more than the 3,350,598 year-to-date average.\n\nIn California, wildfires have scorched more than 350,000 acres this year, twice the five-year average, according to Cal Fire.\n\nContributing: Krystal Nurse and Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/31/quarry-wildfire-colorado-denver/74614394007/", "title": "1 dead as Colorado wildfire spreads; California Park Fire raging", "text": "Hundreds of central Colorado residents were evacuated early Wednesday after deadly wildfires spread fiercely over mountainous terrain as firefighters in California battled the fifth-largest blaze in state history.\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis told reporters Wednesday afternoon that Boulder County authorities confirmed one fatality from the blaze and at least five homes have been destroyed as strong winds and dry heat hampered emergency responders' efforts to quell the flames.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency said four firefighters were injured in Colorado's Stone Canyon Fire, which ignited Tuesday and threatened nearly 500 homes, as well as roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.\n\nSeveral blazes across northern and central Colorado triggered waves of evacuation orders this week as they spread across more than 8,000 acres. As of Wednesday afternoon, Larimer County Sheriff John Feyen said about 4,000 people were evacuated on mandatory orders and 800 others fled their homes after voluntary evacuations were issued. The latest Colorado fire erupted Wednesday in Boulder County, where authorities issued an evacuation order for the Lake Shore Park neighborhood and urged people to keep roads clear for residents in danger zones to flee.\n\nBoulder County Sheriff Curtis Johnson said the latest blaze ignited at around 2:30 p.m. local time Wednesday and damaged two structures since, though it had only burned roughly six acres. The fire was suspected to be unintentionally started by people in the area, Johnson said. Local authorities were speaking to two people, but no arrests have been made.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Wednesday it had authorized funding for two of the largest blazes in Colorado, determining that \"the fires threatened such destruction that it would constitute a major disaster.\" The Fire Management Assistance Grant will cover up to 75% of the state’s eligible firefighting costs.\n\nIn northern California, more than 5,700 personnel were battling the Park Fire, which has torched 609 square miles, an area larger than New York City. The inferno has been burning for one week and has forced more than 25,000 people to leave their homes. Local officials say the fire started after a man, who has since been arrested and charged with arson, pushed his mother's flaming car off a 60-foot embankment.\n\nMeanwhile, Oregon's largest wildfire still posed a danger as the rain that had started to dwindle the flames gives way to another stretch of searing heat. Officials say lightning sparked the fire that has burned 459 square miles of land in eastern Oregon. As of Wednesday, it was 52% contained, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nOver 3,400 square miles, an area twice the size of Rhode Island, have been charred by 95 large active wildfires spreading across the western U.S., according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Experts have blamed the intensity of the fires, in part, on heat waves and dry conditions made worse by climate change.\n\nNearly 600 homes evacuated near Denver as wildfire gains momentum\n\nAround 9 p.m. Tuesday, a deputy patrolling a part of unincorporated Jefferson County, just southwest of Denver, saw “a little spot fire” that was only about 10 feet wide, Mark Techmeyer, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office said at a Wednesday morning news conference. Within three hours, the fire had spread across 100 acres of mountainous terrain.\n\nTechmeyer said officials believe the fire has grown to 130 acres, though officials are awaiting a helicopter to give a precise figure later in the day. Multiple agencies responded overnight, and authorities issued reverse 911 messages and went door-to-door to wake people up and get them to leave. Nearly 600 homes have been evacuated.\n\nAn area high school has been turned into a shelter for evacuees, while the Jefferson County Fairgrounds took in large animals. No property has been damaged and no injuries have been reported, Techmeyer said.\n\nBecause of two major wildfires to the north, “resources are thin,\" Techmeyer said. Local officials have request air support but are unsure if they'll receive any additional help on Wednesday. With over a dozen agencies responding to the blaze, there were only 70 to 80 firefighters on the ground, Techmeyer said.\n\n\"Everything is stacked against us,\" he said, noting the treacherous terrain and dangerously hot weather.\n\nDueling wildfires rage in northern Colorado\n\nThe Quarry Fire is the latest blaze to force people to flee their homes in Colorado as firefighters struggled to contain several fast-moving fires to the north.\n\nThe Alexander Mountain Fire has engulfed more than 5,000 acres of land west of Loveland, a city about 50 miles north of Denver. The blaze broke out on Monday and quadrupled on Tuesday, causing sweeping road closures and evacuations as hundreds of firefighters across the state battled the flames.\n\nWhile the Alexander Mountain Fire was expanding, a new blaze erupted nearby. The Stone Canyon Fire forced evacuations in northern Colorado's Boulder County as well as neighboring Larimer and Lyons County as changing wind conditions spread the blaze in several directions.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the blaze torched at least two homes and spread across 1,320 acres. Boulder Disaster Management said in an update that there was \"no significant growth overnight\" and that, when it's safe to do so, \"damage assessment teams will be in the field to determine structure loss.\"\n\nBoth the Stone Canyon Fire and the Alexander Mountain Fire, which had overlapping evacuation orders, were 0% contained. Meanwhile, temperatures on Wednesday were projected to reach the mid-90s, further hampering firefighters and fueling dry conditions.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued an air quality health advisory for parts of northern Colorado, including Fort Collins, Loveland and the surrounding areas because of the immense wildfire smoke.\n\nCalifornia's Park Fire grows as more hot weather is forecast\n\nMeanwhile, the fifth-largest wildfire in California history has continued to spread throughout four northern counties, causing over 25,000 people to flee from their homes and destroying at least 277 homes, businesses and other structures, mostly in Butte County, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe Park Fire, which erupted near the city of Chico one week ago, has burned about 609 square miles, an area larger than Los Angeles. As of Wednesday evening, firefighters have contained it by 18%. State fire officials warned that \"weather is expected to become much warmer and drier later this week.\"\n\nThe inferno was ignited last Wednesday when Ronnie Dean Stout II pushed his mother's flaming car into a gully, according to prosecutors. Stout, who says it was an accident and denied pushing the vehicle off an embankment, was arrested on Monday and charged with reckless arson and related charges. He's being held pending the completion of his arraignment Thursday.\n\nSouth of the Park Fire, another blaze triggered evacuations and road closures as it \"exhibits a moderate to dangerous rate of spread\" since starting on Tuesday, according to Cal Fire. The so-called Pedro Fire has burned across 2,700 acres in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties, and threatens 350 homes, businesses and other structures.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Jorge L.

The inferno has been burning for over a week and has forced more than 25,000 people to leave their homes.\n\nLocal officials say the fire started after a man, who has since been arrested and charged with arson, sent his mother's flaming car off a 60-foot embankment.\n\nHow fast the Park Fire grew\n\nThe record-breaking blaze torched 71,000 acres in its first 24 hours and burned uncontrolled for several days as it made its way northward through the towns of Cohasset and Paynes Creek.\n\nHow the Park Fire compares with California's largest wildfires\n\nThe Park Fire is the largest wildfire of the year in California and the fourth-largest in the state's history dating back to 1932. The biggest fire on record was the August Complex Fire in 2020, which burned over 1 million acres in 87 days. By contrast, the Park Fire has burned enough acreage to place it as the fourth largest in just nine days.\n\nThe second- and third-largest fires – the Dixie Fire in 2021 and the Mendocino Complex Fire in 2018 – were both active for over 100 days.\n\nHere's how the Park Fire compares with California's largest fires:\n\nHow big are California's largest wildfires?\n\nThe 1 million acres burned by the August Complex Fire is nearly two times the size of nearby Sacramento County. While the Park Fire is smaller than the August Complex Fire, the nearly 400,000 acres burned is more than 13 times the size of San Francisco.\n\nThe Park fire compared with California's largest fire\n\nThe Park Fire, while massive in size, is nowhere near the scale of California's largest fire, the August Complex Fire. The fire burned 1,032,648 acres from Aug. 16 through Nov. 11, 2020. The Park Fire, which is now 24% contained, would need to burn an additional 633,211 acres to match the August Complex Fire, California's largest.\n\nThe August Complex Fire was made up of 37 separate fires ignited by lightning that merged into one blaze, including the Doe and Elkhorn fires.\n\nNine of the top 10 largest recorded wildfires in California's history have occurred since 2017.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/02/colorado-california-park-wildfire-updates/74644087007/", "title": "Wildfires still rage in California; progress made against Colo. blaze", "text": "Firefighters in Colorado made progress in the battle against several wildfires that broke out along the foothills of the Rocky Mountains this week as emergency crews in California struggled to put out one of the largest blazes in state history.\n\nFueled by a persistent drought and stretches of intense heat, four wildfires broke out between Monday and Wednesday along the Front Range, which runs from central Colorado into Wyoming, passing near several major cities including Denver. The fires grew rapidly and encroached on populated areas, forcing hundreds of people to flee. Several dozens of homes have been destroyed, officials said.\n\nThe Alexander Mountain Fire, the largest of the blazes, has scorched 8,134 acres of land west of the city of Loveland. Firefighters have contained it by 5% as of Friday morning, while officials have closed major roads, issued several mandatory evacuations and adopted fire restrictions, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nIn north Boulder County, firefighters contained the southern edge of the Stone Canyon Fire, which has destroyed at least five homes and killed one person near Rocky Mountain National Park, officials said. The blaze has engulfed over 1,500 acres some 20 miles north of Denver. And while it remains the second largest fire in the state, the progress allowed residents in several subdivisions to return to their homes.\n\n\"We're feeling really good about this,\" Nathan Hallam, the fire incident commander on scene, said in a video posted on X. He added that he anticipated the fire to shrink significantly through the weekend.\n\nThe consistent 90-degree temperatures and steep terrain have proved dangerous for firefighters as they attempt to quell the flames. In Jefferson County, at least five firefighters were injured on Wednesday, including four who suffered heat exhaustion, said Mark Techmeyer, a spokesperson for the county sheriff's office.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 6,700 fire personnel continue to battle northern California's Park Fire, the fourth largest in state history. The inferno, which has been burning since July 24, has swallowed 614 square miles, an area larger than New York City. Some 25,000 people have fled their homes as the blaze has torched over 540 houses, businesses and other structures, according to Cal Fire.\n\nScars from historic blaze may blunt growth of spreading wildfire\n\nWith fire crews trying to protect structures and critical infrastructure on the western, southern and eastern edges of the Alexander Mountain Fire, officials are hoping the northern edge will run out of fuel as it moves into the burn scar from the 2020 Cameron Peak Fire.\n\nThat fire, the largest ever in Colorado, burned 326 square miles over more than four months, threatening but not quite reaching the town of Masonville and neighborhoods just west of Horsetooth Reservoir.\n\nThe northern edge of the Alexander Mountain Fire is burning southwest of Masonville, and fire crews are working to build a containment line that will keep it from moving east toward homes in that area and tie into the fuel break to the north that they believe the Cameron Peak Fire burn scar will provide, said Jayson Coil, operations section chief for Southwest Area Incident Management Team 1.\n\n“We have a limited number of resources, so if there’s an area we don’t think the fire’s willing to move through, then it prevents us from having to commit resources there,” Coil said at a media briefing late Thursday afternoon.\n\n– Kelly Lyell, the Coloradoan\n\nLarge fires rage on in California\n\nAs of Thursday, more than 700 structures across California had been destroyed by the Park Fire, as fuel for the flames remained dry and susceptible, Cal Fire said.\n\n\"Heavy fuels continue to exhibit near record-level low moistures and are very receptive to fire,\" the agency said Friday.\n\nThe massive Park Fire was burning more than 397,000 acres and was 24% contained.\n\nAfter starting in Chico, California, the Park Fire has spread north through gulches and canyons, impacting cities like Red Bluff and other mountain communities.\n\nFurther south, a group of other large fires continue to burn in the hills about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. The group, which includes the Borel Fire, is burning more than 90,000 acres and is nearly 50% contained, according to Cal Fire.\n\nFire officials warn of continued summer heat\n\nNational forecasters are warning temperatures will continue to be above average through November, and that fall in much of the U.S. could feel like a “second summer.”\n\nIn the western U.S., the heat has rapidly created dry fuel for wildfires in California and the northwest, and August and September are expected to bring more “above normal” fire conditions, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.\n\nThe most recent report from the group said even larger areas of the western U.S. are expected to face the fire risks compared to the geographic outlook published just one month ago.\n\nThe findings come after temperature records were broken in July in Palm Springs, California, and Las Vegas, which reached 124 and 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the report said.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/07/27/park-fire-record-chico-california/74570798007/", "title": "Park Fire now one of the largest wildfires in California history", "text": "A fire that allegedly started when a man pushed a flaming car into a gully in a Northern California park on Wednesday has quickly ballooned into the West’s largest fire burning right now and one of the largest in state history.\n\nThe southern edge of the Park Fire is about 90 miles north of Sacramento, and the fire has now burned nearly 350,000 acres as of Saturday afternoon, according to Cal Fire. It’s now the seventh-largest fire in California history and is even producing its own clouds and fire whirls.\n\nThe blaze has more than doubled in size since Friday morning, when it engulfed an area the size of Chicago.\n\nProsecutors allege the fire started when Ronnie Stout sent his mother’s car ablaze 60 feet down an embankment near Alligator Hole in Chico’s Upper Bidwell Park. That gave the fire its match to spread northward across the Sierra Nevada foothills.\n\nTriple-digit temperatures, low humidity and gusty winds contributed to the Park Fire’s rapid growth, officials say. The Park Fire on Saturday has burned an area larger than the size of the city of Los Angeles. So far, the Park Fire has damaged 134 structures, according to Cal Fire on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe area's terrain is steep and rocky, with few roads for firefighters to enter to try to put out fires, Kirsten Larson, a spokesperson for Cal Fire's response, told USA TODAY on Saturday.\n\nSaturday had cooler temperatures, with highs in the upper 80s, and more humidity, according to the National Weather Service’s Sacramento office. Cooler conditions are expected to continue in the coming days before hot weather returns next week.\n\nOfficials hoped these conditions would give some 2,500 firefighters the needed respite to reduce the fire's spread from Butte County into Tehama County, where the majority of the fire is now occurring, as it burns grass, brush, timber and dead vegetation.\n\nEvacuation orders have been issued across eastern Tehama County up to the Shasta County line, nearly 50 miles from the fire’s start. This includes smaller communities approaching Lassen Volcanic National Park.\n\nIn Butte County, evacuation orders and warnings continued through Friday night, the county Sheriff’s Office announced. This included warnings for Magalia in the foothills east of Chico, located just next to Paradise, the California town burned by the 2018 Camp Fire that destroyed 14,000 homes and killed 85 people. The Camp Fire, caused by faulty Pacific Gas & Electric power lines, maxed out at 153,336 acres.\n\nIn total, officials have told nearly 8,700 people to evacuate their homes with the Park Fire, Larson said. The Butte County Fairgrounds, churches and rodeo grounds have been converted to evacuation centers and animal shelters.\n\nFire's extreme behavior, climate change\n\nThe Park Fire has scorched a relatively remote area that hasn’t had a recent fire history, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. The fire has spread across from grasslands in the west, toward the Central Valley, to dense forest, including logging, east into the Sierras.\n\nAt the same time, this month has been the region's hottest on record, Swain said. It hasn't been a particularly dry year, nor has severe drought affected the area. But the heat quickly dried foliage to help fuel the fire in under three days, he said.\n\n“The fire has, continuously since it started, moved incredibly quickly and exhibited continuously extreme behavior,” he said. He pointed to the Park Fire producing its own thunderstorm-like clouds, as well as one or two fire vortices captured on video.\n\nWarmer temperatures and dry conditions caused by climate change are helping fuel massive wildfires. More than that, Swain said, fires are burning more readily through the night, along with fires creating their own weather patterns with winds that can reinforce flames. This allows events like the Park Fire to move much more quickly.\n\nThere are over 100 large wildfires that have burned over 2 million acres across 10 western states and Alaska, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nContributing: Christopher Cann and Dinah Pulver of USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/26/california-park-fire-wildfire-photo-video/74562853007/", "title": "Park Fire damage: Photos, videos capture impact of California wildfire", "text": "The largest wildfire in the West so far this summer continues to grow as firefighters in Northern California battle the blaze.\n\nThe so-called Park Fire has engulfed over 164,000 acres, an area larger than the city of Chicago, near Chico, California since it began on Wednesday, fueled by hot weather, low humidity and strong wind gusts.\n\nOn Thursday, Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey announced the arrest of Ronnie Stout, a 42-year-old Chico resident, in connection with the fire.

Residents were urged to keep windows and doors shut as air quality advisories stretched through the San Joaquin Valley and as far west as the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nTony Fuentes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno, said he expect some improvement Saturday but said smoke should linger in the area over the weekend and into next week.\n\nThe cause of the blaze is under investigation, but Pacific Gas & Electric said in two separate reports to the California Public Utilities Commission that it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of its power lines.\n\nA red sky and a road on fire:How this man 'barely survived' California's Dixie Fire\n\nThe questions around the Dixie Fire's origin are only the latest in a string of disasters that has left the utility in bankruptcy and led to its criminal prosecution.\n\nPG&E equipment was determined to be at fault for starting the 2018 Camp Fire, which destroyed most of the Butte County community of Paradise and killed 85 people.\n\nEarlier this year, Shasta and Tehama counties agreed to a $12 million settlement with PG&E to recover costs associated with last year's deadly Zogg Fire after the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection blamed the utility's equipment for causing the fire.\n\nSix of seven of the largest wildfires in California history have occurred during or since 2020, AccuWeather said.

The Hill Fire stayed at 4,531 acres and had reached 90 percent containment, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nThe flare-up, which was first reported around 9:15 a.m., reached 50 to 100 acres in size less than an hour later, Ventura County Fire Department spokesman Capt. Stan Ziegler said.\n\n“It is a flare-up from the Woolsey Fire. It is not a new start,” Ziegler said.\n\nLIVE UPDATES:Latest news, map, statistics on the Woolsey Fire\n\nAircraft pounded Tuesday’s flare-up with water and fire retardant. The sky was dark above them and there were flames up along the ridge line, said Steve Gunner.\n\n“It was like a war zone up there,” he said.\n\nHe and about two dozen others watched the air attack from alongside Potrero Road near Wendy Drive in Newbury Park.\n\nThe increased fire activity came as U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke announced he will visit California regions impacted by wildfires, including communities hit by the Woolsey Fire.\n\nConditions permitting, Zinke will visit areas affected by the Camp Fire in Northern California on Wednesday before traveling south to the Woolsey burn area on Thursday, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n\nThe Camp Fire has killed 42 civilians, destroyed 6,522 homes and burned 125,000 acres north of Sacramento, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe secretary’s visit coincides with increased containment of the Woolsey Fire despite continued fire activity.\n\nLIVE UPDATES:Woolsey Fire destruction raised to 435 structures\n\nEncouraging progress\n\nChief Daryl Osby, of Los Angeles County Fire Department, said progress against the Woolsey Fire is encouraging.\n\n“(We’re) getting the upper hand here. …There is a lot of confidence as it relates to the containment and control of this fire. We’re feeling better. Our containment percentages have increased,” he said Tuesday at a news conference.\n\nAccording to Osby, the area consumed by the fire is larger than the city of Denver.\n\nFor residents trying to return to some form of normalcy, government agencies plan to host a community meeting Wednesday. The event in the Thousand Oaks City Council chambers is planned for residents of Oak Park and Thousand Oaks whose property was affected by the region’s wildfires.\n\nThe meeting, scheduled for 6:30 p.m. at 2100 Thousand Oaks Blvd., will provide residents with information on debris flow assessments, debris removal, public health concerns, rental assistance and other local resources.\n\nIn a joint release from the Ventura County government and the city of Thousand Oaks, officials advised residents to wait before attempting to clean up debris.\n\n“Please be aware that everyday household toxins are present in ash and debris and can present significant health hazards. While we understand that residents are eager to begin clean-up, we ask that you wait until professional hazardous material removal services are secured,” officials said.\n\nMORE:Fire evacuation map, list of shelters\n\nGoing back\n\nAs containment increased, so did the number of evacuees allowed back into their homes.\n\nBy 9 a.m. Tuesday, evacuation orders had been lifted in the Los Angeles County communities of Hidden Hills and portions of Calabasas, Westlake Village and Agoura Hills. Later in the day, the northern section of the unincorporated Topanga area and the eastern section of Malibu accessed via the Pacific Coast Highway were also reopened to residents.\n\nNot all homecomings proved joyful, however, as some residents returned to charred and blackened neighborhoods.\n\nOak Park resident Sue Yaeger walked around her neighborhood Tuesday morning and was confronted by the devastation around her; homes, seemingly chosen at random, had burned to the ground.\n\n“It breaks your heart,” she said.\n\nYaeger couldn’t understand why her home on Liverpool Court was still standing, but others around her weren’t. It filled her with guilt.\n\n“I have to stare out at it, look out my window. I don’t know what to do,” she said.\n\nIn Yaeger’s own home, the smell of smoke was overwhelming.\n\nThe fire has destroyed an estimated 435 structures, although fire officials expect that number to rise as damage assessments continue.\n\nDavid Rocca, vice president of JOR Development Inc. in Westlake Village, dropped by Liverpool Court to put plywood up on the garage of a scorched home. The plan also included putting up a fence to ensure that people stay out, Rocca said.\n\nTuesday was only the beginning of a long road to rebuilding.\n\nRocca, who has a client whose home was damaged by the Thomas Fire, has an idea of just how long the process can take.\n\nOak Park homes spared by the Woolsey Fire still carried with them scars of the incident. Charred bushes, palm trees, lawns and retaining walls spotted the Oak Park neighborhood, outlining a map of where the embers produced by the wind-driven blaze may have landed.\n\nThe now-blackened open space behind the homes will also be a memento of the flames that passed through.\n\nHomes and other structures were not the only things destroyed by the fire, as Cal Fire reported Tuesday that more than 80 percent of the National Park Service land in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area had been burned by the fire.\n\nAs Yaeger surveyed her home and chatted with Rocca, a massive plume of smoke rose over the scene, a reminder of the still-active Woolsey Fire.\n\nYaeger was worried for friends in Lake Sherwood and wondered when the fire is going to let up.\n\nIn other fire news:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/10/22/experts-call-changes-wake-deadly-wildfires-northern-california/768246001/", "title": "Experts call for changes in wake of deadly wildfires in California", "text": "Santa Rosa Fire Chief Tony Gossner stood in the middle of dense smoke as a fire barreled into the city.\n\nThe wind was intense, he could hear explosions, and flames were everywhere.\n\n“I had fire behind me. I had fire to the left. I had fire in front of me,” he said. “It was like that until the sun came up.”\n\nThe Tubbs Fire broke out just before 10 p.m. on Oct. 8, one in a series of blazes that ignited in Sonoma and Napa counties. Within hours, it had reached Santa Rosa.\n\nMore than a dozen large fires were burning in eight counties in Northern California that morning, a number that increased to 21 in the following days.\n\nBy last week, officials confirmed 42 people had died and 7,700 structures were destroyed.\n\nIt’s becoming more of the norm now to have multiple large, damaging fires burning at the same time, Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott said at a recent news conference.\n\nSo far this year, the state reported 37 percent more fires than at the same time last year and nearly twice as much land has burned.\n\nUnder severe wind conditions, they become unstoppable, making some experts call for more attention to improving fallback plans.\n\nThey say agencies throughout the state need to prepare for those rare, but catastrophic circumstances.\n\nCalifornia is ahead of a lot of the country with respect to preparing to handle wildfire, said Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension.\n\n“But we still have a lot to learn,” he said.\n\nDo the building codes already in place work under such severe conditions, and how do you get people out in time?\n\n“That’s what we’re going to be asking ourselves as we pick up the pieces and look at what happened here,” Moritz said.\n\nAn 'unstoppable’ fire\n\nThe night the Tubbs Fire started, winds were blowing 50 mph with gusts up to 70 mph.\n\n“The fire burned with such intensity that it was literally going miles per hour,” said Cal Fire Battalion Chief Jonathan Cox. \"It was unstoppable.\"\n\nIt “was going quicker than we could keep up with,” throwing embers a mile or more ahead of itself. \"People had such little time to get out of the way of it. A lot of people were literally running for their lives,\" he said.\n\nGossner said alerts went out in Santa Rosa, but evacuations couldn’t keep pace with the flames.\n\nWith phone lines down and other problems, it was firefighters knocking on doors and police blaring car sirens and calling out through loudspeakers telling people to get out.\n\n“I think there needs to be a lot of thought and a lot of discussion,” Gossner said about the best way to notify people in such a fast-moving, destructive fire.\n\nHe wondered if more traditional methods like sirens in neighborhoods could work better in some situations.\n\nMoritz also suggested communities could look at creating fire-resistant shelters in neighborhoods.\n\nIdentifying those locations before a fire breaks out could help people reach safety when they can’t get very far away.\n\n“You wouldn’t have to necessarily get into your car and get all the way out of the area,” Moritz said.\n\nThese extreme events have happened relatively infrequently.\n\n“But when they do happen,” Moritz said, “I think it reveals how important it is to actually have some kind of fallback plan for those kinds of circumstances.”\n\nMother Nature decides\n\nYears of drought worsened wildfire conditions. While last winter was a wet one, the bounty of green grass has since dried out.\n\n“Especially with these wind-driven fires, Mother Nature pretty much determines when we’re going to gain control over the fires,” said Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen.\n\nOn May 2, 2013, winds were blowing about 40 mph with gusts in the 60s and 70s when the Springs Fire started near Camarillo.\n\nThe blaze ignited around 6 a.m. off Highway 101. Within 15 minutes, officials said, they knew they wouldn’t be able to stop it.\n\nThe fire ran all the way to the ocean, about eight miles away. It swept up against communities and a university, but no houses or lives were lost.\n\nEngines and firefighters were able to leapfrog from place to place, getting ahead of the flames, Lorenzen said.\n\n“We were fortunate that it hit small pockets of communities initially,” he said.\n\nRead more:Residents seek normalcy in wildfire-hit Santa Rosa\n\nRead more:List of missing people shrinks as California fires ease\n\nThe county has a few things in its favor, Lorenzen said.\n\nA longstanding brush clearance program helps firefighters safely get between homes and burning vegetation.\n\nLarge neighboring fire departments in Los Angeles and others in the county also can respond quickly when needed.\n\nLocally, the county can issue wireless alerts to cellphones, as well as send notifications to any phone or email signed up with VC Alert.\n\nSome counties had those same abilities up north but still ran into problems getting the word out quickly.\n\nWith every tool, there’s usually some gap, said Kevin McGowan, manager of Ventura County Sheriff’s Office of Emergency Services.\n\nThat’s why the county tries to use several different tools to reach as many people as possible.\n\nThe county does have one siren on a fire station in Piru in its notification plans, he said. But it’s there to alert the town in case of a dam failure, not wildfires.\n\n‘Gives us a chance’\n\nThe state adopted fire hazard maps about 10 years ago, linking building codes to level of risk. In fire-prone areas, new construction had to be built with features like vent screens and fire-resistant roofing materials.\n\nEarly on Oct. 9, fire tore through homes inside and outside of Santa Rosa's hazard zones.\n\nEvery house in the Fountaingrove neighborhood was built to those standards, Chief Gossner said. Still, they burned.\n\n“There are very few houses left anymore. Most of them are gone,” he said. “When you get an established fire with that much wind, as soon as one of those houses catches on fire that becomes its own fuel model.\"\n\nThe maps were a big step forward, but had some missing pieces, including that they don't yet incorporate information about severe wind patterns, Moritz said.\n\nThe state needs to understand more about ignition vulnerability and what building codes would provide enough protection in circumstances like these, he said.\n\nBut also the building codes generally only applied to new development, leaving older homes without the upgrades.\n\nMoritz would like to see public funding to support retrofitting efforts. He called it one of the most important policy changes that could happen.\n\nBut even if every community were built to standards required in fire-prone areas, it might not have stopped a fire like Tubbs.\n\n“We want the fire-wise communities, so if a fire starts, we can jump on it and put it out,” Gossner said.\n\nIf there’s enough wind, it might not be enough.\n\n“That gives us a chance,” he said. “It doesn’t mean it’s going to prevent it. It gives us a chance.”\n\nSign up for alerts\n\nTo sign up for VC Alert, visit http://www.readyventuracounty.org/vc-alert.\n\nFor more information about preparing for wildfires, visit http://vcfd.org/ready-set-go", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/22"}]}

This is a disgrace for the International Paralympic Committee,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters following the decision.\n\nThe IOC also announced that it had withdrawn the Olympic Order – the highest award of the Olympic movement – from Putin.\n\n“The IOC was viewed as having a close relationship with Russia,” Michael Payne, former head of marketing at the IOC, told CNN.\n\n“The fact that the IOC has now issued a set of sanctions to Russia, which, in my view, are probably the strongest sanctions the IOC has ever issued … since probably the early 60s when the IOC banned South Africa for its apartheid regime,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, world football’s governing body, FIFA, and European soccer body, UEFA, have suspended all Russian international and club teams from their competitions “until further notice.”\n\nVladimir Putin kicks a football during an event in the Red Square on June 28, 2018 in Moscow. Joosep Martinson/FIFA/Getty Images\n\n“Vladimir Putin has been passionate about both sports and using sport to project Russia’s importance on the world stage and giving back to the Russian people a sense of pride in their success on the world stage.”\n\nPayne added that the most immediate impact of sanctions could be to challenge the Kremlin’s narrative on the conflict, with ordinary Russians wondering what has happened to events they were due to host.\n\nUEFA announced last month that this year’s Champions League final will no longer take place in St. Petersburg’s Krestovsky Stadium, which is sponsored by Russian state-owned company Gazprom, and will now be moved to the Stade de France in Paris to be played on the original date of May 28.\n\n“There can be no misunderstanding: no amount of control of the Russian media is able to explain what’s going on in the sports world, that they’ve suddenly been banished,” Payne said.\n\nRussia is covering the country’s invasion of Ukraine very differently to CNN and other western news outlets. A new law forbids media operating in Russia to use the words “war,” “attack” or “invasion” to describe Putin’s decision to unleash his forces against Ukraine. Instead, they are to use the Kremlin’s Orwellian phrase: “special military operation.”\n\nRussians’ access to social media like Facebook and Twitter has also been severely restricted.\n\n“Sanctions may cause ordinary Russians to ask why can’t they see their Russian athletes performing? And clearly, then there’s prompting the Russian people to say ‘What’s going on?’” Payne said.​\n\n“Will Putin care about having to give his Olympic gold order back or what the rest of the international world thinks of him? Probably not.\n\n“Will he care about what all the local Russians are saying, ‘Hang on, what is going on?’ Absolutely.”\n\nSports as a nationalist tool\n\nLukas Aubin, associate researcher at The French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs (IRIS) and a specialist in the geopolitics of Russia and sports, told CNN Sport that Putin carefully curates his image so that observers are aware of his sporting prowess, on a national and international level.\n\n“When Putin arrived at power in 2000, one of his first decisions was to invite his former coach in judo [to the Kremlin],” he said.\n\nThe Russian premier has also been pictured ice swimming, fishing and bare-chested horseback riding.\n\nPutin attends a gala match of the Night Hockey League teams at the Bolshoy ice arena on May 10, 2017 in Sochi, Russia. Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images\n\n“Today, President Putin uses sports as an element of his power. And not only as a part of his personality because he also has created a big sporting system. He’s using oligarchs, politics, former athletes, to create a machine.\n\n“It’s a big system, where people [are] driven by Putin in the directions that they need to create a beautiful picture of Russia, in the world of sports,” he added.\n\nThis worked for the most part, Aubin said.\n\n“It worked because in 2014, we are seeing the Sochi Olympics. Then four years after, we are seeing the World Cup. It is really very hard to say how many international sporting events Russia [has] hosted the past 10 years – it’s really a lot. At the beginning, it was a huge element of soft power,” Aubin added.\n\nVera Tolz, professor of Russian studies at the University of Manchester, told CNN Sport that Putin has used Russian nationalism “instrumentally and very systematically” as a way of legitimizing his regime since he came to power.\n\n“Nationalism – and the kind of national unification with promoting particular versions of history, of organizing, establishing new national holidays, and of course, sport – has been absolutely key to his legitimation strategy,” she explained, adding such tactics date back to the Soviet period, where sport was used “very intensively as a tool of building loyalty of the people to the regime.”\n\n“Even the fact that the Kremlin, Russia, has gone to such lengths, in using doping, in order to win more medals, in a way shows how participating in competitions and winning, winning was key to Putin’s Popular Mobilization strategy,” Tolz added.\n\nIn 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) unanimously agreed to ban Russia from major international sporting competitions – notably the Olympics and the World Cup – for four years over doping non-compliance.\n\nThe ban was later halved by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2020.\n\nWADA’s punishment relates to inconsistencies in data retrieved by WADA in January 2019 from the Moscow lab at the center of the 2016 McLaren report, which uncovered a widespread and sophisticated state-sponsored sports doping network.\n\n“Every time you let Russia into an international sporting event, you’re essentially agreeing to swim with man-eating sharks. They will cheat your athletes, they will not feel bad about it, they will lie about it, if they’re caught, they will blame you for calling it out,” Jim Walden, the US lawyer of Grigory Rodchenkov who was instrumental in exposing Russia’s initial cover-up, told CNN.\n\nAhead of the Tokyo Olympics, Putin spoke of his frustration of the “politicization of sport” and that the “the rights and interests of our athletes must be protected from any arbitrariness.”\n\nThe Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was initially deemed non-compliant after the publication of the McLaren report in 2016.\n\nPutin looks on during the Opening Ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics on February 4. Matthew Stockman/Getty Images\n\nCommissioned by WADA, the report found the Russian state conspired with athletes and sporting officials to undertake a doping program that was unprecedented in its scale and ambition.\n\n“Putin very much uses his control over sport to try to game the world and win as much as possible, and also curates the content for the Russian population so that he can get maximum popularity, which translates into maximum power to do what he wants internationally – essentially pitting Russia against the rest of the world, at least the rest of the Western world,” Walden added.\n\nFast forward to 2022 and another doping scandal – surrounding Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva – overshadowed the Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nThe 15-year-old Valieva, a breakout star of the Games who got the highest mark in the figure skating team event, was allowed to compete despite testing positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine, which is commonly used to treat people with angina. The failed test occurred before the Winter Olympics but only came to light during the Games, and it remains unclear if the drug test controversy will see the medal revoked.\n\n“Not only is Russia myopically focused on winning at any cost, but in terms of any costs, it’s no holds barred, right? So murder, bribery, drug trafficking, any kind of criminality that will give them an advantage. They believe that not only will they do it, but that other people are weak for following the rules,” Walden said.\n\n“So they marry criminality with obstruction and put that together with sports. And that is how they have consistently won. And that’s how the Russian government has used it to prop up its own popularity, so that it has more leeway to engage in troublemaking abroad,” he added.\n\nTrail of money\n\nOlympic great Edwin Moses, who opposed the 1980 US boycott of the Moscow Olympics, has gone so far as to call for Russia to be banned from the 2024 Olympics.\n\n“The boycott in 1980 was political. This is just horrible,” Moses, who is Chairman of the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, said in a press release from Laureus last week.\n\n“It hasn’t got a lot to do with politics, it has to do with humanity, the war, the fighting, the children and innocent people getting killed, rockets and missiles, tanks … and it’s live on TV, so everyone is aware of it.\n\n“I was in favor of banning the Russians because of what happened in Sochi in 2014 for really corrupting the integrity of the Olympic Games, via doping. I was on the executive committee of the World Anti-Doping Agency, and I thought the penalties were too light.\n\n“What they’re doing to the entire world right now in Ukraine, is exactly the same thing they’ve done to sport, in my opinion. Russia ought to be banned in Paris [2024 Olympic Games].”\n\nA few years ago, Moses says he met Putin.\n\n“I once sat next to him at [a] table. Two seats to my left, and the translator was in between. And I spoke to him that entire evening. I know how he talked about sports, like it was the Holy Grail, and how important sport was, and how it was good where the best of everyone’s country, regardless of your philosophy can compete together, and whoever wins, wins…. I realize now, it was just propaganda.”", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/27/trump-biden-debate-live-updates/74195213007/", "title": "Debate replay: Democrats worry about Joe Biden's debate ...", "text": "Former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden brawled in the first presidential debate of the 2024 race for the White House – sparring over issues ranging from reproductive rights to the southern border and inflation – even with a few confusing moments.\n\nIn a response that immediately prompted questions, Biden froze as he talked about Medicare services in America. After the debate, Democrats were sweating over the president's performance and his stumbles over talking points, data and more.\n\nThe president and the former president for 90 minutes attacked each other's records on the issues facing the nation: childcare costs, the spread of opioids and other challenges. They also waged into America's role on the world stage, with moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper pressing the candidate on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn one of the most heated moments of the night, Biden and Trump also fought over reports that the former president called veterans who lost their lives in war 'suckers.'\n\nCatch up with live updates from the USA TODAY Network.\n\nDonald Trump Veepstakes enter home stretch after Atlanta debate\n\nNow that the first debate is over, the Donald Trump running mate race heads into overdrive.\n\nA bevy of potential Republican vice presidential candidates flocked to Atlanta to carry the flag for Trump before and after his clash with Joe Biden - and amid news reports and informed speculation that the presumptive GOP 2024 nominee could announce his decision any day now.\n\n\"He's told some people, yeah,\" said Lara Trump, the former president's daughter-in-law and a co-chair of the Republican National Committee, speaking to NBC News.\n\nThe Trump debate surrogate list included the most often mentioned possibilities: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio, Tim Scott of South Carolina, and Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Sense of shock': Democrats melt down over Joe Biden's debate disaster\n\nDemocrats and other opponents of Donald Trump melted down as Joe Biden struggled during Thursday's debate, with some suggesting he should bow out to allow another Democrat to run instead.\n\nBiden's voice was hoarse and raspy from the start. He stumbled over words and had to correct himself with numbers. He was sometimes hard to follow. On one occasion, the president appeared to lose his train of thought, concluding − confusingly − with the line, \"we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\n\"That's a good man. He loves his country. He's doing the best that he can,\" said Van Jones, a Democratic political analyst on CNN. \"But he had a test to meet tonight to restore confidence in the country and of the base, and he failed to do that.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump concludes: ‘We’re in a failing nation ... but we’re gonna make it great again’\n\nTrump in his closing statement called Biden a “complainer” and said Biden “doesn’t do anything.”\n\n“This man is just a complainer,” Trump said, mocking Biden. “He said ‘We wanna do this, we wanna do that, we wanna get rid of this tax, that tax.’ But he doesn’t do anything.’”\n\nHe also took aim at the Biden administration’s foreign policy, claiming that none of the crises across the world would be happening if Trump was still in office.\n\n“We looked like fools in Afghanistan,” Trump said. Hamas’ attack against Israel on Oct. 7, Trump claimed without evidence, was such a “horrible thing that would have never happened,” if he were still president. “Ukraine should have never happened,” Trump added.\n\n“We’re in a failing nation but it’s not gonna be failing anymore. We’re gonna make it great again,” Trump concluded.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nBiden zeroes in on bringing down inflation, fixing tax system in closing statement\n\nBiden closed his debate performance by insisting that he would implement “a fair tax system” if he’s reelected, including guaranteeing that people who make less than $400,000 won’t see a tax increase.\n\nHe contrasted that by saying Trump increased taxes, caused inflation by fumbling the pandemic response, and will make it worse by implementing a 10% tariff on all imports to the U.S.\n\nBiden also touted policies passed since he became president, including lowering the cost of prescriptions. And he said if he is reelected, he would advance policies to support childcare and fix “bad pipes and other things causing health problems.”\n\n“We’re going to continue to fight inflation and give people a break,” he concluded.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nA \"childish\" argument about golf\n\nIt took an argument about golf scores - one of their few direct exchanges - to get the two candidates to accuse each other of childishness.\n\n\"Let's not act like children,\" Trump told Biden.\n\nReplied Biden: \"You are a child.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump blames Biden border policies for spread of opioids\n\nAsked what they would do to support people in the throes of opioid addiction, both candidates focused on the situation at the southern border.\n\nTrump said the flow of drugs across the border was under control until the COVID-19 pandemic. “Then we had to get tough,” he said, adding that drugs were “pouring across the border.”\n\nHe argued that since Biden has come into office, the flow of drugs is back up. Biden rebutted that he fought to get equipment that could detect fentanyl coming across the border, but that Trump killed the bipartisan deal in Congress that would have funded it.\n\n“He never argued it’s not a good bill. It’s a good bill,” he said.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nYour money and the presidential debate: Trump and Biden spar over the economy, inflation\n\nAt the top of the high-stakes faceoff, Joe Biden and former Donald Trump sparred over their economic records in a bid to persuade undecided voters theirs is the winning plan to slow rising prices.\n\nExasperated Americans are paying more for the basics from check-out lanes to the gas pump, souring the national mood and making the inflation surge one of Biden’s greatest challenges going into the November rematch with Trump.\n\nYour money and the presidential debate:: Trump and Biden spar over the economy, inflation\n\n– Jessica Guynn and Bailey Schulz\n\nJoe Biden claim: No American troops died anywhere in the world during his presidency\n\n“The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any - this decade - that doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like (former President Donald Trump) did.”\n\nBiden’s comment came following a reference to hostilities in Afghanistan during Trump’s term in office. But the notion that no troops have died in the world during Biden’s time in office is wrong.\n\nThirteen U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing attack near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021, when Biden was president, as thousands tried to flee the Taliban’s takeover of the country, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAmong the deaths were 11 Marines, one Navy hospital corpsman and one Army soldier. Biden remarked on the deaths at the time, calling them “tragic.”\n\nMore recently, three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers were killed in January at a base in Jordan in what was described as a drone attack by Iran-backed militants.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nFor more fact checks about what Trump and Biden said, follow USA TODAY's live debate fact check here (Biden-Trump debate fact check: Separating lies from truth (usatoday.com)\n\nTrump's claim: The US southern border is the most dangerous place in the world\n\n“We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world”\n\nThis is false. While deaths, disappearances and violence do occur at the U.S. southern border, there is no evidence to suggest it is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nStatistics on border deaths vary. Customs and Border Protection data shows 171 people died at the border in fiscal year 2022, some in CBP custody and others while attempting to cross the border. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-related organization, documented 686 deaths and disappearances of migrants on the US-Mexico border in 2022.\n\nPlaces all over the world and even in the U.S. have more frequent deaths. For example, there were more than 700 murders in Chicago in 2022, according to the Chicago Police Department. Chicago is 228 square miles, while the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,951 miles long.\n\n– Brad Sylvester\n\nFor more fact checks about what Trump and Biden said, follow USA TODAY's live debate fact check here (Biden-Trump debate fact check: Separating lies from truth (usatoday.com)\n\nBiden: Trump ‘didn’t do a damn thing about’ climate change\n\nTrump claimed he “had the best environmental numbers ever” and said his administration took significant action to address climate change: “My environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage actually.”\n\n“I have no idea where he’s been,” Biden responded, touting legislation he led that made significant investments in combating climate change, including the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden went after Trump for pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords, arguing the former president did nothing to fight climate change.\n\n“The only existential threat to humanity is climate change and he didn’t do a damn thing about it,” Biden said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump and Biden battle over serving Black communities\n\nAsked what he says to Black voters who are disappointed he hasn’t done more to help their communities during his time in office, Biden said: “I don’t blame you” and noted inflation is hurting them. But he said he has proposed tax credits for first-time homebuyers who are Black and made it easier for Black students to take out loans for college.\n\nHe added that he supports other policies that would help Black families, such as cutting childcare costs.\n\nTrump leaned into that response, arguing that Biden’s economic policies have hurt the pocketbooks of families of color and said undocumented immigrants are taking the jobs of workers of color.\n\n“He caused inflation and it’s killing Black families and Hispanic families,” he said. Trump added that he funded historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and supported criminal justice reform and economic opportunity zones.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWhat happened when Biden froze?\n\nJoe Biden was in the middle of answering a question about the economy during the debate on Thursday night when he began to stutter, froze on stage, and then began talking about the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do, child care, elder care, making sure that we continue to spend our health care system, making sure that we're in every single solitary person eligible,\" Biden said, before taking a long pause.\n\nHe then began talking about the COVID-19 pandemic and Medicare.\n\n\"For what I've been able to do with the COVID, excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do,\" he said, before taking another pause. \"If we finally beat Medicare.\"\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nBiden hits Trump over white supremacists in Charlottesville\n\nIn going after Trump, Biden cited the incident he says inspired him to run for president in 2020: The violent 2017 rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nBiden noted that Trump said supportive things about the Charlottesville rioters. Trump accused Biden of making his criticism up, though Trump did say there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the deadly demonstration.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden freeze sparks backlash on Twitter\n\nBiden freezing on stage when discussing healthcare quickly drew fire on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“Sorry, I’m voting for President Biden but a disaster so far,” wrote Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and NBC News analyst, on the platform.\n\nStephen Hayes, editor and CEO of The Dispatch, tweeted, “Let the Dem panic begin.”\n\n“Holy shit. Joe Biden isn’t running. He just froze. Trump is murdering him,” tweeted American writer and lawyer Clay Travis.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden hits Trump over his felony conviction\n\nDonald Trump responded to the fact that he is a \"convicted felon\" by claiming – without evidence – that Biden is a future felon.\n\n\"This man is a criminal,\" Trump said of his opponent, also noting that Biden's son Hunter Biden has already been convicted on a gun charge.\n\nBiden called the accusation \"outrageous,\" and added: \"It's simply a lie.\" For good measure, Biden noted that Trump's criminal case involved hush money to a \"porn star.\"\n\n\"You have the morals of an alley cat,\" Biden told Trump.\n\nThis all began with a question about Trump's claims that he may seek retribution against political opponents if he gets back into the White House.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump doesn’t take responsibility when asked about Jan. 6 Capitol attack\n\nTrump didn’t take blame for the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack when he was asked about a mob of his supporters breaching the building in a bid to overturn the 2020 election results. Instead, he repeated his false claims that the attack was former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s fault.\n\nTrump claimed he offered Pelosi “10,000 soldiers” to stop the attack, but Pelosi’s office has said she was never presented the offer by the former president. Pelosi also would not have had the power to refuse such an offer regardless.\n\nIn response, Biden went after Trump for his inaction during the attack, instead watching the riots unfold from the White House. He also slammed Trump for calling Jan. 6 defendants “patriots” and promising to pardon them.\n\n“The idea that those people are patriots? Come on,” Biden said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nBiden touts support for Israel, slams Trump on NATO\n\nAsked what additional leverage he would use to end the Israel-Hamas War, Biden said international leaders and experts have endorsed his plan for a ceasefire, which would include trading hostages held by Hamas for a ceasefire.\n\nHe added that “the only thing I denied Israel” was 2,000-lb bombs that can do significant civilian damage, and said Israel is getting “all the weapons they need” from the U.S.\n\nTrump said Israel wants to continue its war against Hamas. “You should let them go and let them finish the job,” he said to Biden.\n\nBiden – in one of his more forceful responses of the debate so far – said Trump wants to pull out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and said U.S. strength relies on alliances. “He has no idea what the hell he’s talking about.”\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump asked about Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nPutin would have never invaded Ukraine if he was president, Trump claimed without evidence. But he added Putin's terms in its brutal invasion of Ukraine should not be accepted.\n\nBiden retorted by saying he'd never heard more malarkey.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to Trump: 'You're the sucker, you're the loser'\n\nThe angriest exchange of the night came when Biden cited reports that Trump has described veterans as \"suckers\" and \"losers.\"\n\n\"You're the sucker, you're the loser,\" Biden told Trump.\n\nTrump denied making such comments, and demanded an apology from Biden. Not a chance, Biden replied.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nPressed about his deportation plan, Trump goes after Biden over border\n\nTrump was asked about his plans to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history” and whether he intended to deport all undocumented immigrants in the U.S., including those currently working critical jobs, whose spouses are citizens and have resided here for decades.\n\nTrump declined to answer and instead criticized Biden over his handling of the southern border and repeated his past anti-immigrant rhetoric at the podium.\n\n“We are living right now in a rat’s nest,” Trump said. “Every state is now a border state and it’s because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies. People are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen.”\n\n“We’re literally an uncivilized country,” Trump added.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump: I won’t block abortion pill\n\nTrump said he won’t block abortion medication if he is reelected.\n\nHe noted that the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a challenge to mifepristone, the pill commonly used in medication abortions, said he agrees with that decision, “and I will not block it.”\n\nHe took credit for appointing the justices that were crucial votes in overturning Roe v. Wade and said the states are “all making their own decisions,” later adding that “the country is now coming together on this issue. It’s been a great thing.”\n\nBiden rebutted that it has been “terrible” since Roe was overturned. He said he would reinstate the protections under Roe if he is reelected.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nTrump appears to call Biden 'Brandon'\n\nTrump at one point appeared to call Trump \"Brandon,\" a reference to \"Let's go, Brandon,\" which has become a joke and a rallying cry for Republicans.\n\nThe phrase originated at an Oct. 2 NASCAR race at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Brandon Brown, a 28-year-old driver, had won his first Xfinity Series and was being interviewed by an NBC Sports reporter. The crowd behind him was chanting something at first difficult to make out. The reporter suggested they were chanting “Let’s go, Brandon” to cheer the driver. But it was clear they were saying, “(Expletive) Joe Biden.\"\n\n– USA TODAY staff\n\nOn top earners paying less in taxes\n\nWith US facing trillion dollar deficits and record debt, why should top earners and corporations pay even less in taxes than they do now? Trump said the tax cuts spurred the “greatest economy that we've ever seen. “ Just prior to Covid and even after Covid, it was so strong that we're able to get through Covid much better than just about any other country, but we spurred that tax spurred.”\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden's voice draws attention\n\nOne story so far, at least on social media: Biden's hoarse-sounding voice.\n\nPollster Frank Luntz, who is conducting a focus group on the showdown, said on X: \"My focus group of undecided voters is surprised and concerned about Biden’s voice. This doesn’t bode well for questions about his health.\"\n\n–David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden: The economy is coming back\n\nThe first question is to Biden about inflation.\n\nBiden, sounding somewhat hoarse, said the economy fell apart on Trump's watch thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is coming back under current leadership - slowly, but surely.\n\n\"Working class people\" are still struggling, Biden said.\n\nTrump replied that Biden's handling of the COVID crisis sparked inflation, and the two argued about who has the best economic approach.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden skip a handshake\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden took the stage on Thursday night without a traditional handshake, walking directly to their podiums.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden jokes about taking ‘performance enhancers’ ahead of debate\n\nJoe Biden joked about being on “performance enhancers” in a social media post shortly before the start of the debate – mocking the conspiracies pushed by Trump and some Republicans that Biden would have to take drugs to keep up.\n\n“I don't know what they've got in these performance enhancers, but I'm feeling pretty jacked up. Try it yourselves, folks,” Biden said in the post, holding a can that reads “Biden” and his slogan “No Malarkey.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly challenged Biden to a drug test, arguing taking artificial enhancements is the only way the 81-year-old Biden can display energy during the debate. Republicans have suggested, without evidence, that Biden was on drugs during his State of the Union address in March.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat time is the debate? 9 p.m. eastern to central, pacific\n\nThe CNN Presidential Debate will begin at 9 p.m. ET, which is 8 p.m. CT and 6 p.m. PT.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nCan I livestream the debate? How do I watch the debate without cable?\n\nYes. A livestream and recording of the first presidential debate will be available on USA TODAY’s YouTube channel.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHow popular is Joe Biden?\n\nHow popular is President Joe Biden? People are certainly curious. Searches for \"Joe Biden approval rating\" in the past one hour shot up by more than 150%, according to Google Trends data.\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll, Biden’s latest 38% job approval rating remains largely unchanged from recent months and continues to put him well below the 48%+ threshold all reelected incumbents in the modern era have had at the time of the election.\n\nHis ratings among the three major party groups are also steady, with 83% of Democrats, 33% of independents and 5% of Republicans expressing approval.\n\n–Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nLongshot Trump VP pick Sen. Katie Britt is not at the first presidential debate\n\nSen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., one of about 20 Republicans seen as a potential Donald Trump option for vice president, will be watching Thursday's first presidential debate from her home in Montgomery, Alabama, a staffer for the senator confirmed.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to watching President Trump win tonight's debate as he outlines his vision to restore secure borders, safe streets, stable prices, and strong families,\" Britt said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nBritt's physical absence from the event in Atlanta could be a signal that the State of the Union star will not be Trump's pick.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nRFK Jr. to hold his own livestream debate tonight\n\nDuring Thursday’s presidential debate, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is hosting a program over livestream after he failed to qualify for tonight’s event.\n\nTo make it to the debate stage, candidates had to get on a sufficient number of state ballots as well as earn at least 15% in four separate national polls. Shortly after the CNN Presidential Debate was announced last month, Kennedy filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that CNN violated federal election laws by scheduling the June debate.\n\nKennedy will respond to the same questions that Biden and Trump are asked in a livestreamed event moderated by John Stossel that his campaign is calling “The Real Debate.” It will start at the same time as the presidential debate and will be held in front of a live audience in a Los Angeles studio.\n\n– Maya Marchel Hoff\n\nMelania Trump? Eric Trump? Who's with Trump in Atlanta?\n\nAs Donald Trump arrived in Atlanta Thursday evening for the pivotal debate, some political observers were watching who's in Trump's entourage for the event.\n\nFootage from Trump landing in Atlanta shows he deplaned alone, and it is unclear if his wife Melania or other members of his family are there with him.\n\nBut several Trump surrogates\n\nwho have also been floated for the vice presidential candidacy, are part of the entourage in Trump's spin room, including North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum; Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and others.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nDebate spin room buzzing hours before Trump and Biden take the stage\n\nHours before the big matchup between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, the floor at Georgia Tech University’s McCamish Pavilion – a basketball arena converted to debate spin room – was buzzing with reporters, campaign officials and politicians.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom; Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy all were swarmed by reporters.\n\nTrump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski and Republican National Convention co-chair David Bossie also circulated in the crowd, along with religious leader Ralph Reed. FOX News host Sean Hannity walked through the crowd and stopped to chat with Reed.\n\nAsked about the questions Trump continues to face surrounding his character and temperament, Lewandowski said “it’s up for the American people to decide.”\n\n“They get to decide if an 82-year-old who is practicing standing for 90 minutes should be the next leader of this country,” Lewandowski said, adding a year to Biden’s age. “Or if Donald Trump should be the leader of this country because they don’t like they way he… made some remarks.”\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nBiden campaign to launch ads during debate\n\nThe Biden campaign will air a set of three ads in battleground states criticizing Trump on issues such as reproductive rights and threats to democracy, CNN reported.\n\nThe first ad, which will run before the debate, will seek to tie Trump to abortion restrictions passed by states after Roe v. Wade’s fall in 2022.\n\nThe second ad will feature a Michigan sheriff who will slam Trump for refusing to denounce the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, according to the outlet. The third ad, which will air after the debate, will focus on criminal charges across four indictments.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhere do Donald Trump and Joe Biden stand on student loan forgiveness?\n\nOne of Joe Biden’s signature priorities while in the White House has been addressing student loan debt. With his effort challenged or blocked in court, the president said alternative actions by his Education Department have resulted in $160 billion in debt relief for nearly 4.6 million borrowers as of May 2024.\n\nDonald Trump has criticized Biden’s efforts to cancel student loan debt for millions of borrowers. In 2023 he also praised the Supreme Court justices for striking down a chunk of Biden’s plan, which Trump called unfair for people who have paid back their educational loans.\n\n– Joey Garrison, David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs Biden or Trump leading in the polls ahead of the debate?\n\nTrump and Biden are in a near dead-heat, according to a Real Clear Politics average of national polling. Trump is slightly ahead at 46.6% compared to Biden’s 45.1%, but those results are well within the margin of error.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nUSA TODAY is fact checking the first 2024 debate\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team will be investigating claims from the presumptive nominees on debate night.\n\nWe'll be watching for statements that exaggerate, mislead, misrepresent or otherwise stray from reality.

Both have experience moderating political debates, including CNN’s Republican Presidential Primary Debate this cycle.\n\nOn Monday, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt accused the longtime political journalists of being biased during an interview with CNN's Kasie Hunt before the host abruptly ended the interview, The Hill reported.\n\nCNN defended Tapper and Bash, saying in a statement shared with USA TODAY Tuesday, \"there are no two people better equipped to co-moderate a substantial and fact-based discussion.\"\n\n– Rachel Barber and Kinsey Crowley\n\nJill Biden rallies supporters before debate\n\nHours before the two presumptive nominees were slated to hit the debate stage for the first time in the 2024 presidential race, first lady Jill Biden stopped in Virginia Beach on her way to Atlanta to support her husband, President Joe Biden.\n\n“You all know that there’s two visions for America and you’ll see them tonight when you watch the debate,” she told the crowd that had gathered inside of the Biden-Harris campaign office in Virginia Beach for a sign-making event.\n\n“You’ve already chosen your vision, or you wouldn’t be here,” she said to the crowd of Biden supporters. “The vision you’ve chosen is for strong, steady leadership versus the other vision, which is chaos and corruption.”\n\n– Elizabeth Beyer\n\nWhat are the rules for the debate?\n\nThe candidates will be provided with a pen, pad of paper and a water bottle, but are prohibited from bringing props or prewritten notes. Following a history of presidential frontrunners talking over one another, CNN announced candidates' microphones will be muted throughout the debate when it is not their turn to speak.\n\nThe candidates will also not be able to consult with their campaign teams during the event’s two commercial breaks, a departure from past formats overseen by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nBiden’s campaign won a coin flip against Trump’s, giving his aides the choice between selecting the president’s podium or the order of the debate’s closing statements. The president’s campaign opted for the podium on the right side of the stage, meaning Trump's campaign got to choose the order of closing statements. His team opted to give Trump the final word.\n\n– Rachel Barber, Sudiksha Kochi and Marina Pitofsky\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp did not vote for Trump in the primary\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, revealed that he did not vote for his party’s frontrunner, Donald Trump, in the state’s primary election in March.\n\nThe governor revealed his decision – counter to that of many GOP voters and lawmakers – in an interview with CNN on the eve of the historic debate between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\n“I didn’t vote for anybody,” Kemp told CNN Wednesday when asked if he voted for Trump.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nWho is in the debate?\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face off in the first presidential debate. Third party candidates including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will not participate in the debate.\n\nIn order to secure a spot on stage, CNN required candidates to have received at least 15% support in four approved national polls and qualify for the ballot in enough states to have the opportunity to earn the 270 electoral votes in November needed to win the White House.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhat channel is the debate?\n\nThe debate will air on CNN and its related channels including CNN International and CNN en Español. Several other networks will carry the debate including Fox News, ABC News, NBC News, and NewsMax.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nGOP lawmakers want to see a more measured Donald Trump\n\nHouse Republicans tuning into tonight’s debate hope to see a more mellow version of Donald Trump compared to his previous debates with Joe Biden, telling USA TODAY that policy debates should be the priority for the former president.\n\nBut those GOP lawmakers acknowledged that Trump’s previous performance in debates means they can’t exactly have high hopes.\n\n“I think he’s his own man and he’s gonna do what he’s gonna do,” Rep. Jake Ellzey, R-Texas, said. Ellzey thinks Trump is going to come off more “gentlemanly” tonight.\n\n“You’re never gonna change Donald Trump. He is who he is, he talks the way he does,” Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., said. But he hopes to at least see a “little more measured approach” and “a little more hopeful.”\n\n“You been to Baskin Robbins? There’s 31 flavors,” Alford said. “I think there’s 31 flavors of Donald Trump. You’re going to see the rocky road, you’re going to see the daiquiri ice, you’re going to see a little vanilla. But in the end, it’s gonna be something you want to take home.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden says it's 'good to be back' in Atlanta\n\nJoe Biden shared photos of voters cheering in Atlanta a few hours before the first 2024 presidential debate.\n\n\"I met some incredible supporters who are fired up ahead of tonight’s debate.

Here's what Chris Wallace said\n\nCNN personality Chris Wallace suggested on \"The Source with Kaitlin Collins\" that Donald Trump may change tactics in the first debate of the 2024 presidential election. Wallace moderated the first debate in 2020 between Trump and Joe Biden when he was an anchor at Fox News. That debate provided multiple campaign changing moments.\n\n\"I’ve talked to a lot of people in the top echelons of his staff. They say he finally understands how badly he did in the 2020 debate,\" Wallace said. \"The two words that are coming out ― you don’t usually hear from the Trump camp ― are ‘nice’ and ‘respectful.'\"\n\n– James Powel and Kinsey Crowley\n\nWhite House reporters urge CNN to widen access during debate\n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Association said they're concerned about CNN’s decision to deny their request for a specific White House pool reporter inside the studio during the network’s presidential debate in Atlanta between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nCurrently, CNN rules state that a pool of still photographers will be allowed in the studio, but a reporter specifically representing print reporters will be given access during commercial breaks. But a broader group of White House reporters say they need more access to cover the historic event.\n\n“That is not sufficient in our view and diminishes a core principle of presidential coverage,” the statement says. “The White House pool has a duty to document, report and witness the president’s events and his movements on behalf of the American people.\"\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Biden and Trump shake hands?\n\nIt's not clear. The president's campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond told Fox News that he probably wouldn't shake Trump's hand, but he added that he believes \"President Biden consistently rises above pettiness.\" Prior to the 2016 election between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a handshake was a central part of decorum of presidential debates.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWhere do Trump and Biden stand on Ukraine?\n\nTrump has called for pulling back on U.S. defense commitments, throwing into doubt additional U.S. aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia. He has also privately said he could end Russia’s war in Ukraine by pressuring its embattled government to give up territory, the Washington Post reported, despite the repeated and vehement refusal of Ukraine's leaders to cede any land in the conflict.\n\nBiden has been a vocal supporter of additional U.S. aid to Ukraine. He struggled, but ultimately prevailed, in 2024 to get Congress to provide additional support for Israel in its fight against Hamas and for Ukraine in its war against Russia’s invasion.\n\n– John Bacon and David Jackson\n\nWho is Donald Trump's VP pick? Everything to know about the many possibilities\n\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump have not yet been formally nominated by their party, and Trump has yet to announce his pick for a vice presidential running mate.\n\nTrump told NBC News he has decided on a running mate, and they could be in Atlanta for the debate.

Five squares in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, wins bingo.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhere do Trump and Biden stand on health care?\n\nExpanding health care coverage provided by the Affordable Care Act and lowering prescription drug costs remain two of Biden’s signature campaign promises in his second presidential race.\n\nHe has called health care a right, not a privilege, for all. He succeeded in winning the right for Medicare to negotiate prices for a slate of drugs for seniors and to cap their annual costs at $2,000. He has said he wants to extend both policies to all Americans.\n\nTrump tried and failed to repeal the health care law signed by his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. Now, Trump says he does not want to repeal it but to improve it and make it cheaper. He has not released a specific plan.\n\nAs president, he did sign legislation to increase funding for substance use disorder treatment in the wake of the opioid epidemic, and in 2017 he declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency.\n\n– Joey Garrison, David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump arrives in Atlanta\n\nDonald Trump's Trump motorcade is now leaving the airport in Atlanta ahead of the debate.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHow old is Donald Trump?\n\nAge has taken center stage in the 2024 race for the White House. If either candidate on stage on Thursday wins in November, they will become the oldest person to take the oath of office.\n\nDonald Trump is 78 years old. He was born on June 14, 1946.\n\n– James Powel\n\nWhere do Trump and Biden stand on the economy?\n\nDonald Trump receives some of his highest marks from voters on his handling of the economy. A Wall Street Journal poll in March found a majority of voters said they trust him to do a better job than Biden in bringing down inflation, a top economic concern.\n\nIn 2017, Trump and his fellow Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul, which would expire during the next president’s term in 2025.\n\nBiden says he believes the best way to boost the U.S. economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. His economic plan has included the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan - a post-pandemic stimulus package - and funding for major infrastructure projects and climate initiatives.\n\nBiden has called for an increase in the minimum corporate tax to 21% from 15%. He also wants to restore a previous version of the Child Tax Credit, make the healthcare tax credit permanent and give new home buyers a $400 a month tax credit for two years to bring down mortgage costs.\n\n– Joey Garrison, David Jackson and Marina Pitofsky\n\nLooking for a debate drinking game?\n\nThe first presidential debate of the 2024 general election is set for Thursday night, with presumptive Democratic nominee President Joe Biden and presumptive Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, set to meet face to face for the first time since the White House changed hands in 2021.\n\nHere are three games that can help you get through the presidential debate Thursday night.\n\nFrom Bingo to shotsPresidential debate drinking games, an American tradition\n\n– James Powel\n\nMary Trump, Donald Trump's niece, to make pitch for Biden at presidential debate\n\nMary Trump, a psychologist, writer, and niece and critic of former President Donald Trump, will make an appearance in the spin room following Thursday's CNN presidential debate, the Biden campaign said.\n\nShe will be supporting her uncle’s opponent, current President Joe Biden, and will be joined by several key Democratic leaders, including Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, California Rep. Robert Garcia and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n– Joey Garrison and Maya Homan\n\nHow old is Joe Biden?\n\nAge has taken center stage in the 2024 race for the White House.

He is 81 years old.\n\n– James Powel\n\nWhere do Biden and Trump stand on climate change?\n\nTrump opposes most climate change legislation, a position that hasn’t changed since his term in the White House. During his presidency, he withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, a global climate initiative that Biden rejoined once he took office.\n\nBiden has warned that denying the impacts of climate change in the U.S. and around the world is “condemning the American people to a very dangerous future.” He has also set a national goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030 and has pledged to make the American power sector 100% carbon-pollution-free by 2035.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAre Trump and Biden in Atlanta?\n\nBiden arrived in Atlanta this afternoon and greeted groups of supporters chanting “four more years” and “let’s go Joe,” according to White House press pool reports.\n\nTrump is expected to arrive in the Peach State at approximately 5:30 p.m.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nYes, Donald Trump is still waiting for Supreme Court to rule on immunity\n\nThe former president debates while he and the rest of the political world are on the cusp of an important legal ruling: A Supreme Court decision on his claim of immunity from prosecution for actions he took while in office.\n\nCourt rulings announced Thursday did not include the immunity case, which could determine when - and if - Trump is tried on criminal charges he tried to steal the 2020 election from Biden.\n\nThe high court is scheduled to issue more rulings on Friday, but that is not expected to be the final day of the current term. So the Trump immunity decision could slip until next week.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nDemocratic governors talk Biden, debate expectations\n\nSeveral Democratic governors from across the country gathered in Minneapolis Monday on the anniversary of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. While there, they looked ahead to tonight’s debate.\n\n“This will be the first opportunity in a long time for people to see the contrast of these two people side by side,” Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly told USA TODAY. “And I think if people are watching with open minds, open eyes, the contrast will be startling.”\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he wouldn’t give the president and leader of his party any advice ahead of the 2024 showdown.\n\n“This isn't theoretical. There's two people who are going to be president, one or the other,” Walz said. “There's going to be a vision that's hopeful, compassionate, optimistic, addressing climate change, addressing inequities. And then there's going to be grievance filled, you know, anger coming from former President Trump.”\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow long is the debate?\n\nThe debate is scheduled to last 90 minutes and will include two commercial breaks.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nMust-watch cringe TV:Few swing state voters want to see Trump-Biden debate\n\nCNN says debate will not have an extended delay\n\nCNN corrected rumors that the first presidential debate will air with a 1–2-minute delay, instead of the standard 7-second delay, allowing the network to potentially edit parts of the broadcast. CNN Communications responded in a post on X, formerly Twitter, stating “This is false. The debate will begin live at 9pm ET.”\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhere is the presidential debate?\n\nThe first presidential debate will take place at CNN’s studio in Atlanta, Georgia, without a live studio audience.\n\n– Rachel Barber", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2023/12/13/sports-cheating-technology-chess-baseball/70561850007/", "title": "Sports cheating fueled by technology, from chess to baseball", "text": "They call him a “chess detective.”\n\nFor more than a decade now, University at Buffalo computer science professor Kenneth Regan has been one of the world's foremost experts in a niche subject: The detection of chess cheating. He spends much of his time monitoring games at top-level tournaments and identifying potential cheats, rooting out deceit with the help of what he describes as a “fairly garden-variety predictive analytic model” that compares the moves of a player to those suggested by chess-playing computers.\n\nRegan acknowledges that, without those computers, known as chess engines, his model would not work.\n\nOf course, without those same engines, many players would struggle to cheat in the first place.\n\n“It is true that I am fighting fire with fire,” Regan concludes.\n\nIt's a familiar refrain across the world of sports. As cheaters and dopers employ new forms of technology in their schemes, looking for innovative ways to gain an advantage and hide their misdeeds, anti-cheating authorities like Regan often use the same tools to catch or thwart them.\n\nIn elite distance running, electronic chips in runners' bibs can detect unusual changes in their pace or, in some cases, whether they attempt to cut the course. In Major League Baseball, officials recently introduced a wireless communication system called PitchCom as a potential antidote to the sign-stealing scandal carried out by the Houston Astros in 2017, when they won the World Series. And in Olympic sports, science has become an invaluable weapon wielded by dopers and anti-doping authorities, trying to stay one step ahead of one another.\n\n“It’s like an arms race,” University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. said. “A never-ending arms race.”\n\nIn his 2016 book titled “The Edge: The War against Cheating and Corruption in the Cutthroat World of Elite Sports,” Pielke writes that we are collectively “overdue to open a discussion of technology in sport.” He argues that technology is not only used to cheat and catch cheaters but also, perhaps more importantly, to establish rules around what, exactly, constitutes cheating in the first place.\n\nDo carbon-plated running shoes and high-tech swimsuits give their athletes an unfair advantage? What about an MMA fighter shaving down the bones in his face, to reduce the chances that he might get cut and bleed when hit?\n\nPerhaps most importantly: What new forms of cheating might we see next?\n\n'Toiletgate' to checkmate\n\nRegan first earned his reputation as a chess detective not by catching an accused cheater, but rather by helping to absolve one.\n\nAt the 2006 world chess championships, Bulgarian player Veselin Topalov indirectly accused his opponent, Vladimir Kramnik, of accessing a chess engine while he was in the bathroom. In a news release, Topalov's team noted that many of the Russian grandmaster's moves corresponded with the computer's suggestions, while calling attention to the frequency with which Kramnik used the bathroom during their match.\n\nThe saga became aptly known as “Toiletgate.”\n\nKramnik denied the allegations and ultimately wound up winning the match. Meanwhile, Regan, who was an accomplished chess player in his youth, decided to crunch the data using his model. He found that in many of the situations in Kramnik’s games, there was really only one strong move to choose from.\n\n“When the best move is singular … chances are a strong player will find the same move as a computer,” Regan explained.\n\nThough sometimes not considered a sport in the traditional sense, chess has had its fair share of cheating scandals − almost all of them involving the assistance of chess engines. Perhaps the most infamous one to date occurred just last year.\n\nAfter a shocking loss at a top-tier tournament in St. Louis, five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen refused to play American grandmaster Hans Niemann and later accused him of cheating \"more – and more recently – than he has publicly admitted.\" Niemann acknowledged cheating in online games as a teen but denied cheating at in-person tournaments. He later sued the Norwegian, among others, for defamation; the lawsuit was dismissed in June.\n\nIn the past decade alone, at least four elite players have been caught consulting a chess engine on a cell phone hidden in the bathroom at a tournament.\n\nIn a handful of other cases, players like Borislav Ivanov have been accused of receiving advice on a move via a wireless device. In Ivanov's case, the allegation was that he had a buzzer in his shoe. (Regan's model determined the odds of him playing the moves he played in a 2012 tournament without computer help were \"almost a million-to-one.\" Ivanov denied cheating but was disqualified from a separate tournament after refusing to take off his shoes. )\n\n“I categorically will not take off my shoes,” he told the tournament director, according to another player who told chess website ChessBase that he witnessed the incident. “My socks smell.”\n\n'It's a real cat-and-mouse game'\n\nRegan estimates there are between five and 10 cheating cases per year in upper-level amateur and professional chess tournaments. Unfortunately, he says, this is nothing new. When he was growing up, cheaters would secretively consult chess books rather than computers. Only the technology has changed.\n\nOver the past century, the devices and techniques at the center of other sports cheating schemes have ranged from the incredibly simple to the highly technical and sophisticated.\n\nAt the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, for example, it was the automobile that Fred Lorz used to win the marathon, riding comfortably for 11 of the race's 26.2 miles.\n\nIn more recent history, it was the center-field cameras that the Houston Astros used to zoom in on opposing catchers' signs, enabling their hitters to know ahead of time which pitches they were about to face.\n\nIn between, there was the electrically-modified fencing épée that pentathlete Boris Onischenko used at the 1976 Olympics. The capsule of fake blood that Tom Williams popped in his mouth, to feign injury at a critical juncture in a rugby match. Tiny electric motors hidden in the seat tubes of bicycles. A powder sprinkled into a boxer's gloves that hardens when wet, turning sweating fists into anvils. And a long list of technological advances used by dopers to avoid detection − from micro-dosing to more comical attempts, like the cyclist who tried to pass a drug test by running someone else's urine from a condom under his armpit through a tube in his sleeve. (That cyclist, Michel Pollentier, was quickly caught.)\n\n\"It’s a real cat-and-mouse game,\" said Matt Fedoruk, the chief science officer at the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. \"We're always, through sound and evidence-based scientific research, trying to develop and refine (our) techniques in order to stay ahead of the dopers.\"\n\nScience has perhaps played a more significant role in the doping world than any other cheating arena in sports. Fedoruk pointed to the use and detection of erythropoietin, more commonly known as EPO, as just one example.\n\nA hormone that ramps up the production of red blood cells in the body, EPO has been banned in sports since the early 1990s, according to the World Anti-Doping Agency. But before the 2000 Sydney Olympics, anti-doping authorities didn't have a test that could detect it. Several high-profile cyclists, including Lance Armstrong, wound up testing positive for the substance over the next dozen years.\n\nAnd yet as more athletes were caught with EPO, new synthetic versions of the hormone began to appear. Fedoruk said they're now seeing third- and fourth-generation EPO molecules, which are structured differently than their predecessors and therefore require different types of tests.\n\n\"As the drugs evolve, the tests have to evolve as well,\" he said. \"Because it’s not a one-test-fits-all type of approach.\"\n\nPerhaps this is why, in a 2022 survey conducted by USADA, 53% of the nearly 1,000 U.S. athletes questioned said they believe the science used to detect performance-enhancing substances is behind or far behind athletes' ability to dodge a positive test.\n\n\"If you’re going to be cheating in doping, you always have the upper hand,\" Pielke added.\n\n\"This is the double-edged sword, right? You come up with a better method of detecting, and the people who hold that knowledge also hold the key to knowing how to be a better doper.\"\n\nWhat comes next?\n\nSome advances in sports technology simply raise questions of cheating, rather than accusations of it.\n\nIn 2008, several swimming world records fell in quick succession after Speedo unveiled its new LZR swimsuit, which was designed to reduce resistance as swimmers traveled through the water. The suits were later banned by World Aquatics, the international federation that oversees the sport. Track and field dealt with a similar controversy in 2017, following the release of Nike's Vaporfly shoes − the first of what are now colloquially known as \"super shoes.\"\n\nThe future of sports cheating is likely to be riddled with more cases like these, in which athletes find and benefit from supercharged equipment before governing bodies are able to react. But experts like Fedoruk and Pielke believe the next major frontier is gene doping, or human enhancement more broadly.\n\n\"The questions of doping are going to seem quaint compared to the ability to do human enhancement going forward,\" Pielke predicted.\n\nIt is already commonplace for athletes to repair or replace parts of their bodies to improve their performance. Just think of every baseball player who has gotten Lasik eye surgery in hopes of picking up a curveball more easily, or MMA fighters like Nick Diaz, who turned to plastic surgery in an attempt to ensure they won't bleed when hit.\n\nBut gene doping goes a step further. The idea is that an athlete could hypothetically alter their genes to produce more of a hormone that would help them in competition, or less of one that would hinder them.\n\nFedoruk said that, while nobody has been caught attempting this kind of gene doping, it has \"become a threat.\" A synthetic type of EPO, for example, can be found in testing, but EPO produced by a manipulated gene cannot.\n\n\"The idea would be: Could this be undetectable?\" he asked.\n\nIt is likely only a matter of time before an athlete, or their accomplice, is able to use new scientific advances to turn the idea of gene doping into reality. In the meantime, Fedoruk and his colleagues will continue to use their own scientific tools to ward it off. Like everywhere else in sports, the proverbial cat-and-mouse game continues.\n\n\"So really,\" Pielke said, \"science and technology are both the problem and the solution.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/20/china/china-winter-olympics-domestic-success-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "The Olympics was a success inside of China. And that's the ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nHeading into the Winter Olympics, there was much talk of two host cities – one inside a tightly-sealed bubble where the Games would be held, and one outside, where daily life would go on as normal.\n\nBut the past two weeks have also shown the world two very different Games: For China, Beijing 2022 was a resounding success that exceeded all expectations. To the rest of the world, it remained a deeply polarizing event, that projected not only China’s rising power but also its growing assertiveness, ready to defy and challenge its critics.\n\nIn its meticulously managed “closed loop,” the ubiquitous face masks, endless spraying of disinfectant and rigorous daily testing have paid-off. Infections brought into the country were swiftly identified and contained, allowing the Games to run largely free of Covid even as the Omicron variant raged around the world.\n\nIn the medal tables, Team China claimed nine golds and a total of 15 medals, delivering its best ever result at a Winter Olympics – and ranking above the United States. The stellar performances of its new Olympic stars – from freeski sensation Eileen Gu to snowboard prodigy Su Yiming – captivated fans in the stands and across the country, drawing an outpouring of pride.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear Eileen Gu's remarks about representation after historic Olympic run 01:29 - Source: CNN\n\nBy Wednesday, nearly 600 million people – or 40% of the Chinese population – had tuned in to watch the Games on television in China, according to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). And while US viewing figures have been markedly down compared to previous Olympics, the boost in Chinese audiences will likely make Beijing 2022 among the most watched Winter Games in history.\n\nEven the official mascot Bing Dwen Dwen, a panda wearing an ice shell, turned out to be a domestic success. Having been mostly ignored for more than two years since it was first unveiled, the chubby bear soared in popularity during the Games, routinely trending on Chinese social media. At souvenir stores inside and outside the bubble, people queued for hours – sometimes in biting cold – to take home plush toy replicas.\n\nBeijing 2022's official mascot Bing Dwen Dwen has become a breakout star at these Games. Richard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nAnd for the ruling Communist Party and its supreme leader Xi Jinping, it is the domestic audience that matters the most. Xi personally backed Beijing’s bid to host these Games, and made a flurry of visits to the ice rinks and snow slopes to inspect preparation work. The success of the Games present Xi with a moment of national unity as he gears up for an unprecedented third term in power this fall.\n\nBut for the Chinese government, part of the domestic success also comes from the avoidance of major political scandal or embarrassment. While the doping saga surrounding a teenage Russian figure skater has cast a shadow over the Olympics, it was downplayed inside China. The same was true of criticism of the Games in general, most of which was censored and blocked.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian figure skater's entourage under investigation 04:49 - Source: CNN\n\nEarly in the Games, many athletes from Western countries were stunned by the stringent Covid restrictions they met upon arrival in Beijing. Some were placed in isolation for weeks after testing positive, while others complained about the bland food served in quarantine. But their criticism – including an emotional plea for help from a Belgian athlete – went wholly unreported inside China.\n\nInstead, Chinese state media avidly shared social media videos, posts and comments from athletes that portrayed their life inside the Olympic village in a positive light, praising the food, the Covid measures and the friendly volunteers.\n\nAnd much to the relief of government officials in Beijing, not a single athlete or Olympic attendee attempted to use the event to publicly protest China’s human rights record – a hot-button issue in the lead-up to the Olympics (though some have expressed critical views).\n\nIn December, the United States and its allies declared a diplomatic boycott of Games over China’s crackdown on Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang – which Washington has labeled a genocide. But apart from the notable absence of Western leaders at the opening ceremony, the impact of the boycott was seldom felt on the ground.\n\n“You can’t write stories about people who aren’t in Beijing – that’s the problem with the diplomatic boycott. There’s no story once the Games start,” said Susan Brownell, an expert on Chinese sports and the Olympic Games at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.\n\n“I’ve predicted at the beginning that the political issues would fade into the background and the sports would take the headlines, and that would be the memory that would be left, at least for the general audience. I think that has largely happened,” added Brownell.\n\nGoing on the offensive\n\nBut Beijing wasn’t just waiting for the political controversies to fade. It has gone on the offensive, using the Games to push its own political message and hit back at criticism – despite having repeatedly derided Western governments for “politicizing” the Olympics.\n\nAs the torch relay got underway right before the Games, state media reported a Chinese soldier who was involved in a deadly border clash with Indian troops was among the chosen few to carry the Olympic flame. The report sparked immediate outrage in India, prompting New Delhi to join the US-led diplomatic boycott.\n\nThe next day, in a symbolic end to the highly choreographed opening ceremony, Chinese organizers chose Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a little-known Uyghur cross-country skier, to deliver the flame to the Olympic cauldron. (Her name could also be written as Dilnigar Ilhamjan.) To many outside of China, it was seen as a deliberate attempt by Beijing to confront critics over its treatment of the Uyghurs.\n\nTorch bearers Dinigeer Yilamujiang and Jiawen Zhao of Team China hold the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony on February 4. Lintao Zhang/Getty Images\n\nThen there came the high-profile appearance of Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis star and three-time Olympian who has been at the center of global concern after she was silenced for accusing a former top Communist Party leader of sexual assault.\n\nAt these Games, Peng met IOC President Thomas Bach for dinner, gave a sit-down interview to French sport news site L’Equipe – during which she denied she ever accused anyone of sexual assault or disappeared from the public eye – and was seen in the stands watching Team China compete in events like curling, figure skating and freestyle skiing.\n\nHer flurry of activities made headlines around the world – and like her previous public appearances, they failed to quell broader concerns about her freedoms. Inside China, however, none of that was reported by state media or shared on social media, where Peng’s name remains censored.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear details of rare Peng Shuai interview with Western media 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nAnd as the Olympics approached its end, the political messaging got more pugnacious.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday, Yan Jiarong, a spokesperson for the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympics Games (BOCOG), was asked whether Taiwan’s delegation would appear at the closing ceremony Sunday.\n\nYan, a former Chinese representative to the United Nations, took the opportunity to assert China sovereignty claims over the self-ruling democracy. “What I want to say is that there is only one China in the world. Taiwan is an indivisible part of China,” she said.\n\nShe also jumped in on CNN’s question about whether the Olympics uniforms were made by forced labor in Xinjiang, calling accusations of forced labor “a lie made up by forces with ulterior motives.”\n\nYan’s comments – which appeared to be an outright violation of Olympic rules about political neutrality – prompted a rare rebuke from Bach, the IOC president.\n\n“We were in touch with the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (BOCOG) immediately after this press conference,” Bach said, “and both organizations, BOCOG and the IOC, have restated the unequivocal commitment to remain politically neutral as it is required by the Olympic charter.”\n\nWhile the Chinese government may see these combative remarks as a propaganda victory, for many in the international audience, they only serve as a reminder of how politically fraught these Games are, despite the organizational success and sporting achievements.\n\n“The Games as a standalone event have been run very well, and China did well. The organization has been phenomenal,” said Mark Dreyer, the founder of China Sports Insider in Beijing.\n\n“But again, it depends on what perspective you’re looking at. Are you just looking through that narrow lens? Because if you’re looking at China as a whole, the narrative (from outside China) is much more about China using these Games for sportswashing…I don’t think it’s really going to change people’s perspective on China as a country.”", "authors": ["Analysis Cnn'S Beijing Bureau"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/asia/shinzo-abe-former-japan-pm-death-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Who was Shinzo Abe, the former Japanese Prime Minister? | CNN", "text": "Tokyo CNN —\n\nJapan’s former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has died after being shot during a campaign speech Friday in Nara.

He was admitted into hospital in a state of cardiac arrest and medical staff were unable to stop the excessive bleeding, doctors said during a press conference on Friday.\n\nAbe served two separate terms as Japanese leader for the right-leaning Liberal Democratic Party – the first from 2006 to 2007, then again from 2012 until 2020. His second stint was the longest consecutive term for a Japanese head of government.\n\nJapanese politician Shinzo Abe attends a party for political fundraising at a hotel in Tokyo on April 14, 2022. Keita Iijima/AP\n\nAbe will be remembered for boosting defense spending and pushing through the most dramatic shift in Japanese military policy in 70 years. In 2015, his government passed a reinterpretation of Japan’s postwar, pacifist constitution, allowing Japanese troops to engage in overseas combat – with conditions – for the first time since World War II.\n\nAbe argued the change was needed to respond to a more challenging security environment, a nod to a more assertive China and frequent missile tests in North Korea.\n\nDuring his term, Abe sought to improve relations with Beijing and held a historic phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in 2018. At the same time, he tried to counter Chinese expansion in the region by uniting Pacific allies.\n\nAfter leaving office, Abe remained head of the largest faction of the ruling LDP and remained influential within the party. He has continued to campaign for a stronger security policy and last year angered China by calling for a greater commitment from allies to defend democracy in Taiwan. In response, Beijing summoned Japan’s ambassador and accused Abe of openly challenging China’s sovereignty.\n\nAbe bows to applause from lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party after winning the party's presidential election on Sept. 20, 2006.

Both his grandfather and great uncle served as prime minister, and his father was a former secretary general of the LDP.\n\nHe studied politics at Tokyo’s Seiki University and the University of Southern California, but initially entered business, taking a position with Kobe Steel in 1979. Three years later, he became an assistant to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n\nAbe was first elected to Japan’s House of Representatives in 1993, at age 38. He held a number of cabinet positions throughout the 2000s, and in 2003 became secretary general of the LDP. Four years later, he was named the party’s president and became prime minister of Japan.\n\nHis first term was marred by controversies and worsening health, and he stepped down as party leader and prime minister in 2007. The end of Abe’s first term opened a revolving door in which five different men held the prime minister post in five years until his re-election in 2012. He stepped down in 2020 citing ill health.\n\nDiplomatic record\n\nAbe was a prominent figure on the world stage. He cultivated strong ties with Washington – Tokyo’s traditional ally – and attempted to build a personal relationship with former United States President Donald Trump, traveling to New York to meet the newly elected Republican President while former President Barack Obama was still in office.\n\nDuring that “unofficial” meeting in 2016, Trump’s first with any world leader, Abe hailed the US-Japan alliance and said he wanted to “build trust” with the new President. He strongly supported Trump’s initial hard line on North Korea, which matched Abe’s own hawkish tendencies.\n\nAbe escorts then President Donald Trump during a welcome ceremony at Akasaka Palace, Nov. 6, 2017. Koji Sasahara/Pool/AP\n\nBut as Washington’s relationship with Pyongyang tipped toward diplomacy, with both Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in holding historic summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Abe appeared to be sidelined.\n\nNo meeting was scheduled between Abe and Kim, and in September 2019, the Japanese leader said he was still “determined” to meet him. Abe wanted to normalize relations with North Korea and ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but his first priority was to bring some closure for the families of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nDuring his tenure, Japan’s relations with South Korea soured. The two countries were engaged in a major dispute in which trade and military intelligence deals were scrapped, partly due to the legacy of World War II and Japan’s brutal colonization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe celebrating in Buenos Aires after Tokyo was chosen as the host city for the 2020 Summer Olympics in September 2013. Kyodo News/Getty Images\n\nOlympic ‘Super Mario’ success and setback\n\nAbe came to office during a time of economic turmoil and soon set about rebooting Japan’s economy after decades of stagnation. Soon after he was re-elected prime minister in 2012, he launched a grand experiment popularly known as “Abenomics.”\n\nIt included three so-called arrows – massive monetary stimulus, increased government spending, and structural reforms.\n\nAbe’s allies praised the plan for reviving the country’s economy and boosting consumer and investor confidence. But after a strong start, it faltered and in 2015 Abe fired “three new arrows” designed to boost gross domestic product. Any hopes they might eventually hit their mark were dashed when Covid-19 swept through the country in 2020, tipping Japan into recession.\n\nOne of Abe’s major domestic achievements was securing the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Abe delighted video game fans around the world when he famously dressed as Japanese icon Super Mario during the closing ceremony for the Rio Games in 2016, to introduce Tokyo as the next host city.\n\nShinzo Abe, dressed as Super Mario, holds a red ball during the closing ceremony of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. PHILIPPE LOPEZ/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn an instantly meme-able segment, Abe, wearing an oversized red cap, was shown emerging from a green pipe, as the sounds of the Super Mario video game echoed around the Maracanã stadium.\n\nBut the success of the much anticipated Tokyo Games was ultimately undone by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced the competition to be postponed to 2021.\n\nAn initial unwillingness to delay the Games was partly credited for Japan’s slow response to the coronavirus pandemic, which hit the country early in 2020. Abe declared a state of emergency months after the first cases were detected. His administration was also criticized for the low rate of testing, and an early lack of specialist medical equipment to treat the rising number of patients.\n\nMore successful was Abe’s handling of the abdication of Emperor Akihito, the first Japanese monarch to step down in two centuries. He was succeeded by his son, Emperor Naruhito, in October 2019, starting the Reiwa era.\n\n“Like the flowers of the plum tree blooming proudly in spring after the cold winter, we wish the Japanese people to bloom like individual flowers with the (promise of the) future. With such a wish for Japan, we decided upon ‘Reiwa’,” Abe said on announcing the new era.\n\nAbe is survived by his wife Akie Abe, née Matsuzaki, who he married in 1987.

Investigators also found dozens of photos of John Thomas Uda’s co-workers taken without their permission from the neck down, leading to 50 counts of voyeurism, Dothan police told news outlets. Uda, 27, also is charged with attempted rape, three counts of burglary, aggravated criminal surveillance and two counts of illegal possession of a credit card. Police are trying to figure out how many of those 400 paris of women’s underwear, which had been worn, might have been stolen. Investigators said worn panties can also be bought on the internet. Uda was accused in 2019 of stealing women’s underwear from laundromats, authorities said. Jail records did not indicate if Uda had an attorney.\n\nAlaska\n\nNome: A miner who said he was harassed by a bear for seven straight nights in the tundra near Nome was rescued when a passing Coast Guard helicopter spotted an SOS, the internationally recognized sign for help, on top of his cabin. The man, who was not identified by the Coast Guard in a statement, was taken to waiting rescue personnel in Nome. The helicopter crew was flying from Kotzebue to Kodiak on July 16 when it saw the SOS on top of the building. The crew circled back over the mining camp and saw a man waving his arms, another recognized sign of distress, the Coast Guard statement said. The man requested medical assistance after the helicopter landed, saying he had been attacked by a bear a few days earlier. The man appeared to have a leg injury and bruising on his torso, the Coast Guard said. The man said the bear had returned to his camp and harassed him every night for the previous week, according to the statement. Friends the same day the man was found had reported him overdue when he hadn’t returned to Nome. The Coast Guard statement didn’t specify what type of bear was involved.\n\nArizona\n\nPage:Lake Powell, the second-largest reservoir on the Colorado River, is about to hit the lowest water level since it was filled in 1963, the Bureau of Reclamation said. As of Friday afternoon, agency data showed the elevation at 3,555.35 feet above sea level. Despite the recent rain, officials anticipated the levels to decline to 3,555.1 feet by last weekend. The last time the reservoir dropped that low was in 2005, during the early days of a prolonged drought that continues to linger to this day. Once it falls below that level, it will mark a new low in the reservoir’s history. “The fact that we’ve reached this new record underscores the difficult situation that we’re in,” said Wayne Pullan, regional director for the Upper Colorado Basin at the Bureau of Reclamation, which manages Glen Canyon Dam, during a press call to discuss the milestone. Because of the low water levels, the bureau plans to release water from three upper basin reservoirs downstream into Lake Powell ahead of schedule. The emergency measure is intended to help ensure the water level remains high enough to keep the hydropower turbines spinning and generating electricity.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas’ coronavirus cases rose by nearly 2,000 on Friday as the state’s COVID-19 surge prompted the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to scale back its hospital visitor policy. The Department of Health said the state’s virus cases rose by 1,987 to 372,313 total since the pandemic began. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by 22 to 871, with 328 in intensive care and 159 on ventilators. UAMS announced that beginning Monday it will change its visitation policy to limit patients to one visitor per day. Previously, patients could have multiple visitors a day as long as only one visitor was in the patient’s room at a time. UAMS said it will continue to allow additional visitors for end-of-life situations. UAMS will continue to require visitors to pass a daily health screening and wear a photo ID badge and a face mask. Hospital visitors will also be required to stay in the patient’s room at all times.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: An unvaccinated snow leopard at the San Diego Zoo has contracted COVID-19. Caretakers noticed that Ramil, a 9-year-old male snow leopard, had a cough and runny nose on Thursday. Later, two separate tests of his stool confirmed the presence of the coronavirus, the zoo said in a statement Friday. Ramil is not showing additional symptoms, the zoo said, but because he shares an enclosure with a female snow leopard and two Amur leopards, the staff assumes they have been exposed. As a result, the animals were quarantined and their exhibit was closed. It’s unknown how Ramil got infected. In January, a troop of eight gorillas at the zoo’s sister facility, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, contracted COVID-19 from a keeper who had the virus but showed no symptoms. The gorilla troop, which has since recovered, became the first known example of the virus infecting apes. The case prompted the zoo to request an experimental COVID-19 vaccine for animals for emergency use. The vaccine from Zoetis, animal health company that was once part of Pfizer, was administered to species most at risk of contracting COVID-19, including several primates and big cats.\n\nColorado\n\nWindsor:The city closed Windsor Lake on Friday afternoon and shifted planned activities this week because of the detection of blue-green algae in the water. The lake, swim beach and dog park are closed to the public until further notice while the city works with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to monitor bacteria levels. Permitted boats are allowed on the lake “to assist in agitating the water,” but tubing, water skiing and other water activities are not allowed. The algae was detected in a precautionary water test July 19. On July 20, the town put out an algae advisory and put signs around the lake, but staff had not yet identified any toxins. Blue-green algae are known to spread rapidly and can be a result of hot weather, stagnant water and stormwater runoff. CDPHE said that the algae, while common in Colorado, can sometimes produce toxins that can harm people and be fatal to dogs and other animals.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: After nearly eight years of discussion and planning, a memorial to the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is nearing construction with the goal of offering a peaceful place for reflection. A groundbreaking ceremony is planned next month at the site down the street where the shooting occurred that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown on Dec. 14, 2012. Construction will be finished before the 10th anniversary next year, officials said. The State Bond Commission approved $2.5 million for the project on Friday, which the town will use to defray much of the $3.7 million local voters approved in April for the total cost of the memorial. The key area of the memorial will be a water feature with a sycamore tree in the middle and the victims’ names engraved on the top of the surrounding supporting wall. The water flow has been designed so floatable candles, flowers and other objects will move toward the tree and circle around it. Pathways will take visitors through a variety of plantings, including flower gardens.\n\nDelaware\n\nDagsboro: A historic chapel that predates the Revolutionary War has reopened to the public following a 16-month closure because of the pandemic. Prince George’s Chapel in Dagsboro welcomed the public for monthly tours Sunday, the Delaware State News reported. “It wasn’t worth even trying to open it up with all the restrictions and everything. So we’ve had it shut down,” Brian Baull, president of the nonprofit organization that serves as caretaker for the chapel, told the newspaper. Tours, which will take place the fourth Sunday of each month, are free. Construction on the chapel began in 1755 and was completed two years later. It was deeded to the state of Delaware in 1967, restored and reopened as a museum. In 1971, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Its most prominent feature is a vaulted ceiling made of heart-of-pine planks, the newspaper reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser has activated the District's Heat Emergency Plan for the first half of this week, WUSA-TV reported. The plan goes into effect when the forecast of the temperature or heat index in the District is 95 degrees or higher. That causes the city to open cooling centers for residents seeking relief from the heat. A list of District cooling centers can be found here. In addition, the city recommends that residents stay indoors, find places in the shade or with air conditioning to seek relief from the heat; check on neighbors – children, the elderly and those with access and functional needs are the most vulnerable in the community; dink plenty of water and wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing; do not leave children or pets in vehicles; pet owners should keep pets indoors, walk pets early in the morning and give pets plenty of water.\n\nFlorida\n\nMarathon: A juvenile green sea turtle rehabilitated at the Keys-based Turtle Hospital has been fitted with a satellite-tracking transmitter and released from a Keys beach to join the 14th Tour de Turtles, a marathon-like race that follows long-distance migration of sea turtles over three months. The educational outreach program organized by the Sea Turtle Conservancy raises awareness about sea turtles and threats to their survival. “The Tour de Turtles is an online educational program where, starting August 1, we’re tracking 19 turtles from Florida, Panama, Costa Rica and Nevis,” said Dan Evans, a senior research biologist with the Sea Turtle Conservancy. “It’s the idea that we’re tracking which turtle swims the furthest distance over three months.” Dubbed “Lucky Pulse” by her rescuers for a pulse-like marking on her head, the Keys turtle was released Friday to raise awareness about her own affliction. She was found off the Keys on March 17, entangled in fishing trap line and covered with fibropapilloma, debilitating tumors that develop from a herpes-like virus that affects sea turtles around the world. After the tumors’ removal, Lucky Pulse’s recovery included blood transfusions, breathing treatments, a broad spectrum of antibiotics, fluids, vitamins and a diet of seafood and greens.\n\nGeorgia\n\nColumbus: Residents at a mobile home park said they have had almost no water service for the past three weeks. So little water comes out of the pipes that it is almost impossible to flush toilets, wash dishes or take a bath at the Sea Breeze Mobile Home Park in Columbus, WRBL-TV reported. The water also isn’t safe to drink. “I had to spend three days in the hotel, me and my 8-year-old and my wife. That was money coming out of our pocket,” resident Jeffery Williams said. Water has been restored to some areas of the mobile home park and a citation has been issued to owner Fountain Bleau Capital LLC, said Columbus Inspection and Code Enforcement Director Ryan Pruett. The Massachusetts owner of the park said the maintenance staff was infected with COVID-19 and that delayed fixing the water problems.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A lawsuit challenging using police forces from other islands to respond to protests over a giant telescope planned for Hawaii’s tallest mountain is headed to the state Supreme Court. Police officers from Oahu and Maui flew to the Big Island in 2019 to help control protesters who blocked the mountain’s access road. Opponents of the Thirty Meter Telescope said it will desecrate land held sacred by Native Hawaiians. Big Island resident E. Kalani Flores’ lawsuit against police chiefs of the Hawaii County, Maui County and Honolulu forces argued his rights to observe Native Hawaiian cultural practices on Mauna Kea were violated by the police presence. The state Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case next month, Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported. The lawsuit said police violated a state statute that a police chief can operate on a neighboring island if doing so is required in the pursuit of an investigation that started in that chief’s jurisdiction. The lawsuit was initially dismissed because of a technicality and later went before the state Intermediate Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of the police chiefs.\n\nIdaho\n\nKetchum: A multiyear project to improve forest health in and around one of the nation’s top ski destinations has begun in central Idaho. The 10-year Bald Mountain Stewardship Project is intended in part to reduce the chances of a wildfire at Sun Valley Resort’s Bald Mountain ski area that operates on U.S. Forest Service land. The Idaho Mountain Express reported that work has started on the Forest Service’s plan to reduce fuel, restore forest health and enhance recreation opportunities. The ski area is a huge economic driver. But pine beetles, dwarf mistletoe and white pine blister rust are killing trees on the ski-run-carved mountain that forms a scenic and much-photographed backdrop for the resort towns of Ketchum and Sun Valley. Experts said the aging forest long protected from wildfires is at risk, leading to the project that also will clear debris within the ski area. The 9-square-mile project includes Sun Valley Resort’s nearly 5-square-mile ski area, of which about 4 square miles is skiable terrain. Officials said wildfires in 2007 and 2013 surrounded 9,150-foot Bald Mountain with burned forest, creating an island of green trees and increasing bark beetle attacks.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockton:Officials have found elevated levels of harmful metals in groundwater monitoring wells at a Rockton Superfund toxic waste site. But the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency noted that the substances were not found in the municipal water system for the Village of Rockton. Its water was tested June 21. Testing of private wells near the site will begin soon. The metals discovered include antimony, cadmium, chromium and nickel. Some metals are essential nutrients, but others can cause health problems. The results came from wells that check groundwater on the site of the former Beloit Corp. toxic waste investigations at the former manufacturer of paper-making products have been underway since 1992. Elevated metal levels were found in 16 of 20 monitoring wells. All are contained on the Superfund site. The samples were collected following the June 14 explosion and devastating fire at Chemtool Inc., located on the Superfund site. Metals were not previously a concern on the Beloit Corp. property. State officials are investigating their source. Officials said that until testing is completed, those with private wells living in the Blackhawk neighborhood adjacent to Chemtool should use bottled water for drinking and cooking.\n\nIndiana\n\nBurns Harbor: Indiana’s Lake Michigan port has seen a big increase in shipments this year as the global economy rebounds from the coronavirus pandemic. In June, the port handled a 52% spike in cargo. So far this year, the Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor has had more than a 36% increase in maritime tonnage compared with the same period last year, said Vanta E. Coda II, chief executive of the Indianapolis-based Ports of Indiana port authority. “Steel is up more than 100% and limestone has climbed nearly 90%, too. We look forward to additional growth in the second half of the year,” Coda said. Through the end of June, international cargos shipped through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Great Lakes ports are up by 8.37% to 12.9 million tons, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported. Great Lakes shipping officials attributed the boost to increased domestic construction, manufacturing activity and global export demand. Shipments of cement are up 36%, gypsum 79% and general cargo 61%. Iron ore volumes are up 14%, partly because of exports to Asia and Europe. Coke, another steelmaking input, is up 125%, partly because of exports to France, the Netherlands and other European countries.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: Forty Iowans, including some from the Cedar Rapids area, had to undergo treatment for rabies after they were potentially in contact with a rabid bat at the zoo in Omaha, Nebraska. More than 180 individuals were advised to receive the rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, which contains the rabies vaccine, after a wild bat was found near a person attending one of the Henry Doorly Zoo’s multiple overnight campouts at the aquarium earlier this month. A total of 186 overnight campers, including youth and adult groups, were contacted by the Nebraska public health department, the Omaha World-Herald reported. Among those were dozens of Iowans, mostly adolescents and their parents, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. Linn County Public Health said anyone locally who has been impacted has been contacted and the appropriate follow-up has been conducted. Public health officials in Nebraska recommended all campers who stayed at the zoo overnight June 29, June 30, July 2 and July 3 receive prophylaxis. The recommendation came after a camper staying in the aquarium the night of July 3 woke up to a wild bat near her head. A team found seven bats in the building, one of which tested positive for rabies, a news release from the zoo stated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Union members at the Frito-Lay plant in Topeka have approved a new contract and will return to work Monday, ending a nearly three-week strike at the plant, union officials said. Members of Local 218 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union approved the contract Friday. It gives all union members a 4% pay raise over two years and guarantees workers at least one day off each week, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. More than 500 of the 850 employees represented by the union went on strike on July 5, complaining of a toxic work environment, forced overtime and a lack of pay raises. Workers said the shifts were caused by a severe staffing shortage at the plant. Carolyn Fisher, spokeswoman for PepsiCo., Frito-Lay’s parent company, said the contract allows the company to rebid its entire facility, or parts of it, once during the two-year contract. Labor-management committees will be formed to make recommendations on staffing and overtime and shape the rebid process.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Two members of Kentucky State University’s governing board resigned days before the abrupt departure of the campus president, adding to the upheaval in the highest ranks of the school as it faces an independent investigation into its finances. Soon after M. Christopher Brown II’s resignation as school president last week, Gov. Andy Beshear called for an independent accounting of KSU’s finances and signed an order empowering the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education to provide guidance and oversight during the review. The development came as Kentucky’s sole public historically Black university contended with concerns about its financial health and lawsuits alleging misconduct by campus officials. In the days before Brown’s departure, Candace McGraw submitted her resignation from the school’s Board of Regents. In her resignation letter, McGraw said she was “not fully aware of the time needed to engage fully in order to ensure the ongoing success of the university.” McGraw, a recent board appointee, is CEO of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Paul Harnice also resigned from the school’s board before Brown left, The State Journal reported. Harnice’s resignation letter did not provide an apparent reason for his resignation, The State Journal reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With more than 1,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19 across Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards encouraged everyone, whether vaccinated or not, to wear masks indoors if they can’t stay distanced from others. But the Democratic governor stopped short of issuing a statewide face covering mandate or new restrictions on activities and businesses amid the state’s fourth spike of COVID-19, driven by the highly contagious delta variant. Louisiana – which has among the nation’s lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates – is seeing thousands of new confirmed cases of the coronavirus illness each day, and its hospitalizations have surged in recent weeks. Edwards said Louisiana has the highest rate of new COVID-19 cases per capita in the nation and has been labeled a “state of concern” by the White House. Edwards placed the blame squarely on people refusing to get immunized against the coronavirus in a state where only about 48% of those eligible for the vaccines have gotten at least one shot.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine is home to the last wild Atlantic salmon populations in the U.S., but a new push to protect the fish at the state level is unlikely to land them on the endangered list. Atlantic salmon once teemed in U.S. rivers, but now return from the sea to only a handful of rivers in eastern and central Maine. The fish are protected at the federal level under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, but a coalition of environmental groups and scientists said the fish could be afforded more protections if they were added to Maine’s own list of endangered and threatened species. State law allows Maine Department of Marine Resources Commissioner Patrick Keliher to make that recommendation, but his office told the Associated Press he does not intend to do it. The department has done extensive work to conserve and restore the fish, and Keliher “does not believe a listing at the state level would afford additional conservation benefits or protections,” said Jeff Nichols, a department spokesperson. The environmentalists who want to see the fish on the state list said they’re going to keep pushing for it and other protections. Adding the fish to the state endangered list would mean conservation of salmon would be treated as a bigger concern in state permitting processes, said John Burrows, executive director for U.S. operations for the Atlantic Salmon Federation.\n\nMaryland\n\nOakland: A state police helicopter hoisted an injured swimmer to safety in western Maryland. The helicopter was dispatched shortly after 5 p.m. Friday to rescue a swimmer who sustained a head injury after slipping on a rock at Swallow Falls along the Youghiogheny River in Garrett County, state police said in a news release Saturday. The helicopter was requested partly because of the steep terrain and nature of the victim’s injuries, police said. The helicopter hovered 275 feet above the river as a trooper with medical equipment was lowered to the scene to prepare the patient for an aerial extraction, the news release said. Once the patient was secured inside the AW-139 helicopter, the crew provided medical care during the trip to a hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia. The patient wasn’t identified, and the person’s condition wasn’t immediately known.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A rare first-place medal from the first modern Olympic Games has sold for more than $180,000. Boston-based RR Auction said Friday that the winning bidder for the silver medal from the 1896 games in Athens, Greece, was a collector based on the East Coast. The company estimated before the auction that the first place medal could fetch about $75,000. At the inaugural Olympiad, first-place winners were awarded silver medals and second-place finishers earned bronze, the auction house said. There was no award for placing third. Unlike today’s games where thousands of athletes compete, just 250 were featured at the first modern games, the company said. Other notable items sold include a gold medal bestowed on the Argentine men’s soccer team during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics that went for more than $97,000. A gold medal for the U.S. men’s basketball team during the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics also sold for more than $83,000 and a gold medal awarded to Swedish wrestler Ivar Johansson during the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympics sold for more than $45,000.\n\nMichigan\n\nCorunna: Elected officials in Shiawassee County who gave themselves bonuses of $65,000 with federal COVID-19 relief aid said they will return the money following days of criticism. County commissioners acted after the county prosecutor said the payments were illegal, The Argus-Press reported. The Michigan Constitution bars additional compensation for elected officials “after services had already been rendered,” prosecutor Scott Koerner said Friday. The commissioners, all Republicans, voted on July 15 to award themselves $65,000 as part of a plan to give $557,000 to 250 county employees as “hazard pay” for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. The smallest amounts for recipients were $1,000 to $2,000. But County Board Chairman Jeremy Root got $25,000. Two more commissioners received $10,000 each, and four others received $5,000 each. The commissioners awarded money to other elected officials, including the prosecutor, the sheriff and the county clerk, all Republicans. They, too, said they would give it back. Two Michigan congressmen, a Democrat and a Republican, said federal virus aid wasn’t intended to reward elected officials.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBlaine: A crane fell over at a construction site in the Minneapolis suburb of Lexington on Friday, causing a power outage for nearly 900 customers in the area as temperatures climbed into the mid-90s. There were no injuries reported. A dispatch supervisor with the Centennial Lakes Police Department said the call came in shortly before 12:30 p.m. The crane fell into power lines and onto the partially constructed building. Dispatch supervisor Donnelle Lawrence said the building was evacuated. The collapse also caused a small grass fire, which was quickly extinguished, Lawrence said. Xcel Energy reported reported nearly 900 customers in the areas of Blaine, Circle Pines and Lexington were without power after the collapse according to its online outage map. Temperatures were in the mid-90s on Friday afternoon and the area was under a heat advisory, as forecasters said the combination of heat and humidity made the temperature feel like it was 100 degrees.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Even as COVID-19 cases have increased rapidly in Mississippi in recent days, some school districts are saying masks will be optional for students, teachers and staff. Among the districts taking that approach is the state’s largest one, DeSoto County School District. “Right now, there are no state mandates or local mandates requiring masks,” Superintendent Cory Uselton told WMC-TV. “Last year, we were under a mask mandate because of the governor’s executive order. There’s no executive order in place right now, so that will be a parental decision.” As part of its guidance for K-12 school settings, the State Department of Health recommends masks for anyone not fully vaccinated. It also recommends people 12 and older get vaccinated. Instead of encouraging either of those things, the DeSoto District will give families information from the health department, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Academy of Pediatrics, Uselton said.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: St. Louis city and county officials said they will require masks in some public places starting Monday, citing a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases spurred by the delta variant. Masks will be mandatory in indoor public places and on public transportation for everyone age 5 or older, even for those who are vaccinated, officials said in a news release Friday. Masking outdoors “will be strongly encouraged,” especially in group settings. The decision comes as both of Missouri’s urban areas are seeing a big uptick in cases in hospitalizations that began in rural areas of the state, especially in southwestern Missouri. The Kansas City Star reported Friday that medical leaders in that region appear to be on the verge of calling for a new mask mandate there, as well.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Five firefighters were injured when a thunderstorm and swirling winds in central Montana blew a lightning-caused wildfire back on them, federal officials said. All five remained in medical facilities and were still being evaluated and treated Saturday, a day after they were injured, Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Mark Jacobsen said. He declined to release the extent of the firefighters’ injuries or specify where they were being treated. They had joined other crews working on the 1,300-acre fire burning in rough, steep terrain about 36 miles northwest of the town of Jordan. They were building a defensive fire line Thursday when the weather shifted, Jacobsen said. “Numerous wind shifts and rapid rates of spread resulted in erratic fire behavior as thunderstorms and associated cells were passing over the area when the incident occurred,” he said. Other firefighters in the area were able to call for help and the injured firefighters – three U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service crew members from North Dakota and two USDA Forest Service firefighters from New Mexico – were evacuated, Jacobsen said. Meanwhile, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Friday that crews from Utah and California were coming to Montana on Saturday to help fight fires. Utah will send two task forces with a total of seven engines and 25 personnel, and California is sending a strike team with five engines and 20 personnel, Gianforte said. The teams will be in Montana for two weeks, and Montana will pay their costs, the governor said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nearly 50 Nebraska school boards have objected to proposed state health education standards that include lessons for young children on gender identity and gender expression. State Sen. Joni Albrecht said 47 school boards across the state have either adopted resolutions or sent letters opposing the first draft of the standards that the Nebraska Department of Education is considering. Albrecht was part of a group of 30 state senators who signed a statement urging school districts to object to the standards. The standards would be optional if they’re approved, according to the Omaha World-Herald. Under the proposed standards, kindergartners would learn about different kinds of family structures, including same-gender families. First-graders would be taught about gender identity and gender stereotypes. Sixth-graders would learn about a range of identities related to sexual orientation, including heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian, gay, queer, two-spirit, asexual and pansexual. They would be taught the differences between cisgender, transgender, gender nonbinary, gender expansive and gender identity. The proposal has faced strong opposition from Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, who has no direct influence over the state board, and large crowds have attended state education board meetings. State Education Commissioner Matt Blomstedt told school districts in a letter earlier this month that there would be changes in the second draft of the standards. He said that next draft will remove many of the explicit examples and make clear that discussions of sensitive health-related topics should be “thoughtfully conducted with parental input at a local level.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Coronavirus numbers remained high in Nevada as the state reported more than 1,000 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, at least 20 deaths and hospitalizations climbing past the 1,000 plateau for the first time in more than five months, state health officials said. The 1,003 new cases reported by the state Department of Health and Human Services nearly matched the 1,004 new cases reported on Tuesday. It was the highest since 1,070 cases were recorded Jan. 30, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The updated figures pushed totals to 349,043 COVID-19 cases and 5,817 deaths statewide since the pandemic began in March 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New Hampshire residents can’t be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to access public facilities, benefits or services under a bill signed into law by Gov. Chris Sununu. Supporters said the bill signed this week establishes “medical freedom” by specifying that all residents have the “natural, essential and inherent right to bodily integrity, free from any threat or compulsion by government to accept an immunization.” It does not, however, supersede the state law regarding vaccinations as a prerequisite for admission to school. That law lists seven required vaccinations but does not include the COVID-19 vaccine. The new law also does not apply to county nursing homes, the state psychiatric hospital or other medical facilities operated by the state or other governmental bodies. And it allows mandatory immunizations in prisons and jails when there is a significant health threat.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSecaucus: New Jersey on Friday took the first step to rid the lower Hackensack River of heavily contaminated sediment dating from the state’s industrial past. State Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette announced the commitment of Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration to seek placement of the 23-mile stretch of river on the federal government’s list of Superfund toxic sites. Approval would mean access to federal funding and would enable the Environmental Protection Agency to seek the parties responsible for polluting the waters to help fund the remediation, once identified. “Designating the lower Hackensack River as a federal Superfund site will provide the tools we need to remove decades of contamination that have polluted river sediments and restore the natural resources that have been impaired for far too long,” LaTourette said. A previous EPA study found elevated levels of cancer-causing dioxin, cadmium, lead, mercury and PCBs in sediment sampled from the river’s mouth at Newark Bay to the Oradell Reservoir. Achieving Superfund status could take years to complete. “I realize that this is one step in the process and that cleanup will take time,” said Hackensack Riverkeeper Bill Sheehan. He said he has been working to get the designation since 2015.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico schools plan to spend the bulk of the federal coronavirus relief money they have received on technology and building upgrades rather than student learning loss. A report this week before the New Mexico Legislature’s budget committee showed school districts and charters plan to spend 38% of the $490 million they received thus far on technology and HVAC systems. T he Santa Fe New Mexican reported that schools plan to spend 9% of the funds on learning loss programs and 8% on interventions for at-risk students. The budget committee’s program evaluation manager Micaela Fischer told lawmakers those numbers were surprising because students likely missed out on learning because of the shift to remote classrooms during the pandemic. Los Alamos Public Schools is an exception to the trend and plans to spend all of the money it received from a December coronavirus relief package to address learning loss with summer and after-school programs.\n\nNew York\n\nYonkers: Police and bystanders lifted a car to free a trapped baby after a suspected drunken driver struck the girl and her mother and then plowed through a storefront with the pair on the hood. The crash and rescue were recorded on video released by Yonkers Police. It showed a Hyundai Elantra striking a curb and parked car Friday before driving into a woman as she crossed the street with a child in her arms. With the woman and child on the hood of the car, it accelerates through the storefront of a barber shop. Police body camera footage from inside the building showed Yonkers Officers Rocco Fusco and Paul Samoyedny, who had been having breakfast nearby, frantically working with bystanders to lift the heavily damaged car and pull the crying 8-month-old girl from beneath it. “Luckily, two veteran officers of Yonkers’ finest just happened to be getting breakfast next door and quickly took action along with members of the community to rescue a child trapped under the vehicle and render aid to her mother,” Police Commissioner John Mueller said in a news release. “The actions taken are nothing short of heroic.” The baby sustained a skull fracture and burns to her back and foot. Her 36-year-old mother broke a leg, the news release said. The 43-year-old male driver and a female passenger were not injured. The driver, from Yonkers, was charged with driving while intoxicated, vehicular assault and aggravated unlicensed operation.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOcracoke: Transportation officials said successful drone flights this week to Ocracoke have them hopeful that it might soon get easier to deliver vital supplies to the remote Outer Banks island amid bad weather. The Department of Transportation’s Division of Aviation and U.S.-based drone logistics company Volansi completed two successful trial flights of a delivery drone from a ferry dock in Hatteras to Ocracoke Island, the department said in a news release. “This is a tremendous first step in better connecting Ocracoke Island to potentially life-saving supplies and equipment,” Secretary of Transportation Eric Boyette said in a statement. “Today, Ocracoke Island is accessible only by plane or by boat. What we’re working on here is an entirely new, third method of serving the needs of Ocracoke’s people.” The tests involved an 8-mile round-trip flight averaging 18 minutes in flight time. The first delivered a small survival kit, space blankets and a chocolate muffin to Ocracoke, and the second delivered bottles of water, according to the news release. The next test, at a time to be determined, will involve a longer flight, the department said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The federal government has denied a request by North Dakota leaders to allow ranchers struggling with drought to hay idled grassland while it’s still of good quality. The Bismarck Tribune reported the state Agriculture Department is looking into the reasons why the request was denied. The federal government is allowing limited emergency grazing of Conservation Reserve Program land, which typically is idled under a government program that pays farmers to protect erodible land and create wildlife habitat. North Dakota ranchers all summer have been seeking federal government permission to also hay that land. The CRP typically doesn’t open until after nesting season ends, to protect wildlife populations. The season in North Dakota ends Aug. 1. Ranchers said that after that day, grass might not be of good enough quality to make it worthwhile to hay. State officials and members of North Dakota’s congressional delegation this summer have pushed the U.S. Department of Agriculture for earlier CRP haying. State Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring earlier this week made another plea. His department has received hundreds of calls from ranchers in recent weeks about the issue.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:The Cincinnati Black Music Walk of Fame is officially scheduled to open next summer. Plans for the interactive park and star-studded path were unveiled Saturday during an induction ceremony. The crowd was lively while the P. Ann Everson-Price & The All-Star Band played tributes to the walk's first inductees as well as other famous Black musicians and funk artists. The first four inductees to receive stars on the Walk of Fame will be Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Bootsy Collins, King Records icon Otis Williams, and Grammy Winners The Isley Brothers and the late Gospel great Dr. Charles Fold. The Cincinnati Black Music Walk of Fame is intended to stand toe-to-toe with The National Museum of African American Music in Nashville, Tennessee; Atlanta’s Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame; and Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. Like the Hollywood Walk of Fame, each inductee will have their name placed on a star on the walkway. The funding for the park and walkway will come from the $159 million stimulus fund that was awarded to the county. The Hamilton County Commission unanimously voted in favor of the park while deciding on how to spend the county's stimulus money. The park was awarded $9 million. Procter and Gamble has also partnered with the project and will pay for the new inductee stars for the next several years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:The owner of a dilapidated Oklahoma Panhandle wind farm has presented plans to clean up the most dangerous of the wind turbine towers. The plans are to address dangerously broken-down towers and turbines of the 60-tower KODE Novus I and II wind farm near Guymon, The Oklahoman reported. Owner Olympia Renewable Platform LLC has hired a contractor to remove broken blades from seven towers and topple a couple of others topped with burned-out generator nacelles. The company assured the repair work could begin next month and take 20 to 30 days to complete, depending on wind conditions. Dozens of wind turbines in the complex have been locked down and aren’t part of the cleanup plan. Oklahoma Corporation Commission officials have determined that the dilapidated wind towers are dangerous to the public, which had easy access to the scene until Olympia erected temporary fencing around it. The complex was developed and owned by a subsidiary of a South Korean company until it went bankrupt.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Low oxygen levels measured off the coast of Oregon and Washington are raising concerns of large “dead zones” that could decimate crabs and bottom-dwelling fish within them. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said this week that researchers have detected unseasonably low oxygen levels in a large area off the Pacific coast, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. Year after year of low oxygen levels beginning in the early 2000s led researchers to determine Oregon now has a “hypoxia season” – just as it has a fire season – and this year’s hypoxia season has arrived far earlier than usual. The start of the hypoxia season is marked by the upwelling of cold bottom water. Winds initiated that upwelling this year around March. Chan said that’s the earliest Oregon ocean-watchers have seen in 35 years. That could have major implications for coastal economies, particularly related to the Dungeness crab. Dead zones happen as winds pick up, driving cold water from the bottom of the ocean toward the surface, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That contributes to blooms of phytoplankton, which once they die, sink to the ocean floor. Bacteria consume oxygen while decomposing the plankton.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: President Joe Biden will head to the Allentown area Wednesday as he fights for passage in the Senate of a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure measure that a bipartisan group of senators brokered with him. The White House is billing Biden’s visit to Macungie as a stop to “emphasize the importance of American manufacturing, buying products made in America, and supporting good-paying jobs for American workers.” It gave no other details of the visit – Biden’s second to Pennsylvania so far this month after he went to Philadelphia last week to speak on voting rights. In the Senate, Republicans rejected an effort this week to begin debate on the infrastructure deal. Supporters said they need more time before another vote, possibly next week. Macungie is near the home of Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, who voted against opening debate. In a statement after the vote, Toomey echoed other Republicans in pointing out that crucial details about the deal are not completed. Should an agreement be reached on those, Toomey said he will consider the measure “based on its substance.” Pennsylvania’s other U.S. senator, Democrat Bob Casey, voted with other Democrats to start debate.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Environmental officials in Rhode Island have extended their ban on shellfish harvesting in certain areas of the state. The state Department of Environmental Management said a ban that was set to expire Sunday will be extended until further notice. The announcement covers what it refers to as the “Lower Providence River Conditional Area E” and “Upper Bay Conditional Area A.” The closures were enacted after recent heavy rainfall and are being extended because test samples showed continued high bacteria levels in the water. At least one other shellfish area in Greenwich Bay reopened to harvesting Sunday, and two others in Mt. Hope Bay and the Kickemuit River are open, the agency said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nNichols: A utility is building walls around an electric substation to prevent it from being overrun by floodwaters in the first-of-its-kind project in South Carolina. Duke Energy is spending $1.6 million on the Nichols project to protect a substation that has flooded twice in the past five years, utility spokesperson Ryan Mosier told the Morning News of Florence. The substation was flooded in 2016 in Hurricane Matthew and 2018 in Hurricane Florence. In 2018, the substation, which takes high voltage power from plants and converts it to lower voltage electricity for homes, was out for five weeks, Mosier said. The substation is surrounded by reinforced fiberglass walls. Crews put up aluminum gates when flooding is threatened, which keep water out but allow crews access inside. The walls are 6-to-8 feet tall with access gates. The gates are installed when the company forecasts potential flooding. Crews can also quickly access the substation for maintenance. Duke Energy has already installed the walls at facilities in Lumberton and Wallace in North Carolina and plans four more projects, Mosier said, Other nearby substations to Nichols are on higher ground and didn’t need the walls, said Davy Gregg, a Duke Energy supervisor for the Marion County area.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:A replica of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier came to Sioux Falls over the weekend as part of a honorary tour to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the monument. The half-scale replica was at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance and crowds came to view it and learn more about its history. The original Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is in Arlington Cemetery in Virginia, across the Delaware River from the nation’s capital.. The replica is part of a traveling exhibition called A Call to Honor: Tomb of The Unknown Soldier. The Americanism Committee of the Exchange Club in Rome, Georgia, is responsible for the exhibition and brings the replica to all parts of the United States.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The bust of Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest that had been prominently displayed inside the state Capitol for decades – over objections from Black lawmakers and activists – was removed from its pedestal Friday. The image of Forrest has sparked protests since its installation in 1978 as defenders sought to tout his legacy while critics objected to honoring a historical figure who supported the South’s secession. Over the years, some suggested adding historical context next to the bust. Yet many others, including Republican Gov. Bill Lee, successfully argued for moving it to the Tennessee State Museum, just north of the Capitol. Forrest was a Confederate cavalry general who amassed a fortune before the Civil War as a Memphis slave trader and plantation owner. Later, he was a leader of the Klan as it terrorized Black people. The busts of Union Navy Adm. David Farragut and U.S. Navy Adm. Albert Gleaves also were moved to the museum on Friday, part of an agreement used to win over the votes needed on key panels that military leaders shouldn’t be displayed in the Capitol.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The Dallas area was the country’s top market for commercial property investments in the first half of 2021. Dallas retained the top real estate spot it gained last year during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report by Real Capital Analytics. Through the first six months of this year, Dallas saw almost $13.4 billion in commercial property deals – 43% more than in the same period a year ago. Last year, more than $19.7 billion in commercial real estate deals were recorded in the local market. Sales of dozens of local apartment communities and warehouses, plus the $700 million purchase of Uptown Dallas’ Crescent complex, all contributed to the huge volume of property investments in the area this year. The Crescent was ranked as the second-largest commercial property deal in the country in the first six months of 2021.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City:People in Utah gathered to celebrate the state’s history and recognize early Mormon pioneers who trekked west in search of religious freedom. Pioneer Day is a beloved only-in-Utah holiday every July 24 that features parades, rodeos, fireworks and more. The festivities were canceled last year because of the pandemic. Hundreds of people on Friday camped and staked out spots along the parade route in downtown Salt Lake City. Pioneer Day marks the date in 1847 when Brigham Young and other Mormon pioneers, many pulling handcarts, ended their treacherous journey across the country from Illinois to the Salt Lake Valley. Many businesses and government offices close for the state holiday.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Signs will be posted near eight Vermont ponds where the use of baitfish is prohibited to protect native brook trout, the Fish and Wildlife Department said. 1/ 2 “Wild native brook trout thrive in ponds where there are simple fish communities with no or few other fish species,” department fisheries biologist Jud Kratzer said in a statement earlier this week. “Adding new fish species, even minnows, disrupts a long-established food chain. Trout populations suffer as a result.” Brook trout are native to the eastern United States but no longer exist in much of their original range, the department said. Signs will be posted at public access points near Beaver Pond in Holland; Blake Pond in Sutton; Cow Mountain Pond in Granby; Jobs Pond in Westmore; Lewis Pond in Lewis; North Pond in Chittenden; Unknown Pond in Avery’s Gore; and Noyes Pond in Groton.\n\nVirginia\n\nCulpeper: Virginia’s government watchdog said the commonwealth’s land conservation easement program that offers participants tax breaks needs improvement. Auditors with the Office of the State Inspector General found items such as trash, old tires, inoperable vehicles and a manure storage area containing dead cattle parts on properties with easements it inspected, the Culpeper Star-Exponent reported. “Virginia provides tax credits up to $75 million per year for conservation easements and land donations,” Inspector General Michael Westfall said in a statement. “In effect, Virginia is paying for natural resource preservation through these tax credits.” There’s a $1 million tax credit value threshold for a Department of Conservation and Recreation quality review of an easement. Among the watchdog’s recommendations was lowering that threshold. But Dan Holmes, director of state policy for the Piedmont Environmental Council, told the newspaper the tax credit was a valuable tool and questioned the audit’s conclusions and methodology.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan and other city officials plan to add a response unit for 911 calls that don’t require typical, armed police officers. Officials said they are still working out details, and it won’t launch until at least next year, The Seattle Times reported. Durkan said the idea is to provide 911 dispatchers with a new option for certain calls, such as wellness checks, that are associated with neither criminal nor medical emergencies. The mayor said it could be similar to the city’s Health One program, which sends firefighters and social workers to nonemergency medical calls. It will likely be staffed by civilian city employees, possibly partnered with certain officers, she said. The responders will know deescalation techniques and how to guide people to social services, she said, adding that it might be called “Triage One.” Durkan said she intends to include funding for the new option in her 2022 budget proposal, which is due in September. She hasn’t said what it might cost but said it would start as a pilot program, with limited capacity.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state treasurer’s office raised nearly $140,000 for law enforcement agencies through its unclaimed property firearms auction. This year’s event had record inventory – more than 500 firearms lots – because the pandemic prevented the treasurer’s office from holding an auction last year, Treasurer Riley Moore’s office said in a news release. The treasurer’s office raised $139,790 during the auction. Under state law, state and local law enforcement agencies can turn over unclaimed, seized or outdated firearms in their possession to the treasurer’s office for auction, and the proceeds can be returned to the law enforcement agency. This year’s auction attracted more than 60 federally licensed firearms dealers. Bidders must be a valid, licensed federal firearms dealer. The event isn’t open to the general public.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin System plans to offer nearly $500,000 in scholarships this fall to students who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus. System President Tommy Thompson said all vaccinated students at regional four- and two-year campuses that get at least 70% of their students vaccinated by Oct. 15 will be eligible for a drawing for a $7,000 scholarship. Seventy students will win, with more winners coming from campuses with larger enrollments. UW-Madison students won’t be eligible, Thompson said, because Chancellor Rebecca Blank is working on her own vaccination incentive programs. Asked for details on Blank’s plans, UW-Madison spokesman John Lucas said the flagship university is “on a path” to reach 80% vaccination among students and is “considering incentives” but had nothing to announce. Thompson has called for campuses to offer at least three-quarters of their courses in-person this fall. He said he set the vaccination threshold at 70% for the scholarship drawing because that’s generally considered the minimum for herd immunity.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Officials expect moderate to extreme drought to persist and spread throughout Wyoming. The multiyear drought is the state’s worst since 2013. Last year was Wyoming’s fifth-driest and 16th-warmest since 1895, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Even parts of the state with average or above-average precipitation got it earlier in the year than usual, leaving those areas just as susceptible to drought now, Wyoming Game and Fish Department terrestrial habitat supervisor Ian Tator told the state Game and Fish Commission last week. “On a statewide basis, there’s nowhere that’s doing fantastic,” Tator said. Fishing spots also face strain as water levels fall and temperatures rise, state fisheries management coordinator Dave Zafft told the commission.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/13/beckoning-tourists-evangelical-outreach-vaccine-sweeteners-news-around-states/116175936/", "title": "Beckoning tourists, evangelical outreach: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: With the state’s jobless numbers already nearing pre-pandemic levels and competition on the rise in a changed job market, the search for hospitality workers may not end with Alabama’s participation in federal supplemental unemployment benefits. Some who lost jobs in the industry “went off and found a job that has more … dependable wages,” said Jacqueline Allen, spokeswoman for state workforce development agency AIDT. “Everybody who basically wants a job right now has a job.” That’s My Child youth nonprofit founder Charles Lee said every member of his teens-to-work training program now graduates with a job, and the phone keeps ringing with employers asking for more. Meanwhile, he said federal relief payments and jobless benefits have changed people’s outlook on what’s possible. “It’s the most money some people have ever seen,” Lee said. “I think it’s just whoever is willing to go up to that $15 is going to get that workforce.” Transportation and child care issues were complicated by the pandemic, too. Child care alone is pricey in the best of times, if it’s available at all. Sam Addy of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Alabama estimated better access to child care could bring 120,000 more people into the state’s labor force.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The runoff race for mayor remained too close to call after Tuesday’s election, with the two candidates separated by only about 100 votes and thousands of ballots still uncounted. Preliminary election results showed Forrest Dunbar leading opponent Dave Bronson by a slim margin, garnering 50.08% of the votes tallied thus far, Anchorage Daily News reports. The election was on track for a record number of votes cast. An unknown amount of ballots cast in person Tuesday, left in secure ballot boxes throughout the city or postmarked by Election Day continue to arrive. As more ballots arrive, it’s likely that turnout will eclipse the city’s last record in the 2018 race for mayor. While technically nonpartisan, the mayoral race has been heated, fomenting partisan divisions among residents who disagree over how the city should move forward. The two candidates take starkly contrasting approaches to issues like the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the homelessness crisis and the city’s economy. Bronson has criticized Anchorage’s public health measures and restrictions on businesses and targeted Dunbar over the city’s handling of homelessness. Meanwhile, Dunbar has largely supported the city’s pandemic policies, saying that without them, more people would have died from COVID-19.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey’s order last month rescinding the mask mandate for schools inflamed and confused the debate over face coverings, as many parents incorrectly interpreted it as a “masks off” directive. Ducey’s action tossed the decision to school administrators, putting them in the driver’s seat on mask policy. For many, it has been a hot seat. “It’s been pretty wild,” said Deb Dillon, president of the Prescott Unified School District board. Prescott opted to make mask usage voluntary last month but reversed itself May 4 after a coronavirus outbreak. The Prescott meeting was orderly, in contrast to earlier events in southern Arizona, where anti-mask protesters crowded into lobbies outside the board meetings of the Vail and Tanque Verde districts, demanding to speak. Both meetings were canceled. The protesters at Vail held a mock election to appoint themselves school officials. That led to incorrect accounts that circulated nationwide that their complaints had scared the official board members into quitting. The Arizona School Boards Association issued a statement condemning actions that threaten school board members. “Too often this year they have been treated as faceless bureaucrats who are optimal targets to release rage and frustration over the circumstances of the pandemic,” the statement said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday formed a panel to come up with ways to spend the $1.5 billion the state is receiving from the latest federal coronavirus relief package. The Republican governor formed a 15-member steering committee for the state’s share of the $1.9 trillion relief measure that became law in March. Hutchinson formed a similar committee for the coronavirus relief money that was approved last year. The panel will be made up of eight Cabinet members and three members each from the state House and Senate. “We have to be methodical about this and not rushed,” Hutchinson told reporters. The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday issued broad guidance on how the relief funds can be spent. Hutchinson said he believed the priority for the state’s share of the relief spending should be capital investments, citing broadband and cybersecurity as two areas he’d like funded with the additional money. “It needs to be investments we can make that do not incur long-term spending and indebtedness of the state,” Hutchinson said. Because Arkansas’ unemployment rate is not significantly higher than its pre-pandemic level, the state is eligible to receive just half of its $1.5 billion allotment immediately, with the rest being provided one year later.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLong Beach: The city is offering tickets to the Aquarium of the Pacific as an incentive to overcome resistance to COVID-19 vaccinations. Long Beach will give two aquarium tickets to anyone receiving their first dose of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at city-run vaccination sites, the city said Tuesday. The offer runs through Saturday. “While we have made tremendous strides in vaccinating 60% of eligible Long Beach residents and 96% of our seniors, we know that vaccine hesitancy for some is real,” Mayor Robert Garcia said in a statement. “We are going to do everything we can to encourage folks to get vaccinated, and that includes incentives.” The Aquarium of the Pacific is one of the Los Angeles region’s major attractions, drawing about 1.7 million visitors annually. A regular adult general admission ticket costs $36.95. City Health and Human Services Director Kelly Colopy said the recent slowdown in vaccinations in California includes Long Beach, and officials are looking for innovative solutions.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Some health officials have warned that continued high numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations point to the pandemic not being over yet despite the state’s average infection rate decreasing by nearly a third since April. Colorado was averaging 1,731 newly confirmed coronavirus cases each day in late April – the most since Jan. 19 – but the numbers have fallen nearly every day since then, The Gazette reports. The state has averaged 1,182 newly confirmed cases over the past week, health officials said. “Colorado is heading in a positive direction again, and vaccination coverage is almost certainly playing a key role in this decline,” said Glen Mays, chair of the Colorado School of Public Health’s department of health systems. But Elizabeth Carlton, who also works for the department, said there are more worrying metrics, including hospitalizations. Carlton said the state was averaging about 100 new hospital admissions from COVID-19 daily since April 28, but that figure has risen to more than 650 as of Monday. Carlton said the metric means the “the number of people developing severe COVID-19 in Colorado doesn’t appear to be declining right now.” Some researchers said infection control efforts have fallen, and the time people spend away from home is rising, meaning current trends could continue.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Nursing home workers continue to struggle with severe staffing shortages, a lack of protective equipment and low pay during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released Monday, days before planned employee strikes across the state. The report also accuses nursing home owners of failing to follow federal guidance on the use of protective equipment and having inadequate infection control, testing and quarantine procedures during the pandemic. It alleges state officials haven’t done enough to oversee nursing homes and hold them accountable. The report, titled “We Were Abandoned: How Connecticut Failed Nursing Home Workers and Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic,” was written by Yale Law School students for the Service Employees International Union’s District 1199 New England, which represents about 5,000 nursing home workers in Connecticut. “These workers risk their lives and the lives of their loved ones back home to care for these residents in unsafe conditions and for low pay,” Yale student Aaron Bryce Lee said at a news conference Monday. “The state must make the financial investments necessary to improve compensation, benefits and staffing levels.” Workers at 33 nursing homes are ready to strike beginning Friday if demands for better wages, benefits and staffing aren’t met.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Delaware State University will cancel more than $700,000 in student debt for recent graduates who “faced financial hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the school announced Wednesday. The average eligible student will qualify for about $3,276 in debt relief, the school said. The funds, which will total $730,655, became available through the federal government’s latest coronavirus relief package. More than 200 students qualify, according to the university. A spokesperson for the school, Carlos Holmes, said most students should already know if they’ve qualified, but they can check with financial aid. School President Tony Allen said the debt reduction is consistent with the school’s initiatives to keep student debt manageable. “We haven’t raised our tuition in over six years; we issue every incoming student an iPad or a MacBook; we are replacing traditional textbooks with less expensive digital editions, and our Early College High School saves the average family of nearly $50,000 in college expenses,” he said in a statement. “Our students don’t just come here for a quality college experience. Most are trying to change the economic trajectory of their lives for themselves, their families, and their communities. Our responsibility is to do everything we can to put them on the path.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents face a Friday deadline to apply for a local program to help those who have fallen behind on their mortgage because of the pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. The Home Saver Program, offered by the D.C. Housing Finance Agency, has $4 million on the table to aid families in need, said Christopher Donald, executive director and CEO of the agency. “You’ve got to be a resident of the District of Columbia,” Donald said. “If they own a home here, and it’s their primary residence, and they’re behind on their mortgage, they’re either unemployed or underemployed, they can get up to 16 months of assistance, up to $60,000.” Money is also available through the Restore Program for people who have returned to work but need a boost to get out of the red. “The assistance does cover delinquent condo fees and HOA fees,” Donald said. The money comes in the form of a grant, so it doesn’t have to be paid back, and there is no income requirement to apply. Relief is also available for small landlords who have taken a financial hit during the pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nPensacola: Hot dogs, hamburgers, minor league baseball and COVID-19 shots are coming together. This week at Blue Wahoos Stadium, adult ticket buyers are eligible to receive the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at several games. The shots were distributed Tuesday and will also be available at games Saturday and Sunday. J&J’s vaccine requires only one dose. Shots will be available to eligible fans for free, with no appointment necessary. “The Blue Wahoos’ mission statement is to improve the quality of life in our community, so when we had the opportunity to partner with the Florida Department of Health, it was a no-brainer for us,” said Donna Kirby, the team’s vice president of operations. “We thought, ‘Absolutely.’ What great fun to have fans back for baseball, to be able to provide them with vaccinations if they so choose.” A total of 500 doses will be administered at the ballpark on a first-come, first-served basis. They will not be divvied up over the course of the three games, Kirby said, so there is a possibility that all 500 shots could be administered before the end of the three-game stretch. To get in the spirit, team President Jonathan Griffith will receive his shot during the seventh-inning stretch of Saturday’s game.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Twelve-year-old Jane Ellen Norman is looking forward to a little more freedom in her life and a possible return to summer camp after getting her first dose of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, one day after U.S. regulators expanded its use to children her age through 15. Georgia is one of the first states to open up the shots, Reuters reports. Being able to see her friends without staying far apart and worrying they might get sick was top of mind for Jane Ellen after her shot at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in downtown Atlanta. “I hope they all get vaccinated,” the sixth grader said. Jane Ellen’s mom, English Norman, said she scheduled an appointment for her daughter and 14-year-old son immediately after hearing about the FDA authorization. She said her kids have been good about wearing masks, washing their hands and staying socially distant, but they’ve still been very anxious about leaving the house. “I think it’s exciting that now their anxiety can start to lessen and they can feel safe,” she said. Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said Monday that the authorization brings the country “closer to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic.” For Jane Ellen, that means a chance to go back to her summer camp, which was canceled last year as the pandemic raged. “I’m excited to go there and see all my camp friends,” she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The chief executive of a company accused of defrauding banks of money meant to assist businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic pleaded not guilty Wednesday. Martin Kao, CEO of Martin Defense Group LLC, formerly known as Navatek LLC, is charged with bank fraud and money laundering. Authorities say he defrauded banks of more than $12.8 million through the Paycheck Protection Program, which Congress authorized to provide emergency financial assistance through forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and other expenses. Kao transferred more than $2 million into his own personal accounts, according to an indictment. Investigators talked to an executive and a former employee who said the company wasn’t affected by the pandemic, court documents said. Authorities describe his company as a “research, engineering, design, and innovations company that specializes in novel systems for the Department of Defense and other partners in academia and other scientific fields.” During a brief arraignment via telephone Wednesday, defense attorney Michael Green entered the not guilty plea on behalf of Kao.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state is moving into a new stage of Gov. Brad Little’s coronavirus reopening plans and lifting restrictions on the size of gatherings. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Dave Jeppesen made the announcement Tuesday, noting that the state’s health care system isn’t strained and that plenty of vaccine is available for interested residents. “Eighty-three percent of hospitals are operating as normal, and there’s no hospital in the state that has a resource limitation going on,” Jeppesen said during a news conference. In November and December, some hospitals were intermittently turning away people or sending them elsewhere because they didn’t have enough healthy staffers or available beds to admit them. In Stage 3 of the reopening plan, gatherings were supposed to be limited to 50 or fewer people, though political, religious, educational and health care events were exempt from the restriction. The current move to Stage 4 means there is no limit on gatherings, though public health officials are encouraging people to follow guidance from federal and local health agencies on how to gather safely. Face coverings are still recommended at times when physical distancing is difficult, and people and businesses should continue to follow physical distancing and sanitation recommendations, Jeppesen said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Capitalizing on the availability of vaccines, cabin fever and an imminent easing of pandemic restrictions, Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Wednesday launched a $6million advertising campaign to promote road-trip tourism and revive Illinois’ devastated hospitality industry. The “Time for Me to Drive” campaign makes use of a play on words from the 1978 song “Time for Me to Fly” by REO Speedwagon, a rock band that got its start in Champaign. The campaign will focus on attracting visitors from within Illinois and from surrounding states to hundreds of sites where they can enjoy Chicago architecture, southern Illinois wineries, hiking in state parks, restaurants throughout the state, and Springfield’s Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. “More and more travelers are ready to get back out there,” Pritzker said at a news conference at the presidential library. “Recent surveys show that half of Americans plan to travel this summer, and half of them intend to drive. ... After an incredibly difficult year in which the pandemic kept us all close to home and staying apart, lifesaving vaccines are bringing us back to life and heading toward a summer of fun and venturing out.” More than 60 potential driving itineraries are available online at enjoyillinois.com.\n\nIndiana\n\nFishers: The Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra is bringing back its popular Symphony on the Prairie performances, a year after the pandemic forced the cancellation of the long-running outdoor concert series. Officials announced Monday that this year’s Kroger Symphony on the Prairie season will begin June 25 with the symphony’s rendition of songs by the Beatles performed for an audience on the grassy lawn at suburban Indianapolis’ Conner Prairie. A series of other performances will be held throughout the summer at the venue in Fishers, just north of Indianapolis, with the last performances set for early September. Tickets go on sale May 24. This year’s concerts will be different after last year’s shows were canceled for the first time in the events’ 40-year history due to the threat that the coronavirus posed to musicians, staff and patrons. The symphony plans to sell only up to 4,000 tickets – or 50% of the venue’s capacity – for the first concerts to help patrons maintain social distance. The dance floor in front of the performance stage will also be closed, and there will be limits on table rentals and reserved seating. People will also have to wear masks when entering the venue, on pathways, in restrooms, and when they wait in line for food and drinks.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: Simpson College won’t require students, staff or faculty to get vaccinated before the fall semester, but it also plans to hold off on returning to normal campus operations until most have gotten their COVID-19 shots. The college’s crisis management team, led by Heidi Levine, vice president for student development and planning, and Simpson President Marsha Kelliher’s leadership cabinet, announced the decision on the college’s online COVID-19 dashboard last week. According to the announcement, the team hopes to see 80% of the campus community vaccinated before transitioning to a “Green” operating phase, but it also plans to strongly encourage everyone on campus to get vaccinated. Some colleges across the country have recently announced vaccine requirements, “but that is still the minority of colleges,” Levine said, adding that Grinnell College is the only Iowa college of which she’s aware that plans to require students to be inoculated by August. Grinnell College officials announced the requirement last month but said students will be able to request an exemption for medical or religious reasons.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: The families of 16 students have sued two suburban Kansas City school districts, arguing their children should be allowed to attend school during the pandemic without wearing masks. “The parents are terribly, terribly upset. There’s a groundswell of dissatisfaction,” said their attorney, Linus Baker. The Kansas City Star reports the lawsuit against the Blue Valley and Olathe school districts in Johnson County argues students should be granted individual exemptions to mask mandates. The parents contend masks are interfering with their children’s ability to learn. Districts offer medical exemptions, generally for students with special needs or disabilities. They also relax mask rules for students during some sports and other activities. Two parents already have medical exemptions but are suing to seek reimbursement for the costs to obtain them. Both districts have fielded challenges since the Legislature passed a bill that empowers parents to fight COVID-19 restrictions. But their school boards have so far upheld their mask mandates. District officials have argued that the mandates cannot be repealed under the new law because they were enacted last summer. The law requires individuals to contest them within 30 days.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state government will receive more than $2.1 billion from the latest round of federal coronavirus aid – a smaller-than-projected amount due to the commonwealth’s improving economic performance, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. The U.S. Treasury announced state allocations based on a formula that included each state’s share of the nation’s unemployed from October through December 2020, Beshear said. Kentucky performed better than expected during that period, he said. As a result, its allotment will be $2.18 billion, down from an initial estimate that state government would receive $2.44 billion, he said. “In other words, Kentucky has recovered stronger than the federal government anticipated, faster than most, and it impacted a little bit on the dollars that will be available to us,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. Beshear has pointed to a recent series of upbeat economic developments – from record sales tax collections to a credit rating agency’s upgraded assessment of the state’s financial outlook – in touting Kentucky’s prospects as more people get COVID-19 vaccines. He has used the economic news to try to deflect criticism from some prominent Republicans calling for a much faster pace in lifting remaining virus restrictions.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: New research being done at LSU Health Shreveport offers an up-close view of how SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, can spread to the brain. The study helps explain the alarming array of neurological symptoms reported in some patients with COVID-19 and reveals clues as to why some patients suffer severe neurological effects, while others experience none at all. The researchers, working with colleagues at Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha in Spain, report evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can infect both neurons, the nerve cells that power the brain, and astrocytes, the cells in the brain and spinal cord that support and protect neurons. “Our findings suggest that astrocytes are a pathway through which COVID-19 causes neurological damage,” said Dr. Ricardo Costa, a postdoctoral fellow at LSU Health Shreveport and the study’s first author. “This could explain many of the neurologic symptoms we see in COVID-19 patients, which include loss of sense of smell and taste, disorientation, psychosis and stroke.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state is rolling out free fishing licenses, baseball tickets and L.L. Bean gift cards to encourage more residents to get vaccinated before the end of the month, Gov. Janet Mills announced Tuesday. The Democratic governor unveiled the public-private program, “Your Shot to Get Outdoors,” during a virtual discussion President Joe Biden hosted with several governors. The items include up to 5,000 hunting licenses, fishing licenses, Maine Wildlife Park day passes and state park day passes, along with up to 10,000 $20 L.L. Bean gift cards and up to 5,000 Portland Sea Dog tickets and passes for Oxford Plains Speedway. “Whether you’re an angler or a hunter, a baseball fan or a racing fan, or someone who just all-around enjoys being outside, now is a great time to protect yourself from COVID-19 and take to the outdoors,” Mills said. The program led by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services comes as the number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered dipped to less than 63,000 last week, down from a peak of more than 125,000 doses in the first week that eligibility opened to all adults. The state hopes the new program along with federal approval of a COVID-19 vaccine for younger teenagers will encourage more vaccinations.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Seeking a big comeback after a pandemic-decimated 2020, city officials are hoping a new ad campaign will remind Americans of just why they love visiting the resort for summer vacation. About this time last year, Ocean City was reopening its hotels, beach and Boardwalk after COVID-19 forced closures. Despite reopening for the 2020 summer season, the pandemic wreaked havoc on Ocean City, causing businesses and the town to lose millions. This May, hotels, as well as the beach and Boardwalk, are all open, and “the pathway to the summer much brighter than it was last year,” Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan said. This year’s ads offer a relatively traditional message, reminding viewers of the memories they’ve made at the beach and encouraging them to come make new ones. In one commercial, heartfelt music plays as a narrator reminds viewers that the 10 miles of beach in Ocean City aren’t “just made of sand and water; it’s made of memories.” That message has been carefully crafted since the end of last year, said Jessica Waters, the city’s acting tourism director. The two ads, “10 Miles of Memories” and “Ocean Calling,” were developed to focus on the “simple moments” and memories people create at the beach.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: While there was a slight increase in the overall number of confirmed and suspected opioid-related drug overdose deaths in the state in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, overdose deaths among Black men soared by almost 70%, health officials said Wednesday. There were 2,104 confirmed and suspected opioid-related overdose deaths in the state last year, a 5% increase over the prior year, according to a report from the Department of Public Health. Among Black, non-Hispanic males, the confirmed opioid-related overdose death rate increased 69%, from 32.6 to 55.1 per 100,000 people – the highest increase of any ethnic or racial group in 2020. “The disparities in overdose trends among Black men underscore the need to continue our public health-centered, data-driven approach to the opioid epidemic that is disproportionately impacting high-risk, high-need priority populations,” Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel said. Battling opioid use was complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, but Massachusetts is among the states with the smallest increases in all drug overdose deaths last year, officials said. “Both the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid epidemic have underscored the importance of supporting disproportionately impacted communities,” Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Health officials on Wednesday urged primary care physicians to enroll to administer COVID-19 vaccines, as the state prepared to quickly begin vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds following U.S. authorization. “The most important thing we can do right now is to make vaccines available for whenever someone is ready,” Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive and chief health deputy, said during a news conference. “We know that patients trust their doctors, and when they are ready to get vaccinated, we want you to have vaccine on hand.” She encouraged doctors to check whether their patients have been vaccinated and ask if they have any questions. About 55% of Michigan residents ages 16 and older have been inoculated. The push to make doses available in physicians’ offices will complement the state’s focus on taking mobile clinics to places such as churches and vaccinating people who are homebound. Dr. Srikar Reddy, president-elect of the Michigan Academy of Family Physicians, said it is time to shift attention to residents who are hesitant about the vaccine and to the newly eligible children. “It only makes sense to visit your family physician to get vaccinated and to get your teenager vaccinated, too,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state government will get about $200 million more than it was expecting under President Joe Biden’s coronavirus relief package, and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz expressed hope Monday that new guidelines for how states can spend the aid might help speed up the slow pace of negotiations over Minnesota’s next budget. The legislative session is due to adjourn next Monday, but the governor and leaders of the divided Legislature have yet to agree on target numbers for a dozen broad spending bills at the core of the state’s next two-year budget, which is expected to come in at about $50 billion. Walz told reporters that at least they now know how Minnesota can and can’t spend its $2.8 billion in federal relief. “The clarification from Treasury is huge,” he said. “That’s what we’ve been waiting on.” Republican leaders said the new federal guidance clears the way for Minnesota to exempt Paycheck Protection Program loans and extended unemployment insurance benefits from state taxes, which have been GOP priorities this session. Democrats have sought to cap the PPP exemption so that larger, profitable companies would pay taxes on forgiven loans.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state will stop accepting supplemental unemployment benefits from the federal government next month, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday. Reeves said the weekly supplement of $300 per person was intended to help people “who are unemployed through no fault of their own” because of the coronavirus pandemic. “After many conversations over the last several weeks with Mississippi small business owners and their employees, it has become clear that the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and other like programs passed by the Congress may have been necessary in May of last year but are no longer so in May of this year,” Reeves wrote on Facebook. He said he’s directed the Mississippi Department of Employment Security to tell the federal government that the state will opt out of the additional federal unemployment benefits June 12, the earliest date allowed by federal law. Without the federal supplement, the maximum weekly unemployment benefit in Mississippi is $235, according to the department. “It has become clear to me that we cannot have a full economic recovery until we get the thousands of available jobs in our state filled,” Reeves wrote. A 40-hour-per-week job at the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour would pay $290 a week before taxes are taken out.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State lawmakers pushed back Wednesday against local coronavirus restrictions, passing legislation limiting the duration of public health orders that have shut down businesses and schools and limited how many people can gather. The legislation would limit emergency orders restricting businesses, churches, schools or gatherings to 30 days, unless extended by the local governing body. It would take effect immediately upon Gov. Mike Parson’s signature, meaning it could affect pandemic restrictions still in place in St. Louis County or other jurisdictions. It also would affect any future local health orders. “We want to be able to get this enforced as soon as possible,” said House Speaker Pro Tem John Wiemann, R-O’Fallon, who handled the bill. The House and Senate passed the legislation by overwhelming votes and with little discussion. Lawmakers have complained repeatedly during this year’s session about local pandemic restrictions that they say infringe on individual liberties and the ability to earn a living. The bill would allow local governing bodies to halt public health orders at any time by a majority vote. It also would prohibit cities and counties that receive public funds from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to use public accommodations or transportation systems.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is sharing COVID-19 vaccines with Canadian truck drivers from neighboring Alberta. About 2,000 truck drivers from the province who transport goods from Canada to the U.S. are eligible to be vaccinated at a highway rest stop near Conrad through May 23, according to a memorandum of understanding signed between the state and the Canadian province. “By working together and taking this critical action, we keep our trade channels open between Montana and Alberta,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a statement. The border between Canada and the U.S. has been closed to all but essential traffic since last spring. “Alberta depends on trade with our American neighbors and this program will ensure our goods get to market while stopping the spike of COVID-19,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said in a statement. The province has reported record numbers of new COVID-19 cases this month. A similar program to vaccinate truck drivers from Canada began in North Dakota last month. The announcement came after the Blackfeet tribe in northern Montana gave about 1,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to their relatives and neighbors across the border last month.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A sweeping bill that would shield businesses and local governments from coronavirus-related lawsuits won initial approval from state lawmakers Tuesday, despite complaints that senators haven’t done enough for workers who were at risk. Lawmakers advanced the proposal, 39-3, through the first of three required votes. The measure would bar pandemic-related lawsuits against businesses or governments as long as they were following federal public health guidelines. At least 29 other states have enacted laws addressing the issue, including 12 that are similar to the Nebraska proposal, said state Sen. Tom Briese, of Albion, the measure’s sponsor. He said Nebraska businesses face the threat of “needless, unwarranted” lawsuits from the pandemic if lawmakers don’t pass legal protections. The proposal has strong backing from Nebraska businesses, hospitals, schools, counties and cities. Organizations representing Nebraska trial attorneys and public school teachers opposed it. Some senators also criticized the bill because they said lawmakers haven’t done enough to help on-the-ground workers who faced the pandemic directly, risking their own health. Lawmakers this year have rejected paid sick-leave requirements for businesses and additional coronavirus protections for meatpacking workers.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Gambling giant MGM Resorts International on Wednesday joined a growing number of Las Vegas Strip casinos with state regulatory approval to open casino floors at 100% capacity and no person-to-person distancing requirement. The company said the Nevada Gaming Control Board granted its waiver for nine properties based on its workforce vaccination rate. “We will continue working to vaccinate as many people as possible and remain vigilant with health and safety protocols,” company CEO & President Bill Hornbuckle said in a statement. Approval applies to casino floors at the Bellagio, ARIA, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, Mirage, New York-New York, Luxor, Excalibur and Park MGM. Three-foot distancing and 80% occupancy restrictions remain at restaurants, swimming pools and other non-gambling areas. Masks are still required. Clark County lawmakers with jurisdiction over Las Vegas-area businesses have approved plans to allow 100% occupancy once 60% of eligible county residents get a vaccine shot. As of Tuesday, the figure was 47%. Southern Nevada Health District Chief Health Officer Dr. Fermin Leguen said the county might not reach the threshold by June 1, given lagging demand.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The Prouty, an annual event to raise money for cancer research, is allowing some in-person participation this year, its 40th, after going virtual last summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Prouty combines cycling, walking and other events to raise funds for the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Norris Cotton Cancer Center. This year, in-person options include golf July 9 in Grantham, a 20-mile cycle July 10 in Hanover and a 5K walk July 11 in Hanover. Designated start times will be assigned to small groups to meet capacity restrictions. Local health guidelines and enhanced safety protocols will be followed. People can participate in activities virtually between June 1 and July 10. “The Prouty has always been about hope, and this year’s hybrid model is a stepping stone to a return to normalcy from the pandemic,” said Jacklynn Rodriguez, executive director for the Friends of the Norris Cotton Cancer Center. Since its inception in 1982, The Prouty has raised more than $50 million to support cancer research and patient and family support services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Brunswick: For the second year in a row, Rutgers University will host virtual commencement ceremonies for graduates of its New Brunswick, Newark and Camden campuses. However, the school announced Tuesday that it will commend the graduates of 2020 and 2021 with in-person celebrations this fall. A notice on the university’s website asks students to save dates for their campus’s events: Rutgers New Brunswick and Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences on Oct. 22-23, Rutgers Newark on Nov. 8-10 and Rutgers Camden on Dec. 1-4. “While we had hoped to bring you together sooner, the continuing public health emergency associated with the pandemic prevented us until now,” said a statement signed by University President Jonathan Holloway and each school’s chancellor. Details on the events will be posted to the university’s website at a later date. “We are excited that Rutgers will have the opportunity this fall to bring you together in person and salute you for your accomplishments,” the announcement said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A year after holding only drive-thru graduations, the school district for the state’s second most populous city has scheduled in-person graduation ceremonies at the district’s soccer stadium for its six high schools over two days later this month. Las Cruces Public Schools scheduled ceremonies May 21 for Onate and Mayfield high schools and Arrowhead Park Early College High School and on May 22 for Las Cruces and Centennial high schools and Rio Grande Preparatory Institute. Each graduating senior can invite up to 16 ticketed people, with the limit set due to the COVID-19 pandemic plus construction-related traffic in the area of the Field of Dreams stadium. Social distancing and mask-wearing will be required for all attendees while inside the venue. “I do want to thank all the graduates for their continuous resilience throughout this whole pandemic and really doing the best that they can,” interim Superintendent Ralph Ramos said. “We want to have this ceremony.” Ramos said the district is looking into ways to celebrate the class of 2020, which didn’t have a normal graduation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State regulators will soon draft rules that will require employers to protect workers from airborne infectious disease. A new state law tasks state labor and health officials with coming up with minimum workplace standards around things like the availability of personal protective equipment, social distancing and quarantine requirements. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law last week. Employers will have to come up with safety plans that comply with the yet-to-be written state standards and provide them to workers. Employers who don’t comply could face fines. Workers could also sue for up to $20,000 from employers who don’t follow safety standards or retaliate against workers for reporting noncompliance. The law was intended to help people like Maritza Ovalles, who has worked in the nail salon industry for over two decades but left her job when the COVID-19 pandemic struck and left her exposed in a workplace that she said lacked adequate health and safety protections. “When the pandemic began, the level of risk of not having proper protections was life or death,” said Ovalles, who advocates for better working conditions as a member of the NY Nail Salon Workers Association.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Public health officials across Western North Carolina are asking the public to get involved as they work to identify the most pressing health needs for the next three years, such as impacts from COVID-19, cancer or infant mortality. National research firm PRC will conduct phone surveys with 300 Buncombe County residents through June, a confidential survey asking about residents’ health status, behaviors and experiences, according to a statement announcing the start of data collection. The 20-minute surveys will go to randomly selected households, but even folks who don’t get the call can take the survey online at www.buncombecounty.org/publichealth. Buncombe County Public Health Director Stacie Saunders urged residents to take part. “If you receive the call to participate, please do lend your voice to the survey,” she said in the release. “This is your opportunity to help us identify health priorities in our community.” Buncombe is joining 17 other counties this year in the regional community health assessment, WNC Healthy Impact, a collaboration with hospital organizations, public health departments and other community partners.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The United Tribes Technical College International Powwow and associated events will return late this summer after a year’s hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the Tribal Leaders Summit that’s traditionally held at the Bismarck Event Center before the outdoor powwow has been called off for a second year. The Bismarck Tribune reports this year’s powwow will be the weekend of Sept. 10-12, starting with the grand entry Friday night and continuing through Sunday. Associated events will include Powwow Youth Day that Friday, a golf tournament Friday, a three-day softball tournament and a three-day youth basketball tournament beginning Friday, and the Powwow Thunderbird Run on Saturday. The powwow put on by the five American Indian tribes in North Dakota typically brings about 10,000 people to Bismarck and boosts the area economy by more than $4 million, according to the college. It attracts dancers from dozens of tribes across the U.S. and Canada and awards more than $100,000 in prize money. It’s considered one of the top powwows in the nation. United Tribes uses proceeds to fund student scholarships.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: State lawmakers have passed changes to ensure that if Kroger is allowed to sell flowers during a pandemic, the local florist can, too. Senate Bill 134, also known as the Business Fairness Act, passed the Ohio Senate 31-0 on Wednesday. The measure would prevent Gov. Mike DeWine’s administration from closing small businesses while their larger competitors remain open, assuming everyone can follow the same safety guidelines. “I would argue you are safer in a small business where you may be the only customer in that business at that time,” Sen. George Lang, R-West Chester, said on the floor Wednesday. The disparity came to light in March 2020 when DeWine’s state health department closed a slew of businesses to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but allowed groceries, pharmacies and other businesses to remain open. The result: Wal-Mart and Kroger stayed open, while the local jeweler had to close. “The playing field must be level,” said Chris Ferruso, a lobbyist for Ohio’s National Federation of Independent Business. “The government should not be picking winners and losers.” And small businesses were among the losers last year. A survey of National Federation of Independent Business members found 1 in 3 closed because of COVID-19 orders.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A new state law that creates a sales tax exemption for the University Hospitals Authority and Trust will grant OU Health funding to train more medical professionals. The law recently approved by the Legislature and Gov. Kevin Stitt restores a sales tax exemption that will allow the health system to train 160 additional nursing graduates and nurse practitioners annually and 70 additional medical residents within three years. State lawmakers and University of Oklahoma officials said the law will help address Oklahoma’s nurse and physician shortage and improve medical care across the state. Oklahoma has 40% fewer nurses per capita than the national average, said OU College of Nursing Dean Julie Hoff. “These nurses will soon be on the front lines of health care, allowing our facilities to increase their staffing levels and making it easier for everyone in the state to get the care they need,” she said. The state is 46th in the nation for physicians per capita, OU President Joseph Harroz Jr. said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown on Tuesday announced statewide and county COVID-19 vaccination targets, with the hope of reopening the state’s economy. Most statewide restrictions will be lifted when 70% of residents 16 and older receive their first vaccine dose, Brown said. In addition, counties will be eligible to move into the “lower risk” category when 65% of the area’s eligible population is vaccinated. “We still have some work to do to reach our 70% goal, but I am confident we can get there in June and return Oregon to a sense of normalcy,” Brown said. “We each play a part.” Currently, more than half the state’s eligible population has received a first dose. “For the first time since the start of the pandemic, we’ll be able to say the virus no longer controls the timelines in our lives – we will if enough Oregonians make the choice to get vaccinated,” said Pat Allen, the Oregon Health Authority’s director. Counties with 65% of their 16-and-up population inoculated will be eligible for the “lower risk” category, which permits indoor gatherings of 10 people or outdoor gatherings of 12 people. Restaurants, gyms and indoor and outdoor entertainment can open up to 50% capacity. Benton and Hood River counties have already vaccinated more than 65% of adult residents and are ready to move to the lower risk category May 21, unless they opt out.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is allowing more people at indoor and outdoor events. Beginning Monday, occupancy limits will be increased to 50% of capacity for indoor events, up from 25%, and to 75% for outdoor events, up from 50%. “As more Pennsylvania adults get vaccinated and guidance from the CDC evolves, we can continue to move forward with the commonwealth’s reopening efforts,” Gov. Tom Wolf said in a statement Tuesday. The state has previously announced that nearly all pandemic restrictions will go away on Memorial Day, including capacity limits on bars, restaurants and other businesses, as well as indoor and outdoor event gathering limits. The state’s mask mandate will remain until 75% of adults are fully vaccinated. Statewide, about 45.6% of people 18 and older had been fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Philadelphia, meanwhile, city officials announced pandemic restrictions will be eased beginning later this month and will go away almost entirely June 11. Starting May 21, retail stores and offices will no longer have to operate at reduced capacity, and the city is lifting its rule that bars and restaurants can only serve alcohol with food. Capacity limits on gyms, exercise classes and theaters will be eased, as well as for catered events.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: With no baseball team in town, McCoy Stadium is being put to good use with the opening of a vaccination clinic at the site on Wednesdays. The drive-up, walk-up site will be open every Wednesday from 5 p.m. until 8 p.m., according to a statement from the city. Residents can make an appointment for a COVID-19 shot at the state’s vaccine signup portal, but people without an appointment are also welcome and encouraged, city officials said. The goal is to make getting vaccinations as convenient as possible. “We want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to get a vaccine,” Pawtucket Public Health and Equity Leader Elizabeth Moreira said. “We believe that opening this site gives everyone another great option for vaccination appointments later on in the day.” The clinic will be run in partnership with the Rhode Island National Guard and Rhode Island Medical Reserve Corps Disaster Medical Assistance Team. The coronavirus testing site at the stadium will continue operating.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s public schools chief on Wednesday said the governor had no legal basis for allowing parents to opt their children out of wearing masks in schools, writing that Gov. Henry McMaster is “inciting hysteria and sowing division” as the school year ends. In guidance sent to state education superintendents Wednesday, education officials said the agency could find “no legal grounds” for the governor to set aside a policy instituted by another constitutional officer, under his or her own powers and not due to an emergency declaration. On Tuesday, the Republican governor issued an executive order letting parents opt their children out of wearing masks in public schools, citing widespread COVID-19 vaccine access for adults across the state. In response, education officials said state Superintendent Molly Spearman had opted to rescind a face-covering policy, with the exception of a federally instituted school bus mask mandate, “rather than wage a debate over constitutionality that would pit elected officials, students, and families against one another.” Guidance had required that students, teachers and staff wear face coverings while entering school buildings, moving through hallways and other instances where social distancing is not possible or optimal.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The South Dakota Department of Health said Wednesday that the state has crossed the 50% threshold for the percentage of adults fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Health officials say more than 304,000 residents have received their shots. “I want to take this opportunity to thank all South Dakotans who have chosen to get their COVID-19 vaccine– protecting themselves, their family and their community,” Secretary of Health Kim Malsam-Rysdon said. “Vaccines are safe and are the quickest way out of this pandemic.” State health officials began Phase 2 of South Dakota’s vaccination plan April 5. It made vaccines available to all residents age 16 and older, in addition to any eligible person who had not been inoculated in the first phase. Parents, schools and vaccine clinics are rushing to begin inoculating younger children after U.S. regulators this week endorsed Pfizer’s vaccine for those as young as 12, a decision seen as a breakthrough in allowing classroom instruction to resume safely around the country. A handful of cities started offering shots to children ages 12 to 15 less than a day after the Food and Drug Administration gave the vaccine emergency use authorization for that age group.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: As she oversees the state’s response to the pandemic, Dr. Lisa Piercey knows getting back to normal may hinge on her ability to convince Christians and conservatives to get vaccinated. Piercey, 43, Tennessee’s top health official, is navigating a crisis of vaccine hesitancy that runs rampant in the rural swathes of the Volunteer State. “Being the hands and feet of Jesus is the way to go,” said Piercey, a 2019 appointee of Gov. Bill Lee. “They might not do it for themselves, but they should do it to help other people.” She said her office is unleashing a media campaign aimed partly at the people who are most hesitant, and she is reaching out to faith leaders to convince those residents on the virtues of vaccination. “It’s their pastor they trust,” Piercey said. And she’s confident the approach will work because she is one of them. An evangelical Christian farm girl from West Tennessee, Piercey said she doesn’t believe in evolution and struggles with the timelines of dinosaurs and man, but she still wears a mask around other people and has strict vaccination rules in her family. On May 20, the mother of four’s triplets will turn 16. “On that morning, they will get the vaccine first and their driver’s licenses second,” Piercey said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: With the coronavirus pandemic not yet licked, some activities will look a little different again this summer, including dips in the city’s beloved, “68-degrees-year-round” watering hole, Barton Springs Pool. Starting later this month, anyone planning a swim at Barton Springs will need to make an advance reservation online. Two-hour time slots will help the pool “to manage capacity for the safety of staff and guests,” according to the city’s website. Those who have purchased a season pass, are older than 80, are city employees, or are veterans or active military members will be allowed to enter the pool without a reservation, but that won’t apply to anyone accompanying them. At this time, Barton Springs Pool is not accepting group reservations. Reservations can be made on a city website. A reservation fee will cost Austin residents $2 if they’re between 1 and 11 years old, $3 for those 12-17, $5 for all adults and $2 for anyone over 61. For nonresidents, it’s $4 for those 1-11, $5 for those 12-17, $9 for all adults and $5 for anyone over 61. All payments must be completed online ahead of time. Those with a seasonal swim pass will also not need to reserve a spot ahead of time before visiting Barton Springs. Passes went on sale earlier this week.\n\nUtah\n\nRoy: A resident has said a hacker stole her personal information and swapped out her banking information to steal about $400 of weekly unemployment benefits. “I feel like being robbed at gunpoint would’ve been better than what’s going to happen now,” said Heidi Howell, who lost her job in March and had her identity and unemployment check stolen. Howell told KUTV-TV that she is now waiting to find out if she can still claim the unemployment check. She also froze her credit reports, filed a police report and changed her bank account numbers. Kevin Burt, director of the Utah Unemployment Insurance Division, said this is the first case he’s seen among 450,000 people seeking benefits in the state during the coronavirus pandemic. He believes the hacker got her login information from another website. “Make sure that you have a secure password,” Burt said. “I think that helps quite a bit – that’s different than your other passwords that you use for more casual online interactions.” Howell said she used a unique password and is not sure how someone gained access. Burt said the state has not seen much of a rise in hacks to the unemployment system, although fraud is up nationwide because of the historic volume of claims being filed.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A community group of members of the state’s minority populations is working to make sure as many of those residents as possible are vaccinated against COVID-19. The Vermont Health Equity Initiative said it will be providing vaccinations for those who are Black, indigenous and people of color through July 10. Clinics are being offered with support from the Vermont Department of Health and the City of Burlington. So far, the initiative has collaborated to deliver more than 2,800 total doses of the vaccine. The group said that as of Monday, about 70% of white, non-Hispanic Vermonters in Chittenden County had received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 58% of minority members had received at least one dose. The clinics were established in an effort to close the racial gap in vaccinations to protect the larger community and in response to the city of Burlington’s declaration of racism as a public health emergency in July 2020. “We’re offering an in-person experience that has been missing for vaccinations for these members of our community,” said Belan Antensaye of the Racial, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Department of the city of Burlington and the Vermont Professionals of Color Network.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Restaurants and drinking establishments will be able to seat up to 100 patrons indoors and a maximum of 250 guests outdoors starting May 15, Gov. Ralph Northam recently announced, but establishments say they may not be able to accommodate more guests due to a shortage in workers. Eric Terry, president of the Virginia Restaurant, Lodging & Travel Association, estimated about 100 Richmond restaurants closed in 2020 but said there have been minimal closures this year. Many restaurants are likely nearing 80% of their pre-pandemic revenue levels, according to Terry. While full recovery for the industry is underway, Terry said the biggest revenue factor is a restricted labor force. “I was on the phone yesterday with two restaurant operators who said they are having to close two days a week because they can’t get enough staff,” he said. The new limit will double the number of indoor guests allowed as of April 1. Restaurants may return to selling alcohol past midnight, and dining room closures between midnight and 5 a.m. will no longer be required. Northam has said all restrictions will be lifted June 15 if the number of new COVID-19 cases remains low and vaccinations rise. But restaurants with limited staff will not be able to accommodate diners at full capacity, Terry said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities say schools in the state won’t consider a requirement to mandate COVID-19 vaccines in schoolchildren until a vaccine is fully approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA on Monday signed off on emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds. The state’s secretary of health, Umair Shah, said Tuesday that more than 370,000 Washington teens and adolescents are in that age group. Vaccines undergo rigorous review before they’re fully approved, but the FDA can allow use under so-called emergency use authorization in instances when vaccines meet certain criteria and there are no approved alternatives. The Seattle Times reports that until a COVID-19 vaccine is formally approved, officials from the Washington State Board of Health – the board that oversees state vaccine policies – say they won’t consider adding it to the list of required immunizations. “The board would not require a COVID-19 vaccine for school entry until it’s approved by the FDA and recommended by Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices,” Kelie Kahler, spokesperson for the board, wrote in an email, referring to a committee housed within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that sets national vaccine guidance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin is joining first lady Jill Biden and actor Jennifer Garner during a visit to the state Thursday. Biden’s office announced Wednesday that she and Manchin will arrive at Yeager Airport in Charleston before joining Garner at a COVID-19 vaccination center and delivering remarks at Capital High School. A previously announced visit to Arnoldsburg Elementary School in Calhoun County has been scrubbed due to a coronavirus quarantine in the school district. Biden and Manchin will then visit with members of the West Virginia National Guard and their families at the airport before departing, the first lady’s office said in a statement. Garner grew up in Charleston. She has previously testified before Congress in support of education programs for preschoolers in poverty.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Native Americans are struggling to overcome increased drug abuse related to the COVID-19 pandemic, a tribal leader said in the annual State of the Tribes address. Speaking to Assembly lawmakers at the state Capitol on Tuesday afternoon, Lac du Flambeau President John Johnson Sr. said increased drug abuse has claimed those most vulnerable during the public health crisis. “The flow of drugs into the Northwoods has escalated during the pandemic, as mental health, economic and social challenges exert growing pressure on our people and families,” Johnson said. He said Gov. Tony Evers’ budget proposal for a regional mental health center in northern Wisconsin is “a crucial building block and a foundation of dismantling the scourge of drugs,” Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Evers has proposed investing more than $150 million in mental health services, including more than $25 million over the next two years for regional crisis centers, training and other services. Republican state lawmakers have stripped hundreds of proposals from the governor’s budget. Johnson also said tribes continue to face harassment and racism as they defend their federal treaty rights to hunt, fish and gather. He specifically highlighted harassment of those spearfishing in northern Wisconsin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The governor has announced that the state will end its participation in federal supplemental benefits intended to address high unemployment across the U.S. caused by the pandemic. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon said Tuesday that the decision will end the weekly $300 payments starting June 19 and no longer expand eligibility to people who previously could not collect benefits, such as self-employed residents, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Wyoming Department of Workforce Services reported last month that the unemployment rate in the state was 5.3% in March – below the national 6% rate. “Wyoming needs workers; our businesses are raring to go,” Gordon said. “I recognize the challenges facing Wyoming employers, and I believe it’s critical for us to do what we can to encourage more hiring.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/13"}]}

Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThe most decorated gymnast of all time, Biles is appearing in her third career Olympic Games in Paris, and is doing so while already making some history — with more potentially to come.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Biles, including her age, oldest American female gymnasts and more heading into the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nSimone Biles age\n\nBiles heads into the 2024 Paris Olympics at 27 years old, making her the oldest woman to compete for American gymnastics on that stage since the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. That year, the U.S. had four athletes over the age of 27, with Marie Margaret Hoesly being the oldest at 35 years old.\n\n\"I knew I wasn't done after the performances in Tokyo so just getting back in the gym, working hard and trusting the process with (coaches Cecile and Laurent Landi), I knew I'd be back,\" Biles told NBC after qualifying for Paris at the U.S. Olympic trials.\n\nIt is the third Olympic Games in which Biles will be competing, which adds her to an exclusive list of U.S. female gymnasts. As noted by NBCOlympics.com, Biles is just the fourth-ever American woman to make three Olympic gymnastics teams, joining Muriel Davis Grossfeld, Linda Metheny and Dominique Dawes.\n\nIt's an impressive feat for Biles, as gymnastics is a sport that typically sees younger athletes dominate. For example, the last three individual all-around gold medalists — Suni Lee in 2021, Biles in 2016 and Gabby Douglas in 2012 — were 18, 19 and 16 years old, respectively.\n\nThat isn't the only historical mark Biles can meet at the Paris Olympics. While she is the likely the favorite to win the women's individual all-around event heading into Paris, if Biles is able to come out with a gold medal in the event, she will become the oldest women's gymnast to win the event in 72 years.\n\nWith two gold medal finishes in Paris, Biles would also break Anton Heida's record for the most Olympic gold medals won by an American gymnast, men's or women's. Heida has five medals, all won in the 1904 St. Louis Olympics; Biles currently holds four gold medals, all coming at the 2016 Rio Games.\n\nClick here to see the other marks that the 27-year-old Biles can meet with wins in Paris.\n\nOldest U.S. Olympians in women's gymnastics history\n\nBiles is the oldest American gymnast to qualify for the Olympics since 1952, but is the fifth-oldest American gymnast to ever compete in the Olympics, behind Hoesly, Dorothy Dalton, Meta Elste-Neumann and Marian Barone.\n\nHere's the full list of the oldest women gymnasts to compete in the Olympics for Team USA:\n\nAge at the time of Olympics\n\n1.

It marked the first time since Lyudmila Tourischeva at the 1974 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships that a gymnast won four gold medals in a single international competition.\n\nHere's a full breakout of how Biles finished in each of her events at the 2016 Rio Olympics:\n\nTeam All-Around: Gold\n\nGold Individual All-Around: Gold\n\nGold Horse Vault: Gold\n\nGold Floor Exercise: Gold\n\nGold Balance Beam: Bronze\n\nBronze Uneven Bars: No. 14\n\nREQUIRED READING:Simone Biles earned this US Olympic gymnastics team spot, and she deserves this happiness\n\nSimone Biles, USA Gymnastics Olympic schedule\n\nBiles and Team USA will open up Olympic competition on Sunday, July 28 with the women's team all-around qualification.

Her decision ignited a wide-ranging, occasionally intense public conversation around mental health and how it affects elite, seemingly unflappable athletes.\n\nAs Biles prepares for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, the third Olympics of her decorated career, here’s a look back at her experience at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, why she withdrew from the competition and what she can expect from the 2024 games:\n\nWhy did Simone Biles withdraw from the 2020 Olympics?\n\nAfter her dominant performance at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in which she won four gold medals, including in the all-around, Biles entered the 2020 Tokyo Olympics not only as a favorite to replicate those feats, but as one of the most famous faces and biggest stars of the entire Olympics, at least from an American perspective. Questions loomed about whether she could even surpass what she had done five years earlier and win a record five gold medals in at a single Olympics.\n\nUltimately, she found herself in the headlines, but for entirely unexpected reasons.\n\nBiles’ difficulties began in the team competition. During an Amanar vault, Biles balked while in mid-air, doing only 1.5 twists instead of the customary 2.5 and nearly falling to the mat on her landing.\n\nThose at the event immediately noticed something didn’t appear to be right, with NBC analyst Nastia Liukin, herself a former Olympic all-around champion, noting that “it looked like she got almost lost in the air” while executing the move. Biles had experienced a similar problem during warmups for the team final.\n\nAfter the snafu, Biles left the competition floor and eventually withdrew from the team finals. Even without Biles, the United States won a silver medal, getting edged out by the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) for the gold.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, USA Gymnastics said Biles pulled out due to a “medical issue” and would be “assessed daily to determine medical clearance for future competitions.” Following the event, Biles said she was not physically injured, but was prioritizing her mental health and trying to ensure that a diminished version of herself didn’t jeopardize her team’s chance at medaling.\n\n“After the performance I did, I just didn't want to go on,\" Biles said at the time. \"I have to focus on my mental health. I just think mental health is more prevalent in sports right now. We have to protect our minds and our bodies and not just go out and do what the world wants us to do. I don't trust myself as much anymore. Maybe it's getting older. There were a couple of days when everybody tweets you and you feel the weight of the world.\n\n\"We're not just athletes. We're people at the end of the day and sometimes you just have to step back. I didn't want to go out and do something stupid and get hurt. ​I feel like a lot of athletes speaking up has really helped. It's so big, it's the Olympic Games. At the end of the day, we don't want to be carried out of there on a stretcher.\"\n\nIn the ensuing days, Biles withdrew from the uneven bars, vault and floor exercise competitions. She had won the gold medal in the vault and floor in the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nBiles remained in the field for the balance beam and adjusted her routine, ditching her usual full-twisting double back tuck in favor of a double back pike. She earned a bronze medal in the event, matching her finish from five years earlier in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\"It means more than all the golds because I've been through so much the last five years and the last week while I've even been here; it was just... it was very emotional,\" she said on NBC's “Today” Show. \"And I'm just proud of myself and all of these girls as well.\"\n\n\"I didn't really care about the outcome,\" she later added. \"I was so happy that I made the routine and then I got to compete one more time.\"\n\nREQUIRED READING:Everything you need to know about Simone Biles, US Olympic gold medalist and the GOAT\n\nWhat are the twisties?\n\nBiles received widespread support as she endured her mental health struggles, but was also the subject of criticism from pundits and talking heads outside the world of gymnastics, some of whom labeled her a quitter.\n\nIn reality, her exit from the Olympics was much more nuanced.\n\nWhile “mental health” can be a wide-ranging, sometimes nebulous term, what affected Biles was something much more specific.\n\nBiles was dealing with what gymnasts call “the twisties,” something she referenced repeatedly while discussing her withdrawal from the various Olympics events. While the term sounds playful and even fun, it’s an incredibly serious matter.\n\nThough it’s not a technical medical diagnosis, the twisties refer to the psychological phenomenon a gymnast experiences when they encounter a disconnect between their body and mind while performing skills, like twists, in competition. It can cause a gymnast to lose their sense of space and air awareness while executing a routine, potentially causing them to do more or fewer twists or flips than intended. In some instances, dealing with the twisties can prevent a gymnast from landing safely on the mat, which could result in serious injury. In other sports, they are analogous to what is colloquial called \"the yips.\"\n\nGymnasts who had dealt with the twisties or were aware of the debilitating effect of them came out to praise Biles and fight against whatever backlash had been directed at her. Among those coming to Biles’ defense was Jacoby Miles, who had bailed early on a skill during competition, stopping earlier than she was supposed to, and landed on her neck, paralyzing her from the chest down.\n\n“She was brave enough and strong enough, even though it was the Olympic stage, to say ‘No, for my own safety, physical and mental health, I'm going to step out and make this decision,’” Miles said to Sports Illustrated. “I thought (it) was just really, really smart on her part.”\n\nBiles took it upon herself to try to educate others on the twisties. In a series of posts on Instagram, Biles explained that her \"mind and body are simply not in sync” and showed herself trying to complete a 1.5 twist before landing on her back.\n\n\"I don't think you realize how dangerous this is on hard/competitive surface,\" she wrote in a caption.\n\nBiles also wrote that while afflicted with the twisties that she \"literally can not tell up from down. It's the craziest feeling ever. Not having an inch of control over your body. What's even scarier is since I have no idea where I am in the air I also have NO idea how I'm going to land. Or what I'm going to land on.\"\n\nHow many Olympic gold medals does Simone Biles have?\n\nBiles has won four gold medals at the Summer Olympics, all of which came in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. She won the all-around, vault and floor exercise individually and was part of the United States’ gold-medal-winning team in the team final.\n\nAdditionally, Biles has a silver medal from the 2020 team competition and a pair of bronze medals, both from the balance beam. Her seven total medals rank her in a tie for ninth all-time among female Olympic gymnasts and in a tie with Shannon Miller for the most by an American female gymnast.\n\nIs Simone Biles going to the 2024 Paris Olympics?\n\nBiles will be one of five female American gymnasts competing at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\n\nShe is just the fourth American woman to ever make three Olympic gymnastics teams. With one medal, she would break a tie with Miller as the most decorated American female gymnast ever and with two gold medals, she could break Anton Heida’s record for most gold medals by an American female gymnast. She could also become just the third woman to win gold in the all-around twice, joining Larisa Latynina and Vera Caslavska.\n\nAt 27 years old in a sport that has historically favored teenaged competitors, she could become the oldest all-around champion since 1952, the oldest American to win an Olympic women’s gymnastics medal since 1948 and the oldest American ever to win a gold medal in women’s gymnastics (the current record-holder, Aly Raisman, was 22 when she did so in 2016).\n\nBiles enters the competition still near the top of her game. She was the gold medalist in the all-around, balance beam and floor exercise at the 2023 World Championships. At the 2024 U.S. National Championships in late May and early June, she swept the available gold medals, winning in the all-around, vault, uneven bars, balance beam and floor exercise.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/01/olympic-gymnastics-all-around-live-results/74193970007/", "title": "Olympic gymnastics highlights: Simone Biles wins gold in all-around", "text": "PARIS — It was closer than expected, but the final result was no surprise.\n\nSimone Biles cemented her legacy as the world's most dominant gymnast Thursday night, narrowly defeating Rebeca Andrade of Brazil in the 2024 Paris Olympics all-around final to become the oldest all-around Olympic champion since 1952. Biles, 27, is also just the third woman in history to win multiple golds in the all-around, and the first to win all-around titles eight years apart. Andrade finished silver and Suni Lee took bronze.\n\nBiles, who hasn't lost an all-around competition in more than a decade, gave herself a bit of work to do after a major mistake on uneven bars, which left her sitting third at the midway point behind both Andrade and Kaylia Nemour of Algeria. But she responded by hitting a big routine on the sport's trickiest apparatus, balance beam, and then put the competition to bed with a typically brilliant performance on floor.\n\n\"I’m getting uncomfortable guys!\" says of how close she was to Andrade. \"I was stressing. But I knew if I did my work it’d all be fine.\"\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nThursday's victory gave Biles her second Olympic gold of these Games, after the U.S. women’s squad captured gold in the team final on Tuesday, and her ninth Olympic medal overall, the most ever won by an American gymnast. In the coming days, Biles could add as many as three more golds as she is due to compete in the apparatus finals for balance beam, floor exercise and vault.\n\nBiles, who has also won 30 medals at world championships, has said she is on a bit of a redemption tour in Paris after her experience at the 2021 Tokyo Games. Biles withdrew midway through the team final with a bout of the \"twisties,\" which caused her to lose a sense of where she was in the air on twisting elements. She proceeded to withdraw from most of her other remaining events and take a two-year hiatus from competitive gymnastics.\n\nBiles has proven to be perhaps even more dominant upon her return last year. She cruised to the all-around world title last fall and has continued to push the boundaries of the sport with new skills, including her now-famous Yurchenko double pike vault – which helped carry her to gold Thursday night.\n\n\"It is crazy I am in the conversation of the greatest of all time,\" Biles said. \"I just think I’m still Simone Biles from Spring, Texas, who loves to flip.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Sports brought you live results, scores and highlights throughout the team final. Check out the highlights.\n\nSimone Biles is now GOAT of all GOATs\n\nSimone Biles is the best to ever do it and it’s not even close. In her sport. And in all others. Michael Phelps, Usain Bolt, Serena Williams and anyone else you want to throw in the mix — they all take a backseat to Biles. With her second Olympic all-around title Thursday night, Biles surpassed all the other GOATs. She’s now, as teammate Jordan Chiles put it earlier this week, the greatest of the greats. Read Nancy Armour's full column on Biles being the greatest of all time.\n\nSimone Biles' goat necklace\n\nAfter Biles won all-around gold — again — she pulled out a necklace with a very blingy goat.\n\nWhen does Simone Biles compete next?\n\nBiles has three individual finals left.\n\nSaturday, Aug. 3: The vault final is at 10:20 a.m. ET.\n\nThe vault final is at 10:20 a.m. ET. Monday, Aug. 5: The balance beam is at 6:36 a.m. ET, and floor final 8:20 a.m. ET.\n\nWho is competing in women's individual gymnastics finals?\n\nHere are the individual final events the U.S. women's gymnasts team will compete in.\n\nSimone Biles: all-around, vault, floor exercise, balance beam.\n\nall-around, vault, floor exercise, balance beam. Suni Lee: all-around, uneven bars, balance beam.\n\nall-around, uneven bars, balance beam. Jordan Chiles: floor exercise.\n\nfloor exercise. Jade Carey: vault.\n\nSimone Biles vault all-around\n\nSimone Biles got some serious height off the table on her Yurchenko double pike — the famous (and incredibly dangerous) vault that is now among her many eponymous skills. And even with a significant hop backwards on the landing, she has already established a commanding lead.\n\nBiles' score of 15.766 puts her more than six-tenths ahead of Rebeca Andrade Andrade through one rotation. While Andrade had a better execution score on her vault, the starting value of the Yurchenko double pike (6.40) dwarfs that of the Cheng vault that Andrade hit (5.60).\n\nSimone Biles' floor routine\n\nSimone Biles held a .166 lead over Brazil's Rebeca Andrade with one rotation left, floor exercise, and she scored a 15.066 to win the gold medal.\n\nSimone Biles' beam routine\n\nIce. Cold. In the trickiest event in women's gymnastics, balance beam, Simone Biles put up a big-time score under big-time pressure. Despite two small wobbles, she nailed her aerial series and had a relatively clean landing on the dismount to earn a 14.566.\n\nSimone Biles bars routine\n\nSimone Biles winced as she walked away from the uneven bars after a nervy moment as she transitioned from the higher bar to the lower. It appeared that she got a bit too much power on the release and got a bit too far away from the low bar, raising her knees to avoid touching the ground.\n\n\"The fact that she did not come off the bar, it's just another thing to be in awe about for Simone,\" NBC analyst Laurie Hernandez said on Peacock's broadcast.\n\nBiles didn't fall, but the sequence forced her to take an additional unplanned swing and significantly hurt her execution score, resulting in a 13.733 that move her into third place (29.499) behind Brazil's Rebeca Andrade (29.766) and Algeria's Kaylia Nemour (29.566) after two turns.\n\nSuni Lee's floor routine\n\nSuni Lee, who sat in fourth entering the final rotation, scored a 13.666 on floor, moving her into the bronze medal position. It's her second Olympic medal in the all-around final.\n\nSuni Lee's beam routine\n\nSuni Lee had a few small wobbles — but no fall — in her beam routine to score an even 14.000.\n\nSuni Lee's bars score\n\nSuni Lee was smiling before she even stuck the landing on her uneven bars routine — a stellar showing that earned a score of 14.866.\n\nSuni Lee's vault score\n\nSuni Lee got things started on vault with a double-twisting Yurchenko, taking a hop on the landing but notching a solid 13.933. Vault is not Lee's strongest event, but her performance there should put her in good position heading into uneven bars.\n\nRebeca Andrade Olympic all-around final performance\n\nRebeca Andrade couldn't have asked for a much better start in the all-around final. On vault, she stuck the landing on a Cheng — the second-hardest vault being done today — and notched a big-time score of 15.100, with a 9.500 execution score (out of 10).\n\nTrailing Simone Biles by almost seventh-tenths of a point after their first rotation, she needed to be pretty much impeccable over the remaining three events to catch up. And she certainly as on uneven bars. Andrade and Biles both had the same difficulty score on their uneven bars routines, but Andrade's execution was significantly better — resulting in a score of 14.766 that was almost a full point better than Biles'.\n\nShe then turned in an impressive performance on beam, especially under the circumstances. Going last in the rotation, and having just seen Simone Biles hit her routine, Andrade managed to block out the pressure and register a score of 14.133. Despite a few balance checks and minor issues, it was a strong showing. She closed out on floor, scoring a 14.033.\n\nSteph Curry at gymnastics all-around final\n\nThe NBA's greatest shooter of all time, Steph Curry, is the stands to watch the women's gymnastics all-around final.\n\nSimone Biles, Suni Lee introduced at all-around final\n\nBiles and Lee were introcued to the crowd here to huge cheers.\n\nHow high can Simone Biles jump?\n\nDuring her floor routine at Olympic gymnastics trials, Simone Biles reached 12 feet in the air at one point.\n\nHow many gold medals does Simone Biles have all time?\n\nBiles now has won nine Olympic medals after the U.S. women's gymnastics squad won team gold at the team final in Paris. Six of her medals are gold. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Biles won three individual golds in the all-around, vault and floor exercise and led Team USA’s “Final Five” to the team gold. She also added a bronze medal on the balance beam. At the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Biles added a silver medal in the team event and an additional bronze medal in the balance beam to her hardware collection.\n\nWhy is Simone Biles called the GOAT?\n\nBiles is the greatest gymnast of all time. She has consistently dominated the sport for over a decade, which would have been an unimaginable feat just a few years ago as most gymnasts reach their peak in their late teens. Her ability to win is in a class of its own. With 39 Olympic and world championship medals — 28 of which are gold — Biles has won the most of any gymnast in history. She has also not lost an all-around competition since 2013.\n\nBiles redefines the possibilities of her sport not just in her record-breaking number of wins and medals, but also in the unmatched difficulty of the skills she completes. Biles has no less than five skills named after her — two on the vault and floor and one on the balance beam — because she was the first, and in most cases, the only athlete to complete them in competition.\n\nSuni Lee kidney illness: How it changed her gymnastics mindset\n\nSuni Lee went to Auburn right after winning gold in Tokyo, wanting to have the college experience and to compete at the NCAA level. She announced in November 2022 that she’d leave Auburn at the end of her sophomore season. Before that season could even end, however, Lee developed a kidney disease that caused her to retain so much fluid there were days she couldn’t even put on her grips. She returned to Minneapolis and began working with doctors at the Mayo Clinic, who discovered she was suffering from a second kidney ailment.\n\nThus began a nearly yearlong nightmare of tweaking medications and Lee feeling as if she had no control over her body. At one point, she said, she’d gained 40 pounds. There were days she could train and days she could only do certain things. Then there were days she couldn’t even get out of bed. By the end of February, Lee had returned to competition. It was an inauspicious start — she did only uneven bars and balance beam at Winter Cup and fell off both — but it let her know she could still do this.\n\nHas anyone won two Olympic all-around titles before?\n\nYes, but it's been a minute. Or a half-century. Larisa Latynina of the Soviet Union was the first to win two Olympic all-around titles, winning in 1956 and 1960. Vera Caslavska of then-Czechoslovakia then won the next two, in 1964 and 1968. But it's been a new champion at every Games since then.\n\nIn fact, there hasn't been a reigning all-around champion who's won another medal of any color since Ludmilla Tourischeva of the Soviet Union. After winning gold in the all-around in 1972, she was the bronze medalist in 1976.\n\nHow many Olympics has Simone Biles been to?\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics are Simone Biles' third Olympic Games.\n\nHow old was Simone Biles at her first Olympics?\n\nBiles was 19 years old at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nWhat are the twisties in gymnastics?\n\nBiles missed most of the Tokyo Olympics after developing a case of “the twisties,” which caused her to lose her sense of where she was in the air and jeopardized her physical safety.\n\nWho is Simone Biles married to?\n\nSimone Biles is married to NFL player Jonathan Owens, who will be at the all-around final today. At the team final on Tuesday, he sat with Biles' parents and wearing a T-shirt with \"BILES\" on it and a huge photo of his wife in action on it. He landed in Paris on Tuesday morning.\n\nDuring the first rotation of Monday's team final, Owens was seen with a pen in hand, possibly recording scores, as Biles performed her vault routine. Mic’ed up on NBC’s broadcast, Owens let out a healthy “let’s go!” after Biles recorded a 14.900 on the vault, the highest score among the three U.S. gymnasts.\n\nSimone Biles' Instagram caption deservedly put MyKayla Skinner on blast\n\nThe scorch marks on MyKayla Skinner are going to be visible for a while after Simone Biles put her on blast Wednesday. Deservedly so, mind you. The Tokyo Olympian had the audacity earlier this summer to criticize the women who eventually made the team for the Paris Games, saying they weren’t as talented and didn’t have the same work ethic as in Skinner’s day.\n\n“Lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions,” Biles captioned an Instagram post of her and her teammates — Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee and Hezly Rivera — celebrating their gold medal Tuesday night.\n\nSimone Biles' moves named after her: What to know\n\nSimone Biles has left her mark on the sport of gymnastics, in addition to her combined 28 world championship and Olympic medals. Biles has five skills named after her: Two on vault, two on floor exercise and one on balance beam. Here’s are the Simone Biles moves named after her.\n\nSimone Biles' Yurchenko double pike: What to know\n\nThe Biles II is also known as the Yurchenko double pike, one of five moves named after Simone Biles. Vaults are categorized by “families,” which are based on the entry. On Yurchenko vaults, a gymnast does a roundoff onto the takeoff board and a back handspring onto the table. Biles then follows it with a double somersault in the piked position.\n\nFew men even try this vault, which is so difficult because of the power it takes to get two somersaults as well as its lack of a bailout. If something goes awry, more likely to land on her head or neck than her knees.\n\nBiles began doing this vault in 2021 but didn’t do it at a worlds or Olympics until the 2023 world championships. With a 6.4 difficulty value, it is the hardest vault in the women’s code.\n\nWhen Biles did the vault last year, she took a half-point deduction for having coach Laurent Landi standing on the landing mat, ready to step in and redirect her into a safe position if it looked as if she was headed for a scary landing. But neither Biles nor Landi feel the need for him to do that anymore.\n\nThe most difficult vault commonly executed by other gymnasts is valued at 5.6, eight-tenths lower than the Biles II, so doing it gives Biles a huge scoring advantage.\n\nWhere Simone Biles trains and what it's like to train with her\n\nSimone Biles trains at Champions Centre World, which is owned by Biles’ parents Nellie and Ron and is just outside Houston, has become one of the premier gyms in the country. WCC has two gymnasts on the five-woman US team at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Biles and Jordan Chiles, with Joscelyn Roberson a traveling alternate and Tiana Sumanasekera a non-traveling alternate. It also sent the most gymnasts, five, to the Olympic trials, and had three more at the US championships.\n\n\"Training with Simone is, like, once in a lifetime,\" said Roberson, who moved to WCC after the US championships in 2022. \"She's always so bubbly in the gym. Plus, she can hit. All the time. Like, she never has a bad day, which is insane to me.\"\n\nHow Simone Biles shattered gymnastics age stereotype\n\nSimone Biles, 27, is seeking to become the oldest all-around Olympic champion in women's gymnastics in 72 years, and she is one of four athletes on the U.S. team who fit what used to be a rare mold, as repeat Olympians in their 20s. The other three − Jade Carey (24), Jordan Chiles (23) and Suni Lee (21) − all competed in college between their two Olympic appearances, which also used to be uncommon. (Hezly Rivera, 16, rounds out the team.)\n\nWith an average age north of 22 years old, it will be the oldest U.S. women's gymnastics team to compete at the Olympics since 1952, according to USA Gymnastics.\n\n\"The longevity of this sport has been totally changed. Simone has changed that,\" Chiles said. not to control everything that I can’t control anymore,” Biles said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/rio-2016/2016/08/15/gymnastics-aly-raisman-gold-medal-usa/88795986/", "title": "Raisman quietly builds one of USA's best Olympics gymnastics ..."}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/22/simone-biles-goat-gymnastics-2024-paris-olympics/74103678007/", "title": "Why Simone Biles is GOAT of gymnastics: A list before Paris Olympics", "text": "Editor’s note: Simone Biles won gold in the all-around final at the Paris Olympics.\n\nAt 2024 Paris Olympics approach, all eyes are on Simone Biles as she competes in her third consecutive Olympic Games. After withdrawing from several events at the Tokyo Olympics after experiencing the \"twisties,\" a term gymnasts use to describe losing their spatial awareness and orientation in mid-air, Biles is set to make the ultimate Olympic comeback this summer.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the gymnastics superstar ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nWhy is Simone Biles called the GOAT?\n\nBiles has been dubbed “the GOAT,” which stands for the greatest of all time, because she is just that. She has consistently dominated the sport for over a decade, which would have been an unimaginable feat just a few years ago as most gymnasts reach their peak in their late teens. Her ability to win is in a class of its own. With 37 Olympic and World Championship medals — 27 of which are gold — Biles has won the most of any gymnast in history. She has also not lost an all-around competition since 2013.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nBiles redefines the possibilities of her sport not just in her record-breaking number of wins and medals, but also in the unmatched difficulty of the skills she competes. Biles has no less than five skills named after her — two on the vault and floor and one on the balance beam — because she was the first, and in most cases, the only athlete to complete them in competition.\n\nIs Simone Biles the most decorated gymnast of all time?\n\nWith a combined 37 medals at the Olympic Games and World Championships, Biles is the most decorated gymnast — male or female — of any nation in history. Biles officially earned this recognition after surpassing Vitaly Scherbo (33 World and Olympic medals) and Larisa Latynina (32 World and Olympic medals) with her performance at the 2023 World Championships.\n\nBiles is also unquestionably the most decorated gymnast on the national level, having won an unparalleled nine U.S. all-around titles.\n\nBiles currently ranks ninth in total Olympic medals for women's artistic gymnastics, but she will unquestionably aim to increase this tally in Paris.\n\nWhat is Simone Biles' GOAT leotard all about?\n\nAs a clear nod to her GOAT status, Biles has twice donned a leotard adorned with a goat's head outlined in rhinestones. Biles first showcased the design during podium training before the 2019 national championships and again at the 2021 U.S. Classic in the lead-up to the Tokyo Games.\n\nWhat is Simone Biles' schedule for the Paris Olympics?\n\nFans who want to see Simone Biles compete will have plenty of opportunities during the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThere are six days of gymnastics competition, and Biles is likely to compete at least five of those days. If she makes the uneven bars final, then she will compete on all six days.\n\nBiles is set to begin her competition at the Paris Olympics with the women's qualifiers on July 28, followed by the team final on July 30 and the all-around final on Aug. 1.\n\nHere's the full schedule.\n\nWhat records could Simone Biles break in Paris?\n\nBiles simply making the 2024 Olympic team will match the American record for the most appearances on a U.S. gymnastics Olympic team. If Biles makes it to Paris, she will join Muriel Davis Grossfeld (1956, 1969 and 1964), Linda Metheny (1964, 1968 and 1972) and Dominique Dawes (1992, 1996 and 2000) as the only American gymnasts to represent Team USA at three different Olympic Games.\n\nBiles will undoubtedly do more than just show up, though. She is the favorite to win at least five of the six events.\n\nWith seven Olympic medals, Biles currently shares the title of most decorated U.S. Olympic gymnast with Shannon Miller. If she wins at least one of the six available artistic gymnastics medals, which she is heavily favored to do, she will become the most decorated Olympic gymnast in American history.\n\nBiles currently sits in ninth place in the international record books for the most Olympic women’s gymnastics medals. With the opportunity to win six more medals in Paris, Biles could catapult her way to second on the all-time list. Statistically, Biles cannot catch Latynina, who won 18 Olympic medals for the Soviet Union between 1956 and 1964, unless she competes at the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n\nIn a sport where most athletes retire in their early twenties, Biles’ longevity is also record-breaking. If Biles wins just one gold medal in Paris, she will become the oldest female gymnast to do so since Latynina won gold in 1964.

Additionally, she’s a six-time gold medalist in the all-around competition at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.\n\nFor as much as Biles’ excellence can be summed up through numbers and her ever-lengthening resume, her brilliance is perhaps best understood by simply watching her. While any gymnast competing in the Olympics will be able to execute maneuvers that astonish the average viewer — or, at the very least, terrify them — the leaps, flips and twists that Biles is able to pull off showcase an even more astonishing level of athleticism and grace than any medal count could properly express.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS:Follow USA TODAY's complete coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nIn those moments, whether it’s launching herself into the sky off the floor or pulling off a complex sequence of moves mid-air in only a couple of seconds, it’s easy to see, even for an untrained eye, why she’s considered perhaps the greatest gymnast of all-time.\n\n2024 Olympic medals: Who is leading the medal count? Follow along as we track the medals for every sport.\n\nAs with many gymnasts, those incredible feats come from someone with a diminutive physical stature.\n\nAs she prepares to compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics, where she can become just the third gymnast ever to win gold in the all-around multiple times, here’s more about Biles’ height and leaping ability:\n\nSimone Biles height\n\nOn her profile page on the official Team USA website, Biles is listed at 4-foot-8.\n\nWhile elite gymnasts are typically smaller, Biles is short even among that group. Four of the past five women to win the Olympic all-around gold medal, all of them Americans, have been at least 5 feet tall, a group that includes 5-foot-3 Nastia Liukin and 5-foot-2 Gabrielle Douglas.\n\nHow high can Simone Biles jump?\n\nThough exceptional verticality is often associated with tall, rangy NBA players who fly through the air to throw down dunks or swat shots, there are few American athletes who display it quite as breathtakingly as Biles.\n\nDuring her floor exercise routine at the 2024 US Olympic Gymnastics Trials in June, the top of Biles’ head got as high as 12 feet above the surface on one of her jumps. According to ESPN, that leap would have been high enough for her to jump over San Antonio Spurs superstar Victor Wembanyama, who, at 7-foot-4, is the tallest player in the NBA.\n\nCompetitive gymnastics floors have springs beneath them, which makes the surface safer for athletes for landing while giving them added inches on tumbles, but it’s still a remarkably impressive mark for Biles.\n\nSimone Biles age\n\nBiles, who will be competing in the Olympics for the third time, is 27 years old.\n\nIn Paris, she could become the oldest women’s all-around champion since 1952, the oldest American to win a medal in women’s gymnastics since 1948 and the oldest American woman to ever win a gold medal in gymnastics.\n\nTeam USA gymnastics heights\n\nHere’s a look at the heights of four of the five members of the United States women’s gymnastics team, from shortest to tallest.

For example, a search for the question “Was the 2020 election stolen?” yielded six videos that contained false claims in the first 20 results, NewsGuard found.\n\nNewsGuard researchers also found that TikTok’s search engine “is consistently feeding millions of young users health misinformation, including some claims that could be dangerous to users’ health.” For instance, a search for “does mugwort induce abortion” receives over a dozen results that advocate for unproven herbal abortion methods.\n\nTikTok recently began removing abortion-related videos that violate its policy against medical misinformation, including those that share potentially dangerous advice about how to self-induce an abortion.\n\nIn response to the NewsGuard report, a TikTok spokesperson told CNN that its community guidelines “make clear that we do not allow harmful misinformation, including medical misinformation, and we will remove it from the platform. We partner with credible voices to elevate authoritative content on topics related to public health, and partner with independent fact-checkers who help us to assess the accuracy of content.”\n\nTikTok ties to China under scrutiny\n\nTikTok removed more than 102 million videos in early 2022 for violating its guidelines, according to its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report. But less than 1% of those videos were removed for violating the company’s “integrity and authenticity” guidelines, which include misinformation, according to NewsGuard’s review.\n\nNewsGuard’s report was released amid bipartisan concerns in Washington about the possibility that US user data could find its way to the Chinese government and be used to undermine US interests due to a national security law in that country that compels companies located there to cooperate with data requests.\n\nUS officials have expressed fears that China could use Americans’ personal information to identify useful potential agents or intelligence targets, or to inform future mis- or disinformation campaigns.\n\nTestifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, TikTok Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Pappas declined to commit to cut off flows of US user data to China, instead promising that the outcome of its negotiations with the US government “will satisfy all national security concerns.”\n\nTikTok does not operate in China, Pappas said, though it does have an office in China. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, whose founder is Chinese and has offices in China.\n\n“I was surprised that TikTok is so much worse even than Google and worse, as a general matter as a platform, than Facebook or Twitter when it comes to this stuff,” Steven Brill, founder of NewsGuard, told CNN.\n\nBrill said the report’s findings are especially concerning due to the company’s ties to China and how easily children can access the app’s content.\n\n“We should take this as a warning. If I had kids of TikTok age, I would certainly want to know what they’re using as a search engine,” Brill said. “I’d be upset enough if they were relying too much on Google and coming up with reports in school that were based on what they were reading on Wikipedia.

But some families ...", "text": "BRIGHTON, Mich. — Inside a small photography studio on a Friday afternoon in September, there's a knock on the door. It's a family, arriving for a scheduled appointment. A little girl is looking forward to a magical fairy photoshoot the day before her birthday.\n\nEach time she hears the knock, Brighton, Michigan, photographer Dawn Flowers' heart breaks a little. There was a time when she thought she'd be running those photoshoots — but it's long gone now.\n\nAccording to Flowers, Texas-based Enchanted Fairies terminated an agreement with her studio months ago, after she voiced concerns about their scheduling arrangements. Since then, she's had to turn customers away or inform them a shoot with her independent studio doesn't include fairy costumes or props. Sometimes, the families travel hours to reach her.\n\nFlowers opened her studio in a newly renovated storefront in downtown Brighton with hopes of working part-time for Enchanted Fairies, an expansion of her pre-existing photography business.\n\nThe firm supplied her with costumes and fairy-themed props. It's all been removed now. The company told Flowers they'd handle booking appointments, making sales calls, and processing customers' photos.\n\n\"It looked cute,\" she says of discovering the business on Facebook. \"They give a lot of money to charities for kids. I applied for it.\"\n\nBut things went wrong when Enchanted Fairies started booking appointments.\n\n\"They wanted me to work 10 hours a day, six days a week,\" Flowers said, adding the intention was never for her to work for the business full-time. She also shoots family portraits, senior pictures, wedding photos and baby photos.\n\nAccording to Flowers, one Enchanted Fairies representative suggested she hire an employee to keep the studio available for appointments 60 hours a week.\n\n\"I had 217 sessions booked,\" she said. \"June and July were completed booked. August was pretty full and September, and they were still booking them.\"\n\nShe told the company she couldn't take on a full-time schedule. Enchanted Fairies informed her they'd be parting ways.\n\n\"The next day, they sent an email saying, 'Maybe you want us to take the studio off your hands for you.'\"\n\nIt was a lot, she felt, for a company that hadn't even told her how much its photos would cost families.\n\nIn the weeks since, customers have shown up at her studio for appointments the company never cancelled or moved. She worries more have shown up while she's closed, damaging her reputation.\n\nShe plans to keep her studio open by finding another photographer or small business to split the rent — and by negotiating compensation from Enchanted Fairies through her attorney, an issue that has yet to be resolved.\n\nThe family on this particular afternoon agreed to hire Flowers to take photos of the little girl in a princess dress, instead. But not all customers are so willing.\n\nEnchanted Fairies and founder Christopher Rensink responded via email on Friday to inquiries from The Livingston Daily, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n\"Enchanted Fairies contracts with photographers across the country and receives thousands of applications from freelance photographers seeking to sign up as a contract photographer,\" the statement continues. \"Enchanted Fairies accepts only a small percentage of those applicants, and takes any concern raised by contract photographers seriously.\"\n\n“Enchanted Fairies is aware that a photographer recently made claims about their experience,\" Rensink said. \"The photographer did not perform any photoshoots for Enchanted Fairies’ clients and is no longer affiliated with Enchanted Fairies. Enchanted Fairies disagrees with the allegations raised by the photographer; however, we value the privacy of our contract photographers, and our policy is not to comment publicly regarding any contract photographer.\"\n\nSeeing red flags she'd perhaps missed before, Flowers did some digging. What she found appalled her.\n\nEnchanted Fairies draws scores of complaints\n\nEnchanted Fairies has 51 resolved complaints in the last three years listed through the Better Business Bureau, with hundreds more detailed in a Facebook group called \"Enchanted Fairies Scam Victims.\" The group has more than 2,000 members.\n\nEnchanted Fairies has a 1-of-5-star rating from customers via the Better Business Bureau. Melanie McGovern, public relations director for the International Association of Better Business Bureaus said the organization is aware of the complaints, adding that Enchanted Fairies went through a complaint-resolution process last year.\n\nThe most recent complaint, from August 28, details the struggle of one mother and grandmother to set up a Zoom meeting to review photos.\n\n\"We have both tried calling and she has also tried reaching out via email and no response,\" the mother wrote. \"We both are extremely irritated and unhappy about this.\"\n\nComplaints often allege customers are enticed by a $25 booking fee and an offer for a complimentary photo. But later, they're told buying photos will cost hundreds, or thousands, of dollars. Some photo packages have exceeded $10,000. Complaints also detail high-pressure sales tactics and financing, and some complainants report never receiving their complementary photos at all.\n\nEnchanted Fairies has pricing information listed online. \"Most of our clients invest between $1,000-$3,000 and are thrilled with their art pieces,\" the website says. \"Some families invest $10,000+.\"\n\nThe business is also involved in an open case with the National Labor Relations Board, filed in October 2022 by a former employee, according to documents obtained by The Daily through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe complaint alleges an employee was fired and another was suspended, and Enchanted Fairies violated their right to engage \"in concerted activities with other employees for the purposes of mutual aid and protection by seeking to assist (redacted) coworkers and/or discussing wages, hours and/or other terms and conditions of employment with (redacted) coworkers.\"\n\n\"Enchanted Fairies has earned 13,000 four- and five-star reviews from its valued customers,\" the company wrote to The Daily. \"After an exhaustive review by the Better Business Bureau this year, claims of a high-pressure sales approach and lack of clarity around pricing were determined to be unfounded.\"\n\n\"We acknowledge that there is a small percentage of the approximately 72,000 customers we see on an annual basis that are not completely satisfied,\" Rensink wrote. \"We read each piece of feedback, we listen to it, and we take negative feedback seriously as we continue to grow and improve our business.\n\n\"Any customer concerned about our pricing can view all pricing on our website, as well as an explanation of the purchase process. If there are any logistical challenges, such as a change in reservation location or a need to reschedule a reservation, Enchanted Fairies makes every effort to notify customers and keep them informed.\"\n\n'Shocked' by cost of children's fairy photos\n\nUnhappy customers live across the country.\n\n\"I have two kids — five and eight — and I was like, 'I want to have the experience,'\" Dion McCullam told The Daily after responding to a post on \"Enchanted Fairies Scam Victims.\"\n\nThirty-nine commenters on the post expressed interest in sharing their stories.\n\n\"My girl likes fairies. My little boy isn't as into it,\" McCullam, who lives in Wisconsin, said. \"I thought it would be nice to have a photograph of them together.\"\n\nShe said the shoot itself, done with a photographer last summer, was a good, fun experience — but she was \"shocked\" when she found out how much photos would cost.\n\nShe and her husband purchased one 14\"-by-12\" photo on stretched canvas \"with all the enhancements\" for $2,500.\n\n\"We found that extravagant,\" McCullam said. \"We were falling for that hook, line and sinker. ... I find that to be misrepresentation.\"\n\nThey tried to cancel the purchase and report it to their credit card company before Enchanted Fairies processed the order, but it was too late.\n\n\"It just sounded like hard lining,\" McCullam said.\n\nCressida Ceesay of New Castle, Washington, started \"Enchanted Fairies Scam Victims\" after her own negative experience with the company's pricing and sales tactics.\n\n\"It was supposed to be an audition for modeling,\" she said. \"That's how it was marketed to me. I'd submitted my daughter's information, and I had to pay $25 for the audition, and from there we booked the appointment. The place was two hours away. We had to take the ferry.\"\n\n\"The photographer was nice,\" she said. \"It was after the fact, during the Zoom photo reveal (with sales representatives).\"\n\nShe said they offered her 11 photos for $3,500.\n\n\"I didn’t get any photos,\" she said. \"Their justification was the portraits will last 300 years, and the dresses are designed by J. Lo.\"\n\nThe Daily has found no digital link between Jennifer Lopez and Enchanted Fairies.\n\nSince starting the Facebook group, Ceesay said, she's had contact with many unhappy customers and photographers. The most expensive package she's heard of was $25,000.\n\n\"It’s different depending on where you live,\" she said.\n\nShe said customers complain about high-pressure sales tactics that \"pull on your heart strings.\"\n\n\"A lot of the time, the local photographer isn’t aware of the pricing until a customer tells them,\" she said. \"They'll get backlash and bad reviews because of Enchanted Fairies.\"\n\nJennifer Eberbach can be reached at jeberbach@livingstondaily.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/05/10/leon-county-under-tornado-warnings-as-severe-storms-sweep-across-area-tallahassee-weather/73638607007/", "title": "Updates: Woman killed as Tallahassee faces what may be its worst ...", "text": "A line of severe thunderstorms and a possible tornado roared through Tallahassee Friday morning leaving a large swath of damage – downed trees, tangled power lines and buildings with their roofs sheered off.\n\nThe violent storms crashed into the city amid the rush to get high school students to school.

Residents hunkered down in interior hallways and bathrooms as they prepared for the worst in the early morning hours.\n\n“Having been in Indianhead for 40 years, and a Florida native, I had always heard of tornadoes and the freight train noise that they make, but I had never experienced it. Well, now I have experienced it,” said Sherry Mills, an Indianhead resident.\n\nHer son and small grandson just happened to be staying over at her house the night before. “We all ran to the bathroom with no windows, it was unbelievable. The worst of it was only about five minutes, but it was terribly frightening.”\n\nThe cleanup of the neighborhood with the massive green and brown camouflaged roads will likely take days before residents see some sense of normalcy.\n\nVideo of Railroad Square from above shows scope of damage\n\nThe beloved arts district of Railroad Square was one of the hardest hit areas of Tallahassee, along with Indianhead Acres, Myers Park and College Town.\n\nSee the scope of the damage from above in drone footage and hear from one of the business owner's.\n\n\"It's terrible,\" she said. \"One of the galleries is completely gone, smashed down to the ground.

City officials expect the work to restore power will go through the weekend.\n\nCity spokesperson Alison Faris said the extent of the damage has made it hard-going today because crews are focused on fixing the transmission infrastructure before they can start working on the distribution of power that energizes homes and businesses.\n\n\"Transmission first and then we restore circuits which impacts distribution,\" Faris told the Democrat. \"All hands are on the transmission. We should start seeing some circuits repaired here shortly.\"\n\nThat can lead to entire sections of neighborhoods being powered up.\n\nAt 6 p.m., Faris said 85 percent of the work to the transmission line is complete.

All those photos, videos, documents, messages and emails contain some highly personal information.\n\nThat's why locking down your tech the right way is essential. Have you ever wondered whether a PIN, fingerprint or face ID is the safest way to lock your smartphone? I reveal the answer here on Komando.com.\n\nWhen it comes to your computer or tablet, you need to make sure outsiders aren’t tapping in. Here are seven clear-cut signs your computer is infected with a keylogger or virus.\n\nHow can you tell if someone inside your home is accessing your files and applications without your knowledge? Is someone using your computer behind your back? Thankfully, there are ways to find out.\n\nCheck your PC’s recent items\n\nA quick note before we get started: The exact steps may vary depending on which version of Windows, macOS or iPad OS you use. If you can't find an item below, use your device's search tool to look for the function by name.\n\nSo someone’s been poking around your computer or tablet, opening your files and applications left and right. There are bound to be traces of it, right? Correct. There are quick and easy ways to view recently accessed files, folders and even applications.\n\nWith these tools, if you notice an item you don't remember opening, that's a sure sign someone has accessed your system without your knowledge. Here's how you view your recent items:\n\nOn a PC:\n\nPress Windows + R. Type in \"recent\" and hit enter. This step will show a list of files that were recently opened. If you see something on this list that you don't remember opening, someone may have been poking around your computer.\n\n\n\nOn a Mac:\n\nTo see recent items, click on the Apple logo on the left-hand side of the menu bar. Hover your mouse over Recent Items. You'll see the 10 most recent items accessed in three categories: Applications, Documents and Servers.\n\nTo see recent folders, open a Finder window. While the window is active, click Go on the menu bar. Hover your mouse over Recent Folders. Like Recent Items, you’ll see the 10 folders that were most recently accessed.\n\nOn an iPad:\n\nOpen the Files app. Tap Recents at the bottom of the screen.\n\nOn an Amazon Fire tablet:\n\nTap on the Docs button on the home screen to open the document library. Browse by Recent.\n\nHandy download: This free tool shows you what someone last searched for using Google, Yahoo, Facebook and more\n\nCheck your web browser’s history\n\nAnother good place to check for unauthorized access is browsing activity. Although a savvy user can always use a web browser’s Incognito or Private mode or delete browsing history, it doesn’t hurt to review.\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\nClick the three vertical dots on the upper-right side of your Chrome window. Hover on History for the most recent sites visited. Click History to see a full list.\n\n\n\nMozilla Firefox:\n\nClick the View history, saved bookmarks and more icon on the menu bar. (It looks like a row of books). Click on History.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Edge:\n\nSelect the three-dot menu for Settings and more. Choose History, then Manage history.\n\n\n\nSafari:\n\nOpen Safari. On the Apple menu bar, click History > Show All History.\n\nIncognito mode: Think it hides everything you search for? Not so fast. But there are a handful of reasons you should use it. Here are six you should try.\n\nReview recent logins\n\nTo see all the login activities on your PC, use Windows Event Viewer. This tool will show you all Windows services that have been accessed and logins, errors and warnings.\n\nTo access the Windows Event Viewer, click the search icon and type in Event Viewer. Click Windows Logs, then choose Security.\n\nThis will show you a list of all the login events on your PC. Under the Event ID column, look for the number 4624 for standard logons, 4672 for administrative logons and 4634 for logoffs. Click the entry for additional details and check if another user has logged in to your system while you’re away.\n\nOn a Mac, you can use the Console tool to check if someone attempted to wake your computer while it’s locked or in sleep mode.\n\nTo access this tool, use Spotlight Search (command + space), then look for the word Console, then press enter. On the Console window, click All Messages. In the search field in the upper-right side of the window, type “wake” to see all the relevant events and their timestamps.\n\nPC smarts: I compiled my favorite Windows tips only the pros know\n\nHow to stop others using your computer or tablet\n\nThe most basic security step is essential to keep others out: Lock your computer or tablet with a strong password when you’re not using it.\n\nThe lock screen suspends your activities and protects your work from would-be visual snoopers without completely shutting your computer down. On Windows, you can use the shortcut Windows key + L to lock your PC quickly.\n\nOn a Mac, you can use the shortcut Control + Shift + Eject (Control + Shift + Power button on Macs without disk drives) or Control + Command + Q to lock it quickly. You can also click on the Apple logo on the menu bar and select Lock Screen.\n\nNote: Make sure you set your Mac’s security options to require the password immediately after it’s locked. You can set this by opening System Preferences > Security & Privacy.\n\nWhile you're at it, update your password to something more complex. It's easy to fall into the trap of setting an elementary password on our home desktop or laptop, and I bet at least some of you lock down your tablet with \"1234\" or similar.\n\nUnique, complex passwords take more time to create, but they keep your information safe from anyone who wants to snoop around. Of course, you also need an excellent way to remember them.\n\nNeed password help? I bet you do. Here’s a simple how-to for creating strong passwords.\n\nAnd then there’s keyloggers\n\nKeyloggers are programs that exist solely to capture information coming from your keyboard. They're one tool hackers can use to steal your information, but companies, parents and even enterprising spouses can install them on your tech.\n\nThey come in software and hardware form and are not something to take lightly. Physical keyloggers are easy to hide inside computers, and you would never know. They can also sit on wires and cables, and if you don't know what you're looking for, you can easily miss it. Fortunately, these external keyloggers are limited in what they can do.\n\nHow can you spot them? Hardware keyloggers come in many forms, including a USB stick, cable or wall charger. Check your computer for anything that looks out of place or that you don’t remember plugging in.\n\nUnfortunately, the software counterparts are just as hard, if not harder, to detect. Plus, they can do a lot more damage. Luckily for you, you can use software to detect keyloggers on a Mac or PC.\n\nNow that you know the tricks of the trade, you can spot someone snooping through your tech. What you do with that information is up to you.\n\nOn my website, we have an active Q&A forum where you can post your tech questions and get answers you can trust from real tech pros, including me.

Police are also increasingly savvy about covering their tracks so as not to alert suspects of their interest.\n\nThat's the backdrop for recent revelations that the Trump-era U.S. Justice Department sought data from Apple, Microsoft and Google about members of Congress, their aides and news reporters in leak investigations — then pursued court orders that blocked those companies from informing their targets.\n\nMore:Access to Gooseberry and Hazard's beaches is being restricted, Newport residents claim\n\nIn just the first half of 2020 — the most recent data available — Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft together fielded more than 112,000 data requests from local, state and federal officials. The companies agreed to hand over some data in 85% of those cases. Facebook, including its Instagram service, accounted for the largest number of disclosures.\n\nConsider Newport, a coastal city of 24,000 residents that attracts a flood of summer tourists. Fewer than 100 officers patrol the city — but they make multiple requests a week for online data from tech companies.\n\nThat's because most crimes — from larceny and financial scams to a recent fatal house party stabbing at a vacation rental booked online — can be at least partly traced on the internet. Tech providers, especially social media platforms, offer a \"treasure trove of information\" that can help solve them, said Lt. Robert Salter, a supervising police detective in Newport.\n\n\"Everything happens on Facebook,\" Salter said. \"The amount of information you can get from people's conversations online — it's insane.\"\n\nAs ordinary people have become increasingly dependent on Big Tech services to help manage their lives, American law enforcement officials have grown far more savvy about technology than they were five or six years ago, said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.\n\nMore:Newport cracking down on noisy vehicles, short-term rentals\n\nThat's created what Cohn calls \"the golden age of government surveillance.\" Not only has it become far easier for police to trace the online trails left by suspects, they can also frequently hide their requests by obtaining gag orders from judges and magistrates. Those orders block Big Tech companies from notifying the target of a subpoena or warrant of law enforcement's interest in their information — contrary to the companies' stated policies.\n\nOf course, there's often a reason for such secrecy, said Andrew Pak, a former federal prosecutor. It helps prevent investigations getting sidetracked because someone learns about it, he said —\"the target, perhaps, or someone close to it.\"\n\nLongstanding opposition to such gag orders has recently resurfaced in the wake of the Trump-era orders. Apple in 2018 shared phone and account data generated by two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, but the politicians didn't find out until May, once a series of gag orders expired.\n\nMicrosoft also shared data about a congressional aide and had to wait more than two years before telling that person. Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, last week called for an end to the overuse of secret gag orders, arguing in a Washington Post opinion piece that \"prosecutors too often are exploiting technology to abuse our fundamental freedoms.\"\n\nCritics like Cohn have called for revision of U.S. surveillance laws drawn up years ago when the police and prosecutors typically had to deliver warrants to the home of the person being targeted for searches. Now that most personal information is kept in the equivalent of vast digital storehouses controlled by Big Tech companies, such searches can proceed in secret.\n\n\"Our surveillance laws are really based on the idea that if something is really important, we store it at home, and that doesn't pass the giggle test these days,\" Cohn said. \"It's just not true.\"\n\nMany tech companies are quick to point out that the majority of the information they are forced to share is considered \"non-content\" data. But that can include useful details such as the basic personal details you supply when you register for an account, or the metadata that shows if and when you called or messaged someone, though not what you said to them.\n\nLaw enforcement can also ask tech companies to preserve any data generated by a particular user, which prevents the target from deleting it. Doing so doesn't require a search warrant or any judicial oversight, said Armin Tadayon, a cybersecurity associate at advisory firm the Brunswick Group.\n\nIf police later find reasonable grounds for conducting a search, they can return with a warrant and seize the preserved data. If not, the provider deletes the copies and \"the user likely never finds out,\" Tadayon said.\n\nMore:Bill from Newport lawmakers would crack down on short-term rentals in RI like AirBnB and VRBO\n\nIn Newport, getting a search warrant for richer online data isn't that difficult. Salter said it requires a quick trip to a nearby courthouse to seek a judge's approval; some judges are also available after hours for emergency requests. And if a judge finds there is probable cause to search through online data, tech companies almost always comply.\n\n\"Most of the companies do play ball,\" Salter said. \"We can speak with people, get questions answered. They're usually pretty helpful.\"\n\nNearly all big tech companies — from Amazon to rental sites like Airbnb, ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft and service providers like Verizon — now have teams to respond to such requests and regularly publish reports about how much they disclosed. Many say they work to narrow overly broad requests and reject those that aren't legally valid.\n\nSome of the most dramatic increases in requests have been to tech companies that cater to younger people. As the messaging app Snapchat has grown in popularity, so have government requests for its data. Snap, the company behind the app, fielded nearly 17,000 data requests in the first six months of 2020, compared to 762 in the same period of 2015.\n\nSalter said the fact that we're all doing so much online means police detectives need to stay tech-savvy. But training courses for how to file such requests aren't hard to find.\n\nFor those worried about the growing volume of online data sought by law enforcement, Salter said: \"Don't commit crimes and don't use your computer and phones to do it.\"\n\n\"Judges are not going to sign off on something if we don't have probable cause to go forward,\" he said. \"We're not going to look at people's information without having something to go on.\"\n\nBut Cohn said more tech companies should be using encryption technology to make all personal information, including metadata, virtually impossible to decipher without a user key to unlock it.\n\nUntil then, she said, police can short circuit constitutional protections against unreasonable searches \"by just going to the company instead of coming directly to us.\"\n\nLiedtke reported from San Ramon, California.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/02/29/facebook-scam-imposters-use-facebook-messenger-lure-you-into-fraud/4891992002/", "title": "Friend or foe? Be on the alert for imposters and scammers on ...", "text": "Facebook Messenger is a great way to keep up with friends and family, but it can also be a method for scammers to defraud you, so be aware.\n\nHere's a likely scenario from a recent real-life case: A note arrives over Facebook Messenger that appears to be from a friend – right down to their name and photo – so you have no reason to question otherwise, at least at first.\n\n“Hey Marc, how are ya?”\n\n“I’m well, thanks. You?” I replied, while sipping a coffee at a local café.\n\n“Good, thanks. In fact, really good. Did you hear about the money I received from the International Financial Corporation Grant?”\n\nAs this was the first time I received such a message, my response was sincere: “Wow, that’s great, congrats!” I figured it was something tied to my friend’s work, as he’s an educator who publishes reports on teaching techniques for those who have special needs.\n\nBut my “Spidey sense” started tingling with what came next: “You should apply, too, as they’re granting a lot of money before the end of their fiscal year end, coming up. Let me send you a link about it.”\n\nAt this point, I knew this was a scam. I blocked the person and reported the incident to Facebook, and I sent a note to my friend to let him know his account was comprised and cloned by a cybercriminal.\n\nHow to get a better night's sleep?:Keep your tech out of the bedroom\n\nBefore Nintendo and Atari:How a black engineer changed the video game industry forever\n\nSniffing out Facebook fraudsters\n\nSuch a fraudulent exchange – had it gone further – would send you to a phony website to type in your personal information, and you’d be contacted shortly thereafter with the good news: You’ve been approved for a $80,000 grant (the exact amount varies between reports). After a short while you’ll be approached to pay a small fee, such as $1,200, to release the funds into your account.\n\nUnfortunately, many fall for it. Even if the scammers are unsuccessful in defrauding you, you’ve just filled out a form with valuable personal information, which can be used for identity theft.\n\nFacebook is acutely aware of these scams and has removed more than 3.2 billion fake accounts between April and September 2019, compared with more than 1.5 billion during the same period last year, according to the company’s last Community Standards Enforcement Report published in November.\n\nTo sniff out phony accounts, the social media giant says it’s employing more artificial intelligence measures and other technologies, along with better reporting tools, and human review as an additional layer of defense.\n\nPlaying defense against cyberscams\n\nBut there are a few precautions you can take to prevent and thwart scammers:\n\n•Never accept an invitation from someone you don’t recognize – or worse, it just says “Facebook User” and there’s no photo.\n\n• Even if you do recognize the person, or if they’re already a Facebook friend, be suspicious when receiving these kinds of messages over Facebook Messenger. If you aren’t sure if it’s really your friend, contact them in another fashion – like a phone call, email or text message -- and confirm it was sent by them. Chances are, it won’t be.\n\n• Block the person who sent you the message and report them to Facebook right away from within Facebook Messenger. On the app, tap the little “i” tab, select “Block” and then tap “Something’s Wrong” to report it. On the desktop version, tap the Options (an icon of a small gear) to do the same. You can also send a message to Facebook at phish@fb.com.\n\n• Use common sense. Never pay for a “free” grant. If you must pay something to receive a grant, it’s a scam. And it’s not just grants; similar scams involve fake lotteries, loans, and requests for charitable donations.\n\n• Watch out for “distress scams,” too. This is where you get a message that appears to be from one of your Facebook friends, saying they need money because of a situation they got themselves into. When in doubt, contact them in another fashion.\n\n• Be suspicious of attachments, whether they are sent over Facebook Messenger or in an email or text. They may contain malware (malicious software). Be equally as cautious with links to a website. If you accidentally fall for it and land on a page that is supposed to look like Facebook – it may have a similar blue logo and familiar layout – you’ll see the URL will be different.\n\n• Scammers are getting increasingly sophisticated, as evidenced by cloning a friend’s page, and their spelling and grammar is getting better, too. (In the past, misspelled words and awkward phrasings were giveaways of fraudulent efforts.) Some friend requests are A.I. ‘bots, too, which can be difficult to tell.\n\n• Change your password. Often. Many of us are guilty of not regularly changing passwords or using the same password for most or all online activity. While it’s less convenient, also enable two-factor authentication, where you’ll not only need a password to log into Facebook but a one-time code sent to your mobile device, as well, to confirm it’s really you.\n\n• Whether it’s a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop, enable auto updates so your operating system will be updated whenever software “patches” to vulnerabilities are found and fixed. On a related note, be sure to use anti-malware software and keep it up to date.\n\nFollow Marc on Twitter: @marc_saltzman.

It's also introducing an appeals process for Facebook users who believe their posts were removed in error.\n\nUntil now, Facebook had not publicly disclosed the lengthy rules given to its content reviewers to guide their decisions on whether to remove Facebook posts flagged for violating the Silicon Valley company's policies. And Facebook users, whose content was removed, had little recourse if they believed content reviewers made the wrong call.\n\nGrowing frustration that the policies — called community standards — are unclear and inconsistently enforced compelled Facebook to open up about how these decisions get made.\n\nFacebook executives say they want users to understand how company policies are applied to their Facebook posts. The company is also looking for feedback from Facebook users on the policies.\n\n\"We think the new community standards are going to give people the knowledge they need to say: 'We think you applied the policy incorrectly,'\" said Monika Bickert, vice president of global product management. \"This is going to be a way to give people a real voice in this process.\"\n\nThe new appeals process will give Facebook users the option of asking a team of content reviewers to take a second look when individual pieces of content are deleted for nudity or sexual activity, hate speech or violence, she said.\n\nHow it works\n\nIf your photo, video or post is removed for violating Facebook's rules, you will be given the option to \"Request Review.\" Appeals will be conducted by a \"community operations\" team within 24 hours. If Facebook determines it made a mistake removing content, it will be restored. Before the end of the year, Facebook will extend appeals to people who report content and are told it does not violate Facebook's rules.\n\nThe moves announced Tuesday are the latest in a series of efforts to restore public trust after 87 million people had their data taken without their consent by Cambridge Analytica, a British political firm with ties to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\nThey come amid growing scrutiny of blunders Facebook has made in policing content around the globe — from riots and lynchings sparked by the spread of hate speech and misinformation in countries such as Sri Lanka and Myanmar, to inflammatory posts attacking religions and races — even after U.S. users flagged them.\n\nFor example, Facebook refused to take down a photo of a black man missing a tooth and wearing a Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket on his head with the caption: \"Yeah, we needs to be spending dat money on food stamps wheres we can gets mo water melen an fried chicken.\"\n\nBut Ijeoma Oluo had her Facebook account suspended after she posted screenshots of racist comments and threats she received following a social media post. While on a road trip, the black activist had stopped at a Cracker Barrel, which has paid millions to settle lawsuits over racial discrimination, and posted, \"At Cracker Barrel 4 the 1st time. Looking at the sea of white folk in cowboy hats & wondering 'will they let my black ass walk out of here?'\" Facebook later apologized and pledged to improve its \"process on these important issues.\" It also removed some of the accounts that attacked Oluo.\n\nOver the past decade, Facebook has developed dozens of rules to draw the line between what should and shouldn’t be allowed on the platform to make Facebook a safer and less toxic place for its 2.2 billion users, from credible threats of harm to hate speech. The rules are interpreted differently from country to country depending on the language, culture and mores of Facebook users.\n\n\"Facebook seems to be taking a step forward by being a bit more open about its standards for filtering and moderating content,\" said Siva Vaidhyanathan, professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and author of Antisocial Media, an upcoming book on Facebook. \"But it still calls these standards ‘community standards’ as if Facebook constitutes a community. ... This whole process assumes there is — or perhaps creates — some global, universal standard of decency and appropriateness.\"\n\nFacebook's growing influence over permissible speech in one of the most crowded corners of the Internet has alarmed many. Some say Facebook isn't doing enough to remove harmful content. Others say Facebook is quickly becoming the world's largest and most dangerous censor. Both sides had called for greater transparency.\n\nThe diversity of content reviewers and their bosses has also been called into question. Conservatives say there's too much influence from the left-leaning Silicon Valley, with its liberal leadership and employees. Others say not having content reviewers who reflect the racial and ethnic make-up of the communities they serve leads to mistakes in enforcement.\n\nDuring Mark Zuckerberg's testimony on Capitol Hill, lawmakers accused Facebook of shutting down conservative voices such as the pro-Trump YouTube duo Diamond and Silk. Christian broadcasters have also complained that Facebook censors their voices.\n\nRep. Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-N.C., challenged Zuckerberg on the company's poor track record on diversity. \"This does not represent America,\" he said, waving a print-out of Facebook's all-white executive team.\n\n\"With the amount of content in our systems and the current systems we have in place to review, we have a small amount of mistakes, but that’s too many,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nRules on Facebook are different than laws in the United States and elsewhere. For example, Facebook defines hate speech as a direct attack — dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority or calls for exclusion or segregation — on people from protected groups. That means Facebook deletes calls for violence or slurs that may be protected free speech in the U.S. under the First Amendment.\n\nFacebook is not under any legal requirement to remove offensive content. A 1996 federal law shelters most technology companies from legal liability for the content users post on their services.\n\nFacebook executives say it's a difficult balancing act to weigh what is acceptable expression and what is not.\n\nAn internal meeting is held every two weeks to review policies and update them when appropriate. Facebook also conducts weekly audits of content reviewers' work to make sure they are following the guidelines consistently, Bickert says. But with millions of posts flagged each week, critics say content reviewers frequently have to make snap decisions on complex questions.\n\nDuring his testimony on Cambridge Analytica, Zuckerberg was asked by Sen. John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, about the company’s content screening policies and how it draws \"the line between what is and what is not hate speech.\"\n\nThe Facebook CEO said his company would increasingly rely on artificial intelligence in the next five to 10 years. In October, Facebook announced plans to hire 10,000 more human content reviewers.\n\n“We’re developing AI tools that can identify certain classes of bad activity proactively and flag it for our team at Facebook,” he said. But he acknowledged there are challenges.\n\n“Determining if something is hate speech is very linguistically nuanced,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/tech/wireless-carriers-locations-fcc/index.html", "title": "Wireless carriers keep your location data for years and provide it to ...", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nThe country’s largest wireless carriers not only know where you are every time you make a phone call or use your data connection, but they routinely hold onto that location information for months and in some cases years, providing it to law enforcement whether you like it or not, according to carrier letters made public last week by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nFrom data about which cell towers your smartphone has been communicating with to your specific GPS coordinates, your smartphone constantly gives off a tremendous amount of information on your whereabouts, the letters from AT&T, Verizon and other carriers show.\n\nFor example, T-Mobile retains granular latitude and longitude coordinates of devices on its network for up to 90 days, and less-granular cell-site location data for up to two years, the company told the FCC in a letter dated Aug. 3. Verizon said it holds cell-site data for up to one year, while AT&T said it may retain cell-site data for up to five years.\n\nThe company letters highlight how telecom companies, and not just tech platforms, cooperate with government requests for personal information — an issue that’s received intense scrutiny in recent months as new state laws restricting abortion have prompted critics to worry about cellular location data being used to prosecute abortion-seekers. In addition to sending official data requests to companies, government agencies have also resorted to simply buying personal data from the open market themselves, a practice US lawmakers have questioned authorities about this year.\n\nThat sensitive data, privacy advocates have said, can reveal whether a person may have visited an abortion clinic or sought other reproductive care, even if the location data was merely collected for the purposes of facilitating an unrelated call or mobile web search at the time.\n\n“Governments collect information for many reasons. But, all too often, data collected by the state is misused and weaponized for other purposes,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, wrote in a blog post this spring.\n\nFCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel didn’t explicitly mention potential risks related to reproductive care or abortion in her letters to more than a dozen top US wireless carriers in July. But the inquiries came less than a month after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn federal abortion rights in June, and amid heightened scrutiny of the many companies that handle location information and how they might respond to law enforcement requests for that data in connection with abortion prosecutions.\n\n“Given the highly sensitive nature of this data — especially when location data is combined with other types of data, the ways in which this data is stored and shared with third parties is of utmost importance to consumer safety and privacy,” Rosenworcel wrote at the time.\n\nLast week, Rosenworcel added she has called on the FCC’s enforcement bureau to investigate whether wireless carriers are doing enough to tell customers how their information is handled.\n\nThere are many reasons a wireless carrier collects location information from subscribers, the companies told the FCC. One main reason is simply to operate the network as consumers would expect. But there are other reasons, too. For example, FCC rules require that carriers provide detailed information to 911 dispatchers in an emergency, down to a device’s likely elevation so that first responders can more easily locate someone in need if they are on the fifth floor of a building.\n\nCarriers also collect location data for purposes that don’t directly relate to the provision of wireless services. Verizon, for example, told the FCC it may use location data as part of an offering to third-parties that can “develop insights to help estimate traffic patterns during the morning rush hour or how many customers go to a retail store.” AT&T told the FCC it may collect location information in order to serve subscribers targeted ads.\n\nWhile in some cases consumers may be able to opt out of this data collection — such as with AT&T’s advertising program — they generally cannot opt out of having their location data shared with law enforcement, the carrier letters said.\n\n“Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to law enforcement and other government entities by complying with court orders, subpoenas, and lawful discovery requests,” AT&T wrote to the FCC. “In all cases, we review requests to determine whether they are valid.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/18/irma-update-dried-up-supply-lines-leave-lessons-stores-frazzled-customers/668680001/", "title": "Dried-up supply lines before Irma leave lessons for stores, frantic ...", "text": "Waiting in line at Publix more than a week ago as Hurricane Irma bore down on Florida, Fort Myers' Christina Wyatt watched a heated argument break out over places in line.\n\nIt was among the frantic scenes that repeated in Southwest Florida as the massive storm marched closer after Labor Day weekend and people couldn't find water, plywood, gas, generators and other necessities.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that tempers flare,” Wyatt said Thursday as she cleared branches and debris in the morning heat outside her home, which was without power several days. “But you’ve got to be patient, and patient with each other. Nobody likes this.”\n\nFor more coverage of Hurricane Irma and the storm's aftermath visit: news-press.com/hurricane.\n\nFaced with what they called unprecedented demand, local retailers recounted efforts to keep shelves restocked while helping oft-panicked customers keep calm and informed – with lessons to be learned on both fronts for the next threat of Irma proportions.\n\n“No one has experienced anything to this volume, to this magnitude before,\" said Publix spokesman Brian West, \"to have a storm that really stretches from the Keys to the Panhandle in size, and it comes right up through the center of the state.\"\n\nPublix saw its statewide footprint of nearly 800 stores effectively receive double its normal demand in the span of only a couple days, West said.\n\nMore:Hurricane Irma update: Farmers assessing damage; U.S. Sugar reporting at least $20 million loss\n\n“Each time a truck would arrive, as soon as (products were) on the shelf, it was gone,” he said. “It’s hard to keep up with that kind of volume. We’re prepared. We just can’t get the product there quick enough. The demand has just been incredible.”\n\nMichael Wynn, president of Sunshine Ace Hardware, said the family owned business always increases hurricane supplies entering storm season and began adding more before Labor Day weekend as the threat from Irma grew.\n\nSome customers bought supplies over the three-day weekend. But Tuesday was “off the charts.\"\n\n“This storm in particular really frightened a lot of people,” he said. “We were literally getting trucks in almost everyday. We would bring in a significant amount of supply, and it would be gone within hours.”\n\nMore:Hurricane Irma update: Restaurants open in Fort Myers, Cape Coral, Sanibel, Lehigh, beaches\n\nVendors said hurricane preparation had been fairly lax for most of this storm season, perhaps because the southern half of the state had not suffered a significant hurricane since a wave of storms that included Charley in 2004 and Wilma in 2005.\n\nBut in the wake of mass flooding in Houston from Hurricane Harvey late last month, the unprecedented size and threat of Irma combined to create demand on both Florida coasts that overwhelmed stores, distribution centers and suppliers.\n\n“All of a sudden, all those (locations) were a target for impact for that storm,” Wynn said. “It was pulling on supply resources throughout the Southeast.”\n\nAs stores struggled to meet demand, photos spread on social media of empty water shelves at grocery stores and empty plywood shelves at lumber and hardware stores. Desperate homeowners who couldn't find plywood bought fencing, particle board, single boards and even plastic lattice to cover windows.\n\nIn the latter half of the week, the logistics worsened as retailers and suppliers began losing employees to evacuations and preparations at their own homes.\n\nTruck drivers stopped being sent into the southern half of the state given the mass exodus clogging what would be their own exits along Florida’s few north-bound routes.\n\n“The truck drivers couldn’t go down there and expect to get out,” said Home Depot spokesman Matt Harrigan, pointing as other retailers did to the need to get products to customers and make sure their own employees weren’t being endangered.\n\nMore:Hurricane Irma expected to batter, boost Florida’s economy\n\n“We have distribution centers with pre-staged loads, supply chain teams working around the clock. We were getting product to the stores as quickly as possible.”\n\nHome Depot has made about 7,000 shipments – either full or partial truckloads – of storm supplies to Houston and Florida before and after Harvey and Irma, Harrigan said.\n\n“Houston also needed help,” said Leonard Kinzel, manager of the Lowe’s Home Improvement in Fort Myers, where sand and wood shipping palettes were put out free for those in need after the store closed.\n\n“We have hurricane trucks ready to go. When you have a Cat(egory) 4 hit, you’re going to send all your supplies. When you have another Cat 4, everything has to swing around.”\n\nEven with shipments precisely tracked in modern business, many retailers lost the ability to tell customers when new products would arrive.\n\n“You had dealers all over the state trying to secure from the same warehouses,” Wynn said. “There were things you thought were reserved but they had to be back-filled from other warehouses that were out of the state. There were inevitable delays. We tried to communicate as best as we could to customers.”\n\nMore:Irma update: Lehigh residents wade home after the storm\n\nPlywood posed challenges because it isn’t warehoused in quantities large enough to meet the demand seen in Irma, Kinzel said.\n\n“You can’t just keep it out in the rain,” he said. “(New supplies) still have to come down from Georgia and the Carolinas.”\n\nBritt Beemer, a consumer trends and retailing expert, said as much as Florida’s narrow supply lines contributed to the problem, the biggest challenge was limited availability from suppliers in an era of stripped-down storage and “just-in-time” shipments.\n\n“The trouble with just in time means you just ran out,” he said of the common business principle. “Just in time means you can’t predict incredible demand in an emergency. I don’t think anybody could have imagined a disaster could impact an entire state the size of Florida.\"\n\nBeemer said supply chain management has become the No. 1 degree companies are hiring for and is being offered by more colleges. But Irma's impact was too great.\n\nMore:Irma update: Lee County declares Hurricane Irma 'major disaster'\n\n\"As companies are getting leaner and leaner, the companies with the best supply chain management always win,\" he said. \"Obviously companies have warehouses and distribution centers. Well those may not have enough of something to be able to supply 40 extra stores twice or three times what they used to sell.\"\n\nAfter Irma passed, the issues that plagued preparations were repeated for several days with the long lines and insufficient supply of gasoline across Southwest Florida.\n\nBut efforts to get products into the area before the storm helped many quickly reopen for customers needing food, water, ice, generators and other supplies.\n\nOne Publix location in North Fort Myers reopened partially on Monday under generator power. Employees escorted some elderly residents of the many nearby trailer parks through the aisles to help get needed supplies.\n\n“As soon as it was safe to be back in, we were trying to get open, even with a skeleton crew,\" West said.\n\nLowe's on Gladiolus Drive in Fort Myers, which reopened at 6 a.m. Tuesday, used its 500-gallon tank on site to supply gas to its available employees for the store to be able to open and quickly get chainsaws, generators and more to customers.\n\nMore:Hurricane Irma update: FEMA slow to respond, has few specifics for disaster recovery in Lee County\n\n“Right now the biggest need is battery-powered fans and portable air conditioners to run on generators,\" Kinzel said.\n\nWith many of its employees still evacuated shortly after Irma passed, Sunshine Ace turned to family members and even neighbors to carpool, fix older generators and more.\n\n“Our people were incredibly flexible,\" Wynn said. \"You get very creative during these times. We have found every which way. We’ve got a lot of great people that have just stood up and said, ‘Where can I help?’”\n\nBeemer, who has appeared across an array of national media for his America’s Research Group, said Irma’s circumstances are so unique that they may provide lessons for future business course case studies.\n\nOne Sunshine Ace location handed out numbers in line – grocery store deli style – to help customers feel more at ease that they weren’t being skipped in line.\n\nEven with stores under duress, Beemer said he might advise them to still take old-fashioned call lists to reach customers who were shut out of supplies.\n\nMore:Hurricane Irma update: 54 Lee schools still without power; schools remain closed through Friday\n\nAnd even with some employees getting “beat up so much by customers,” Beemer said it didn’t help in instances when employees fired back verbally.\n\nBut given that damage from Irma could have been much worse, many understood the lesson that there's only so much even modern supply lines can do. And that preparations in the future should start earlier than the week of a storm.\n\n\"The more prepared people are in advance, the better off all the different businesses can be to better serve them and make sure there's an equitable distribution of those supplies and products,\" Wynn said. \"So there's not that last-minute surge of demand, which frankly doesn't help the individuals and doesn't serve the community well.\"\n\nFollow @NewsPressSeth on Twitter.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/18"}]}

The numbers represent the sharpest increase and largest unhoused population since the federal government began tallying totals in 2007, the U.S. Department of Urban Planning and Development said Friday. Last year, federal data showed 582,462 people experienced homelessness.\n\nThe federal government calculates the number each year based on counts from local officials on a single night in January.\n\nThe population of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, who are particularly at risk of violence and criminalization, increased, as well as the number of people living in shelters.\n\nThe data comes months after the federal government found the U.S. is facing growing rates of poverty and food insecurity. In 2022, the most recent year for which data is available, more than 12% of the nation was living below the poverty line and nearly 13% said they didn't have enough to eat.\n\nThe U.S. saw such a sharp increase this year because more people are becoming unhoused faster, according to Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homeless. More people are also becoming homeless for the first time, she said.\n\n\"That move from a housed situation to an unhoused situation is happening more quickly, and it's more direct,\" Oliva said. \"More folks are reporting, as they're showing up in the homeless services system, that they're coming directly from a lease.\"\n\nUnlike in years past, the spike in U.S. homelessness was driven by increases among all populations and demographics, HUD said Friday, including unhoused families with children and unhoused veterans.\n\n\"It's alarming,\" Oliva said.\n\nRelated:Ticketed for being homeless? Supreme Court asked to weigh if punishment is 'cruel and unusual'\n\nWhy are more people becoming homeless?\n\nThe nation's unhoused population increased so sharply because people are becoming unhoused at a greater rate than people exit homelessness, HUD officials said Friday.\n\nIn recent years, homeless services providers have been particularly strained, according to Oliva, because more people need help, and at the same time it has been harder to get people housed because housing costs have increased.\n\n\"The cost of rent is outpacing our ability to get folks housed,\" she said.\n\nHigh housing costs continue to be a financial stressor for the poorest Americans. In recent years, more people in the U.S. are rent-burdened, according to HUD, meaning they spend more than 30% or even over 50% of their income on rent.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, as millions of Americans struggled with high rents, increasing grocery bills and other essential expenses, pandemic-era government financial assistance waned or ended, Oliva said.\n\n\"There's a pipeline of people who are deeply at risk,\" she said.\n\nEvictions nationwide have been steadily increasing since fall 2021, when the national eviction moratorium ended, according to Princeton University's Eviction Lab. In late 2022, emergency rental assistance from the federal government also stopped.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2022, the number of people who became homeless for the first time increased by 30%, according to HUD data.\n\nEven as more people became homeless and it became harder to house them, homeless services providers across the country helped more than 420,000 people in the U.S. exit or avoid homelessness, HUD announced this month.\n\nIn a statement Friday, U.S. Interagency Council on Homeless Executive Director Jeff Olivet said pandemic-era protections prevented even more people from falling into homelessness in 2021 and 2022.\n\n\"During the height of the pandemic, the nation came together and chose to invest more in housing, health care, income supports, and other wraparound services to prevent people from losing their homes in the first place,\" he said.\n\nMore children, veterans became homeless\n\nIn contrast to recent years, 2023 saw increases among homeless families with children, veterans and unaccompanied young people, HUD officials said Friday.\n\nSince 2022, the number of families with children experiencing homelessness rose by more than 15%. But the increase was almost completely driven by families who were able to access homeless shelters, HUD said.\n\nVeteran homelessness, which had historically seen some of the steepest declines in the U.S., increased by more than 7%. From 2020 to 2022, veteran homelessness dropped by more than 11%.\n\nUnaccompanied people ages 24 and younger made up 22% of all homeless young people in 2023, HUD said. Since last year, the number of unaccompanied homeless young people increased by 15%, including increases for sheltered and unsheltered youth. Foster youth who age out of the foster care system without secure housing and LGBTQ+ youth are some of the groups most likely to fall into youth homelessness.\n\nThese cities reduced homelessness, fought evictions\n\nAcross the country, elected officials and nonprofits in some cities have reduced homelessness by working with landlords and helping people remain in their homes.\n\nHouston saw a 17% drop in street homelessness, after more than 4,500 residents were moved from the street to housing or prevented from becoming homeless, the mayor's office says.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the city's eviction diversion program helped a majority of participating landlords and tenants avoid evictions, by mediating any landlord-tenant disputes without taking cases to court.\n\nThis year, Chattanooga, Tennessee, saw more than a 30% drop in unsheltered homelessness after officials used American Rescue Plan money to pay people's rents and axed a lottery process the county had used for housing vouchers. The city also worked directly with landlords to prevent evictions and keep people housed.\n\nLocal providers put in the hard work and saw positive results, Oliva said, and \"their housing market is not quite as tight as as what you see on the coasts and in some other big cities,\" she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/06/20/california-accounts-for-nearly-one-third-of-the-nations-homeless-people/70340309007/", "title": "Nearly one-third of nation's homeless population lives in California ...", "text": "Nearly one third of all people who are unhoused in the United States live in the Golden State, according to a new study released Tuesday.\n\nThe California Statewide Study of People Experiencing Homelessness also reveals 50% of all unsheltered people in the country – who may or may not have a car to sleep in – live in California. Almost 90% reported that the cost of housing was the main reason they could not escape homelessness.\n\n\"The results of the study confirm that far too many Californians experience homelessness because they cannot afford housing,\" wrote Margot Kushel, a principal investigator of the study and director at the University of California, San Francisco's Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative.\n\nThe study encompasses findings from nearly 3,200 surveys and 365 in depth interviews with adults experiencing homelessness across the state between October 2021 and November 2022. It is the \"largest representative study of homelessness in the United States since the mid-1990s,\" according to the study, which was requested by California Governor Gavin Newsom's administration, Fortune reported.\n\nMore than one million people experience homelessness in the United States in a given year and many more are at risk of losing their homes, according to the Biden administration. Florida, New York and Washington also had high rates of homelessness last year, the Annual Homeless Assessment Report shows. The report provides data and analysis for funding decisions by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nWhat does the study reveal?\n\nThe study found that many people cannot afford homes in the state. Nearly all people surveyed said they \"face barriers,\" like poor credit history, discrimination, health challenges or prior evictions, when trying to rent or buy a home. California is experiencing a housing shortage crisis, and the states is home to some of the most unaffordable places to live in the country.\n\nThe research shows \"the incalculable personal costs of homelessness,\" Kushel wrote in the release.\n\nCalifornia's homeless population is growing older in age with the median age of participants being 47-years-old, the new research shows, with nearly half of the state's homeless population being 50-years-old or older. An overrepresented majority are Latino (35%), Black (26%) and Native American (12%).\n\nA vast majority of people surveyed were from or last housed in California. And about 20% of the unhoused people surveyed came straight from institutions.\n\nTwo-thirds of all participants surveyed reported struggling with mental health issues at the time they were surveyed. And 72% had experienced some type of physical violence in their lifetime, the findings show.\n\nMany of the unhoused people the institute surveyed are looking for jobs. \"Participants were disconnected from the job market and services, but almost half were looking for work,\" a news release attached to the study reads.\n\nBiden administration:Unveils initiative to combat homelessness in 5 US cities, California\n\nTo combat the growing housing needs, the group is recommending six policy changes, including:\n\nIncreasing \"access to housing affordable to extremely low-income households;\"\n\nExpanding \"targeted homelessness prevention, such as financial supports and legal assistance;\"\n\nProviding \"robust supports to match the behavioral health needs of the population;\"\n\nUpping \"household incomes through evidence-based employment supports;\"\n\nGrowing \"outreach and service delivery to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness;\" and\n\nEmbedding \"a racial equity approach in all aspects of homeless system service delivery.\"\n\nIn an attempt to reduce homelessness nationwide by 25% by January 2025, the Biden administration last month unveiled an initiative called \"ALL INside\" to help unhoused people in cities with high homeless populations access federal services.

Gutowski, now 55, was left with only $120. First, she lived in her Chevrolet Cavalier, then briefly at a shelter that shuttered 16 months after launching.\n\nNow Gutowski, who uses a walker, lives in a tent and sleeps on a cot under five layers of blankets in Morrison Centennial Park, about a mile and a half from the house she lived in most of her life. She has lymphedema, diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease, and this summer she might face more challenges living without a house.\n\nGrants Pass, a city of about 40,000, is at the center of a Supreme Court fight pitting the unhoused community against local officials, who say they want control of their parks back. The Supreme Court could have a deep impact on Gutowski and about 600 others who live outdoors when the judges on Monday hear arguments in a case about whether the city can enforce a ban on camping and sleeping at all times, in all public spaces.\n\n\"I don't like having to try to survive out here. It's not comfortable and it's not warm,\" Gutowski said during a recent phone interview.\n\nHomeless advocates argue the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment protects people from being punished based on a personal status outside their control − like being homeless, according to David Peery, a lawyer with the National Coalition for the Homeless. If Grants Pass wins the case, he said, homeless residents could face punishment for using as little as one blanket outside, in addition to any tent or other covering.\n\n\"This is the biggest human rights case you've never heard of,\" Peery said.\n\nCity leaders await Supreme Court hearing\n\nCity leaders in the Ninth Circuit, which includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, are watching closely as the hearing approaches. Lawyers representing each side say the court's decision would impact a large chunk of the country's unsheltered homeless population, either protecting them from criminalization or giving local authorities more leeway to permanently prevent sleeping in public.\n\nIf the court sides with the unhoused community in Grants Pass, cities and states across the U.S. that have similar 24-hour bans on sleeping in public will be unable to enforce them, legal experts told USA TODAY. If the court sides with Grants Pass, authorities in the Ninth Circuit can start ticketing and arresting people for sleeping outside.\n\nNational attention surrounding the case has increased stigma in Grants Pass, Gutowski said. These days, more residents − including children in the park − hurl nasty words her way.\n\n\"It wasn't that long ago that I was a part of that same community that is now looking at all of us and thinking we're the lowest scum of the Earth, that we should just be wiped off or bused out of the city,\" she said.\n\nFLORIDAGov. DeSantis signs bill banning homeless from camping in public spaces\n\nLike across the country, nonprofit food and health care providers and religious groups form a small but mighty stopgap for the unhoused in Grants Pass. Volunteers serve hot food and a nonprofit, Mobile Integrative Navigation Team, provides free transportation to much-needed medical care. But without housing or shelter, people remain living outdoors.\n\nFor the past three years, elected officials in Grants Pass have tried to create an appropriate shelter space, but nothing has worked, Mayor Sara Bristol told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We need to help establish a place where people can legally sleep, and it's been a real uphill battle with all kinds of different challenges,\" she said.\n\nWhat is the Grants Pass ruling about?\n\nIn this case, Grants Pass says it needs to be able to clear residents like Gutowski out of parks. But the city hasn't been able to enforce its around-the-clock camping ban on public property.\n\nThat's because a 2022 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decision ruled homeless people in places without enough shelter beds have an Eighth Amendment right not to face punishment for living outside and protecting themselves from the elements. In Grants Pass, that has meant tents, tarps and other belongings dot parks while public benches and picnic tables are often used for sleeping.\n\nAuthorities have been enforcing an ordinance that prevents people from setting up their tents in the same spot indefinitely, Bristol told USA TODAY. But lawyers handling the city's case say that's not adequate.\n\nAppeals court decisions have \"limited the ability of towns and cities, large and small, to address this crisis and have taken away the ability to really address what's happening in our communities,\" said Theane Evangelis, one of the lawyers arguing the case for Grants Pass.\n\nHomeless rights advocates say the enforcement city leaders want will only make the country's homeless crisis worse, having dire consequences for unhoused populations where people from marginalized communities are overrepresented.\n\nSome legal historians also argue the Supreme Court should not overlook the history of anti-camping bans, including vagrancy laws that served to bar people from certain spaces based on their race. In the 1800s, vagrancy laws in many parts of the U.S. largely targeted formerly enslaved people.\n\n\"That is our legacy, this desire to purge undesirable people from communities, to drive people out,\" said Sara Rankin, a law professor at Seattle University, and author of The Wrong Side of History, a study tracing the origins of anti-camping laws.\n\nLIVING OUTDOORSA homeless man living on national forest land was shot by federal police. He's now suing\n\nWhere are homeless residents allowed to go?\n\nIn the West, cities like Denver, Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and San Diego, can offer homeless people spots in new hotel programs and sanctioned campsites to clear away encampments.\n\nBut unlike those big cities, Grants Pass doesn't have the same forms of assistance to offer unhoused residents, Evangelis said.\n\nThere is no city-run shelter, only a church-run program for homeless people that includes a shelter that requires residents to work. Transitional housing, in the form of a tiny home village, opened in 2021, but there are only 17 slots. Due to a severe lack of affordable housing in Grants Pass, turnover at the facility is low, service providers said.\n\n\"The city has no way to limit encampments, and it has no way to encourage people to accept services and to find a place indoors,\" Evangelis said.\n\nWhy does Grants Pass want to ban blankets, pillows, cardboard?\n\nA 24-hour ban would give the city authority to clean up all encampments, said Judge Glock, director of research at the Manhattan Institute, a think tank supporting individual freedom and the rule of law.\n\n\"The main reason they should clear these encampments, even in the nighttime hours, is that these spaces aren't fit for human habitation,\" said Glock, who along with other researchers filed an amicus brief in support of Grants Pass. \"A lot of these encampments are an incredible danger to the homeless themselves.\"\n\nIf the city wins the Supreme Court case, Glock said, it should build more homeless shelters so that its unhoused residents have somewhere to go.\n\nBut in her first year in office, Bristol and city council members tried to launch a sanctioned campsite so that unhoused people could put their tents somewhere that wasn't a park. But the plan went sideways and transformed into an effort to purchase a building for an indoor shelter, she said.\n\nThat idea fell apart, Bristol said, when in late 2022 Grants Pass residents pushed back, saying the site was too centrally located. It also would have been right across from a children's dance studio, said Ruth Sears, the studio building owner.\n\n\"For the most part, we were compassionate and recognized something needed to be done to help people in need, but that was a terrible location and would have impacted so many,\" Sears, 72, told USA TODAY.\n\nAs of this year, there is no shelter where someone living outdoors can go at night, and no money left for the city to fund any more plans, Bristol said.\n\nThe lack of shelter means that if the Supreme Court sides with Grants Pass, there wouldn't be any places in town − indoors or outdoors − where an unhoused person could legally sleep, said Gutowski.\n\n\"Where are all these people going to go? There are no other shelters,\" Gutowski said. \"I’m worried about them leaving the city and going up into the mountains.\"\n\nHomeless advocates warn against criminalization\n\nNational homeless rights advocates have decried the sweeping camping ban Grants Pass wants to enforce, arguing punitive measures work against efforts to end homelessness. More affordable housing and assistance with health care will help homeless people, not laws banning sleeping outside, said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness.\n\n\"As communities address the homelessness crisis, they must follow the evidence of what works best − providing immediate help by connecting people to low-barrier shelter and services, while the long-term affordable housing and services are put in place,\" she said.\n\nAn arrest record stemming from a camping ban would make it harder for someone to secure a job or housing, making it more likely they'd end up in jail repeatedly, said Samantha Batko, a researcher at the Urban Institute who studies city budgets.\n\n\"Criminalization doesn't solve homelessness,\" she said. \"What happens is, this cycle of arrests and citations get people caught in a homelessness-jail cycle.\"\n\nEvangelis said the 24-hour camping ban has come as a last resort.\n\n\"This is just the bread and butter of running a city,\" she said, adding that concerns from advocates about increased criminalization of unhoused people are \"unfounded.\"\n\n\"They want to be just like cities outside of the Ninth Circuit who have all of the tools available,\" she said of Grants Pass.\n\nEd Johnson, a public defender in Grants Pass, first took on the case after learning unhoused people were receiving camping fines they couldn't pay. Fines are also a huge burden to homeless people, said Johnson, who is not related to the named plaintiff in the case, Gloria Johnson.\n\nCity advocates, however, say they're necessary.\n\n\"Whatever the dangers of a fine − those can be a danger for some people out there − they pale in comparison to the danger they are facing in the encampments,\" Glock said.\n\nAcross the country, statistics also show people of color are more likely to become homeless than their white counterparts, due to systemic racial and housing discrimination, Johnson said.\n\nLast year, Black people made up 13% of the U.S. population, but accounted for 37% of all homeless people, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 2023 there was also a 40% and 28% increase in the number of Asians and Latinos, respectively, experiencing homelessness.\n\nPeery, who is Black, briefly ended up behind bars after a Miami landlord evicted him when he got laid off during the Great Recession in 2008. He was homeless for the next 10 years.\n\n\"Aside from the fact that it takes you away from where you're at and scatters you, the hit to your psyche just sends you into a fog,\" Peery said, adding, \"there's a huge racial equity component to this.\"\n\nFor Rankin, anti-camping laws that prohibit tents and bedding are the latest version of vagrancy laws.\n\n\"That instinct that lives on is about punishing unemployment,\" she said, describing how going back centuries, elected leaders and other officials have used criminalization to rid cities of homeless people perceived to be \"economic threats.\"\n\nWhen was the last time SCOTUS heard a homeless case?\n\nIt has been decades since the Supreme Court heard a case that could criminalize those experiencing homelessness.\n\nIn 1972, the Supreme Court overturned a Jacksonville, Florida, law prohibiting vagrancy. The law banned begging and applied to people who slept during the day and wandered at night, the Florida Times-Union, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nThe ruling in Papachristou v. Jacksonville said the city's anti-vagrancy ordinance, which led to hundreds of arrests, made it too easy for authorities to criminalize activities that are \"normally innocent.\"\n\nAcross the country, states and cities outside the Ninth Circuit have in recent years passed more camping bans, to respond to growing unsheltered populations and encampments that block sidewalks and other public spaces.\n\nIn Supreme Court documents, lawyers representing homeless residents said most cities with anti-camping ordinances don't go as far as the ordinance in Grants Pass.\n\nOut of 200 cities with populations similar to that of Grants Pass, more than 80% do not ban sleeping on all public property, at all times, according to amicus briefs. In most other cities, bans are in place with exceptions, like allowing camping when there are no shelter beds available.\n\n\"Whatever their merits as a matter of public policy, such laws do not punish the status of homelessness in the way that the\" Grants Pass ordinance does, lawyers wrote.\n\nNo matter what happens in late June, there will still be hundreds of homeless people living outdoors in Grants Pass, Gutowski said.\n\nAt that point, care teams will still be helping, reminding the people in tents that they matter, she said.\n\n\"They're our angels. They truly are,\" Gutowski said. \"Not everybody realizes that, but the ones that help, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/21/florida-camping-ban-homeless-public-spaces/73048034007/", "title": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signs bill banning homeless encampments", "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation Wednesday prohibiting local municipalities from allowing people to camp or sleep on public property, vowing that the measure would ensure \"homeless individuals have the resources they need to get back on their feet.\"\n\nAt the bill signing, DeSantis and top Republicans in the Florida Legislature highlighted that their anti-public camping bill would provide what are known as \"wraparound services,\" including mental health care, for the state's homeless population. The governor said the bill \"will help maintain and ensure that Florida streets are clean and that Florida streets are safe for our residents.\"\n\nThe legislation, which takes effect Oct. 1, requires municipalities to designate a specific public space for camping and sleeping, if the shelters are full, with approval from the state Department of Children and Families. They must include security, behavioral health services and bathrooms with running water.\n\nThe bill's sponsor, Rep. Sam Garrison, R-Fleming Island, earlier told the USA TODAY Network that the state has allocated $30 million – $10 million more than the previous year – for what are known as \"continuums of care\" to prepare for the law. Continuums of care are the regional bodies coordinating housing and services for homeless people.\n\nBut critics say the state's $30 million appropriation for the measure isn't enough.\n\n\"We're going to need so much more funding if we're going to build up these resources,\" said Megan Sarmento, an outreach program manager for the Florida Harm Reduction Collective in Tampa. \"Even now, how the system is, we are finding people on the streets and are unable to link them to care because of the lack of resources, including housing and detox.\"\n\nHomeless shelter fraud:Latest case of homeless shelter contract fraud in NYC highlights schemes across the nation\n\n'Resources are either scarce or not allowed'\n\nDeSantis said the law was Florida's way of preventing cities from looking like San Francisco, a city he has criticized for its \"leftist policies\" and for allowing parks and sidewalks \"to be overwhelmed with tent cities and homeless encampments.\"\n\n\"These are difficult issues, but you should not be accosted by a homeless like we see,\" DeSantis said at Wednesday's news conference. \"You should be able to walk down the street and live your life.\"\n\nCritics have said the legislation unfairly targets a vulnerable population and places limits on municipalities struggling to deal with their homeless population. The measure has no penalties for those living on the streets, but it allows local residents, businesses and the state attorney general to sue local governments that don’t follow the restrictions.\n\nThe state's homeless population was estimated to be about 30,809 in 2023, according to the Florida Department of Health. Sarmento works in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, which ranked third and fourth in the number of homeless people last year.\n\nCurrently in Hillsborough, only one detox facility that takes people without insurance, and it's always full, she said. \"I think the idea of providing wraparound services is great, but the two services that people want the most, detox and medications for opioid use disorder, those resources are either scarce or not allowed,\" Sarmento said.\n\nAmerica's homeless crisis:Unhoused people in these rural areas remain 'invisible'\n\nConservative think tank, others behind bill\n\nAccording to the January 2022 Point-in-Time Count, 582,462 people were experiencing homelessness across America. As the number of people experiencing homelessness rises across the country, states and cities have turned to numerous possible solutions such as re-housing programs, providing rental assistance, increasing the number of shelters, and establishing coordinated outreach centers.\n\nBut an increasing number of cities and states have passed laws making it illegal to live out of tents and cars or sleep in public spaces.\n\nIn 2021, the National Homelessness Law Center released a national study on state laws criminalizing homelessness. Almost every state, 48 in total, has implemented at least one law that prohibits or restricts the conduct of people experiencing homelessness, according to the study.\n\nThe study added that 17 states had already criminalized camping in public places and noted that a camping ban \"unnecessarily displaces a person experiencing homelessness to another public place, where they might find themselves at risk of subsequent enforcement.\"\n\nThe conservative, Texas-based Cicero Institute, a policy research group, has advocated for states to adopt restrictions like the new Florida law. Republican megadonor and billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel has promoted the idea, along with Joe Lonsdale, a tech investor who hosted a Texas fundraiser for DeSantis during his now-suspended presidential campaign.\n\nStateline previously reported that there had been nine bills introduced in six states between 2021 and 2022 that used similar or the same language as legislation by the Cicero Institute.\n\nRelated:Supreme Court to decide if ticketing people who are homeless is 'cruel' punishment\n\nContributing: John Kennedy, USA TODAY Network – Florida; Claire Thornton, USA TODAY\n\nAna Goñi-Lessan, state watchdog reporter for the USA TODAY Network – Florida, can be reached at agonilessan@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/07/48-major-us-cities-struggling-to-shelter-growing-homeless-population/40242171/", "title": "Cities with growing homeless populations to shelter", "text": "Thomas C. Frohlich\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nThe number of people experiencing homelessness in the United States in 2018 increased for the second consecutive year. In 2017, homelessness had increased for the first time in seven years. On a single night last year, more than half a million Americans lacked permanent shelter, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nA significant number of people staying in sheltered locations in January 2018 – about 4,000 – were likely displaced by presidentially declared national disasters, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate.\n\nThe problem of homelessness is at its root a problem of affordable housing. According to statistics compiled by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, 11 million low-income households spend half or more of their annual income on housing. As housing prices – especially in large cities – continue to rise faster than incomes, more people are likely to become homeless.\n\nHousehold income:States with the highest and lowest averages; Maryland leads the way, data shows\n\nNight life:The night economies of America's biggest cities\n\nThere are serious health risks associated with homelessness, which increases exposure to weather and disease. Homelessness can also lead to – and is often accompanied by – untreated medical issues, mental illness, social isolation, and increased risk of substance use disorders.\n\nWhile the number of families with children experiencing homelessness declined between 2017 and 2018, a large share of the country’s homeless population are children. More than 180,000 people in families with children and approximately 36,000 individuals under 25 experienced homelessness.\n\nAmong the myriad of government anti-poverty programs is the Continuum of Care Program, which was designed by HUD to promote community efforts across the nation to end homelessness. Federal funds are dispersed through these jurisdictions to the communities they contain – cities, counties, and sometimes entire states.\n\nUsing data provided by HUD, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the estimated total number of individuals experiencing homelessness in the 48 HUD jurisdictions (Continuums of Care) representing the 50 largest cities in America. City population data is for the city proper and came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018 American Community Survey. Cities are ranked by total population, in ascending order.\n\nTo identify the cities with the most unsheltered homeless people, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) for the 48 Continuums of Care (CoC) identified as major cities. The CoCs identified as major cities with the highest percentage of their overall homeless population that is unsheltered were considered the cities with the most unsheltered homeless people. The AHAR defines CoCs as “local planning bodies responsible for coordinating the full range of homelessness services in a geographic area, which may cover a city, county, metropolitan area, or an entire state.”\n\nHomeless populations for each CoC are estimated during one night in the last week of January each year. Shelters include emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, safe havens, rapid re-housing programs, permanent supportive housing programs, and other permanent housing programs. The percentage of homeless people in families, in families with children, and the level of chronic homelessness – individuals who have been homeless for one year or more – also came from the HUD. Total population for the city proper is from the 2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates. All other data is from the 2018 AHAR report.\n\n48.

Even though I was giving the other ones food, or I’d say, ‘I’d like to talk to you. I’m a film director, I have some lunch for you.’ They’d take the lunch and pretty much (tell me to) kiss off,” said Akers, who also is a minister.\n\nAkers’ documentary, “Homeless in the South,” which also focuses on homeless populations in North Carolina, Alabama and Georgia, will be screened at the Peace Center on June 29.\n\nGreenville’s transformation into a popular destination for tourists and businesses has been remarkable, but the positive press has overshadowed the city’s struggles with poverty and homelessness, said Akers, an Ohio native who moved to the Upstate 16 years ago.\n\nWhen he first began filming, Akers didn’t realize the depth of Greenville’s homeless situation.\n\nIn one particular area, “they had about 40 people there. It was like going back in time. I could not believe it. This is Greenville; it’s beautiful. You just don’t see it. And I was thinking to myself two things. One, there’s got to be more I can do than just give them a sandwich. And two, making the transition from Ohio to South Carolina, and having some medical issues and restrictions, not sure about the plight of my own circumstances, this could be me. Then I started researching and realizing, there’s a whole lot of people who are just one paycheck from being homeless.”\n\nMore:Faith sustains, empowers Hillcrest High graduate who was homeless\n\nAccording to statistics from United Housing Connections, Greenville has hundreds of people who can be described as homeless at any given time. A Point in Time Count from January 2017 found more than 600 people who were considered homeless. That included people living in emergency shelters and transitional housing.\n\nThe PIT Count is considered a snapshot of homelessness in Greenville for a single night, but those figures don’t include people who are staying with family or friends or living in motels, said Natalie Worley, director of program planning and evaluation for United Housing Connections.\n\nAccording to 2016 figures from United Housing Connections, Greenville has the largest homeless population of any county in the state, totaling around 20 percent of the 2016 PIT Count.\n\nWhile the homeless population is larger, resources such as food are more easily accessed here than in other cities around the region, Akers said.\n\nAs Akers sees it, the availability of food is a factor in why Greenville’s homeless community is friendlier than others he has encountered.\n\nMore:Student homelessness increases in SC, nation\n\nAtlanta may be a bigger city, but the size makes it more difficult for people without transportation to find their way to soup kitchens on the other side of town.\n\nIn Greenville, “there are so many different agencies that feed them, churches that feed them, people that feed them. Even people out in the street, ‘Hey, I won’t give you any money, but I’ll go in here and buy you a sandwich.’ So they’re not hungry. They can get food; they got food. So I think that’s one key component, from my opinion, being in the field and watching, versus other cities where people are not so ready to give. Greenvillians are very kind-hearted in that aspect. … People ain’t feeding them in Georgia; they’ve got to get out and get it themselves.”\n\nHe also was surprised to learn how many different levels of homelessness there are. Some folks live on the streets, but others may be staying with family members, in shelters or in extended-stay hotels. Some are chronically or permanently homeless, while others may be able to get off the streets and into transitional housing. There are people suffering from addiction or mental illness, women who lose their homes after a divorce, military veterans who suffer from the after-effects of their service.\n\nStacey Ashmore works with Greenville Family Partnership, and he’s involved in homeless ministries with his church, Greenville Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Ashmore introduced Akers to many of the homeless folks featured in Akers’ film.\n\nOne of the biggest factors in Greenville's homeless problem is the shortage of affordable housing, Ashmore said.\n\n“Greenville has grown, but the salaries have not grown. The cost of living is high, especially in the inner city,” he said.\n\nOn the west side, in particular, rents have risen and some of the less-expensive rental homes have been replaced with higher-priced condominiums, Ashmore said.\n\nOne of the goals of the film was to show the effects of homelessness on individuals and on the community as a whole, Akers said.\n\n“I tried to paint the picture from a 360-degree angle, not just based upon the concept of being homeless, but the totality of how this problem affects society, how it’s rising,” he said. “You take for instance the property damage that they leave. … There’s sewage and things like this in these camps. … The disease increase that this will have is just not addressed. And there are some that don’t want help. I think that’s the hardest part for service providers, is that the schematic of homelessness is so huge, it’s not one solution.”\n\nBut Akers has another goal as well. He hopes viewers will come away with “more compassion, more understanding, and to have a different perspective. Because doing a documentary changed my perspective.”\n\nYOU CAN GO\n\nWhat: “Homeless in the South” film screening\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. June 29\n\nWhere: Peace Center’s Gunter Theatre\n\nHow much: $10\n\nFor more: www.peacecenter.org", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/11/03/gavin-newsom-blocks-homelessness-funding/8263455001/", "title": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom blocks $1 billion in homelessness ...", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California's plans to reduce the nation's largest homeless population aren't good enough, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday, prompting him to halt $1 billion in state spending for local governments as he seeks to reset the state's strategy ahead of his expected second term in office.\n\nCalifornia's homeless population — likely higher than the 161,000 people estimated in 2020 — is one of the state's most pressing and public problems as the high cost of living has only increased the size and number of homeless encampments that dot cities throughout the state.\n\nFor decades, California's state government has viewed homelessness as a local issue, handing cities and counties tens of billions of dollars to design and run programs aimed at getting people off the street and into permanent housing. That included a recent commitment by state lawmakers to spend $15.3 billion over the next three years.\n\nBut the state's homeless population seemed to grow in concert with increased state spending, frustrating officials. California's counties, 13 largest cities and groups of homeless service providers were in line to receive about $1 billion in state homelessness spending, but only if they submitted plans on how they would use the money to reduce the number of unsheltered homeless people.\n\nOn Thursday, Newsom declared those plans were \"simply unacceptable\" as they would collectively reduce the state's homeless population by just 2% over the next four years. He said he would pause spending until after a meeting with local officials this month to \"review the state's collective approach to homelessness.\"\n\nLASTING EFFECTS START EARLIER THAN YOU THINK:Children experiencing homelessness rarely enrolled in early learning programs\n\n\"At this pace, it would take decades to significantly curb homelessness in California,\" Newsom said in a news release. \"Everyone has to do better — cities, counties, and the state included. We are all in this together.\"\n\nLocal leaders were not happy.\n\n\"Now is not the time to play politics when people's lives are at stake,\" said Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities. \"Failing to release state funding will not put roofs over the heads of Californians or deliver desperately needed supportive services.\"\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said he shared Newsom's frustration but that his city needed the funds to maintain more than 1,100 shelter beds. In Oakland, Mayor Libby Schaaf, who leads a coalition of mayors of the state's 13 largest cities, said her city followed the state's process as instructed.\n\nIn San Jose — the 10th largest city in the U.S., with more than 1 million residents — Mayor Sam Liccardo said if Newsom wanted to be bold in solving the homeless crisis, he would dedicate 10% of the state's recent historic budget surpluses to build housing and require homeless people to take permanent housing when it is offered, among other reforms.\n\n\"Let's put down the megaphones and pick up the shovels,\" Liccardo said.\n\nIn the state Legislature, Senate Republican Leader Scott Wilk criticized Newsom for taking too long to act, while Democratic Assemblymember Jim Wood said he \"wholeheartedly applaud(s)\" the move.\n\n\"The money is not going to go very far and you're not going to make much of a dent unless you figure out a different way to do things,\" Wood said.\n\nA common plea echoed by mayors and advocates for the homeless was the need for dedicated funding so cities and counties can plan ahead and ramp up the number of people they expect to help.\n\nChione Flegal, executive director of Housing California, said $1 billion sounds big but it's a \"drop in the bucket relative to the incredible need folks are facing.\" She said there also needs to be massive investment in public health, affordable housing stock and the social net to really solve homelessness.\n\nNewsom is running for reelection this year and is likely to win a second term as he faces a little-known Republican state senator. But Newsom's political future, including a possible run for president, could be complicated by California's persistent homelessness crisis.\n\nSince taking office in 2019, Newsom has been more aggressive in setting and enforcing a statewide homelessness policy. In 2019, the Newsom administration sued the Southern California city of Huntington Beach, accusing local officials of ignoring the state's affordable housing requirements.\n\n'I DON'T HAVE ANY FAITH IN THE SYSTEM':Soaring housing costs have renters mulling how they’ll vote in the midterms\n\nEarlier this year, the Newsom administration launched a first-of-its-kind investigation of San Francisco's housing policies aimed at figuring out why it takes officials there so long to approve housing projects. And last month, the Newsom administration and the state attorney general joined a lawsuit against the city of Anaheim alleging officials there violated state housing laws.\n\nIn the past year, the Newsom administration says it has cleared 1,600 homeless encampments, cleaning up 2,227 tons of trash, enough to fill more than 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools. He also signed a new law that will let judges force some homeless people into treatment — a controversial proposal opposed by civil rights advocates who say it goes too far.\n\nAdvocates for the homeless say compelling treatment when there are not enough beds or services and cleaning up encampments will not seriously reduce the number of unhoused people in California.\n\n\"People experiencing homelessness are not garbage to be thrown away,\" Flegal said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/06/28/supreme-court-grants-pass-advocates-react-homelessness/74191106007/", "title": "Supreme Court decision on homeless could lead to more ...", "text": "Advocates for unhoused people warn the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in a major case on camping bans will make the homeless crisis worse, forcing more people into a cycle of jail, debt and living on the streets.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Grants Pass, Oregon, a small city with a large homeless population. The justices said the town can go ahead with its ban on sleeping in public with bedding, which will prohibit unhoused people from living in public parks, according to lawyers supporting Grants Pass who spoke with USA TODAY. People who violate the ban will face fines and possibly jail time.\n\nIn their 6-3 decision, justices said enforcing a camping ban is not equal to cruel and unusual punishment. The ruling overturned a lower court ruling that kept the ban from being enforced.\n\n“This is a pretty hard blow and it’s devastating,” said Helen Cruz, 49, who gives meals to unhoused people in parks in Grants Pass and has advocated against the sleeping ban for years. She's been homeless herself for most of her adult life, she said. Recently, she has been able to live in a church where she does volunteer work.\n\nSpeaking after the ruling's release Friday, Cruz told USA TODAY the decision was the worst possible outcome the hundreds of people living outside in Grants Pass could have imagined.\n\n“These people who have had nothing had one glimmer of hope, and now it’s been stripped from them. How far down can you beat somebody who has nothing? I don’t understand,\" Cruz said, speaking through tears.\n\nNational homelessness advocates also said Friday the court's ruling was a huge disappointment.\n\n\"We are incredibly disappointed and we're worried about how quickly some communities will move to enact local ordinances that are now legal under this ruling,\" said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness.\n\nSince 2018, cities in much of the western U.S. couldn't enforce 24-hour bans on sleeping in public, a dilemma they said made it harder to clear large tent encampments. Now, some of the cities with the largest numbers of unsheltered homeless populations in the country − Los Angeles, San Diego and Seattle − are free to pass new laws to prevent people from sleeping outside.\n\nTheane Evangelis, the lawyer who argued the case for Grants Pass, said Friday the court's ruling comes as \"urgent relief\" for cities struggling to control homeless encampments.\n\n\"Years from now, I hope that we will look back on today’s watershed ruling as the turning point in America’s homelessness crisis,\" Evangelis said in a statement.\n\nPolicy experts who supported Grants Pass in the case said the Supreme Court's decision was a victory for local governments across the country.\n\n\"The court made the right decision to not become micromanagers of local homeless policy across the entire United States of America,\" said Judge Glock, director of research at the Manhattan Institute, a think tank supporting individual freedom and the rule of law that submitted documents to the Supreme Court in support of Grants Pass.\n\nIn Oregon, a 2021 state law means unhoused residents in Grants Pass and throughout the state will have some protections in the face of 24-hour sleeping bans, but cities can still move forward with stricter camping rules after the Supreme Court on Friday reversed a low court decision.\n\nOral argumentsWhat justices said in court as they heard Grants Pass v. Johnson\n\nGrants Pass Mayor Sara Bristol said she is glad the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the city. She told USA TODAY she and the city council will begin reviewing the decision and state law to figure out how to move forward.\n\n\"I'm relieved that Grants Pass will be able to reclaim our city parks for recreation,\" Bristol said. She also said she acknowledges homelessness is a \"complex issue\" for which her city has \"been trying to find solutions.\"\n\nOne solution was to launch a sanctioned campsite or open a new shelter, but both received pushback from the city.\n\nRuth Sears, who owns a dance studio building next to what was a planned shelter in downtown Grants Pass, said the court's ruling won't do anything to solve homelessness in her city.\n\n“I don’t see how it’s really going to help, unless their thought is they’ll go someplace else, which is obviously not a real good answer for the homeless people,\" Sears, 72, said.\n\nLegal experts on the side of homeless plaintiffs in the case worry that more cities will pass similar bans, leaving unhoused people with fewer jurisdictions where they can legally live outside.\n\n\"What if every jurisdiction passes these laws? You'll probably see them sweeping across the nation,\" said David Peery, a lawyer with the National Coalition for the Homeless in Florida.\n\nThe fines that will come as a result of camping and sleeping bans will only prolong people's homelessness because debt and a criminal record will make it harder for them to secure jobs and housing, Oliva said.\n\n“We know they can’t pay those tickets,\" Oliva added.\n\nHomeless in Grants PassHow one woman's homeless story fits into the national debate\n\nGrants Pass had already been issuing fines and enforcing a law that prohibits people from setting up tents in the same spot indefinitely, and now officials have more leeway to crack down on people living outside.\n\nThis decision by the Supreme Court will only make the homeless crisis worse, said Eric Tars, the Legal Director for the National Homeless Law Center.\n\n\"Harmful approaches like criminalization are a crutch to avoid dealing with their affordable housing problems,\" Tars said.\n\nSimilarly, Oliva called camping bans a \"fake solution\" to the crisis playing out in homeless encampments nationwide.\n\nAdvocates say cities should focus on affordable housing\n\nOn Friday, Oliva said local mayors and city councils across the country must remember that they serve the needs of unhoused communities, as well as housed constituents who want the homelessness crisis solved.\n\nLocal elected officials should build more shelters and connect unhoused people with more services through outreach, Oliva said, rather than crack down harder on people in encampments by passing new sleeping bans.\n\n\"Housing-focused shelter and outreach will keep people safe and healthy as possible while we are building more affordable housing for people − that's the path forward,\" Oliva said.\n\nTars called the court's ruling \"heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"But we are not done fighting,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nWhat did the court debate during oral arguments?\n\nDuring oral arguments on April 22, the justices wrestled with the question of whether being homeless is an unavoidable status, or if sleeping outside is conduct that comes as a result of not having a home.\n\nThe justices said it would make more sense for local and state governments to make choices about homelessness policy, rather than having the country's highest court wade into the debate.\n\nIn April, some of the justices also wondered if the court could narrowly decide the issue by saying that the Grants Pass sleeping ban isn't allowed under a new Oregon law prohibiting 24-hour bans.\n\nWhat was the Grants Pass case about?\n\nGrants Pass v. Johnson pitted the homeless population of Grants Pass, Oregon, a town of about 40,000 against local officials, who said they wanted to regain control of public parks, where about 600 unhoused people live in tents, under tarps and sleep on tables and benches.\n\nMost of the unhoused people living outside in Grants Pass first became homeless as the price of homes skyrocketed over the last couple decades, according to the public defender who first took the case, Ed Johnson, who is not related to the named plaintiff in the case, Gloria Johnson.\n\nThe city wanted to permanently clear people out of parks, but said it couldn't because a 2022 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit decision ruled homeless people in places without enough shelter beds have an Eighth Amendment right not to face punishment for living outside and protecting themselves from the elements.\n\nThere is no city-run shelter, only a church-run program for homeless people that includes a shelter that requires residents to work. Transitional housing, in the form of a tiny home village, opened in 2021, but there are only 17 slots. Due to a lack of affordable housing in Grants Pass, turnover at the facility is low, service providers said.\n\nThe mayor of Grants Pass and some city council members worked hard to try to launch a sanctioned campsite and open a new shelter, but multiple plans received too much pushback from the community and went sideways. As of this spring, the town had no more funds to try to create the shelter space needed for its unhoused population, Bristol previously told USA TODAY.\n\n\"We need to help establish a place where people can legally sleep, and it's been a real uphill battle with all kinds of different challenges,\" Bristol said in April.\n\nTo solve the problem of homeless encampments in public parks, lawyers for Grants Pass asked the Supreme Court in April to overturn the Ninth Circuit decision that protected unhoused people from facing punishment for sleeping outside.\n\n\"The Ninth Circuit ties cities' hands by constitutionalizing the policy debate over how to address growing encampments,\" Evangelis said in April, arguing before the Supreme Court for Grants Pass.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/08/28/covid-19-invisible-victims-homeless-people/5636938002/", "title": "COVID-19 takes worst toll on USA's invisible victims: homeless people", "text": "Molly Bohannon, Katie Surma, Austin Fast, Nino Abdaladze, Megan Lupo, Jamie Fields and Sanjana Garg\n\nHoward Center for Investigative Journalism\n\nThis story was supported by the Pulitzer Center.\n\nPHOENIX – Nearly 200 tents stand inches apart on the scorching gravel lots, many covered in blankets for an extra layer of relief from the desert sun. Outside, their occupants sit on hot ground or in folding chairs, nearby palm trees providing no shade. Despite 12-foot-square sections painted in the gravel, there is little social distancing for Phoenix’s homeless population.\n\nCreated by local officials in late April as a temporary solution for some of the estimated 3,700 unsheltered homeless, the fenced-in lots on the edge of downtown promised round-the-clock security, social distancing and access to water and toilets. But residents complain that hygiene supplies have become scarce, and measures meant to contain the spread of COVID-19 are not enforced.\n\n“We have been, like, ignored,” said Elisheyah, 61. “There's no safety, nothing to guarantee you can be safe out here.”\n\nHomeless people are one of the most vulnerable populations in the coronavirus pandemic, yet they’re largely invisible victims of the crisis. Very little is known about how they’re faring, in part because the Department of Housing and Urban Development – the main federal agency overseeing programs for them – has not required its national network of providers to gather information on infections or deaths. That’s despite the fact that unlike other high-risk, congregate-living groups, such as nursing home residents and prisoners, homeless people interact more with the general public.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic in March, researchers warned that at least 1,700 of the nation’s estimated 568,000 homeless people could eventually die of COVID-19. The Trump administration’s homelessness czar, Robert Marbut, told Congress in July there had been just 130 homeless deaths, noting that was “significantly lower than had been originally projected.”\n\nHowever, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism tracked at least 153 deaths of homeless people in the same time period in just six areas with large homeless populations – San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Phoenix – and at least 206 deaths nationwide by early August.\n\n“This country for a long time has written off the lives of people experiencing homelessness,” said Margot Kushel, a nationally recognized expert on homelessness and medical professor at the University of California, San Francisco. “And now it is literally the thing that is really going to make it very difficult to control this pandemic.”\n\nKushel called the pandemic “a crisis within a crisis,” noting that most homeless people are usually in poorer health and, with widespread closures in response to the pandemic, had lost access to services providing food, water and shelter.\n\nOnly about a dozen states acknowledged their homeless populations when they issued stay-at-home orders. Arizona said “individuals experiencing homelessness are exempt from this directive, but are strongly urged to obtain shelter as soon as possible.” Delaware similarly noted homeless residents weren’t “subject to this shelter in place order.” But orders from Idaho and Kentucky made no reference to their homeless, even as they took care to mention golf and guns, respectively.\n\nCongress has allocated more than $4 billion for homeless-specific programs as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and made billions more available at the discretion of federal and state officials. But four months after passage of the CARES Act, most of that money had not made its way to local communities, the Howard Center found. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, officials in Washington are seeking to shift long-standing homelessness policy, and state and local politicians disagree whether funds should be used to help currently homeless people or those at risk of becoming homeless in the economic collapse that has accompanied the pandemic.\n\nThe Howard Center spent three months investigating COVID-19’s impact on homeless people, analyzing data to predict which homeless populations around the country would be most vulnerable. It identified 43 counties that would likely struggle in the pandemic, several of which, such as Imperial in California and Maricopa in Arizona, went on to develop some of the highest infection rates in the country. Reporters also interviewed more than 80 professionals working in homelessness, epidemiology and public health, as well as homeless people in hot-spot areas, who described their daily struggles. And because homelessness is typically a problem left to local communities to address, reporters filed 140 public records requests to the vulnerable counties and their major cities to learn more about their responses to the crisis.\n\nSome communities were quick to act, forming cross-departmental working groups to address both the housing and health needs of their homeless, securing emergency housing, such as hotels, trailers and even convention centers, and taking care to prevent communal spread. In Colorado Springs, Colorado, for example, an emergency isolation shelter with 100 beds was constructed in just three weeks. By March 11, police in Oceanside, California, were handing out fact sheets to homeless people to inform them of the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nOthers were slow or failed to respond. The city manager in Sanger, California, opposed housing homeless people possibly infected with COVID-19 in emergency trailers in his town. And in Daytona Beach, Florida, efforts to convert an old building into permanent housing for homeless residents failed despite having the funding and county support needed to do so.\n\nOverall, records showed, localities faced two major problems in addressing the pandemic’s impact on their homeless populations: a lack of readiness to work across departments dealing with both housing and health, and insufficient data and testing to know who was getting sick and where.\n\nMany have criticized the federal government for not providing a coordinated response to the pandemic’s impact on homeless people, as well as more resources for testing and tracing. Some have also advocated for racially equitable COVID-19 responses. By early August, people of color, who represent about 24% of the general population, made up about 61% of all COVID-19 infections and 50% of all deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"All states have been at a disadvantage in their response to C-19 because the federal government has failed to adopt a unified nationwide strategy. In fact, the national strategy seems to be ‘let states handle it,’” Barbara DiPietro, senior policy director for the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, said in an email. “This is the least efficient, most wasteful way to approach a crisis.”\n\nCOVID’s unmeasured impact\n\nOne week before the CARES Act was passed on March 27, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA and Boston University released a report forecasting COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and fatalities among homeless people. They estimated more than 20,000 homeless people could require hospitalization and gave a range for potential fatalities, with the midpoint about 3,400.\n\nMore:From a Biogen conference to a homeless shelter: Researchers track coronavirus infections from 'super-spreader' events\n\nMore:Wrestling with demons: How a troubled child turned into a champion\n\nMore:Another 1 million expected to file unemployment claims as coronavirus spikes and ebbs\n\n“We believe that the true likely fatality outcome would be on the higher end of this range given the challenge of actually getting homeless clients to the hospital, especially when they are unsheltered, as well as the unusually high mortality risks that prevail among the homeless population,” the researchers wrote. They estimated $11.5 billion was needed to supply additional beds and housing required for social distancing.\n\nDan Treglia, one of the Penn researchers, said he stands by the study’s predictions. He, like other experts interviewed by the Howard Center, noted there was no nationwide systematic testing, including for homeless people. Without such testing, the virus’ infection rate remains unknown, making COVID-19 deaths harder to identify and count.\n\nThe virus “is hitting different parts of the country at different times and with different rates of severity,” Treglia said, adding it’s hard to know “exactly what this number is going to look like at the end of the day.”\n\nHUD’s Homeless Management Information System allows for the department, through a network of regional and local planning bodies, to track COVID-19 infections and deaths among homeless people. But HUD announced in late March it would not require COVID-19 data collection through HMIS, although it did provide guidance on what information communities could collect if they wanted.\n\nExperts say this highlights one of the structural problems facing how the country deals with homelessness.\n\n“HUD is for housing, so they're not really thinking about health care and the people on the ground; even service providers that are serving their patients in their housing programs are not primarily thinking about health,” said Bobby Watts, chief executive of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council. But, he added, “Housing is health care.”\n\nNew York City, which has the nation’s largest sheltered homeless population because of a right-to-shelter law, is the only metropolitan area yet to attempt a statistical assessment of COVID’s impact on homeless people. The Coalition for the Homeless, the city’s court-appointed monitor of homeless shelters and families, reported that the age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rate for sheltered homeless was 67% higher than the mortality rate for the city’s general population, as of early August. The city reported 104 deaths among its almost 80,000 homeless residents for the same time frame.\n\nBoston tested a group of homeless people after a large-scale outbreak at a shelter in late March. Of 408 residents tested, researchers found a 36% positivity rate, a measure of viral spread. Of those, about 88% were asymptomatic. The results, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, confirmed that COVID-19 carriers could be asymptomatic.\n\nLos Angeles, which along with New York accounts for nearly one-quarter of the nation’s homeless population, began to measure COVID’s impact on its most vulnerable in April. California has the nation’s largest unsheltered homeless population.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said as of Aug. 7, it had tested about 30% of its nearly 60,000 homeless residents and found a 2.8% positivity rate among sheltered homeless and a 2.4% positivity rate among those living unsheltered. Researchers have noted that infection rates seem to be lower for people living outdoors compared to those in shelters, though they’re not sure why.\n\nWilliam Nicholas, director of the county’s Center for Health Impact Evaluation, said decades-long funding cuts of public health departments meant many didn’t have the ability to track homeless COVID-19 deaths or infections.\n\nThe report to Congress by the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness cited relatively low numbers of homeless infections and deaths, which it credited to “early collaboration with federal agencies, front-line providers and local authorities.” It also said “individuals experiencing homelessness have been tested on a wider basis and at significantly higher rates than the general public.” The report noted the numbers were provisional and may “increase slightly.”\n\nEmily Mosites, a senior CDC adviser on homelessness, told the Howard Center the report included some CDC data, “but we don't have a very precise count of total cases, and we expect that the estimates that we do have are an underestimate.” One reason for that, she said, is homelessness is not always reflected in medical records.\n\nIn an interview with the Howard Center, Marbut, executive director of the Interagency Council on Homelessness, said his organization, not HUD, was best suited to collect COVID-19 data on homeless people. He said the council was doing that through contacts with homeless shelters around the country.\n\nJeff Olivet, who has researched homelessness for 25 years, said “it would be dangerous to assume that just because there have not been major outbreaks yet that there won't be.”\n\nAfter shelter outbreaks in Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and Atlanta, the CDC recommended that shelters consider testing all residents and staff members, but local government records show that did not always happen.\n\nIn Santa Barbara County, California, no homeless people brought into the county’s emergency shelter site were being tested as of April 15, records showed. A homeless assistance program manager requested widespread testing but was told asymptomatic people would not be tested.\n\nIn Merced, California, the public health department sent nurses in mid-May to encampments of homeless people to test for COVID-19 and provide guidance, records showed, but it was not able to provide treatment to those who tested positive.\n\nOfficials in Arizona’s largest county, Maricopa, were discussing in late March how to implement testing for their homeless residents, records show, even though one local nonprofit was already testing the homeless. One month later, testing remained a problem for the county. As of the first week in August, officials reported that 490 of the estimated 7,400 homeless in the county had tested positive for COVID, and nine had died.\n\n“We’re flying in the dark,” Watts said. “We don't really know if we're giving the best advice at a given period of time. And the only way to really try to get the best advice is to have the best data.”\n\nA patchwork of homeless solutions\n\nAndy Phelps, the homelessness prevention and response coordinator for Colorado Springs, received countless emails in the first two weeks of March as the COVID-19 threat hit home.\n\nOne shelter operator reminded him that “people in homelessness with little to limited access to hand-washing and who are already apt to suffer from other illness may be among higher risk populations for the Corona virus.” She then asked whether emergency shelter operations were still applicable if an outbreak occurred. Others told Phelps of increased cleaning needs and sought guidance from the Office of Emergency Management on alternate locations to house people.\n\nPhelps even got questions about asking questions – “could the OEM make that request to the County, or could you? Or should one of us reach out directly?”\n\nFinally, Phelps emailed El Paso County’s public health director proposing a meeting to discuss the response to the crisis.\n\n“I have received a growing amount of calls and emails from shelter providers in town that are concerned about the potential impact of the COVID-19 virus spreading into the shelters,” Phelps wrote. “I feel unprepared to offer them guidance further than sending them a CDC webpage.”\n\nThe Howard Center filed public records requests in the 43 counties its analysis identified as being most vulnerable to a coronavirus outbreak, including to the HUD planning bodies that oversee homelessness efforts around the country, known as Continuums of Care. Responses to about half the 140 records requests filed provide an inside look at how some communities struggled to respond in the first three months of the crisis.\n\nAfter Phelps’ suggestion, El Paso County began cross-departmental meetings with representatives of its public health and homeless response teams, as well as relevant nonprofits. Within three weeks, the city had created a 100-bed isolation center.\n\nSeveral other communities from Florida to Hawaii created similar task forces to address homeless needs in the pandemic, bringing together departments that didn’t regularly work together, such as housing, health and emergency services.\n\n“One thing that has kept me up at night has been how do we protect those in encampments and living unsheltered,” Chelsea Haring-Cozzi, executive director of the Indianapolis Coalition for Homelessness Intervention & Prevention, said in a March 13 email to city officials. “How do you quarantine someone who doesn’t have a home?”\n\nMaricopa County had two main goals: reduce the risk among the most vulnerable homeless and adequately respond to people with symptoms or those who needed isolation. Although the cross-departmental coordination was successful, the county was criticized for housing unsheltered homeless people in three open-air encampments in downtown Phoenix, known as the Lots.\n\nIn late July, when temperatures reached 118 degrees Fahrenheit, about 200 people were living in nearly 170 spaces, according to Amy Schwabenlender, executive director of Human Services Campus, a nonprofit that was providing services to the Lots. She said total numbers were fluid because people regularly came and went.\n\nOceanside, California, and Pasco County, Florida, were among several cities and counties that partnered with nonprofits to ensure their unsheltered populations had water, hand-washing stations, toilets and electricity to charge cellphones – all services that became nearly inaccessible after COVID’s mass closures.\n\nCalifornia implemented Project Roomkey, aimed at moving high-risk homeless people out of crowded shelters and outdoor encampments to secure isolated settings, such as hotel and motel rooms. As of June 30, 14,200 people had been housed by the program, funded by state and federal emergency funds.\n\nOther cities, such as Las Vegas, San Diego and Santa Barbara, California, turned convention centers and high school gyms into emergency homeless shelters big enough to allow social distancing.\n\nSan Diego opened its convention center as an emergency shelter, testing site and meal distribution hub on April 1 and, by early August, had sheltered 2,780 homeless people. Internal records show the city spent about $2.8 million a month on the makeshift shelter, and it expects to spend $3 million a month through the end of the year. Funding was also allocated to ensure that, when the center reverts to normal operations, homeless residents will “be able to obtain shelter and housing.”\n\nConnecticut has been widely praised by homeless experts for moving quickly. In early March, the state’s housing department reduced shelter capacity by nearly 60% and placed homeless people 60 or older in hotels, some of which it used as testing sites. Of 300 tests, only two homeless people tested positive, according to Steve DiLella, a Connecticut housing official who spoke in July at the virtual Nationwide Town Hall on Ending Homelessness.\n\nBut not all efforts to safely house or test the homeless were welcomed, records showed.\n\nIn Daytona Beach, Florida, heads of two homeless nonprofits sought permission to convert an empty building into a shelter that could be turned into permanent single-room housing after the pandemic. Jeff White, executive director of Volusia/Flagler County Coalition for the Homeless Inc., and another nonprofit leader argued that using COVID-19 funds to develop “permanent supportive housing” was better than paying for hotel rooms, which would be “basically burning money.” The project had funding, a quick timeline and county support, records show, but the deputy city manager was not encouraging.\n\nWhite told the Howard Center he never received a final answer from city officials and moved on to another plan.\n\n“The response was kind of a non-response saying that the permits could be applied for but not really commenting on whether they would support the project,” he said.\n\nIn Sanger, California, city manager Tim Chapa opposed placing three emergency isolation trailers in his town to house homeless people showing symptoms of COVID-19. The Fresno County public health department ordered Chapa to take the trailers, records show, but before they arrived, Chapa appealed to the City Council. He said the city’s shelter \"may not have the capacity to provide adequate medical support service to identified COVID + homeless,\" he recounted in an April 17 email to a county official. Chapa said the trailers would be better in Fresno, where they ended up later that day.\n\nLeaders in El Centro, the main city in California’s Imperial County, repeatedly but unsuccessfully sought the county’s help with a COVID-19 testing program.\n\n“As to the homeless population, they (county officials) are not going to enact anything unless there are any positive results within the population. They are not doing any pre-emptive activities,” Adriana Nava, El Centro’s community services director, wrote to her colleagues March 19.\n\nBy June 22, there were 17 confirmed coronavirus cases among the estimated 1,400 homeless people in Imperial County, including one case in a 10-person encampment behind a grocery store in Calexico. Internal emails show that county officials did not realize the infected person had been living in the camp until they were notified by a homeless service provider, who said others there were worried about becoming ill. The county then tested the encampment residents and said all were negative, records show. In a June 22 email, Linsey Dale, a spokeswoman for Imperial County, said it was the only encampment the county had tested.\n\nEl Centro Fire Chief Kenneth Herbert told the Howard Center he had questions about the county’s infection numbers for homeless people.\n\n“You look at that and say there are only 17 positive, then my next question would be what your testing outreach has been, how many persons have you tested or attempted to test?” he asked. “How can it possibly be 17?”\n\nAs of the first week of August, the county reported 36 homeless people had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe varied local government responses to caring for homeless people during the pandemic highlight the need for a coordinated federal approach, experts told the Howard Center.\n\n“We have been left county by county, city by city, to cobble together a public health response to something that is on par with the Spanish flu in terms of its infectiousness and potential lethality,” said Marc Dones, executive director of the National Innovation Service, a public policy organization focused on racial equity. “To simply step out of the role, to step out of the responsibility in this moment feels like a fundamental abdication of the purpose of government.”\n\nTwo crises, one cause\n\nFive months into the pandemic, statistics show people of color are disproportionately infected with and dying from COVID-19.\n\nAt the same time, Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans are disproportionately affected by another public health crisis: homelessness. These same groups comprise nearly 65% of the country’s homeless population, according to HUD’s 2019 Annual Homeless Assessment Report.\n\nExperts interviewed by the Howard Center said structural racism was the root cause of both plagues affecting people of color.\n\n“We simply wouldn't have homelessness if we didn't have the kinds of structural racism that we have,” Dones said, pointing to hurdles that people of color face in accessing both affordable housing and health care. “Racism is one of, if not the core driver, of why homelessness exists in this country.”\n\nExperts say the main type of homelessness experienced by Latino and Native communities involves living doubled or tripled up in inadequate housing, which influences both the undercounting and underserving of those communities, as well as the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn a 2018 study, researchers in El Paso, Texas, found that homeless Latinos were being underreported in HUD statistics, which they attributed to the fact that the agency did not account for people who were marginally housed, such as those doubling-up with others or couch-surfing.\n\nIn its definition of homelessness, HUD considers marginally housed people 24 and younger to be homeless, though such people are not recorded in HUD’s biennial Point-in-Time counts. People older than 24 in the same situation are not considered homeless by HUD. The agency acknowledged, when updating its definitions in 2011, that it was excluding some vulnerable populations.\n\nOlivet, who authored an influential report on racism and homelessness in 2018, said Latino homelessness often is “hidden” because outreach services are not “culturally and linguistically competent.”\n\nExperts attribute high rates of COVID-19 infections and homelessness among minority populations to their likelihood of working low-wage jobs. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed such workers were more likely to be people of color: fewer than 20% of Black people and about 16% of Latinos were able to work from home during the pandemic, compared with about 30% of white people.\n\nPeople of color are not less healthy than their white counterparts, Olivet said; rather, they’re put in less healthy working conditions with inadequate health care.\n\n“So it's not just that they're sick because they're sick, it's also that they're sick because they don't have access to health care,” he said.\n\nCOVID’s disproportionate impact on people of color has coincided with a larger conversation on race as Black Lives Matter and anti-police brutality rallies spread across the U.S. Recently, some federal, state and local government agencies have started considering how to incorporate racial equity into how federal homeless and COVID-19 dollars are spent.\n\nOne of the first places to take such action is Tacoma, Washington, which is aiming to issue 45% of its coronavirus rental-assistance funds to households identifying as Black or mixed race. In Pierce County, where Tacoma is located, Blacks comprise about 26% of the homeless population but about 6% of the general population.\n\nVa Lecia Kellum, president of St. Joseph Center, a Los Angeles organization providing housing opportunities and health services, said she would like to see similar approaches elsewhere.\n\n“If we are all in this together, then it's absolutely the case that we need to invest in our most vulnerable citizens,” Kellum said.\n\nAmid finding ways to protect, isolate and test one of the nation’s most vulnerable populations, experts say another homelessness crisis is looming.\n\n“We're starting to brace ourselves for just a huge infusion of people losing their homes,” said Megan Hustings, the managing director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. “We already didn't have the resources to help everybody who was losing their homes before this crisis, and it's just going to be worse.”\n\nIn 2019, there were only 389,549 shelter beds for an estimated 568,000 homeless people, according to HUD. To combat the expected rise in homelessness, some experts are calling for additional rental assistance and unemployment benefits in addition to continued bans on evictions.\n\nTreglia, the Penn researcher who was among the first to warn of an impending homeless crisis amid COVID, said shelter capacity won’t keep pace with the expected increases in homelessness, and that could have wide-ranging effects.\n\n“The worse this gets, the more homeless people that are infected, the more precautionary measures need to be taken,” he said. “The more we put at-risk populations or any population at risk of infection, the greater the risk is for everyone.”\n\nThis story was produced by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, an initiative of the Scripps Howard Foundation in honor of the late news industry executive and pioneer Roy W.

Roy Cooper, who was widely considered a leading contender to be Vice President Kamala Harris' running-mate, has taken his name out of contention.\n\nCooper confirmed in a statement Monday night that he's withdrawn himself from consideration to be Harris' pick as vice president.\n\n\"This just wasn't the right time for North Carolina and for me to potentially be on a national ticket,\" the two-term governor said in a statement. \"As I've said from the beginning, she has an outstanding list of people from which to choose, and we'll all work to make sure she wins,\" Cooper said of Harris.\n\nCooper, who will leave the governor's office at the end of the year, was among several Democrats who the Harris campaign vetted for the job of vice president.\n\nMore:Sen. Mark Kelly, Gov. Josh Shapiro betting favorites as Democratic VP candidate\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether the Harris campaign lost interest in Cooper, or whether Cooper made the decision unprompted on his own. Cooper's name is often mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in North Carolina in 2026, when Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., is up for reelection.\n\nCooper was a top surrogate of President Joe Biden before he dropped out of the race and has since become a vocal supporter of Harris through television appearances and other campaign engagements.\n\nThe New York Times first reported on Cooper's withdrawal.\n\nHarris is aiming to name a running-mate before Aug. 7, the deadline for the Democratic National Committee to virtually confirm the party's presidential and vice presidential nominees ahead of the Democratic National Convention later in the month.\n\nOther Democrats under consideration by Harris as her vice presidential nominee include Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nCooper, a 67-year-old former attorney general before twice elected as governor, was seen by many Democrats as a prime contender for vice president because of his potential to put Harris over the top in North Carolina, a critical battleground state in the 2024 election that has historically leaned Republican.\n\nCooper is credited by Democrats for successfully pushing through progressive causes in the South despite the state's Republican-controlled legislature including expanding Medicaid as part of the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nCooper is also a champion for abortion access − a key theme of the Harris campaign.

Neither have ruled out joining a Harris ticket.\n\nTheir states are key battlegrounds in the fall, and Pennsylvania in particular has the power to sway the outcome of the presidential race.\n\nGov. Andy Beshear has also drawn attention as a Democratic governor who won reelection in a deep red state and could help broaden Harris’ appeal.\n\nCould a homegrown candidate in the No. 2 spot help Democrats reframe the race and put their home states into play, both up and down the ticket?\n\n“I think it would only help in those states,” said Jessica Taylor, an analyst and governors editor with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\n“Harris has the potential to generate, I think, more enthusiasm among Democratic base voters: young voters, Black voters in Philadelphia,” Taylor said. “And I think someone like Shapiro could also bring in some more of those blue collar, rural voters too. And you know, that's the same types of voters they need to appeal to in Michigan and Wisconsin as well.”\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer appears to have removed herself from the conversation, telling reporters Monday she doesn’t plan to leave Michigan, another top battleground state, for a spot on the presidential ticket.\n\nWhitmer has thrown her support behind Harris, putting to bed speculation that she might seek the top nomination herself.\n\nHarris has quickly consolidated support from Democrats across the country, and she’s won the endorsements of many Democratic governors – some of whom, like Whitmer, could have challenged her for the presidential nomination.\n\nMore:Kamala Harris’ VP pick: Who’s up and who’s down on her running mate list?\n\nNow the conversation shifts to who Harris may tap as a running mate and what credentials that person brings to help balance out the ticket.\n\nRepublicans are likely to start attacking Harris as a West Coast liberal, Taylor said. And a Midwestern everyman could help shore up Democrats’ appeal in battleground states.\n\n“Democrats have a historic ticket in front of them,” said Mike Ceraso, a Democratic strategist and founder of the communications firm Winning Margins.\n\n“We’ll need a vice president candidate with policy chops and with a style of communication that reaches voters in rural and small towns, which are increasingly Black and brown. These are the voters the VP will need to have a winning coalition.”\n\nHere's a rundown on the contenders:\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro ‘would translate well’ in other swing states\n\nAlison Dagnes, a professor of political science at Shippensburg University, said she understands why Shapiro is being talked about for vice president: He's shrewd, tech-savvy and a proven winner in the battleground state with the most Electoral College votes at stake.\n\n\"His social media game is on point,\" Dagnes told the USA TODAY Network. \"I have gotten Josh Shapiro TikToks and Instagram Reels and Stories from students, former students who don't even live in Pennsylvania anymore.\"\n\nProlific campaigning and fundraising has fueled two decades of sustained election success for Shapiro.\n\nHis resume in this pivotal swing state includes terms as a county commissioner, state legislator and attorney general. He won his gubernatorial race by 12 points, and his approval rating as governor — according to polling from the Commonwealth Foundation, a libertarian-leaning policy group — has been as high as 60% and has never fallen below the mid-50s.\n\nShapiro's presence at the top of the party's ticket could also benefit down-ballot Democrats in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the 2022 midterms, when he was elected governor, Democrats picked up a U.S. Senate seat and retook control of the state House of Representatives for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nShapiro could bolster the ticket with his disciplined campaigning and ability to stay on message, said Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion.\n\n“That’s why he’s been such a rising star to Pennsylvania politics for two decades,” he said. “I think he would translate well (in all the swing) states.”\n\nHe’s not, however, without his critics.\n\nTo those on the left of the Democratic Party, Shapiro’s history of centrist messaging may be less than inspiring.\n\n“Any prospective VP pick, including Gov. Shapiro, must champion popular progressive policies like canceling medical debt, raising the minimum wage, and capping rent increases at the federal level,\" said Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the progressive group Our Revolution. \"President Biden recently embraced these popular polices, and base voters will expect that they remain front and center in the Party platform.”\n\nAnd although Dagnes sees an eventual White House run in Shapiro's future, she's not as convinced he’d be the ideal choice for Harris.\n\nShe noted that his Jewish heritage and vocal support for Israel could be problematic in parts of the country where acts of antisemitism are rising. The Biden-Harris ticket has also faced pushback from Arab and Muslim American populations who oppose Israel’s actions in Gaza.\n\nNBC News reported Monday that Shapiro left the door open to running as Harris’ vice president if it were offered to him.\n\n\"She will make that decision when she is ready,\" he told reporters in Pittsburgh. \"And I have all the confidence in the world that she will make that decision along with many others in the best interest of the American people.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper could also boost critical governor’s race as VP pick\n\nNorth Carolina's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, has served two terms while Republicans maintain a supermajority in the state Legislature.\n\nHe clinched a win over his Republican rival in 2016 by less than a percentage point and increased his margin to about 4.5 percentage points in 2020 – both years when Republican Donald Trump won North Carolina’s presidential race.\n\nThis year, Democrats have been eyeing North Carolina as a possible battleground state to help expand their electoral map in 2024.\n\nCooper’s electoral success in this purple state could give Democrats a regional advantage, said Michael Bitzer, political scientist at North Carolina's Catawba College.\n\n“This is a different North Carolina from 20 years ago, and certainly this dynamic of working on the margins of victory, you know, you want as strong a candidate as you can possibly get,” Bitzer said. “And Cooper would present that, at least here in North Carolina.”\n\nNot only could Cooper help Harris, but he could also set the tone for high-stakes down-ballot races in the state.\n\n“I've been a little skeptical of North Carolina as a reach state, but Cooper could put that back in play,\" said Taylor, the Cook Political Report analyst. \"And, you know, there's a very important governor's race there to succeed him too.”\n\nCooper has endorsed Democrat Josh Stein to succeed him in the race against firebrand Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson. It’s one of the most high-profile governor’s races in the country this year, and any high-profile help at the top of the ticket could boost Stein’s chances.\n\nNadine Gibson, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, said Cooper could help mobilize voters and \"motivate more people to vote than the Biden-Harris ticket.”\n\n\"A lot of winning elections is about not only persuading swing voters, but also about mobilizing voters,\" Gibson said. \"There is an argument that there's a lot of untapped Democrats in North Carolina.\"\n\nOn Monday, Cooper appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe show where he declined to comment on VP speculation and instead shifted the focus back to Harris, who he has endorsed.\n\n\"I appreciate people talking about me, but I think the focus right now needs to be on her this week,” he said. “And she needs to concentrate on making sure that she secures this nomination and gets the campaign ready to go.”\n\n‘It’s really a broader message that matters’ with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear\n\nAdding Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear to the ticket is unlikely to swing the red state in favor of Democrats, said University of Kentucky political scientist Stephen Voss.\n\nTrump swept to victory there in 2020 with about two-thirds of the vote, defeating Biden 62% to 31%.\n\nBut Beshear could help Democrats pick up voters in other states with demographics similar to Kentucky’s, he said.\n\n“Adding a Kentucky governor (to the ticket) ought to help in Ohio, in parts of Pennsylvania,” Voss said. “It’s really a broader message that matters, not a favorite son phenomenon.”\n\nMike Ward, a longtime Democratic activist, thinks Beshear’s ability to relate to rural Americans could be an asset well beyond Kentucky.\n\n“They feel left out and neglected, and Andy (Beshear) has shown again and again and again that he did not leave them out in Kentucky, that he showed them every ounce of respect and attention that he showed to the areas of the state where he got a lot higher percent of the vote,” Ward said.\n\nOthers disagree.\n\nMore:Why Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is — and isn't — the best candidate for vice president\n\nIn 2019, Beshear won the governorship by the narrowest of margins — less than half a percentage point, or just over 5,000 votes.\n\nAnd although he won by a wider margin in 2023, most of his votes came from the state’s population centers, said Danny Briscoe, a longtime Democratic consultant in Kentucky.\n\n“He carried Lexington, he carried Louisville, he carried Owensboro, he carried Ashland, he carried Bowling Green, he carried Richmond, he carried Frankfort,” but Beshear lost in 91 of Kentucky's 120 counties in his 2023 race for governor, Briscoe said. That throws into question his success with the rural vote.\n\nThe Kentucky House and Senate are both held by Republican supermajorities, and it’s unlikely that a Beshear vice presidential pick would have much impact on those down-ballot races, University of Kentucky political scientist Voss said.\n\n“One could argue he'd attract more than the usual enthusiasm, but I doubt it, given that he couldn't extend coattails even to the Democratic candidates who shared a ballot with him last year,” Voss said.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom may be out of the veepstakes but could still be influential\n\nWhile it remains unclear whether Whitmer is under consideration to be Harris’ running mate, she seemed to express disinterest in the role.\n\nWhile she avoided questions from the media at public events Monday, she responded to one reporter on her way to the car who asked whether she’s prepared to take the vice presidency if offered.\n\n“No, I’m not planning to go anywhere,” Whitmer said.\n\nThat might come as a disappointment for Democratic candidates in Michigan staring down competitive races this fall.\n\nThe state has an open U.S. Senate seat following the retirement of Democratic U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, which could decide party control of the chamber. The state also has several competitive congressional campaigns, and Democrats’ narrow majority in the Michigan House of Representatives is also on the line.\n\nBernie Porn, the pollster for EPIC-MRA in Lansing, said Whitmer joining Harris’ campaign as her running mate could provide a boost for Democrats.\n\n“I think it would be a benefit down ballot in Michigan if that were to happen,” he said.\n\nHowever, it’s remains uncertain whether voters might respond positively to having two women on the ticket.\n\n“Although I would love to test it out,” Porn said.\n\nIn California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom appears to have similarly ended any speculation that he would seek the Democratic presidential nomination this week when he endorsed Harris for president.\n\nBut he hasn’t entirely quieted rumblings that he is a contender for Harris’ 2024 running mate.\n\nBut unlike many others named as possible vice presidential picks, Newsom comes with a handful of legal hurdles and thorny strategic obstacles that election experts and Democratic strategists say makes his selection unlikely – if not impossible.\n\nNational Democratic strategist Bob Shrum points to the 12th Amendment, which says the candidates for president and vice president cannot be from the same state.\n\n“Gavin Newsom would have to move out of state and resign as governor,” Shrum said. “Because Harris is never going to give up her California residency.”\n\nIt’s just as unlikely Newsom would relinquish his role as governor or his California residency. He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan, his late father a state appeals court judge who made his millions in wineries, restaurants and hotels stretching across the state.\n\nShrum, director of the University of California’s Center on the Political Future, said he still expects Newsom to play a significant role in the 2024 election.\n\n“I think he'll continue to be a very effective surrogate and campaign hard,” he said. “He is telegenic, he is fluent, he is eloquent, so I think he can make a real contribution for Harris.”\n\nOther Democratic governors who might have future White House ambitions, like Wes Moore in Maryland and J.B. Pritzker in Illinois, have also endorsed Harris.\n\nMoore has ruled out running as a vice president, telling reporters on Monday that he spoke with Biden and Harris on Sunday but has “no interest” in the position of vice president.\n\n“I have no interest and I’ve expressed that,” he said, “I love my job.”\n\nAsheville Citizen Times reporter Joel Burgess and The Herald-Mail reporter Dwight A.

Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\n\nThe Harris campaign has also requested vetting materials from one Democrat whose name has received much less attention as a vice-presidential contender: Cedric Richmond, a former congressman from Louisiana who served as a top aide in the Biden White House and on his campaign.\n\n\"I would color that doubtful,\" Richmond told a New Orleans TV station.\n\nWhitmer also tried to take herself out of the running on Monday, telling a local TV station on Monday that she's \"not leaving Michigan.\"\n\nNotably missing from the Harris vice president vetting list that was shared by the source are Kentucky Gov.

Vice presidential candidates run separately, which means whoever Harris picks will receive a separate vote on the convention floor.\n\nWith roughly 100 days until the election, experts say the short timeframe means this group being vetted could be the only round of contenders.\n\n\"If we were in a normal situation, this would be a process that would play out over a couple of months,\" David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"They don't really have that kind of time, because the convention is coming up in a few weeks,\" he added.\n\nCritical choice to 'balance' ticket, contrast with Trump, Vance\n\nAll of the names being floated bring their own strengths and weaknesses, experts say, as they are auditioning to join the brand new Harris ticket. The choice will first center on who best complements Harris.\n\nHopkins said the vetting list suggests Harris' team is thinking about who would be best at helping the ticket appeal to a different segment of voters as it tries to cobble together a new coalition that can help them defeat Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in November.\n\n\"When you have a someone from California who's a woman of color and has experience in Washington, then the obvious way to sort of balance it is to think about someone from a different part of the country, or from a battleground state,\" he said.\n\nThe other thing a Harris running mate could be used for is serving as an attack dog against Trump, particularly in contrast with his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who has championed his upbringing in rural Ohio.\n\nDuring an appearance Tuesday on \"Morning Joe,\" for instance, Walz, the Minnesota governor, took direct swings at Vance, who is thought to be a lunch pail messenger to working class voters.\n\n\"What I know is people like JD Vance know nothing about small-town America,\" Walz said.\n\n\"He gets it all wrong, it's not about hate, it's not about collapsing in,\" he added. \"The golden rule there is mind your own damn business. Their policies are what destroyed rural America. They've divided us. They're in our exam rooms. They're telling us what books to read.\"\n\nOther rumored Harris contenders, such as Buttigieg and Beshear, launched similar attacks aimed at Vance earlier in the week.\n\nMichael Traugott, an emeritus research professor of political studies at the University of Michigan, said Harris' entry resets the 2024 race and that this represents her first major test as the Democratic standard bearer. Her pick also will signal to voters much about the vice president's thinking on the White House campaign that has a little more than 100 days to go.\n\n\"It's a little hard to figure precisely because we're short on the polling of assessing the actual Democratic team against Trump and Vance,\" he said. \"But it's still a very closely contested race, and most of the action takes place in the battleground states, so I would probably consider at the top of that list governors of battleground states.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/01/harris-vp-vetting-process/74545420007/", "title": "As Kamala Harris' VP choice looms, inside the vetting process", "text": "WASHINGTON – So you want to be vice president? Prepare for one of the most invasive reviews of your personal life in American politics.\n\nBefore they can be selected as a running mate, vice presidential contenders undergo a vetting process that seeks to unearth their darkest secrets − and even those of their family, friends and business partners.\n\n“It’s very intense,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was vetted as a potential running mate to former President Barack Obama in 2008 and again in 2016, when he was chosen to be the vice presidential candidate to Hillary Clinton.\n\nRep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., one of the eight Republicans vetted by former President Donald Trump this year, described it as a “pretty interesting” process that took “a deep dive into every decision in your life.”\n\nSeveral Democrats are going through that process right now, as Vice President Kamala Harris − after becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee last week − chooses a prospective vice president of her own.\n\nThe review can involve turning over financial and real estate records, dating histories, and even the passwords to social media accounts.\n\n\"It's not very pleasant. The truth is, none of us is a saint,\" said University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato. \"We forget, they're human beings. And in fact, they're very, very human.\"\n\nGiven his experience with vetting, Kaine said colleagues who are about to undergo the process come to him for advice. It can be surprisingly thorough even to senators and governors, he said, who have already faced scrutiny in statewide races.\n\n“Everything about your life will be known,\" Kaine said.\n\nA short schedule and a short list\n\nFor Harris, the vetting process has been accelerated. While most campaigns have months to narrow down their options, she has had a little under two weeks since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and threw his support behind his vice president. A decision is expected by early next week.\n\nAt least seven Democrats have popped up on Harris' short list, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. However, Cooper pulled himself out of the running, citing concerns that his Republican Lieutenant Governor would challenge his authority while he is campaigning out of state, and Whitmer has said she plans to remain governor of Michigan until the end of her term in 2026.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s campaign requested vetting materials from vice presidential candidates at least six weeks before the Republican National Convention earlier this month when he announced his pick of Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.\n\nThose who have previously been through vetting told USA TODAY that the Harris campaign's process will likely have the same rigor, albeit focused on a smaller group of prospective candidates.\n\n“They assign a team of people to look at everything in your life – financial records, medical records, interview people you’ve worked with, interview friends and family and you multiple times,” Kaine said.\n\nPritzker, who has a net worth of around $3.5 billion as heir to the Hyatt family fortune, previously told USA TODAY that his assets wouldn't be a problem as he is vetted, despite lingering questions about potential conflicts of interests related to his independently-managed trusts.\n\n\"I've been fully vetted, because I've run for office now twice statewide in the fifth largest state in the country and done that successfully,\" he said. \"Everything's been transparent.\"\n\nWhy campaigns vet running mates\n\nThe goal of vetting is to avoid any last-minute surprises that can tank a campaign by unearthing any potential liabilities early on.\n\nHistory is full of cautionary tales, from vice presidents to Cabinet nominees.\n\nIn 1972, Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, George McGovern's running mate, dropped out of the race after media reports revealed he had been hospitalized and undergone electroshock therapy for depression. In 1993, former President Bill Clinton's nominee for Attorney General, Zoë Baird, had to withdraw her nomination over a controversy that she had hired undocumented immigrants for childcare and did not pay taxes for their labor. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle withdrew his nomination in 2009 to lead the Department of Health and Human Services when it became clear he failed to report tens of thousands of dollars in charitable donations and consulting income on his taxes.\n\nThis time around, former Obama-era Attorney General Eric Holder is leading the Harris campaign's vetting process along with former Biden White House General Counsel Dana Remus. Remus was part of the team that helped Biden pick Harris in 2020 and also led the vetting of U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson when she went through Senate confirmation hearings in 2022.\n\nContacted by USA TODAY, the Harris campaign declined to comment on the extent of its vetting process. A spokesperson for the campaign confirmed the team is vetting potential candidates and said: “We do not expect to have additional updates until the Vice President announces who will be serving as her running mate.”\n\nSimultaneous tryouts\n\nVetting also includes an audition for the role of sidekick. “The other part of it is you just get out there and work. Whether it’s being a surrogate, whether that’s TV or rallies or at events, doing what you can to help the campaign financially raise money, all that stuff,” Donalds said.\n\nHe joked that pundits often compared Trump’s process for choosing a running mate to “The Apprentice,” the long-running reality TV show that made Trump a household name.\n\n“But in some aspects, it was like ‘The Apprentice,’” he said. “You kind of gotta do your thing and see what happens at the end.”\n\nSeveral of Harris’ potential running mates have appeared on the campaign trail in recent days.\n\nShapiro and Whitmer held a joint rally for Harris near Philadelphia Monday. Walz and Pritzker advocated for Harris on marquee Sunday news programs and have been a regular feature of the cable news circuit since Biden dropped out. Beshear spoke at the opening of a Harris campaign office in Georgia on Sunday.\n\nIn terms of boosting their chances, being a successful surrogate is one of the best things those potential candidates can do, said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a finalist to be Trump’s vice president in the 2016 election.\n\nGingrich’s advice for those being vetted now? “Go campaign, go on TV, and then you see what the polls say.”\n\nWant daily politics news in your inbox? Subscribe to USA TODAY's OnPolitics newsletter as we lead up to the presidential election.\n\n'Personal chemistry'\n\nNot every prospective vice presidential candidate finds vetting to be remarkably intense.\n\nGingrich said his vetting experience “wasn’t that big a deal” – especially considering his role as speaker and his own presidential run in 2012.\n\n“We’d been through all the various security clearances over the years, so we were used to producing material,\" Gingrich said.\n\nHe filled out reams of paperwork and sat through around two hours worth of questioning from the Trump campaign. Then he flew out to campaign in Cincinnati for a day with Trump, who he had already known for years.\n\nRegardless of what turns up in the vetting process, it usually comes down to how well the candidate and their potential running mate get along.\n\nWhile Harris’ team is likely to look at polling to see who might boost her chances in key states, said Kaine, “at the end of the day, it really is a personal chemistry call.”\n\nContributing: Ken Tran", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/21/joe-biden-drops-out/74255359007/", "title": "Joe Biden endorses Kamala Harris after he drops out of 2024 ...", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news of Joe Biden stepping aside from his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday, July 21. For the latest news on Kamala Harris' efforts to secure the Democratic nomination, follow our live election updates for Monday, July 22.\n\nWASHINGTON − President Joe Biden said Sunday he is ending his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from Democratic leaders sounding the alarm that his path to beat former President Donald Trump in November had vanished.\n\nThe president's historic withdrawal throws the 2024 race − already roiled by a shocking attempt on Trump's life − into uncertain territory, with Vice President Kamala Harris widely seen as the Democrat most likely to take Biden's place atop the party's ticket.\n\nBiden made the announcement from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where he's self-isolated since testing positive for COVID-19 Thursday night.\n\nBiden quickly endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee in a separate statement on X. Harris responded that she's honored to have Biden's endorsement, and her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" The president and vice president spoke several times on Sunday morning ahead of his announcement.\n\nBiden said he would speak to the nation later this week to provide more details about his decision.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nIn his statement, Biden reflected fondly on his four years in office, saying the U.S. has built the “strongest economy in the world” while touting efforts to lower prescription drug prices, expand health care, tackle climate change and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe decision upends the 2024 campaign 107 days before Election Day, with Democratic National Committee members now tasked with choosing an alternative nominee to take on Trump, whose polling lead has swelled while Democrats have fought internally.\n\nBiden's departure will soon mean the end of a five-decade career in Washington that began in 1972 with an upset victory for U.S. Senate in Delaware. He served as a senator for 36 years, then as Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. Biden returned to public life to run against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. He framed the race as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\" and defeated Trump 51%-47% in the popular vote.\n\nIt marks an extraordinary turn for Biden, who for three weeks remained defiant in the face of growing calls from Democratic lawmakers that he withdraw after a disastrous June 27 debate with Trump raised scrutiny over the president's mental fitness.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live updates.\n\nLouisiana Democratic delegation endorses Harris\n\nWhile President Biden's delegates at the upcoming Democratic National Convention are not formally obligated to follow his lead and back Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement at the top of the ticket, the Louisiana delegation is already onboard.\n\n\"This evening, the LA delegation to the @DemConvention met virtually, and by an overwhelming majority vote, officially endorsed Vice President @KamalaHarris to be our 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee,\" the state party reported on X.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC endorses Harris\n\nIn a sign of coalescing Democratic Party unity around Harris, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, BOLD PAC, announced Sunday night that it is endorsing President Biden's chosen successor.\n\nJust a few days ago, BOLD PAC stood squarely behind Biden amid growing calls for him to drop out.\n\n\"President Biden's tenure will be remembered for his accomplishments that stand among the best in history,” said BOLD PAC Chair Rep. Linda Sánchez, D-Calif., in the statement Sunday.\n\n\"As we look ahead, we know that these accomplishments would not have been possible without Vice President Kamala Harris and CHC BOLD PAC is proud to endorse her for president. This administration has led with working families in mind and shown an unwavering commitment to Latinos. There is so much work left to do and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Make no mistake, Latinos nationwide will bear the brunt of the consequences of a Trump second presidency, just like they did in the past. BOLD PAC will remain laser focused on doing what it takes to ensure that Trump remains a one-term president. Vice President Harris is the leader we stand behind at this critical moment.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nHow Harris would run against Trump\n\nA campaign ad from Harris' 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign sheds light on how she might run against Trump if she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe ad, which was shared Sunday afternoon by a pro-Harris account on X, characterizes Harris as the antidote to Trump. It leans heavily on her work as a prosecutor and contrasts that record with Trump's alleged misdeeds.\n\n\"She prosecuted sex predators, he is one,\" the narrator notes, followed by the recording of Trump's crudely phrased statement that he grabs women by their genitals.\n\nThe ad goes on to draw similar comparisons. Whereas Harris prosecuted for-profit colleges that swindled students, Trump ran a for-profit university that was sued by former students who said they were misled by false claims. Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nDemocrats raise nearly $50 million online since Biden’s exit\n\nDemocrats have raised nearly $50 million online since President Joe Biden announced his decision on Sunday to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nActBlue, the leading site processing Democratic donations, said as of 9 p.m. ET it has raised $46.7 million from supporters, making Sunday its biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nMost of the Democratic Party has coalesced quickly around Harris as the nominee, making her the strong favorite to take on Trump in November.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Manchin is considering seeking Democratic nomination\n\nSen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is considering switching his party affiliation from independent to Democratic to seek the party's presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will exit the 2024 race, according to Manchin's adviser Jonathan Kott.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to openly consider challenging Vice President Kamala Harris for the nomination. Manchin, 76, previously flirted with the idea of launching an independent campaign for the presidency, and at one point even floated appearing on a ballot with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, but decided not to in mid-February.\n\nManchin is unlikely to receive much support from Democrats, given his record of bucking some of the party’s major legislative proposals and his decision to register as an independent in May.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris makes the rounds\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spent her afternoon working the phones, calling Democratic Party leaders and members of Congress as she sought to quickly coalesce lawmakers and potential competitors around her candidacy. Among the Democratic officials she spoke to were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star in the party who leads a must-win battleground state, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, according to a source familiar.\n\nHarris has plans to be in Milwaukee on Tuesday and Indianapolis on Wednesday at previously scheduled events. It was not immediately clear when she planned to hold her first campaign event after Biden's surprise dropout and endorsement on Sunday.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nAOC endorses Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a key progressive Democrat, endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination Sunday night as Harris continues to coalesces most of the Democratic Party around her bid.\n\n“Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States. I pledge my full support to ensure her victory in November,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X.\n\n“Now more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy. Let’s get to work.”\n\nWhile 35 congressional Democrats publicly called for Biden to end his campaign prior to his announcement, Ocasio-Cortez was among those who remained behind the president.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump raises questions about the next debate\n\nIs Trump laying the groundwork to forgo a debate against Harris (or any other Democrat)?\n\nIn a Truth Social post late Sunday, Trump noted that his Sept. 10 debate with Biden \"was slated to be broadcast\" on ABC.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Trump gave a somewhat equivocal answer to the debate question: \"I don’t know who I'm going to debate. So far, we haven’t determined who is going to be on that side. But I think whoever it is, I’d like to debate. Yeah, sure.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTennessee Democrats become first delegation to formally endorse Harris for president\n\nTennessee’s 77 Democratic delegates voted by conference call Sunday afternoon to formally endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination, becoming the first delegates previously pledged to Biden in any state to formally back her.\n\nThe decision comes as much of the Democratic establishment, including former President Joe Biden, has quickly coalesced behind Harris following Biden’s announcement to end his 2024 campaign.\n\n“It’s very compelling to me that the president decided not to run and to endorse her,” Chip Forrester, one of the Tennessee delegates, told USA TODAY. “He has worked with her for four years. He chose her as his running mate four years ago. For the president to have that kind of confidence is important to me.”\n\nForrester said Harris also holds as strong “strategic position” because she will inherit Biden’s $240 million cash on hand that his campaign reported at the end of June.\n\nThe Harris campaign took over the Biden campaign committee following Biden’s announcement to drop out.\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Melissa Brown\n\nPotential lawsuits to keep Biden as Democratic nominee would be fruitless: election experts\n\nRepublicans argued Democrats will be ignoring 14 million voters who supported President Joe Biden in the primaries after he declined to become the nominee, but election experts said Sunday that potential lawsuits aiming to keep Biden as the nominee would be fruitless.\n\n“Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters,”House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement. “After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.”\n\nBut David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced election laws and is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said potential lawsuits from Republicans or allies of former President Donald Trump couldn’t force the Democratic Party to stick with Biden because parties choose their own nominees.\n\n“These claims are less than frivolous,” Becker said. “That would not succeed and will not succeed in any state.”\n\nBiden was not yet the Democratic nominee because the party has not yet held its convention scheduled for late August. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that Colorado election officials couldn’t keep Trump off the state’s primary ballot because allowing states to set qualifications for federal office would lead to “chaos.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Who will be Kamala Harris' VP? Here's the possible contenders.\n\nJohn Kerry supports Kamala Harris as party’s next nominee\n\nJohn Kerry, former Secretary of State under the Obama administration, in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, indicated he will join in on supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s next nominee.\n\n“President Biden deserves the gratitude of every American for his extraordinary presidency…I know how difficult today’s selfless decision must have been for someone who spent his entire life in service to country,” he said.\n\nHe added that “now is the time to listen to the only person who has ever beaten Donald Trump, and join with President Biden in every effort to make Vice President Harris the next President of the United States.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nElection expert says no way to hold more Democratic presidential primaries\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced elections law and who now advises state and local officials who conduct elections, slammed the door Sunday on the potential for holding more presidential primaries before the Democratic National Convention in late August, calling it a “fantasy.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee after winning state primaries. Some political analysts, such as GOP podcaster Mike Murphy, have suggested Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger nominee if she beat potential rivals in a new set of primaries.\n\n“She needs to become a winner, which means winning a nomination process,” Murphy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “That would give her a lot more strength coming out of the convention.”\n\nBut Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said states such as Arizona and Florida are still holding local primaries into September, so there is no way election officials could create a new set of primaries within days or weeks.\n\n“The idea that election officials who are already running elections could somehow put together a snap primary in days, and voters would know what to do and where to show up and to cast ballots for candidates we can’t even imagine who might be running is fantasy. There is no feasible way to hold any kind of primaries right now,” said Becker, who is also executive director of the Election Official Legal Defense Network. “There is no way to do open primaries.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nLaPhonza Butler, only Black woman serving in U.S. Senate, backs Harris\n\nCalifornia’s Laphonza Butler, the only Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate, applauded Biden’s service and urged support for Harris. Butler was tapped to serve in the seat when Biden picked Harris for his running mate.\n\n“The threat to all that progress remains, and we must now do everything we can to ensure Vice President Harris succeeds,’’ Butler, the first woman of color to head EMILY's List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, said in a statement. “There's no one better prepared for this challenge.’’\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, was the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Others vying to make similar history praised Harris’ bid for president.\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a Democrat and a Black woman running for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, said she is 100% behind Harris.\n\n“She will provide a clear and stark contrast to the regressive vision Donald Trump has for this country,’’ she said in a statement. “She will make this race about the future and the kind of country our children deserve to inherit.”\n\n-- Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nHarris takes over Biden campaign committee\n\nThe former Biden campaign is now officially the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe campaign formerly known as Biden for President in a filing Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission changed its name to the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe move makes Harris’ bid for the Democratic nomination official, with her campaign apparently assuming control of Biden’s campaign funds. The move also allows Harris to begin raising money for her presidential bid. Harris named Keana Spencer her treasurer.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nEmily’s List endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nEmily’s List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“.@kamalaharris was made for this moment,” they wrote. “Throughout her career, she has been a steadfast fighter for women and reproductive freedom — a role that is more important than ever before. We’re proud to endorse her for president.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep. Cori Bush endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nBush is currently in a tight primary race and said this month that her constituents had concerns about President Joe Biden’s viability as a candidate. She praised him for “prioritizing our nation’s needs” and threw her support behind Harris.\n\n“When we say trust Black women, we mean it. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party and it is past time for us to lead at this moment,” Bush said.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\n'There are many questions now'\n\nShannon O'Brien, a presidential history professor at the University of Texas, called Biden's announcement \"huge:\" \"We've never had a candidate drop out willingly so late before.\"\n\nThe professor also explained how the Democratic convention could potentially function next month.\n\n\"There are many questions now. The pledged delegates for each state are bound by state rules to vote for their candidate X number of times under state law,\" O'Brien explained. \"If Biden has enough to win, then he can decline, which will throw it immediately into a brokered convention. I don't know what it means with Harris on the ticket and much of this would come down to state law on whether or not she wins those pledged delegates.\"\n\n− Darren Samuelsohn\n\nNational Ice Cream Day: A fitting day for Biden\n\nIt’s no secret: Joe Biden loves ice cream.

I am very hopeful that we will come out of our convention next month united and that everyone who has expressed concerns and hopes and thoughts and fears in the last few months, we'll continue to support the ticket that will win this fall,” he said.\n\n“And we'll see what happens in terms of the choice for a running mate. But I think our President Joe Biden has made his endorsement clear. And I think that is the most important endorsement that we could all be paying attention to today.”\n\nHe said earlier in the interview that Harris “has fought hard for freedoms and for rights of Americans and she is a genuine leader.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nIllinois Gov. Pritzker praises Biden, jabs Trump in statement\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, another Democrat who could be vetted to join the Democratic presidential ticket now that Joe Biden has dropped out, praised the former president Sunday before focusing on Donald Trump.\n\nIn a post on X Pritzker commended Biden for working across the aisle to pass infrastructure legislation and shepherd the country past the COVID-19 pandemic. He then criticized Trump for his 34 felony convictions and stances on issues like abortion.\n\n“As we extend our gratitude toward President Biden and reflect on his many accomplishments, we must not ignore the threat posed by Donald Trump’s potential return to the White House,” Pritzker said. “I will work everyday to ensure that he does not win in November.”\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nThe 'ultimate statesman'\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus PAC in a statement called Biden the “ultimate statesman” in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“He’s dedicated his entire career, amid great personal sacrifice, in service to the values of democracy; civility, freedom and opportunity… Americans and democracy loving people around the world owe Joe Biden a great debt of gratitude,” the statement says.\n\nThe group added that it joins Biden in “supporting Kamala Harris as our party’s nominee.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden among most significant US presidents, Pete Buttigieg says\n\nTransportation Secretary and former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Sunday lauded Joe Biden as one of the \"most consequential presidents in American history,\" after the president announced he would not seek another term.\n\nButtigieg has popped up as a potential vice presidential running mate for Kamala Harris, who is the frontrunner to replace Biden as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee. But the former South Bend, Indiana mayor did not address those rumors in his brief social media statement that focused on Biden's presidency.\n\n\"I am so proud to serve under his leadership, and thankful for his unwavering focus on what is best for our country,\" Buttigieg said.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nKamala Harris thanks Biden for service, says she will seek nomination\n\nKamala Harris said in a statement that she is “deeply grateful” to Joe Biden and his family: “With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else.\n\nShe said she is honored to have his endorsement.\n\n\"My intention is to earn and win this nomination. Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead. I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” she said.\n\n− Sarah D. Wire\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. says he commends Biden for stepping down\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that he commends President Joe Biden for stepping out of the 2024 race.\n\n“His infirmities were evident to any unbiased observer from the beginning. It was this progressive deterioration — and his abandonment of Democratic Party principles — that prompted me to enter the race and ensure American voters had a viable, vigorous alternative to Donald Trump,” said Kennedy.\n\nHe also called on the Democratic Party to “return to its traditional commitment to democracy and exemplify it with an open process.”\n\n“Instead of anointing a candidate hand-picked by DNC elites, the party should use neutral polling to identify the candidate who can best beat Donald Trump. The delegates should then select a nominee based on this information,” he said. “If they had done this to begin with, I would not have had to leave the Democratic Party.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nYoung voter group endorses Harris for president\n\nVoters of Tomorrow, a political advocacy group representing Gen Z, endorsed Kamala Harris for president in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe organization has chapters in 20 states and a volunteer presence across the country. It had previously endorsed Joe Biden.\n\n“As vice president, Kamala Harris has been one of Gen Z’s fiercest champions,” the statement said. “Harris has presented a clear vision for our future — a vision that will undoubtedly fire up young people this election to defeat Donald Trump.”\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nObama: Biden is ‘a patriot of the highest order’\n\nFormer President Barack Obama praised Biden’s decision to end his campaign for a second term, saying he selflessly put the country’s interests ahead of his own.\n\nBiden’s “outstanding track record” while in office gave him “every right to run for re-election and finish the job he started,” Obama said. But, “Joe understands better than anyone the stakes in this election — how everything he has fought for throughout his life, and everything that the Democratic Party stands for, will be at risk if we allow Donald Trump back in the White House and give Republicans control of Congress.”\n\nBiden, who served as vice president during the eight years of Obama’s presidency, has never backed down from a fight, Obama said.\n\n“For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life,” the former president said. “But I know he wouldn’t make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It’s a testament to Joe Biden’s love of country — and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow.”\n\nBiden has been “one of America’s most consequential presidents,” Obama said, and “a patriot of the highest order.\n\nObama’s statement made no mention of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is considered the frontrunner to replace Biden on the ticket.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden adviser Klain bemoans ‘donors and electeds’ who pushed the president\n\nJoe Biden’s former White House chief of staff Ron Klain called on Democrats to unite behind Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee – and took at shot at Biden’s Democratic detractors in doing so.\n\n“Now that the donors and electeds have pushed out the only candidate who has ever beaten Trump, it’s time to end the political fantasy games and unite behind the only veteran of a national campaign — our outstanding VP, Kamala Harris!

Project 2025 is a 900-page, sweeping conservative plan for the next GOP administration.\n\n“If President Biden is incapable of running a presidential race, how can he lead our nation for another six months?” Roberts said in a statement Sunday. “In the interest of national security and the safety of our citizens, President Biden must immediately resign.”\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nWhitmer says her job 'remains the same' after Biden drops out\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Sunday that her role in the 2024 election is unchanged in light of Joe Biden’s decision to leave the race, though she didn't explicitly say she wouldn't seek the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhitmer’s name has risen to the top of the list of potential vice presidential nominees who could join a new Democratic ticket led by Kamala Harris.\n\nHowever, the Michigan governor said in a social media post, that her “job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families’ costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan.”\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nSanders praises Biden’s tenure in office\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., thanked Joe Biden for serving the country with “honor and dignity” after the president announced he would end his reelection campaign.\n\nWhile the list of Democrats calling for Biden to exit the 2024 race grew, Sanders continued to back the president until he dropped out Sunday.\n\n“As the first president to ever walk on a picket line with striking workers, he has been the most pro-working class president in modern American history,” Sanders wrote in a social media post. “Thank you, Mr. President, for all you’ve done.”\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton endorse VP Harris for president\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nThe former president and the former secretary of state, who was the Democratic nominee for president in 2016, pledged to do “whatever we can” to support Harris.“We’ve lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term,” the Clintons said in a joint statement. “He has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile Supreme Court will only embolden him to further shred the Constitution. Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we’ve got to elect her. America’s future depends on it.”\n\nThe Clintons also offered praise for Biden, saying he lifted the country out of an unprecedented pandemic, created millions of new jobs, rebuilt a battered economy, strengthened democracy and restored America’s standing in the world.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nWho will replace Biden? Harris is the immediate frontrunner\n\nKamala Harris appears to be the leading candidate to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s nominee in the 2024 election, after the president dropped his reelection bid amid rising concerns about his age following his debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden emphatically endorsed Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nIf formally nominated, Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman at the top of a major party presidential ticket.

Nov. 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”\n\nJohnson said Biden’s decision to leave the race under pressure from Democrats who feared he would lose to Trump “invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president.”\n\n“The party’s prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris, who co-owns the disastrous policy failures of the Biden administration,” he said. “As second in command and a completely inept border czar, Harris has been a gleeful accomplice — not only in the destruction of American sovereignty, security, and prosperity, but also in the largest political coverup in U.S. history. She has known for as long as anyone of his incapacity to serve.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nPelosi calls Biden 'one of the most consequential Presidents in American history'\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a statement on Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race, said Biden is a “patriotic American who has always put his nation first.”\n\n“His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,” Pelosi said.\n\nThe former House speaker added: “With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden’s greatness and goodness.”\n\nIn recent days, Pelosi had reportedly shared concerns privately to Biden about his grim prospects to defeat Trump and that his candidacy could doom Senate and House Democratic candidates.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nPotential VP nominee Beshear says Biden's decision in “best interest” of country\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called Joe Biden’s decision to drop his 2024 reelection bid in the “best interest of the country and party,” in a statement Sunday.\n\n“President Biden will be remembered as a consequential president. Along with Vice President Harris, he led us through the aftermath of the January 6th attack on our Capitol and steadily steered us out of a global pandemic,” Beshear wrote.\n\nHe is among a handful of Democratic governors believed to be on the short list to now join the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\n“Now it’s time for our nation to come together,” Beshear added in the post. “We need to dial down the anger, rancor and noise.\"\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nHakeem Jeffries: 'We are forever grateful'\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Rep.

Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,\" he added.\n\n−Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden exits race amid widespread pressure, mounting concerns about his age\n\nBiden's exit came after he received bleak warnings from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that his candidacy could lead to massive losses for Democrats in the Senate and House. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shared similar concerns to Biden.\n\nMore than 30 congressional Democrats had called for Biden to bow out. Former President Barack Obama reportedly also relayed fears privately to Democratic allies about Biden's prospects of beating Trump. Democratic donors from Hollywood to Wall Street also came out against Biden continuing his reelection bid.\n\nBiden, 81, has battled Americans’ concerns over his age since he took office but it turned into panic for Democrats after last month's first debate with Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's voice sounded faint, he struggled to complete sentences and finish thoughts, and he failed to rebut many of Trump's claims on the debate stage.\n\nBiden's campaign was in a free fall over the past few weeks with his future in doubt. Instead of focusing solely on Trump, Democrats spent as much time and energy debating whether Biden could even defeat his predecessor.\n\nFundraising for the Biden campaign took a dramatic hit. And Biden not only fell behind in key battleground states that will decide the election, but his growing unpopularity seemed to put recent Democratic strongholds like Virginia in play for Trump.\n\n−Joey Garrison and Swapna Venugopal\n\nBiden becomes first incumbent not to seek reelection since LBJ\n\nBiden becomes the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since Lyndon B.

Since then, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and others in the Democratic Party have mirrored the message in news interviews.\n\nWalz explained why he uses \"weird\" to attack Republicans in an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday:\n\n\"Listen to the guy, he's talking about Hannibal Lecter, and shocking sharks, and just whatever crazy thing pops into his mind, and I thought we just give him way too much credit,\" referring to some of the alarm bells Democrats have raised on Trump's threats to democracy. \"When you just ratchet down some of the, you know the scariness or whatever, and just name it what it is...my observation on this is, have you ever seen the guy laugh?\"\n\nRepublicans fight back weird allegations\n\nVance has weighed in on the weird comments, posting a video of Harris introducing herself with her pronouns, with the caption \"JD Vance is weird.\"\n\nFlorida Rep.

Mike Pence praised Donald Trump and slammed Hillary Clinton during a rally in Westfield on Tuesday that was widely seen as an audition to become Trump’s running mate.\n\nTrump made no announcement, but seemed to relish teasing his Indiana audience with the prospect.\n\n“I don’t know if he’s going to be your governor or your vice president. Who the hell knows! Good man,” Trump said at the end of a nearly hour-long speech to about 6,500 supporters at the Grand Park Events Center.\n\nAmid Trump veep buzz, Newt Gingrich and Fox News cut ties\n\nDuring a roughly five-minute introduction of Trump, Pence called on the crowd to put “a fighter, a builder and a patriot” in the Oval Office and said Clinton should be ineligible to run for president because of the death of U.S. personnel in Benghazi.\n\n“As the proud father of a United States Marine, let me say from my heart we don’t need a president that took 13 hours to send help to Americans under fire,” Pence said. “Anyone who did that should be disqualified from ever being commander in chief of the armed forces of the United States of America.”\n\nThe attacks on Clinton were uncharacteristically fierce for Pence, who has eschewed negative campaigning in the past. But the comments are typical for vice presidential candidates, who are often called upon to act as attack dogs on the campaign trail.\n\nThe rally and a joint appearance with Trump earlier in the day at a downtown fundraiser come as Trump is nearing a decision on a vice presidential candidate, with Pence considered a front-runner.\n\nBernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton join forces against Donald Trump\n\nWhile some Trump supporters in the audience were lukewarm about the idea of Pence joining the ticket, others said they saw something new in Pence’s speech.\n\n“That’s the most exciting I’d ever heard or seen the man,” said Lyle Enyeart, a Pence supporter from Warsaw. “Man, what a ball of fire there.”\n\nPence, a staunch social conservative, could help Trump with religious conservatives who have been skeptical of Trump. In focusing on Clinton, Pence was hitting on a message likely to resonate with those conservatives.\n\nOthers under consideration for the vice presidential slot have also joined Trump on the campaign trail in recent days, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has compared the selection process to Trump’s reality TV show The Apprentice.\n\nThose who attended the private fundraiser at the Columbia Club said Trump spoke highly of Pence. Indiana Senate leader David Long, a Fort Wayne Republican who attended the fundraiser, said that at one point Trump asked if Pence would be a good vice president and the crowd roared, “Yes!”\n\nPence isn’t the only possible vice presidential pick who Trump has dropped hints about. At a rally in Ohio last week, he said Gingrich “will be involved with our government,” according to the Washington Post.\n\nWhile the Indianapolis fundraiser and rally were filled with Trump supporters, the scene was less cordial outside the Columbia Club. Dozens of protesters chanted \"Fire Mike Trump\" and held signs with slogans such as \"Pence Must Go\" and \"Trump: Divider in Chief.\"\n\nBrexit leader Farage has 'lessons' for Trump, GOP\n\nSeveral Democrat speakers said they thought Pence has hurt Indiana and a Trump-Pence ticket would be bad for the country.\n\nState Sen. Jean Breaux, D-Indianapolis, said Indiana's per capita income has fallen under Pence's leadership and he signed a restrictive abortion law this year that she says takes choices away from women.\n\nTrump rarely mentioned Pence during his speech Tuesday night, promising better trade deals that protect American jobs, a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and a tougher stance on terrorism.\n\nHe also pitched himself as the “law and order candidate” and offered his condolences to the families of the five police officers killed in Dallas last week.\n\n“The hostility against our police has to end, and it has to end right now,” he said.\n\nWhile Pence is seen as someone who could help Trump navigate Congress and tap conservative donor networks, it’s unclear how his strongly held positions on social issues would fare in a Trump administration.\n\nEarlier in the day, Pence declined to directly answer questions about how he would address significant differences with Trump. Pence has publicly criticized Trump’s comments on abortion and has called his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the country unconstitutional.\n\nInstead, Pence said differences among Republicans are not unusual and that he plans to campaign hard for Trump. He even compared the billionaire businessman to a Republican icon.\n\n“I think he is going to be a great president,” he told a group of reporters. “I think he is someone who has connected with everyday Americans like no one since Ronald Reagan.”\n\nKyle Kondik, an election analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said Trump’s appearances with Pence “might be a way to test out whether they complement each other well and are comfortable with each other.”\n\nPence is facing a tough race in Indiana against Democrat John Gregg, a former Indiana House speaker who narrowly lost to Pence in 2012. Polls have shown the two candidates in a virtual dead heat.\n\nDemocrats in Indiana have tried to capitalize on Pence’s role in the vice presidential hunt, but chasing the job has significantly raised Pence’s national profile, which could be important for someone with presidential ambitions.\n\nAnd even if Pence is not selected, he may see a close association with Trump as beneficial to his gubernatorial re-election effort in a Republican-leaning state whose voters sealed Trump’s status as the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\nPence faces a Friday deadline to withdraw from the governor’s race to allow state party leaders to choose a replacement candidate.\n\nContributing: Brian Eason, Kaitlin Lange and Crystal Duan, The Indianapolis Star.

Here's what happened", "text": "Sen. Mark Kelly, vice-presidential prospect and retired astronaut, is married to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona native whose promising political career was cut short by an assassination attempt in 2011.\n\nKelly, a Democrat, is relatively new to politics, having never held public office until four years ago when he was elected to the U.S. Senate at the age of 56 in a special election to fill the seat vacated by the death of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Kelly is 60.\n\nGiffords, a Democrat who married Kelly in 2007, paved the way for Kelly to embark on his own political career. Kelly, is under consideration as the running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nA Tucson native, Giffords first got into politics in 2001 when she was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives. In 2002, at the age of 32, she was elected to the Arizona Senate. Her career continued on an upward trajectory, and in 2006, she became the third woman in Arizona history elected to the U.S. Congress.\n\nAt 10:10 a.m. on Jan. 8, 2011 — a sunny Saturday morning three days after she was sworn into her third term in the U.S. House of Representatives — Giffords was shot in the head while meeting with constituents at a public event outside of a Safeway grocery store northwest of Tucson.\n\nHere are seven things to know about the assassination attempt on Giffords and its aftermath:\n\nWhat happened in the Gabby Giffords shooting near Tucson?\n\nSix people died in the Jan. 8, 2011, shooting: U.S. District Judge John Roll, who was 63; Gabe Zimmerman, 30, a community-outreach director for Giffords' office; 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, who was visiting the event with a family friend; Dorwan Stoddard, 76, who died protecting his wife; Dorothy Morris, a 76-year-old retiree, mother and grandmother; and 79-year-old Phyllis Schneck, a mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and Republican who loved Giffords.\n\nDuring a talk about the shooting at the University of Arizona in December 2011, Kelly called the loss of Christina-Taylor, the youngest victim, \"the most tragic thing about this story,\" the Tucson-based Arizona Daily Star reported.\n\n\"Gabby was horribly injured, but she survived,\" Kelly said.\n\nA doctor called Giffords' survival from near-fatal head injury 'miraculous'\n\nThirteen people, including Giffords and two of her staff members, were injured in the shooting. Giffords was the most seriously wounded. She was shot through the left side of her head.\n\nThe bullet entered her head just above her left eye, stayed in the left hemisphere, did not cross through the brain's geometric center and exited through the back, doctors said. Neurosurgeons performed what is called a decompressive craniectomy, in which part of the skull was removed to give Giffords' swelling brain room to expand without being constricted by bone.\n\nOne day after the shooting, Dr. G. Michael Lemole Jr., who was one of the two neurosurgeons who performed Giffords' surgery, called Giffords' condition \"miraculous\" given the trauma she suffered.\n\nWhat was the Tucson shooter's motive? He had untreated schizophrenia\n\nTucson resident Jared Loughner, 22, at the time of the shooting, was restrained by bystanders at the scene and arrested.\n\nAfter his arrest, Loughner was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He was later sentenced by a federal judge to life in prison with no eligibility for parole.\n\nDuring the sentencing, U.S. District Judge Larry A. Burns said Loughner's mental illness did not mean he could have successfully pursued an insanity defense, the Arizona Daily Star reported. Prosecutors had too much evidence that his conduct was \"purposeful\" and that he appreciated his actions were wrong, according to the Star.\n\nSome victims later speculated that Loughner's undiagnosed mental illness fueled the killings. Had someone in Loughner's life intervened when he was showing symptoms, he might have received involuntary psychiatric treatment that could have prevented the killings, shooting victim and former Giffords aide Ron Barber told the Star after the sentencing.\n\nBarber was elected to replace Giffords in Congress following her resignation in 2012.\n\nGiffords spent months recovering in Houston\n\nGiffords was treated for her gunshot wound at what is now called Banner University Medical Center Tucson.\n\nShe was transferred to Houston on Jan. 21, 2011, to begin more than six months of inpatient rehabilitation for her brain injury at The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR) Memorial Hermann. The facility is among the top-ranked in the country for rehabilitating brain injuries, and Kelly was living in Houston at the time.\n\nGiffords' progress captured the attention of people across the country and made national headlines for each step of progress she made, including asking for toast with her breakfast just a month after the shooting. Within two months of the shooting she was singing and remembering the words to \"American Pie.\"\n\nDue to his career at NASA and Giffords' career representing Arizona in Congress, they had a long-distance marriage prior to the shooting, with Kelly living in Houston and Giffords in Tucson and Washington D.C. When Giffords completed her rehabilitation in Houston, the couple moved to Giffords' hometown of Tucson.\n\nKelly retired from the military nine months after his wife was shot\n\nGiffords was all smiles as she attended a ceremony at the White House to honor Kelly's retirement as a U.S. Navy Captain and astronaut on Oct. 11, 2011. In one of the few public appearances she'd made since the shooting, Giffords got up on her own to help present her husband with the Distinguished Flying Cross medal, which he earned for commanding the fourth and final flight on the space shuttle Endeavour in May of that year.\n\nJoe Biden, who was vice president at the time, presided over the ceremony for Kelly. Biden spoke directly to Giffords during the event, calling her an inspiration to thousands of people who suffer from traumatic brain injuries.\n\nKelly also addressed Giffords during the ceremony.\n\n“Gabby, you remind me every day to deny the acceptance of failure,” Kelly said.\n\nBecause of her injuries, Giffords resigned from Congress\n\nGiffords made remarkable progress after being shot in the head, but her injuries were life-altering. The gunshot wound left her struggling with speech, took away a significant portion of her eyesight and left her right arm and right leg mostly paralyzed.\n\nKelly once joked that Giffords used to say at least 70% of the words in their marriage. But that changed after the shooting.\n\nOn Jan. 25, 2012, Giffords made her last appearance as a member of Congress. In a video message, she said she was resigning to focus on her recovery.\n\n“Arizona is my home. Always will be,” Giffords said in the video. “A lot has happened over the past year. We cannot change that. But I know on the issues we fought for, we can change things for the better. Jobs. Border security. Veterans. We can do so much more by working together.”\n\nHundreds of Giffords' colleagues from both sides of the political aisle gathered on the House floor to say goodbye and pay tribute to her.\n\nWhen she handed then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, her official letter of resignation, he could be seen brushing away tears, Politico reported at the time.\n\nGiffords now works to prevent gun violence\n\nAs the leader of a nonprofit called Giffords, the former member of Congress now advocates against gun violence. Her organization says it is \"fighting to end the gun lobby’s stranglehold on our political system.\"\n\nGiffords the organization announced last week it is committing $15 million in ads supporting Democratic candidates and Harris’ presidential candidacy in swing states. Giffords herself has made recent stops for congressional campaigns in Pittsburgh, Detroit and Grand Rapids, Mich.\n\n“She works a lot harder than most people realize,” Emma Brown, the executive director of the Giffords organization, recently told The Arizona Republic. “She keeps up a blistering schedule. … And at the same time, she works extremely hard at recovering from being shot in the head 13 years ago. It’s a daily effort.”\n\nRepublic reporter Ronald J. Hansen contributed to this article\n\nReach health care reporter Stephanie Innes at stephanie.innes@gannett.com or at 480-313-3775.

Biden had already committed to choosing a woman as his running mate.\n\n\"I think this is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket,\" Klobuchar said on MSNBC. \"If you want to heal this nation right now — my party, yes, but our nation — this is sure a hell of a way to do it.\"\n\nBiden praised Klobuchar in a tweet Thursday, citing her \"grit and determination\" and saying, \"With your help, we're going to beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nJoe Biden vowed to pick a woman VP:Some Democrats say she must be a woman of color\n\nKlobuchar's chances at getting the VP nod diminished after the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Klobuchar was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis, and during that period, more than two dozen people — mostly minorities — died during encounters with police.\n\nFloyd's death last month set off days of protests across the country and criticism that as the county's top prosecutor, Klobuchar didn't charge any of the officers involved in citizen deaths. Officer Derek Chauvin, who was charged with Floyd's murder, had been involved in one of those cases, the fatal 2006 shooting of a man accused of stabbing people and aiming a shotgun at police.\n\nKlobuchar, 60, was among a large field of Democrats who had sought the 2020 presidential nomination, running as a pragmatic Midwesterner who has passed over 100 bills. She dropped out and threw her support behind Biden before the crucial March 3 \"Super Tuesday\" contests after struggling to win support from Black voters, who are crucial to Democratic victories.\n\nEven before Floyd's death, activists were pushing Biden to consider a woman of color, saying it would help build a multiracial coalition behind the Democratic ticket and motivate people — particularly younger voters — who may be underwhelmed by the 77-year-old former vice president's bid.\n\nOthers wanted Biden to choose a more progressive candidate, who could bring in support from voters who backed Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in the primary.\n\n'Vision, competence and national experience':More than 100 liberal activists urge Joe Biden to pick Elizabeth Warren as VP in letter\n\nLike Biden, Klobuchar disagreed with Sanders and Warren during the campaign on major issues such as health care, calling \"Medicare for All\" unachievable and pushing instead for changes to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDemocrats with knowledge of the process told The Associated Press last week that Biden's search committee had narrowed the choices to as few as six serious contenders after initial interviews. Among the group still in contention: Warren, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Susan Rice, who served as President Barack Obama's national security adviser. Warren is white; both Harris and Rice are Black.\n\nBiden has said he will announce his VP decision by Aug. 1.\n\nAssociated Press writers Amy Forliti in Minneapolis, Julie Pace in Washington, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Ashley Thomas in Savannah, Georgia, contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/18"}]}

Video taken by Perez shows the basement blanketed by murky water, soaking the legs of furniture as Christmas ornaments and other items float about.\n\nThe water had receded by 9 a.m., revealing a layer of debris and black sludge and leaving everything in the basement ruined, Perez said. “Never in my life have I experienced something like this,” she said.\n\nFrom late Monday night to Tuesday, more than 9 inches of rain fell on St. Louis, surpassing the city’s highest 24-hour rainfall total on record, which was 7.02 inches on August 19-20, 1915.\n\nThough the downpour subsided Tuesday afternoon, the area is expected to receive less severe rainfall Wednesday and Thursday, which could lead to flash flooding in areas that were soaked by Tuesday’s storms, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe flooding left at least one person dead Tuesday. The man’s body was found in a vehicle that had been submerged under more than 8 feet of water, city Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson said. Police were called to the low-lying area by a concerned resident and found the body when the water receded, he said.\n\nAbandoned cars are scattered by flooding across a shuttered section of I-70 Tuesday. Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/AP\n\nRescuers fanned out across the area to help stranded residents stuck in the flooding. The fire department responded to about 18 homes where people were trapped, rescuing six people and six dogs, the department said. Approximately 15 people chose to shelter in place.\n\nA state of emergency was declared for the area by St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, which allows the state to ask for federal relief funding, Page said in a tweet. Shelters for displaced residents were set up around the region.\n\nAmong those sheltering Tuesday was a family from the suburb of University City, who told CNN affiliate KSDK water was pouring into their home so quickly that they had to flee barefoot, leaving behind medication, walkers and canes. But the items they will mourn the most, they said, are their irreplaceable sentimental belongings, like photos of family members who are no longer living.\n\nHighways turned into rivers\n\nThe flooding inundating homes also transformed roads into rushing rivers, forcing multiple street closures as vehicles became submerged window-deep and drivers were left stranded throughout the city, waiting for rescuers on boats.\n\nAt one point Tuesday, all four interstate highways heading to downtown St. Louis – I-70, I-64, I-55, and I-44 – had at least one closure because of flooding, KMOV reported.\n\nA stretch of I-70 in the St. Louis area – where vehicles were seen stuck in the water – was closed in both directions during the early morning, and motorists were urged to avoid the interstate.\n\nA car is submerged in flood waters after St. Louis recieved record-breaking rainfall Tuesday. KSDK\n\n“You can see there’s cars up there floating around,” driver Jerome Smith said in a video he took while stuck on I-70 for three hours.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, highways were mostly clear and all bridges over the River des Peres were open, said Heather Taylor, St. Louis’ deputy director of public safety.\n\nIt wasn’t just drivers who saw hourslong delays Tuesday. Parts of the St. Louis area’s MetroLink commuter rail system were flooded, with potential damage to equipment threatening closures lasting more than two weeks as services are restored, according to the city’s transit agency.\n\nWater covers much of MetroLink's Forest Park-DeBaliviere station in St. Louis on Tuesday morning. Tony Nipert\n\nImages showed water rushing through the Forest Park-DeBaliviere Metrolink station. “It’s currently a river … I have never seen this in the four years I’ve lived here,” said Tony Nipert, who lives near the station.\n\nThe severe flooding drenching the region also heavily damaged electrical equipment, with thousands of power outages reported in St. Louis County. By the afternoon, power had been restored to nearly 20,000 customers, according to electric power utility Ameren.\n\nOf the more than 9 inches that fell in 24 hours in St. Louis, 7.68 inches fell in just six hours. Rainfall that intense in St. Louis has less than a 1 in 1,000 chance of happening in a given year based on historical data, according to the weather service.\n\nThe climate crisis is supercharging rainfall around the world, with climbing temperatures making record-breaking downpours more likely as more moisture is stored in the atmosphere, experts say. Scientists are increasingly confident in the role that the climate crisis plays in extreme weather.\n\nBig one-day precipitation dumps that used to happen once a decade (between 1850 and 1900) are expected to become more common, according to a report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\n‘Potentially significant’ flash flooding possible elsewhere in US this week\n\nIn some states to the east of Missouri, more storms over the next couple of days, combined with already saturated soils, could lead to “potentially significant areas of flash flooding,” the Weather Prediction Center said.\n\nA moderate risk – or level 3 of 4 – of excessive rainfall exists Wednesday and Thursday for parts of Kentucky, West Virginia and northern Tennessee, the prediction center said.\n\nBut those are just the areas of greatest risk. A “conveyor belt of heavy showers and thunderstorms” will stretch from the Southwest to the central Appalachians over the next few days, the center said.\n\nFlash flooding could happen from the Ozarks through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, and in parts of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and by Friday, western Kansas, according to the center.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh Elizabeth Wolfe Raja Razek", "Nouran Salahieh", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Raja Razek"], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/morris-county/2024/01/10/morris-county-flooding-swamps-homeowners-again-after-latest-storm/72180641007/", "title": "Morris County flooding swamps homeowners again after latest storm", "text": "For Lincoln Park's Kristen Perry, it was getting old. Wednesday marked the third time in three weeks that floodwaters invaded the garage of her yellow raised ranch near the Pompton River.\n\nThe latest deluge wasn't as bad as the mid-December rainstorm that left 4 feet of water swirling around the property at Ryerson Road and Pequannock Avenue. This time, Perry \"only\" had to contend with 2 feet, she said. Still, she picked her son up early from Pequannock Township High School, worried he might have trouble getting home if the river continued to rise.\n\n“The water comes around both sides of our house. If it rises high enough, it meets in the middle of the yard it and will connect and then our house is completely surrounded by water,” she said. “I don't think it's supposed to be as bad as last time, which is good but, it's still a little nerve-wracking. I don’t want my son walking through disgusting, muddy river water to get back in the house.\"\n\nFrom Dover to Denville to Montville and Pequannock, waters were receding around Morris County by Wednesday evening, but roads and intersections remained flooded in some spots after the region's latest soaking. Authorities were still urging caution.\n\nFlood warnings in Lincoln Park, Pequannock\n\n“River flooding is expected this evening,” Lincoln Park officials warned in an alert to the community earlier in the afternoon. “Residents in flood-prone areas are urged to self-evacuate before roads become impassable. For the safety of our first responders, assisted evacuations will end at 10 p.m. unless there is an emergency.”\n\n'That just made me cry':NJ funeral home offers hot tea, shelter for flood victims\n\n'Entire neighborhood on edge':North Jersey residents face more hardships from flooding\n\nIn the Pompton Plains section of Pequannock, the Pompton River was still in a \"major flood stage\" when it crested around 4 p.m. at 20.4 feet, according to the National Weather Service. That was 4 feet above flood level, though the river was projected to continue falling, the agency said.\n\nEarlier in the day, stores were open and traffic was brisk along the flood-prone Route 202 corridor from Montville through Lincoln Park into Pequannock. But significant flooding could be seen in some neighborhoods, including homes along River Road, parallel to Route 202 near the Wayne border where the Pompton River bends. Those River Road homes were completely surrounded by floodwater.\n\nMore flooding could be seen nearby along Ryerson Road, while the Lincoln Park Community Lake recreation complex was completely under water. So was the boat launch at Aqueduct Park.\n\nRoad closings in Montville, Denville\n\nBoonton Turnpike at the Wayne border and Two Bridges Road both remained closed in Lincoln Park. In Montville, police Changebridge Road would be closed, with the Passaic River expected to rise until 1 a.m.\n\n(Above: Before and after views of flooding in Denville.)\n\nIn Denville, floodwaters were dropping in many areas and Route 46 near Bloomfield Avenue was open as of 3 p.m. following earlier closures. Bloomfield Avenue was still closed due to flooding, as were Second Avenue, McCarter Park and several parking lots.\n\nBut downtown, Broadway was open, as was Pocono Road after Rockaway River flooding closed it earlier in the day near Saint Clare’s Hospital. Several hospital lots were still under water, so visitors were parking along Pocono Road. The river at 3 p.m. was flowing heavily, just below the bridge into Mountain Lakes.\n\nIn Lincoln Park, looking for a way out\n\nPerry, 53, and her husband Brian, 50, moved to town 14 years ago to be near his family. Since then there have been numerous floods, some major, some minor, she said.\n\nAt this point, the family would like to get out. But neighbors have had trouble selling their homes.\n\n“Our neighbors were trying to sell their house and they actually had some offers and then the potential buyers came during the first flood and took pictures and video and I don't think they ever heard from them again. It's frustrating.”\n\nShe’s hoping the government might help. Perry applied to the state's Blue Acres program, which buys out homes in flood prone areas. The initial application was turned down, but she tried again recently.\n\n“I sent them video of the water just rushing into our driveway after Irene in 2011 and I sent them pictures of the last two storms and said, ‘How do we apply again?’ But I forget, what the reply was.

The borough received 2.66 inches of water, while there was 3.13 inches of rain further up the Pascack Brook, he said.\n\nThe water rose rapidly around 2 a.m., with significant flooding being reported at Harding Avenue, Steuben Avenue, Nugent Place, Broadway, Brookside Park and at the Roxbury and 500 Center condominiums, said Arroyo. Flooding peaked around 6 a.m. and began to recede soon after.\n\nThe borough’s Office of Emergency Management, police officers, public works personnel, fire department and other emergency services were actively monitoring conditions throughout the night, providing updates, warnings, and responding to calls for aid, said Arroyo.\n\n“Our heartfelt thanks to these men and women for their diligence and commitment to the residents of Westwood,” said Arroyo.\n\n- Stephanie Noda\n\nFor more on the flooding in North Jersey and how it affected residents, check out this story.\n\nWhen will NJ rivers flood?\n\nThough the rain has dissipated some major rivers have not reached their peak flooding stages yet.

But for now, residents of some neighborhoods still experience flooding during bad storms.\n\nNorth Jersey:Here's what towns, residents are reporting about flood conditions\n\nJosh Cohen, a resident in the Fairmount section of Hackensack, said his sewer line consistently floods with city overflow during heavy rains. During storms like the one Tuesday, sewage also overflows onto the street through catch-basins on Clinton Place and Prospect Avenue.\n\n“I have a flood-gate backwater valve installed on my sewer which prevents the overflow from entering the basement,” he said. “But I cannot take showers or flush toilets during an overflow event.\"\n\n−Megan Burrow\n\nGov. Murphy gives state update\n\nGov. Phil Murphy said on CBS that as of 8:45 a.m. there were about 56,000 without power, and that was primarily near the shore where the winds had been stronger.\n\nFlooding is still a concern in the northern part of the state as rivers may not crest until tomorrow, Murphy said.\n\nHe noted that there have been no storm-related deaths reported and the system has moved through the area, but more rain is expected in a few days.\n\nHow much rain?Here's a look at the amount of rain North Jersey got by town in latest storm\n\nThe governor also said declaring a state of emergency early has two benefits. The first is that it helps with managing the response to the storm, while the second is that it signals to residents that the storm will be serious.\n\n“It’s harder to penetrate on water events,” Murphy said. He added that people don’t take rain as seriously as they do snow, and in cases like Hurricane Ida, “people pay with their lives.”\n\n−Katie Sobko\n\nMore:NJ flooding is getting worse.

So far, Alicea said there’s been no major flooding in the city.\n\nBut the Passaic River is expected to crest at 10 feet in Paterson on Thursday afternoon, which likely will swamp some bridges and flood streets near the river, Alicea said.\n\nPublic schools opened for in-person classes Wednesday morning, despite a request from the city’s emergency management coordinator, Troy Ayers, that they close because of the “impending hazard” from the storm.\n\nThe district didn’t disregard Ayers’ request, said school board president Manny Martinez. “We considered it,” Martinez said.\n\n−Joe Malinconico\n\nOakland flooding\n\nOakland Business Administrator Richard Kunze said Wednesday that flooding has receded in Crystal Lake and Roosevelt Boulevard. The Glen Gray Road bridge over the Ramapo River remains under water, he said. One neighborhood lost power for six hours last night, but power was restored, Kunze said.\n\n−Marsha Stoltz\n\nNorth Passaic flooding\n\nIn the extreme northwest of Passaic County, West Milford residents saw nearly 3 inches of rain and another inch from snowmelt but no road closures as of 8:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, according to a statement from local police. The Pequannock River running along the south of the township was nonetheless teeming with runoff from the Charlotteburg Reservoir, helping to fuel severe flooding in towns to the southeast.\n\nPequannock Avenue and Hillview Road were also closed in Pequannock. Further north, the flooding had led to road closures in the vicinity of Van Dam Avenue in Bloomingdale. And, in Pompton Lakes, the rising flow of the Wanaque River at Wilderness Island Park and other rivers led town officials to open a temporary shelter at the Carnevale Center at 10 Lenox Ave.\n\n− David Zimmer\n\nLincoln Park flooding\n\nResidents in flood-prone areas are urged to self-evacuate before roads become impassable.

Water could be seen filling Sidney Sweet up to the Dunkin'.\n\nWayne mostly in good shape\n\nMerchants at Willowbrook Mall in Wayne opened for business as scheduled at 11 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nRyan Hidalgo, the senior general manager of the shopping center, the largest in Passaic County, said the low-lying property south of Route 46 experienced no flooding.\n\nIt is a concern for all property owners in that area due to the proximity of the Passaic River, which forms the border between the township and Fairfield, and between it and Little Falls.\n\nBut local police reported that flood-prone roads in the vicinity were navigable.\n\nOther streets farther north were inundated. They included Clark Street, a portion of Fayette Avenue, Manhattan Avenue, a portion of Monmouth Avenue and all roads in the Hoffman Grove neighborhood.\n\n−Phil DeVencentis\n\nFlooding on NJ highways\n\nThe highways were a mess Wednesday morning with flooding closing many main arteries for commuters.\n\nSome of the highways with lanes closed due to flooding include Route 17 in Hasbrouck Heights, Route 23 in Kinnelon, the New Jersey Turnpike in Newark and Route 206 in Mount Olive.\n\nRoute 23 in Pequannock is also expected to be closed in both directions, police said.\n\nLincoln Park residents take precautions\n\nAlthough Wednesday's flooding isn’t as severe as it was on Dec. 18, three times in three weeks is still a lot to deal with, said Lincoln Park’s Kristen Perry, who currently has two feet of water in the garage of her yellow raised ranch on the corner of Ryerson Road and Pequannock Avenue.\n\nThere was 4 feet of water in the garage on that December day. Still, Perry picked up her son from Pequannock Township High School early Wednesday, worried he might have trouble getting in the front door if floodwaters continue to rise.\n\n“The water comes around both sides of our house. If it rises high enough, it meets in the middle of the yard it and will connect and then our house is completely surrounded by water,” Perry said. “I don't think it's supposed to be as bad as last time, which is good, but it's still a little nerve-wracking.

For Passaic County, December’s 8.57 inches of precipitation was the second highest total on record for the month and double the 30-year normal rate of 4.26 inches.\n\nIt was the fourth wettest December for Bergen County, which got 7.67 inches.\n\nThe active weather pattern for the region has been caused by a strong El Nino and exacerbated by climate change, said David Robinson, New Jersey’s state climatologist and a Rutgers University professor.\n\nEl Nino is a weather pattern that pulls moisture and energy out of the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean and sends it east across the United States.\n\nThe pattern of storms we have been experiencing is the result. And the storms are even more intense than they otherwise would be because the warmer air and greater energy in the atmosphere caused by climate change can amplify weather events, making large storms even larger, Robinson said.\n\n− James O'Neill", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/20/hilary-california-live-updates/70635871007/", "title": "Tropical Storm Hilary updates: Floods and rescue across region", "text": "Editor's note: For the latest news on Hilary and the storm's path please follow our live updates file here\n\nMARINA DEL REY, Calif − Tropical Storm Hilary drenched Southern California from the coast to inland mountains and deserts Sunday evening, prompting rescues from swollen rivers and forcing some of the nation’s largest school districts to cancel Monday classes\n\nHilary brought intensifying rain to the region, with some mountain and desert areas seeing more than half an average year’s worth of rain come down in just one day, including the desert resort city of Palm Springs, which saw nearly 3 inches of rain by Sunday evening. Hilary was toppling trees and causing mudslides in the San Diego area.\n\nHilary was the first tropical storm to cross into California from Mexico since Nora in 1997, the weather service office in San Diego said Sunday night. If Hilary had come in off the ocean in a landfall in California, it would have been the first tropical storm to do so since 1939.\n\nOne person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalia when a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream, The Associated Press reported. Rescue workers saved four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege township.\n\nMud and boulders spilled onto highways, water overwhelmed drainage systems and tree branches fell in neighborhoods from San Diego to Los Angeles. Dozens of cars were trapped in floodwaters in Palm Springs and surrounding desert communities across the Coachella Valley. Crews pumped floodwaters out of the emergency room at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who is traveling to Hawaii on Monday to survey damage from devastating wildfires in Maui, urged \"everyone in the path of this storm to take precautions and listen to the guidance of state and local officials.\"\n\nTropical Storm Hilary tracker:Follow the storm’s path as it heads toward Southern California\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ Thousands of Southern California residents were without power on Sunday as storm conditions took down power lines. Over 7,000 Imperial Irrigation District customers in the eastern Coachella Valley and Imperial County service area were without power while over 31,000 Southern California Edison customers lost power areas in or near Los Angeles county.\n\n◾ The National Weather Service extended its flash flood warning for the Los Angeles area until 3:00 a.m. local time. The agency warned some parts of the area would experience life-threatening flooding as the fire department conducted water rescues for cars stuck in flooded roads.\n\n◾ The Los Angeles school district, the second largest in the nation, said all its schools will be closed Monday. The San Diego school district, which planned to begin its fall term Monday, said it will delay the start of classes to Tuesday.\n\n◾ The city of Palm Springs declared an emergency, \"due to unprecedented rainfall in flooding of local roadways and at least one swift water rescue.\" The declaration, according to spokesperson Amy Blaisdell, opens up access to extra resources, such as funds for repairs from storm damage and more flexibility with emergency purchases.\n\n◾ In Southern California, at least two debris flows have been reported over roadways in San Bernardino, and rocks have been reported on roads in three locations in Kern, the National Weather Service said. Two semi-trucks were reported flipped along Interstate 8 in Imperial, the weather service added.\n\n◾ Hilary’s rainfall is an extreme, record-breaking event, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “There’s a very clear link between increases in extreme precipitation and global warming,” Swain said. In a warmer world, “the atmosphere’s capacity to hold water vapor increases exponentially.”\n\n◾ California Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency, and authorities issued an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, 23 miles off the coast.\n\n◾ As the storm rolls north, portions of Oregon and Idaho could see as much as 3 to 5 inches of rain, producing some \"significant\" flash flooding, the National Weather Service said.\n\n'Walls were moving quite a bit'\n\nLouis Brown, a security guard at Ralph’s grocery store in Marina del Rey, California, surveyed the customers at about 8 p.m. Sunday night. “Last night it was chaos, havoc,’’ Brown told USA TODAY. “It was packed until 1 o’clock, and I could see the fear in their eyes and their soul.’’\n\nHe was referring to the customers stocking up on food before the storm arrived. And less than 24 hours later? “Nothing,’’ he said, looking around the store. “No chaos.’’\n\nWith the initial hurricane having weakened to a tropical storm, Brown presumed those panicked shoppers survived Hilary as did he -- without incident.\n\nRain fell for most of the day, but 17-year-old Michael Gatto said he still rode his skateboard to work at Local Pizza a block from Venice Beach.\n\n“I did it on purpose so I could tell people that,’’ he said.\n\nHe said business was slow but picked up toward the end of the day. One of his last customers of the night was Andrea Iucci, who said he was in town from Amsterdam and visiting with his wife and two children. Originally, Iucci said, they planned to vacation in Maui. But the deadly fires in Hawaii prompted them to head to Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, their third day in Los Angeles, they experienced not only the storm but also the earthquake. He said they were on the top floor of a nearby hotel when the earthquake with a 5.1 magnitude hit.\n\n“The walls were moving quite a bit,’’ he said. “But it’s OK. As long as everyone’s safe.\"\n\nSenior community impacted by flooding in Coachella Valley\n\nAbout 60 homes at the Canyon Mobile Home Community in Cathedral City have been impacted by flooding, according to Cathedral City Councilmember Nancy Ross, who also lives in the 55 and older community of 350 homes.\n\n“On the (most impacted streets), there was in several locations at least three feet of rushing water that was like a river and had a current of its own, it’s frightening,” Ross said. “And that rushing water by nature just wanted to follow a straight path up into people’s driveways and into their garages, and so many people flooded.”\n\nRoss says damage to the roughly 60 impacted homes includes water flooded into garages or homes, and water under the mobile homes. Ross and her husband spent the afternoon checking on neighbors and attempting to keep nearby culverts clear of debris.\n\nThe Cathedral City Fire Department also came to the park Sunday afternoon to help evacuate several people out of their homes who couldn’t get past the rushing water in the road.\n\n“It’s a senior citizen mobile home park, many of our people are in their 80s. They just don’t deserve to be in such a vulnerable situation, that’s for sure,” said Ross.\n\n— Erin Rode, Desert Sun\n\nMudslides and debris flow through mountain and desert areas\n\nBy Sunday evening, Hilary had moved over San Diego and was headed north into inland desert areas.\n\nResidents of the Coachella Valley had previously expressed anxiety and fear over the storm as many spent the past few days preparing by filling up sandbags as a precaution. And as Hilary closed in on the area Sunday night, the heavy rain turned roadways into rivers and filled up the local wash.\n\nCities within the desert region are at risk of dangerous flooding due to their location and environment. Surrounded by several mountain ranges, waterways in the area can be overwhelmed by the heavy rain and can cause waters to quickly rise.\n\n“This entire valley is basically a giant river bottom,” Palm Springs resident Carley Pinkney told the New York Times.\n\nIn an area where residents are accustomed to intense heat and the blaring sun during this time of year, Hilary is bringing record rain. Palm Springs set a daily record for rainfall on Sunday, recording more than two inches as of 5 p.m., according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“Usually, when the weatherman says rain, they’re wrong because we get rain like one and a half days a year,” resident Michael Matera told the Times.\n\n“When it rains, it just sits there, like it’s in a bowl,\" he added.\n\nIn the San Bernardino Mountains, AccuWeather storm chaser Aaron Rigsby said a large mudslide moved boulders and trees onto the roadway in Forest Falls. Images and videos of the mud slide showed debris flowing in muddy waters, completely covering roads.\n\nSan Bernardino County declared a local emergency Sunday afternoon and the sheriff's department issued evacuation orders for several communities, including Forest Falls.\n\nSouthern California cities see impacts of Hilary\n\nThe full strength of the tropical storm had yet to reach the city of Diamond Bar in Los Angeles County Sunday evening, but the environment is already seeing some effects.A large tree broke off onto one of the city’s major streets on Sunday afternoon. A police car blocked off the route as it covered one whole side of the street that was near a business center.After spurts of rain were scattered throughout the day, the rain began to pick up in the afternoon, as some streets began to see some flooding.\n\nMeanwhile, in San Diego County, strong winds and moderate rain toppled trees, moved boulders, and flooded roadways. San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria declared a state of emergency on Sunday as the storm's center closed in on the region.\n\nThe weather service in San Diego issued several flash flood and tornado warnings Sunday afternoon for the eastern part of the county. During a live broadcast, the agency said it was watching \"one of the remnant eyewall bands moving through the county,\" bringing the heaviest rain.\n\n\"This is the type of rain that can cause urban flooding, mud debris, even sometimes flash flooding,\" the agency said. \"... Never before has there been a tropical storm level system intact moving through San Diego County.\"\n\nSeveral roadways were closed or blocked off due to rock slides and rising waters. Crews from the California Department of Transportation were working on Interstate 8 near In-Ko-Pah near the U.S.-Mexico border after boulders had moved into the road.\n\nEarthquake shakes Southern California amid Hilary threat\n\nAn earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 jolted parts of Southern California Sunday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, as residents in the region braced for Tropical Storm Hilary.\n\nThe earthquake was centered about four miles southeast of Ojai, California, about 80 miles northwest of Los Angeles. It struck shortly after 2:40 p.m. local time at a depth of approximately 9 miles, the USGS said.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, several aftershocks with magnitudes up to nearly 4 were recorded in the area, according to the USGS. The U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said no tsunamis were expected.\n\nTo the best understanding of geoscientists, the earthquake is coincidental, and not related to heavy rainfall in the Los Angeles area, Daniel L. Swain, a climate scientist at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles, told USA TODAY on Sunday.\n\nCanceled flights, closed amusement parks, rescheduled MLB games\n\nCanceled and delayed flights, closed amusement parks, and rescheduled baseball games are among the early impacts of Hilary's approach to the U.S.\n\nSouthwest has canceled more than 700 flights scheduled for Sunday and nearly 190 flights set for Monday, according to FlightAware, which tracks flight status in real-time. Other major carriers like United, American, Delta, and JetBlue were impacted as well.\n\n\"As California’s largest carrier, we’ve made proactive adjustments to our flight schedule throughout the weekend and have communicated with affected customers,'' Southwest told USA TODAY in a statement.\n\nAmusement parks like LEGOLAND California and Knotts Berry Farm closed their doors Sunday, as did the San Diego Zoo and SeaWorld in the same city. Disneyland in Anaheim is shutting down early, at 9 p.m. PT.\n\nMajor League Baseball moved up three games scheduled Sunday in Southern California ballparks. Each of the games – Arizona at San Diego, Tampa Bay at the Los Angeles Angels, and Miami at the Los Angeles Dodgers — were turned into split doubleheaders Saturday to avoid issues with the storm.\n\n'Glassy' waves draw surfers to Venice Beach\n\nMore than a dozen surfers and one pelican braved the extraordinary weather conditions at Los Angeles’ famed Venice Beach with distinctly differently goals Sunday afternoon.\n\nFor the surfers, this was the perfect storm to ride out the waves, and they were not going to be deterred by a sign saying swimming was prohibited. After all, they were technically not breaking any rules.\n\nDamien Rho, an 18-year-old lifeguard from Santa Monica, arrived with his surfboard and a good bit of knowledge about the last time a storm like Hilary hit these shores.\n\n“It’s not every day you get a hurricane out here. You gotta get out here. When is the last time, 1939?” Rho said, getting the year exactly right even if Hilary has actually been downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nRho said the increasingly large waves were “glassy,’’ a surfer term for smooth water.\n\nTwo other surfers said these were the best conditions they’d seen at Venice in weeks, brushing off safety concerns by saying it was more dangerous to drive the highway to the San Fernando Valley.\n\nThe pelican seemed unimpressed and eventually flew away. Apparently, the fishing wasn’t nearly as good as the surfing.\n\nDisaster relief funding running low, FEMA head warns\n\nAhead of Tropical Storm Hilary and other weather disasters, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, warned that her agency is running low on cash to respond to the deadly events in the future.\n\n“We do still anticipate that we will have a shortage of funding at our current spending levels by mid-September,” Criswell said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” If needed, Criswell said, FEMA will push back recovery projects into the next fiscal year to ensure there is enough funding for any “immediate lifesaving needs.”\n\nFEMA’s disaster relief funding shortfall is against the backdrop of numerous weather disasters that have resulted in hundreds of lives lost and billions of dollars in damage, including deadly wildfires in the Hawaiian island of Maui that have claimed over 100 lives alone.\n\nHomeless vulnerable as Hilary advances\n\nVolunteers have been driving the streets of Los Angeles passing out tarps and plastic bags to people without homes so they can try and keep themselves and their belongings dry. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department warned those without a place to stay to move away from riverbeds and other likely flooding locations.\n\nIn Venice Beach, west of downtown Los Angeles, Bobby Geivet arrived at about 6:30 a.m. with a cooler, weathered guitar, a tarp and a plan. Geivet, 45, said he’s homeless but not defenseless against the storm. He tied his tarp between two palm trees and anchored it by using a stone to pound makeshift stakes into the ground. He said he planned to set up a hammock underneath the tarp.\n\n“I like to be high and dry,\" he said. “It’s going to be wet, but I want to be as dry as I can.\"\n\nJoshua Tree National Park closed because of flooding concerns\n\nCoachella Valley could see year's worth of rain over a few days\n\nTropical Storm Emily takes shape but may not last long\n\nWhat began as a large area of low pressure off the Cabo Verde Islands has become well-defined enough to earn a name and designation.\n\nTropical Storm Emily, with maximum sustained winds of almost 50 mph, was heading west-northwest in the Atlantic Ocean at nearly 10 mph Sunday. However, Emily is expected to weaken and lose its status as a tropical storm in the coming days.\n\nContributing: Eve Chen, Ken Tran, Claire Thornton, and Dinah Pulver, USA TODAY; Kate Franco, Palm Springs Desert Sun; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2014/08/20/slow-wet-monsoon-storm-causes-mischief/14324649/", "title": "Slow, wet monsoon storm causes mischief", "text": "Sean Holstege, and D.S. Woodfill\n\nPNI\n\nA series of slow, powerful monsoon storms lashed the region on Tuesday, washing away at least two homes, prompting evacuations and dramatic flood rescues, turning one freeway into a river and closing others.\n\nThe mountains north of Phoenix were hardest hit, inundated with up to 5 inches of rain in an hour, enough water to trigger \"100-year floods.\" It was the second time in a week that central Arizona saw severe flooding.\n\nRain continued to fall Tuesday night and more is possible through Thursday, according to the National Weather Service, which warned that even as the desert sun starts to dry out the area, continued rainfall on the mountains carries a threat of mudslides and flash floods.\n\nThe storm on Tuesday forced the evacuation of 20 people from a trailer park in Black Canyon City in the morning and 89 children from an elementary school in New River in the afternoon. Nearby, Interstate 17 was closed for four hours after almost 5 inches of rain fell in the area — the most recorded there in five years, according to the Maricopa County Flood Control District.\n\nNew River was the scene of a helicopter rescue attempt at midday, when two women were trapped in a trailer home after it floated down the wash and got wedged into a pair of tall trees. After a 40-minute operation to try to airlift the women to safety, the water receded from near window level to ankle depth, and the pair were walked to safety, along with their two dogs.\n\nWater burst the banks of Skunk Creek Wash, washed away a berm alongside the freeway and sent a river of muddy water across all southbound lanes and downhill toward helpless motorists. State transportation officials said they'd never seen anything like it.\n\nThe muddy water then dumped into the Central Arizona Project canal, prompting a brief but unfounded drinking-water scare. Phoenix water-department officials said they prevented turbid, and possibly contaminated, water from getting into homes by shutting off the intake at the nearest treatment plant and pumping in clean water from elsewhere.\n\nThe damage from the storms appeared concentrated in northern Maricopa and southern Yavapai counties. The state emergency-operations center remained on standby but was not called into action.\n\nMarcia Fuller was inside her New River trailer home when storm waters dislodged it.\n\n\"It's been raining, and the river overflowed where they had covered it up to hold it back, and it broke, and the water surged … and washed my house away,\" she said while holding a small dog.\n\nFor a moment, it looked like frothing water might flood her home through the windows. But water subsided in about half an hour and Fuller and her rescuers were able to walk across ankle-deep water.\n\nNew River resident Jason Perkins described how water rose just as quickly.\n\n\"The river started coming up, we started turning horses loose and stuff,\" Perkins said. \"And then when it finally came up all the way, it came up, I mean, drastically fast.\n\n\"I opened the door and all this … wall of water come got me and just knocked me down through the house. It was a big ol' wall of water. It was scary.\"\n\nTuesday afternoon, high water prompted the evacuation of New River Elementary School.\n\nThe first evacuation occurred in Black Canyon City. Although the trailer park near the wash was most threatened, homes uphill were so badly damaged that some residents were stranded or wondering where they were going to spend the night.\n\nThe Red Cross kept an evacuation center at Cannon Elementary School open until 8 p.m. Yavapai County Sheriff's Office kept its Swift Water Rescue units deployed in the area to assess the ongoing risk from high waters.\n\nCathy Wiley was at work when her ailing husband called and told her a mudslide had damaged the foundation of their 11-year home and washed out the only dirt road leading to it. Despite a heart condition, Shaune Wiley, 65, was digging ditches to channel the water away from the three-bedroom house.\n\n\"There is nothing we can do. I'm going to lose my home out of this,\" Cathy, 56, said, her voice cracking with anxiety. \"I'm just pacing the floor.\"\n\nShe said her neighbor's home was damaged and the church was still cleaning up from a muddy storm last week. After a storm five years ago, some residents asked county officials to do something about the threat of mudslides, but officials declined, she said.\n\n\"All of the residents are blood-red mad, because we're paying our taxes and they just let these homes wash away,\" she said.\n\nBut her focus Tuesday was on her husband, who was stranded along with a partially disabled nephew and the family's pets.\n\n\"If I can get to him, I'm not coming out until this is over,\" Wiley said. \"We've been trying to clean up from the last rain. I'm just going to put my faith in a higher power.\"\n\nIt was the recent rainfall that made Tuesday's storms so destructive. With water already in hard desert ground above the mountainous gullies, there was nowhere for heavy rainwater to go.\n\n\"The heaviest amounts of rain were in open-desert areas,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Jessica Nolte said. \"When a lot of rain concentrates in those areas, you get what we saw today. We didn't really dry out much, and with desert soils, it doesn't take much.\"\n\nAfter another wave of storms hit parts of the Valley on Tuesday evening, the Scottsdale, Tempe and Phoenix fire departments worked together to rescue four people, including a woman in a motorized wheelchair and a dog, at Eldorado Park near 77th Street and McDowell Road in Scottsdale.\n\nCapt. Dwayne Bader, a spokesman for the Scottsdale Fire Department, said the floodwaters came quickly and trapped parkgoers, most of whom found higher ground while waiting for firefighters.\n\nThe 2014 monsoon has been drier than average, as measured at the official monitoring station at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. But, Nolte said, moist tropical air and unseasonably early Pacific moisture are combining to create spot locations for very heavy downpours.\n\nThe weather service has issued a hazardous weather outlook that says there is a chance of showers, thunderstorms and spot flooding through Friday, particularly in high country north or east of Phoenix.\n\nThat means commuters can expect more problems on the roads.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Transportation said the I-17 flooding, which did not injure any motorists, was caused by more than 4 inches of rain in about 45 minutes on already saturated soil. ADOT says all it can do is monitor roadway conditions.\n\nStatewide, the threat of rockslides in mountain passes is real, spokesman Tim Tait said.\n\n\"We do work around the state to try to clear these slopes of rocks that may fall,\" he said, citing an ongoing project on Interstate 40.\n\nOn Tuesday, ADOT reported only one mudslide near Table Mesa on I-17.\n\nBut there were problems elsewhere. Parts of Carefree Highway, Loop 303 and Grand Avenue were closed by flooding at times.\n\nThree separate rescues were conducted in the West Valley, the most dramatic of which involved a 24-year-old pregnant woman, a month shy of her due date, who was stranded on the roof of a car in a Wittmann wash as floodwaters rose.\n\nFirst responders from the Wittmann Fire District threw her a life jacket, walked through chest-high water and escorted her to safety. In Surprise, officials said they walked another woman out from a flooded road to safety.\n\nIn a third incident, also in Surprise, an elderly woman was pulled out of a half-submerged van that was stuck in a wash. Rescuers struggled against the strong current and, 10 minutes after she was safe, water cleared the roof of the van.\n\nElsewhere around the Valley, dozens street closures tied to flooded washes or slow drainage impeded traffic.\n\nRepublic reporters Megan Cassidy, Matthew Casey and Dawn Gilbertson contributed to this article.\n\nNew River Mesa: 4.8\"\n\nLake Pleasant North: 3.6\"\n\nParadise Valley: 0.98\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/08/30/hurricane-idalia-matlacha-pine-island-hit-with-localized-flooding/70718516007/", "title": "Hurricane Idalia: Matlacha, Pine Island hit with localized flooding", "text": "Hurricane Idalia brought localized flooding to several parts of Pine Island and Matlacha, areas that were already heavily damaged from last year’s Hurricane Ian.Out surveying the damage during low tide, Matlacha residents Ron and Cindy Walton told the News-Press that waters from the storm surge were “half an inch from the silt plates and coming through their doors.”They said the storm waters started hitting around 4 a.m. Wednesday morning.However they consider themselves on of the luckier ones so far.

Dennis Daugaard, who was in Sioux Falls for a workforce development summit, toured flooded areas with state Department of Transportation officials Tuesday morning.\n\n\"I must compliment the citizens of Sioux falls for reacting quickly to the city's request to reduce water usage,\" he said.\n\nPeople were directed to stop using water altogether Monday night when the city's treatment plant was handling four times the amount of water it normally does.\n\nCity crews spent Tuesday clearing storm sewer grates of debris, replacing manhole lids and working to lower water levels at some of the drainage ponds in an effort to get them ready for handling more rain to come.\n\nTesting cities, sump pumps\n\nIt had been a challenging Monday evening in Canton, according to Fire Chief Brian Severson. Half Canton's approximately 30 volunteer firefighters live out of town and were unable to get into Canton as every paved and gravel road leading into town was covered with water. That left about 15 firefighters to respond to four structure fire alarms.\n\nFirefighters also used an inflatable boat to rescue two motorists stranded in high water, and South Dakota Department of Game Fish and Parks personnel rescued two more.\n\nIn his 48 years living in Canton, Severson had never seen flash flooding of such magnitude. In his 25 years as a firefighter, the department had faced no greater test, he said.\n\nOf approximately 1,500 houses in town, about half had water in their basements, Severson estimated. Gutters all over Canton ran like minor creeks Tuesday as sump pumps worked to clear homes of storm runoff.\n\nBut the city's power, water and sanitary sewer systems were intact and in no danger of failing, according to City Manager Sean Pederson.\n\n\"If something would have had an issue, it would have happened last night,\" said Pederson. \"The infrastructure is not as much a concern as it was last night.\"\n\nIn Sioux Falls, residents Tuesday were still being asked to limit water use as the city's wastewater treatment plant catches up with the surge in sewage the system received Monday evening.\n\n\"We dodged a major bullet last night,\" Mayor Mike Huether said Tuesday.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday, Huether scolded people for disobeying a city ordinance that says sump pumps should not discharge into household drains that are connected to the sewer system. Instead, they should be discharged into your lawn.\n\n\"Quit dumping your sump pump water into the floor drains. It's not rocket science,\" he said.\n\nCity officials said infrastructure upgrades over the last four years helped prevent a major back up, but all it takes is four or five sump pumps draining into the sewer system when it's under stress to cause a backup.\n\nIn Harrisburg, city officials were working to deal with the reappearance of what they wryly call Lake Ole.\n\n\"It's as big as it has ever been,\" City Manager Andrew Pietrus said. The ad hoc lake, about 10 acres in size and waist deep in places, hemmed in Liberty Elementary School and the Harrisburg library on three sides. It flooded part of the school to a depth of a foot or more. About 50 volunteers responded to a Facebook plea Monday to fill sandbags, said Pietrus.\n\n\"We sent as many sandbags as we could to the school, but it was overwhelmed,\" Pietrus said.\n\nCity workers Tuesday hooked a massive hose to a pump borrowed from GF&P and placed in the water near the school. About 1:30 p.m. they fired it up and began to draw down the lake. Water was pumped across Willow Street, the main entry from the west into town, and down sloping Emmett Trail into the Harrisburg storm drain system and ultimately into Nine Mile Creek.\n\nA similar strategy had been employed after Memorial Day last year when rain caused similar flooding. Based on that experience, Pietrus estimates it will take two weeks to clear the water.\n\nA return of heavy rain would force the city to interrupt pumping, so the gutters along Emmett Trail will not be overwhelmed, Pietrus said. Barring that, Harrisburg was going to enjoy its temporary new watercourse on the street through a residential development, he predicted.\n\n\"Last year, kids all evening long were playing in it,\" he said. \"Next week, after 5 p.m., you'll see the whole neighborhood playing in the water. It's kind of fun.\"\n\nCarter Rager, 10, Zach Rager, 8, Damian Lund, 11, and their black Labrador retrievers Skidrow and Wizard were already taking advantage of the water. From the parking lot of Harris Burgers, on the far western shore of Lake Ole across from the school, they threw sticks to the dogs romping through the water.\n\nLike in Canton, Pietrus reported Harrisburg's utilities had survived the flooding. However, where Pederson was requesting additional pumps Tuesday, Pietrus said Harrisburg had all it needed.\n\nHe was beginning to inventory the damage Tuesday. Three box culverts on roads leading into town had been over topped by water Monday, but they were dry Tuesday and appeared undamaged. The basement of the former city hall, used to store records, had about a foot of water in it.\n\n\"We're a little scared to get in there,\" Pietrus acknowledged. But he added \"at worst, we'll have lost some old records. If that's the worst, we've fared well.\"\n\nHarrisburg is mostly made up of first-time home owners who were dealing with flooding for the first time, he said.\n\n\"But they rolled with the punches,\" he said. While there were reports of flooded basements, by late Tuesday afternoon city officials had not heard of any sewage backups.\n\n\"We're doing well right now,\" Pietrus said. \"We're lucky, compared to Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and Canton.\"\n\nCanton's flooding was made significantly worse as the storm sewer along 2nd Street was blocked because the city is replacing the sanitary sewer that serves the area. Incalculable amounts of water cascading down Canton's hillsides drained to the area, pooled and flooded basements.\n\n\"This was a raging river, a major rapids,\" said Darin DeBruin, of 122 W. 2nd St. \"I've never experienced this, and I've lived around here 45 years.\"\n\nSurveying damage\n\nDeBruin came home from work in Sioux Falls shortly before 5 p.m. Monday but was prevented from getting into town by water across Highway 11 at the edge of Canton.\n\n\"There must have been a couple of hundred cars lined up,\" he said. He and other drivers sat by the side of the road until 11 p.m., he said, when water receded enough for the highway to become passable.\n\n\"I finally got back to see this disaster,\" he said.\n\nLuckily, he lives in a second story apartment. His friend and downstairs neighbor Dale Larson who lived in the basement. When he finally got home Tuesday, he found his furniture floating.\n\nLarson was also coming to terms with the realization his personal history had likely been reduced to memories. Tuesday he stood in several feet of water in his home and handed up through a window piles of soaked family photos to his girlfriend, Heidi Bauder, standing outside. Almost forlornly, she promised to take them home and try to dry them and save them.\n\nAt nearby 319 W. Cedar St., the Bournes were similarly facing a basement full of water and the loss of scores of valuables. This included his collection of Civil War era weapons, fabric books from her interior design business, and two safes full of personal papers. They were on a list at the fire department to get a pump, Deb Bourne said. But the list on a whiteboard at the fire station contained about a dozen other names on it. She was not expecting relief any time soon.\n\nGordon Bourne carried a simmering anger with him throughout Tuesday morning as contemplated the fact the storm drain that might have carried off much of the flood water had been blocked. But he also sought to reduce the loss of possessions to something he could put in perspective. Nobody died, he noted, and \"we're South Dakotans. We cope, right?\"\n\nThe basement of the 106-year-old Canton Lutheran Church, at 124 E. 2nd St., was also awash in several feet of water. It lapped at the legs of tables and chairs in the fellowship hall and half submerged the furnace.\n\n\"I'm sure we're going to have mold problems,\" Don Pottratz said. He's been the church custodian 19 years. As he watched a crew of firefighters man a pump throwing a powerful spray of water from the church he asked, \"Are you fellows going to be here through lunch? Can we buy you pizza?\"\n\nIn the Christmas Tree Lake neighborhood in northeast Canton, the sudden rise of the little lake sent water flooding into Scott and Lori Larson's home at 1501 Holiday Dr. She'd made a request for sandbags to the fire department as the storm began around 3 p.m., she said. A few sandbags to block the door to their walkout basement would have probably kept the house dry, she said. But they were not available until Tuesday morning.\n\n\"If we had had sandbags, we would have been all right,\" she said wistfully.\n\nAs she watched the lake water rise Monday \"the kids saw their sandbox toys floating away. They were crying about that,\" she said. The Larsons lost some furniture but managed to move most of their goods to the second story out of harm's way before the water reached their home.\n\n\"It's not fun to have most of your basement in the kitchen,\" he said.\n\nTuesday they were pulling up carpet, shoving remaining water out the door with squeeges and removing soaked sheetrock.\n\n\"I hope to get some insurance money to put this back together,\" he said.\n\nThroughout flooded communities Tuesday, people answered the flood's destructive energy with a dogged determination of their own to take the first steps to setting things right. On a warm and humid day, if sweat helped wash away despair, dark humor also held it at bay.\n\nHolding a Keystone beer in a foam sleeve in one hand, Dale Larson took a pull on a cigarette he held in his other hand during a short break from his labors.\n\n\"I can tell you one thing,\" he said of the flood after exhaling. \"It wasn't on account of me -- for once. I can tell my mother that.\n\n\"You've got to have a sense of humor or you're going to cry and go crazy.\"\n\nArgus Leader reporter J.L.

He rushed to the store at 316 W. Sixth St., to find 10 to 12 inches of water in the basement and 6 to 8 inches in the administrative offices.\n\n\"We had a lot of issues,\" Phillipy said Friday morning, nearly a week after the flooding. \"All the water was out by 2 a.m.\"\n\nFans, a larger air mover, a shop vac and dehumidifiers were put into place to help dry out the areas affected. On Monday morning, a service that specializes in floods and mold mitigation began working to help clean up the basement and office areas.\n\nClimate change:Deadly June 18/19 Bloomington storms were a once-in-a-century event, meteorologist says\n\n\"They came in and drilled test holes in the drywall,\" Phillipy said. The carpet in the conference room was pulled up and everything was sanitized. \"We lost electronic equipment and computers on the floor. But we were able to do business.\"\n\nThe actual grocery store portion of the store wasn't affected by the flood, Phillipy said, adding that this flash flood was worse than the one in 2008.\n\n\"That block from Sixth to Seventh on Madison, it floods and the storm drains can't keep up,\" he said. \"I went out to make sure the storm drain was clear, and it was clear. That water was up to my waist,\" he said, estimating it was 36 inches deep.\n\nJeff Grant, owner of Hopscotch Coffee Roastery, got a call early Saturday morning from Phillipy, who was battling the flood waters next door at Bloomingfoods.\n\nGrant got to the coffee shop at 2 a.m. Saturday and said the flood waters had already rushed out, but it was obvious there had been between 18 inches and 2 feet of water inside.\n\n\"That's where we stored all the coffee, in 150-pound bags,\" Grant said. \"All that stuff was submerged and was ruined. ... Everything was in there. Stuff that we keep in the back of the store we found in the front of the store. It was very surreal.\"\n\nFlooding damage:Downtown Bloomington businesses, area residents deal with flooding damage\n\nA refrigerator and other equipment was ruined. A large chest freeze was completely flipped over. Grant is hopeful the coffee roaster will dry out and be usable. But for now, Hopscotch is reaching out to coffee roasters in Louisville to purchase coffee.\n\n\"We had about five or six days of coffee already roasted,\" Grant said.\n\nEverything at the Dodds Street coffee shop is fine, he said. But he isn't certain when the Madison Street shop will reopen.\n\n\"We're at a lower level there,\" he said of the 212 N. Madison St. shop. \"There's not great storm drainage down there,\" he noted, adding that he has filed reports with the city in the past and \"nothing has been done.\"\n\nGrant said they hired Service Master, who set up dehumidifiers and fans for a couple of days. Now he's trying to determine if they need to remove drywall to stop any mold from forming.\n\n\"We're still assessing,\" he said, adding he hopes the Madison Street shop won't be closed more than a couple of weeks. \"But I have no idea.\"\n\nGrant said anyone who wants to donate to Hopscotch to help with the cleanup and lost revenue can do so on the shop's website. He's also grateful for the help fellow coffee roasters and other people have already given.\n\nAlong East Kirkwood Avenue\n\nOn the other side of the downtown area, some businesses were completely flooded while others remained dry. Bob Costello, owner of both Soma Kirkwood coffeehouse and Village Deli, said even though Soma is in a basement, it was dry while Village Deli had more than 6 feet of water in the basement.\n\n\"I'm a little baffled,\" Costello said Friday afternoon, taking a break from working at the deli. \"The church across the street (from Soma) had a bunch of damage. And the Village Deli did flood.\"\n\nOutages also a problem:Severe storms cause flooding and power outages\n\nWhen Costello arrived early Saturday morning, the walk-in cooler out back of the deli at 409 E. Kirkwood Ave. was no longer attached to the building. He believes the flood waters ripped it away, allowing water to pour into the building and find its way to the basement.\n\n\"We have a sump pump down there but it couldn't keep up with the volume of water,\" Costello said.\n\nWhen rental stores opened Saturday morning, Costello had people picking up pumps and a pool company brought them two more pumps. By 2:30 p.m. Saturday, all the water had been pumped into city storm drains.\n\nThat allowed Costello and other workers to begin taking out all the computers, telephone system, air handlers, furnaces, water heaters, washers, dryers and other equipment that was destroyed.\n\n\"The office was completely destroyed,\" Costello said. \"Everything has been removed from the basement and now we are rebuilding.\n\n\"The dining room had about 1 to 2 inches of water,\" he said. \"We removed all the wet drywall. We evacuated all the water and dried it all out.\"\n\nNow they are replacing drywall, painting, installing new ductwork and new carpeting, all of which is expensive, especially because Costello didn't have any flood insurance. \"We do have flood insurance now,\" he said. \"It will take effect in 30 days. We purchased it the next day.\n\nTo add to the troubles Village Deli has faced in the past week, Duke Energy shut down power along Kirkwood Avenue on Sunday night, when a transformer blew. That left the walk-in cooler without power — all the food was lost.\n\nEven with all the devastation, Costello spoke positively about the \"Kirkwood community,\" which he said has been so helpful to one another, moving equipment to neighboring stores and helping with cleanup efforts.\n\n\"It was just such a great community spirit the next day,\" he said. \"It's what you have to love about Bloomington.\"\n\nThe waters that flooded the deli's basement were flowing like a river through some nearby businesses along East Kirkwood. This happened at both Nick's English Hut and nearby Osteria Rago, according to Ian Fletcher, general manager and head chef of the Italian restaurant.\n\nOn Friday night and early Saturday, there was 4 to 5 inches of water over the entire floor of the dining area of Osteria Rago, Fletcher said. Fortunately, the main kitchen area remained dry.\n\nFletcher arrived around 12:30 a.m. Saturday and was there working for four hours \"pushing water out the front door.\"\n\nEmployees came in Saturday morning and a major cleanup effort began, with anything from the baseboards down having to be cleaned and sanitized. \"We were cleaning for about 10 hours or so,\" Fletcher said. By 4 p.m. Osteria Rago was able to open.\n\n\"We were pretty lucky with that,\" Fletcher said, adding that the restaurant keeps most food items and computer equipment at least 6 to 12 inches off the floor.\n\nSome problems associated with the flooding continued into Saturday night and Sunday that weekend when the transform outside the restaurant caught fire.\n\nBoth Nick's and Osteria Rago lost the recycling and trash bins that were out back in the alley. Co-owner Susan Bright said she thinks she may have seen one of the restaurants' blue bins when she was riding her bicycle south near Switchyard Park. She credits the slab flooring in the restaurant in Osteria Rago with helping keep the flood waters from doing more damage.\n\nNearby Cafe Pizzaria also had some flooding but after a thorough cleaning on Friday night and early Saturday, the pizza place was able to open on Saturday.\n\nAcross the street, the Monroe County Public Library had some flooding along Grant Street, according to manager Josh Wolf. Quick response by Wolf and others kept the flood waters from spreading farther inside. At the height of the flooding, Wolf said there was a couple feet of water outside the library's Grant Street entrance with some water making its way into the basement areas. but no books were affected.\n\nWolf said the Ellettsville branch had worse problems due to the flash flood, with a power outage causing the lights to go off and the internal fire door to fall.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/27"}]}

That has led them to say the strain involved may be widespread throughout the turkey industry including ground turkey, turkey patties and full turkeys.\n\nE. coli:Why women and girls bear the brunt of the romaine lettuce E. coli outbreak\n\nOfficials are not suggesting cooks forego the Thanksgiving turkey, but are advising them to wash their hands before and after handling the turkey. Warm soapy water should be used to thoroughly clean any surfaces that may have come in contact with the raw meat or poultry juices.\n\nRather than thawing the turkey by leaving it on the counter, cooks should thaw it in the microwave or in the fridge in cold water, which is changed every 30 minutes, officials advise. When cooking turkey or any leftovers that contain any turkey, make sure the food hits an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nRomaine lettuce E. coli warning\n\nThe CDC on Tuesday also warned the public not to eat any Romaine lettuce – and retailers and restaurants not to sell or serve it – over concerns of an E. coli outbreak.\n\nSince October, at least 32 people in 11 states have gotten sick, with at least 13 hospitalized, from the same strain of E. coli in the outbreak, officials say. No deaths have been reported, but one person suffered a kind of kidney failure, the CDC says.\n\nConsumers should not only avoid romaine lettuce and any salad mixes that might contain romaine, but also should clean refrigerators where romaine had been stored, the CDC says.\n\nThis strain of E. coli had the \"same DNA fingerprint\" as an outbreak tied to leafy greens in the United States and romaine in Canada late last year. That outbreak killed one person and infected 25 in 15 states. But it is not related to an E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce from earlier this year – which killed five people and sickened 210 in 36 states – the CDC says.\n\nLatest ground beef recall\n\nLet's just say you want to play it safe, skip the turkey and grill some burgers for Thanksgiving. You're not necessarily in the clear there, either.\n\nThe nation's largest beef processor, JBS USA, this week recalled nearly 100,000 pounds of ground beef for possible E. coli contamination. The ground beef, produced Oct. 24 at JBS USA-owned Swift Beef Co. in Hyrum, Utah, may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the USDA says.\n\nThe 99,260 pounds of ground beef was packaged in 2,000-pound pallets and in plastic wrapped packages of 8 to 10 pounds marked as \"Blue Ribbon Beef\" and sold in varying levels of fat content including \"Ground Beef 81/19 (81% lean) Coarse Grind bearing product code 42410.\"\n\nNo confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of the products have been reported, the agency says.\n\nLong Phung Pork Rolls recalled\n\nLong Phung Food Products of Houston on Tuesday recalled an undetermined amount of ready-to-eat pork products potentially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, the USDA says.\n\nThe ready-to-eat pork patty rolls, produced between May 21, 2018, through Nov. 16, 2018, have led to four confirmed illnesses between July 1, 2017, and Oct. 24, 2018, the agency says.\n\nAmong the Vietnamese sausages recalled are 6-ounce plastic vacuum-packed Long Phung 1988 Gio Lua Vietnamese Brand Cooked Pork Patty Roll Anchovy Flavored Fish Sauce Added and a 32-oz.

The affected products also have an establishment number of \"EST. 960A\", found inside the USDA mark of inspection.\n\nThere is no recall for these items because they are no longer available for purchase, the FSIS says. Anyone who has previously purchased the products should not conserve or serve them, and they should be thrown away or return to their place of purchase.\n\nWhat ground beef products are under the health alert?\n\nThe problem was discovered by Greater Omaha Packing Co. while conducting an inventory of product that was on hold because it was positive for E. coli, according to the FSIS, which was notified that the company had \"inadvertently used a portion of the contaminated beef to produce ground beef products that they subsequently shipped into commerce.\"\n\nThe products' labels under the health alert can be found on the FSIS' website.\n\nThere have not been any confirmed reports of illness due to consumption of these products, and anyone concerned about an illness is recommended to contact their healthcare provider.\n\nWhat is E. coli?\n\nEscherichia coli, abbreviated as E. coli, are bacteria that are found in the environment, foods and intestines of people and animals, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAlthough most strains of E. coli are harmless, some can make you sick and cause diarrhea, urinary tract infections, respiratory illnesses and pneumonia and other illnesses.\n\nWhile symptoms can vary person to person, common symptoms for E. coli can include severe stomach cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting. Some people can have a fever, often less than 101 degrees Fahrenheit, and most people get better within five to seven days.\n\nMost people who are infected start feeling sick three to four days after eating or drinking something that contains the bacteria, but illnesses can start anywhere from one to 10 days after exposure.\n\nSome infections are very mild, but the CDC says others can be severe or life-threatening.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/05/07/raw-milk-dairy-linked-bird-flu-virus-pasteurized/73597204007/", "title": "Raw milk linked to bird flu, so beware of social media claims", "text": "The \"raw milk\" trend is surging again, this time mostly on TikTok.\n\nBut federal agencies have warned raw milk fans that along with the risks of bacterial contamination, you could get bird flu.\n\nIn an update last week on the bird flu outbreak in the U.S., public health officials said that recent testing on commercial dairy products detected remnants of the virus in one in five samples, although none of them contained the live virus that could make people sick.\n\n\"As this situation evolves, the FDA will continue to consider all ongoing scientific research related to the effectiveness of pasteurization for HPAI in bovine milk,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a news release. \"We are also committed to continued surveillance of milk production, processing and pasteurization to help ensure the safety of the milk supply.\"\n\nTests on contaminated dairy showed that pasteurization killed the bird flu virus, officials said, making it safe to consume.\n\nStates across the country have started to take another look at prohibitions against selling unpasteurized milk after a surge of testimonials from fans of raw milk — most recently content creators on TikTok — who insist it's healthier and easier to digest despite evidence that it can be dangerous to children, the elderly, or people who are pregnant or have a compromised immune system.\n\nLast year, Florida's Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis tried some at a raw milk farm and pronounced it \"delicious.\"\n\nIn a tweet, the state CFO said, \"Something’s wrong with the way the feds regulate foods and decide what’s 'healthy.' I visited a raw milk farm; tastes delicious! But they have to say on the carton it’s not for “human consumption” cause of some federal regulation?! Stupid!\"\n\nIs raw milk better for you? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhat is raw milk?\n\nRaw milk is simply milk from cows, sheep and goats (or any other animal) that has not been heated to a sufficiently high temperature to kill harmful bacteria, a process called pasteurization that has been used for over 100 years,\n\nThe process of heating up wine to deactivate any harmful microorganisms in it and make it last longer has been known for over a thousand years, and multiple scientists found that thermal treatment aided in food preservation. In the 1860s, French microbiologist Louis Pasteur discovered that less aggressive, briefer, less hot temperatures would work just as well, and the process was called \"pasteurization\" in his honor.\n\nRoutine pasteurization of milk started in the 1920s and became widespread in the 1950s, leading to \"dramatic reductions\" in the number of people getting sick, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.\n\nIs it safe to drink raw milk?\n\n\"In fact, raw milk is one of the riskiest foods,\" according to the CDC. \"Raw milk can be contaminated with harmful germs that can make you very sick.\"\n\nTurns out milk is an excellent medium if you're looking for bacteria. Raw milk and products made from raw milk, including soft cheese, ice cream, and yogurt, can be contaminated with germs from the animals, their waste or their environment such as Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria which can cause serious illness, hospitalization, or death.\n\nAccording to the CDC, improperly handled raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other food-borne disease source.\n\nWhat can raw milk do to you?\n\nFor many, drinking raw milk will have no adverse effects. But even people who have drunk plenty of it before can get sick from drinking raw milk or products made with raw milk and experience many days of diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting. Some people may develop chronic, severe or life-threatening diseases, including:\n\nGuillain-Barré syndrome, which can cause paralysis.\n\nHemolytic uremic syndrome, which can result in kidney failure, stroke, and even death.\n\nBovine tuberculosis, which can cause infections in the chest, lungs, kidney, spine and brain.\n\nIllnesses caused by bacteria from raw milk \"can be especially problematic for infants, young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised,\" according to the FDA. Between 1987 to September 2010, the FDA found at least 133 reported outbreaks from the consumption of raw milk and raw milk products, leading to 2,659 cases of illnesses, 269 hospitalizations, 3 deaths, 6 stillbirths and 2 miscarriages.\n\nIn 2014, two people were infected with listeriosis from raw milk distributed by a Pennsylvania dairy, one from California and one from Florida. The Florida victim died, the CDC said.\n\nRaw milk nutrition facts: Is raw milk good for you?\n\nRaw milk fans say it is.\n\n\"Pasteurization destroys enzymes, denatures anti-microbial and immune-stimulating components, diminishes nutrient availability, denatures fragile milk proteins, destroys vitamins C, B6 and B12, kills beneficial bacteria, promotes pathogens and is associated with allergies, increased tooth decay, colic in infants, growth and behavior problems in children, osteoporosis, arthritis and heart disease,\" according to A Campaign for Real Milk.\n\nRaw milk tastes better, advocates say, and claim it contains more butterfat, no additives and it's easier to digest. And while the need for pasteurization was great in the 20th century when tuberculosis, scarlet fever and other diseases were widespread, they say that modern farming eliminates that risk.\n\nHowever, according to the FDA, multiple studies have shown that pasteurization has no significant effect on the nutritional quality of milk and raw milk contains no additional benefits but many additional risks.\n\nThere is a tendency to believe that foods that have not been processed or come from small, local farms are inherently healthier, but some processing is necessary to destroy disease-causing germs, the CDC said.\n\nMilk can get germs from an animal's poop, skin or udder, from the environment where the animal lives, from insects or rodents, from unsanitary conditions, or even from cross-contamination from dairy workers, and any of that can happen no matter how small the farm or how clean the conditions are.\n\nPasteurization is recommended by the CDC, the FDA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, and others.\n\nDoes pasteurized milk cause lactose intolerance?\n\n\"Lactose is a unique disaccharide found in milk,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a raw milk factsheet. \"Lactose concentration in bovine milk is about 4.8%. People with lactose intolerance lack the enzyme, beta-galactosidase or lactase, to break down lactose into glucose and galactose during digestion. All milk, raw or pasteurized, contains lactose and can cause lactose intolerance in sensitive individuals.\"\n\nRaw milk also does not cure asthma or allergies, prevent osteoporosis, improve children's immune systems or increase gastrointestinal health any more than pasteurized milk does, the FDA said.\n\nIs raw milk legal in Florida?\n\nIt is not illegal to drink raw milk in Florida or any other state in the U.S., but it is illegal here for anyone to sell anything besides Grade A pasteurized milk and milk products for human consumption, according to Florida Statute 502.091(1).\n\nCheese made from raw milk may be sold retail to the final customer or food service establishments but only if the cheese is aged more than 60 days at a temperature above 35 degrees. Raw milk may be sold as pet food from farms, markets and health stores provided it is labeled \"not for human consumption.\"\n\nIt's not a federal regulation to prohibit or label raw milk. Federal regulations only prohibit selling or distributing raw milk and raw milk products across state lines.\n\nWhat is the healthiest milk to drink?Best options for protein content and weight loss.\n\nAre there states where it's legal to sell raw milk for humans?\n\nSelling raw milk for human consumption is illegal in 20 states, including Florida.\n\nSome states — not Florida —allow \"cowshare\" or \"herdshare\" agreements where consumers can purchase a \"share\" of a cow and are therefore partial owners and can consume its milk. Others outlaw raw milk sales but allow it directly from the farms or dairies where it is produced, with restrictions. Some states allow it with permits or licenses. According to Britannica ProCon.org, these are the current restrictions on raw milk across the country.\n\nFederal law prohibits non-pasteurized milk in its final package form from being distributed across state lines.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/03/bird-flu-outbreak-raw-milk-social-media/73545886007/", "title": "Bird flu outbreak: Don't drink raw milk, no matter what social media ...", "text": "Don't drink raw milk, no matter what social media tells you. Seriously.\n\nIn an update on the outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. on Wednesday, federal agencies revealed that recent testing on commercial dairy products detected remnants of the virus in one in five samples. However, none contained the live virus that could sicken people.\n\nOfficials also said that testing on contaminated dairy reaffirmed that pasteurization kills the bird flu virus, making it safe to consume.\n\nDespite the assurances, a seemingly growing pocket of influencers and content creators online, particularly TikTok, have taken to boasting about drinking raw milk, touting supposed benefits and sowing seeds of skepticism as to the safety of pasteurization.\n\nWhile the science-backed practice has been used for over 100 years, some believe it's unnecessary or even harmful. Unfortunately, that could mean anyone who takes their advice could be playing with fire, especially if the raw product is consumed by children, the elderly, a pregnant person, or someone with a compromised immune system.\n\nHere's what to know about pasteurization and what it does to the products we consume:\n\nBackyard chickens:Here's how to protect your flock from bird flu outbreaks\n\nWhat is pasteurization and why is it important?\n\nPasteurization is the process of heating milk to a high enough temperature for a long enough time to kill harmful germs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe process of pasteurization became routine in the commercial milk supply in the U.S. in the 1920s and was widespread by the 1950s. As a result, illnesses commonly spread via milk became less prevalent.\n\nWhile misinformation about the process has led some to believe that pasteurized milk is less nutritious or better for people with lactose intolerance, pasteurization does not significantly compromise the nutritional value or content of milk. In some states, selling raw milk directly to a consumer is illegal.\n\nWhat can happen if you consume raw dairy?\n\nRaw milk can carry a host of harmful bacteria, including:\n\n◾ Salmonella\n\n◾ E. coli\n\n◾ Listeria monocytogenes\n\n◾ Campylobacter\n\n◾ Coxiella burnetii\n\n◾ Cryptosporidium\n\n◾ Yersinia enterocolitica\n\n◾ Staphylococcus aureus\n\n◾ Other foodborne illness-causing bacteria\n\nThe presence of these can cause a variety of health issues and ailments, including:\n\n◾ Listeriosis\n\n◾ Typhoid fever\n\n◾ Tuberculosis\n\n◾ Diphtheria\n\n◾ Q fever\n\n◾Brucellosis\n\n◾ Food poisoning\n\n◾ Miscarriage\n\n◾ Guillain-Barre syndrome\n\n◾ Hemolytic uremic syndrome\n\n◾ Reactive arthritis\n\n◾ Chronic inflammatory conditions\n\n◾ Death\n\nBird flu testing:As bird flu virus concerns grow in US, so do tests of milk, cheese, meat and other foods\n\nWhy are some social media users pushing unpasteurized milk and dairy?\n\nFringe ideas of health, wellness and nutrition have become easily widespread and somewhat popular with social media.\n\nOn TikTok, many homesteading, \"tradwife,\" \"all-natural\" and other self-proclaimed wellness influencers push the idea of raw milk, presenting the idea that less intervention of any kind in their food is better.\n\nSome also claim that they have been drinking it for years without illness, that they believe drinking it has cured their lactose intolerance and other health conditions, or that the raw milk contains vital nutrients and ingredients that are done away with by pasteurization.\n\nOthers simply say they see it as a means of subverting what they see as undue government regulation on their food and drink.\n\nEven big names like Gwyneth Paltrow, who has been criticized for her comments on nutrition in the past, have promoted the idea of drinking raw milk.\n\nWhy? Some people may just be misinformed, convinced by anecdotal evidence, or even think they are helping others. Some cite an overall distrust of government regulations involving food, while others have products they hope to sell after disseminating misinformation, plugging them at the end of their videos or in their bios.\n\nAs it stands, consuming unpasteurized milk and dairy can easily lead to many of the illnesses already listed. The spread of bird flu is certainly not the only reason to ensure you are drinking properly treated milk, but it is yet another thing to be aware of when it comes to making decisions about food safety.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2021/07/08/chicken-recall-tyson-foods-usda-recall-size-increase-listeria/7908510002/", "title": "Tyson recall: 9 million pounds of chicken recalled for listeria risk", "text": "More Tyson Foods chicken is being recalled for possible listeria contamination.\n\nThe massive recall, first announced Saturday, grew by nearly 500,000 pounds Thursday, according to an update posted on the recall notice on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service website.\n\nApproximately 8,955,296 pounds of frozen and cooked chicken products are part of the recall.\n\nWalmart, Target, Kroger, Publix, H-E-B and Wegmans are among the retailers that sold Tyson branded fully cooked and frozen products.

Her owner, Stacy Wistock, milks her twice a day.\n\nWistock takes precautions to keep the milk clean, but she rarely pasteurizes it. Until recently, she gave it away to family and friends. Now, she’ll make a little money off it. Iowa legislators decided this spring to join dozens of states in allowing small producers to sell unpasteurized milk from cows, goats and sheep.\n\nPublic health authorities and major dairy industry groups oppose the practice, saying such milk can be tainted with dangerous bacteria, including E. coli, salmonella, and listeria. But in state after state, those warnings have been overwhelmed by testimonials from fans of “raw milk,” who contend pasteurized milk is more difficult to digest because the process alters enzymes and kills helpful bacteria.\n\nFederal experts say there is no proof that pasteurization makes milk less healthful. People on all sides of the debate say the rising interest in raw milk is fueled partly by distrust of public health authorities, which grew during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWistock is unsure about some of the health claims made by ardent fans of raw milk. But she sees the question as a matter of freedom. “I don’t like restrictive laws about what foods you can and can’t sell to your neighbors,” she said.\n\nIowa’s new law, which took effect July 1, allows only direct sales from small producers to consumers. The law is stricter than those in several other states, which allow raw-milk sales in stores.\n\nPasteurization, which was developed in the 1800s, involves heating milk to kill bacteria. The practice was widespread by 1950 and helped rein in deadly diseases, including tuberculosis, typhoid and scarlet fever, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“Most public health professionals and health care providers consider pasteurization to be one of public health’s most effective food safety interventions ever,” the CDC’s website says. It warns that consumption of unpasteurized milk has sparked outbreaks of food poisoning, which can cause diarrhea, vomiting, kidney failure and even death.\n\nIowa: A case study in raw milk’s evolving legal landscape\n\nEric Heinen, an environmental health officer for northern Iowa’s Black Hawk County, is among the public health officials who worked for years to keep raw-milk sales illegal.\n\nHe was discouraged but not shocked to see Iowa’s raw milk proposal pass this spring amid growing skepticism of science. “It’s a different atmosphere we’re in right now,” he said.\n\nHeinen said he has no objection to informed adults risking their health by consuming raw milk. But he wishes it weren’t being given to children, who are particularly susceptible to complications.\n\nHe has heard proponents argue that humans got along fine for thousands of years while drinking unpasteurized milk and going without vaccinations. “Then again, the life span 2,000 years ago was a lot less than it is today,” he said, and many more children used to die as infants or toddlers.\n\nIowa legislators repeatedly rebuffed proposals to legalize raw milk over the past 17 years. The idea finally cleared the Republican-controlled Legislature this spring and was signed into law by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds.\n\nThe leading statehouse sponsor, Republican Sen. Jason Schultz, noted during debate that under the bill, raw-milk dairies may have no more than 10 animals giving milk. Producers must test the animals monthly for bacteria. The unpasteurized milk must be sold directly from producers to consumers. It can’t be offered in stores, restaurants, or farmers markets. Containers must include labels noting the milk is unpasteurized and has not been inspected by the government.\n\n“By limiting the size of the farm and the methods of distribution, this bill will meet the niche market demand while requiring strong local connections between consumers and producers,” Schultz said during floor debate.\n\nSchultz expressed delight in formally asking his colleagues to “mooooove” the bill to final passage.\n\nThe bill was opposed on the Iowa House floor by Rep. Megan Srinivas, a Democrat and infectious disease physician. Srinivas recounted treating children who were seriously sickened by germs in unpasteurized milk.\n\n“Raw milk increases chances of infection by 150 times,” Srinivas told her colleagues. Infected people can then pass on germs, including hepatitis A, shigella and E. coli when handling other people’s food, she said. “These outbreaks have public health implications that we cannot ignore.”\n\nA national group, the Weston A. Price Foundation, advises activists who lobby for legalization of raw milk in statehouses across the country.\n\nThe foundation’s president, Sally Fallon Morell, said that when her group launched its website in 1999, 27 states allowed any sales of raw milk. Only a few states still ban it, she said.\n\nFallon Morell lives in rural Maryland, where she raises Jersey cows and complies with her state’s regulations by selling raw milk with labels saying it is for pets. “There’s no law against eating pet food,” she said.\n\nShe contends the public health establishment supports an “industrial system” of farming, and she disputes official reports of raw milk being tied to outbreaks of food poisoning.\n\nFrom curious consumer to staunch critic\n\nA vocal opponent of unpasteurized milk acknowledged in an interview that the other side is winning across the nation. “Public health has lost the war on raw milk,” said Mary McGonigle-Martin, a board member of a national food safety group called Stop Foodborne Illness.\n\nMcGonigle-Martin, who lives in California, testified four times over several years against legalization proposals in the Iowa Legislature. She recounted how her son, Chris, became critically ill after drinking raw milk tainted with E. coli in 2006.\n\nMcGonigle-Martin said in an interview that she bought the milk at a health food store because she hoped a natural diet would help her son, who had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. But Chris, who was 7, became severely ill less than three weeks after starting to drink it.\n\nHe spent two months in the hospital, and doctors had to put him on a ventilator and kidney dialysis while his body fought off toxins produced by the bacteria.\n\nMcGonigle-Martin wants states that allow sales of raw milk to require testing and training to reduce the danger. Iowa legislators added precautions before their bill passed, she said, but they didn’t include strong enforcement provisions.\n\nWhich milk is best?What is the healthiest milk to drink? Best options for protein content and weight loss.\n\nShe favors the Iowa law’s 10-animal limit for raw milk producers, but she worries the provision could encourage untrained hobbyists to get into the business. “Producing raw milk is not like growing vegetables in your backyard and selling them,” she said.\n\nRaw milk distribution isn’t totally new in Iowa. Before the law took effect, several Iowa producers posted online that they offered it via “herd shares.” Under such arrangements, customers purchase a share of a herd, then receive a portion of its milk from the farmer. Proponents contend it’s legal because people are allowed to drink raw milk from their own animals.\n\nSeveral states have laws explicitly allowing or banning herd share distribution of raw milk. Iowa has no such law, although a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship said the agency has considered such arrangements to be unpermitted sales of the product.\n\nStates have widely varying laws on raw milk, said Alexia Kulwiec, a Wisconsin lawyer and executive director of the Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund, which advocates for legalization. Some state laws contain language seeming to allow limited distribution but still make it nearly impossible, she said. Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, Nevada and Wisconsin have some of the highest hurdles, Kulwiec said.\n\nBefore Iowa allowed sales of raw milk, some consumers loaded coolers into their cars and traveled to neighboring states to buy it. Supriya Jha, a software engineer from the central Iowa town of Runnells, is among them.\n\nJha has driven to Missouri every month to buy unpasteurized cow milk for her toddler. The round trip is nearly 200 miles. She plans to buy goat milk from Wistock’s Iowa farm now that it’s legal.\n\nJha believes properly produced raw milk is healthful and easier for children to digest than pasteurized milk. She said she looks into how raw-milk producers operate before she buys from them. She plans to try some of Wistock’s goat milk herself to see how her body reacts before she feeds it to her daughter.\n\nJha grew up in India, where, she said, manufacturers are less aggressive in hawking highly processed foods. “I wanted to raise my baby with the old ways,” she said. She also is skeptical of many vaccines that most doctors and public health leaders urge for children. “I don’t trust the medical establishment,” she said, adding she believes the system pushes profitable products and treatments. “It’s a racket.”\n\nBack at Wistock’s farm, Babe will soon be joined by a few more nanny goats that are ready to be milked. Wistock, who works a full-time remote office job, figures she can make a small profit on the side by milking four goats and selling the milk for $6 a half-gallon.\n\nWistock already runs bacterial tests on milk for her own use, so it won’t be a big adjustment to follow the state’s new testing rules. She has built a small milking parlor in a trailer, complete with a vinyl floor that’s easy to scrub. Before milking, she cleans the goat’s teats with an antiseptic spray and paper towels. Her containers are washed in a dishwasher, then sanitized in a UV light chamber. She catches the milk in a stainless-steel pitcher and strains it through a filter into glass jars.\n\nAfter collection, Wistock uses her freezer to chill the milk to 38 degrees, then places it in the refrigerator. She sometimes pasteurizes goat milk before she turns it into cheese, “just to be safe.”\n\nWistock is confident that the raw milk she’ll sell is clean, but she knows any food product can carry risks. She’s not sure she would feed it to children or people with weak immune systems.\n\nBut she won’t ask what her customers plan to do with it: “I’m not going to tell other people what to drink.”\n\nKFF Health News,formerly Kaiser Health News, is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs atKFF,an independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/07/25/salmonella-recalls-whats-going-and-what-heck-whey-powder/827175002/", "title": "How salmonella may have ended up in Honey Smacks cereal and ...", "text": "For years, salmonella scares have centered on raw or undercooked foods such as chicken, eggs or meat.\n\nBut this summer, there's concern that the bacteria may have found its way into the kind of packaged products where one would never expect it – Pepperidge Farm Goldfish, Ritz Crackers and Kellogg's Honey Smacks.\n\nIt turns out the potentially fatal pathogen is sneaky, able to survive not only wet but dry environments. In this case, whey powder, an ingredient often used in shelf-stable dry foods, may be tainted with salmonella.\n\nMore:Dangerously Delicious: Rocker turned baker savors his piece of the small business pie\n\nMore:Trump offers help to farmers hit by escalating China trade war\n\nMore:Harley-Davidson puts tariff loss at $150 million as sales slump\n\nThe Goldfish, Ritz Crackers and Swiss rolls, made by Flowers Foods and sold under various brand names, are believed to use the whey powder manufactured by Associated Milk Producers, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday. The recalls have been initiated \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\n\n\"There is no evidence at this time that anyone was sickened from one of these products, or that these products are contaminated,\" FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement. \"We know that these are products that are widely eaten by consumers, including children. That’s, in part, why we are taking steps to intervene early on this potential risk.\"\n\nBut grocer's shelves may still be hit again soon.\n\n\"As there are likely other food products made by other manufacturers that also use this common ingredient, there may be other recalls initiated in the coming days,\" the FDA said.\n\nOn Tuesday, AMPI voluntarily recalled whey powder packaged in 50-pound and 25-kilogram bags produced at the cooperative’s Blair, Wisconsin, plant during certain periods in May and June. .\"\n\nThe company called it a \"precautionary recall\" and said all products shipped to the manufacturers tested negative for Salmonella. Production at that plant has stopped.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a public health alert about certain packages of Hungry-Man Chipotle BBQ Boneless Chicken Wyngz. AMPI's whey powder is among the ingredients.\n\nWhat is salmonella?\n\nIt's a bacteria that sickens an estimated 1.2 million people in the U.S. each year, causing 23,000 hospitalizations and 450 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Food is responsible for 1 million of those cases, 19,000 hospital stays and 380 deaths.\n\nSalmonella originates in feces and is spread through contact. That can mean via unwashed hands contaminating the next thing they touch or tiny dirt spores, tainted with traces of animal poop, entering a food manufacturing plant, according to Martin Bucknavage, a Pennsylvania State University food safety expert.\n\nDespite its association with raw protein, salmonella has nothing to do with fish. It was named after Dr. Daniel Salmon, who ran the federal Bureau of Animal Industry in the late 19th century.\n\nHow does it get into packaged foods?\n\nYou might think salmonella couldn't make it through the baking process, but food companies don't want to risk it, explained Brian Kellerman, a Columbus, Ohio-based food-safety expert. Salmonella can thrive in a dry environment, plus it can stick around on the equipment itself, which can be trouble for the next batch.\n\nSalmonella is notorious for its ability to survive for a long time, even in a dry environment, unlike E. coli and listeria, which need damp environments. And salmonella's low infectious rate means it takes a tiny amount of bacteria to cause trouble.\n\nWhat's whey powder?\n\nYes, like Little Miss Muffet's, but her whey came in wet form. The powder form is easier for food companies to work with.\n\nWhey, a byproduct of milk, is like\"adding milk without adding milk,\" Bucknavage said. \"You're getting the protein you need for the product.\"\n\nWhat happens when salmonella is found in dry foods?\n\nThe plants where the foods are made will undergo comprehensive cleaning, according to experts. Dry facilities – factories that make packaged goods such as cereal and crackers – are cleaned using an ethanol-based sanitizer, dry ice, peracetic acid or chlorine bleach.\n\nAre salmonella-related recalls more prevalent now?\n\nYes, said Kellerman, who credits more regulations requiring food manufacturing plants to test ingredients when they come in the door and to keep equipment cleaner.\n\n\"We’re getting better at finding it,\" he said. \"The industry better understands how they make their way through.\"\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nDiarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps appear 12 to 72 hours after a person is infected, the CDC said.

Giant African land snails are illegal to own as pets in the United States. But some exotic pet owners still keep the invasive pests. If the owners discard them into the wild or accidentally lose them, they can quickly establish a foothold, feeding on over 500 different plant species and even consuming the paint and stucco off houses as a source of calcium.\n\nChitty said the department is currently investigating the population and determining how many snails are in Pasco County. The snails are native to east Africa and can grow up to 8 inches long.\n\nThe quarantine took effect June 25 and prevents residents from moving the snail or related items, like plants and soil, in or out of the designated quarantine area. Residents who think they have spotted a giant African land snail are advised to call the FDACS hotline and avoid touching the snail without gloves on due to the meningitis risk.\n\nAccording to Chitty, FDACS plans to spend three years eradicating the population in Pasco County, using the pesticide metaldehyde to treat the soil.\n\n“The goal is to eradicate” the snails, said Chitty. “It is a comprehensive and extensive process.”\n\nThis is not the first time Florida has dealt with an invasion of giant snails. In 2011, a population of the pests was discovered in Miami-Dade County.

Castro says that managers of a fruit processing company exaggerated quantities they bought from him to make their U.S.-bound shipments appear organic, an accusation the processor denies.\n\nPITAL, Costa Rica — Plenty of people knew that the numbers didn’t add up in pineapple fields here that stretch like green carpets beneath brooding volcanoes.\n\nThey knew it in Washington, D.C., where the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Organic Program saw Costa Rica was shipping more organic pineapples than it was certified to grow.\n\nThey knew it in Pital, hub of the world’s biggest pineapple exporter.\n\nCosta Rica’s surplus indicated that someone was mislabeling fruit produced less expensively with chemicals forbidden for organic products — thereby cheating U.S. consumers, who pay high premiums when trusting the USDA organic seal.\n\nA Costa Rican government investigator assembled 1,500 pages of evidence. He found that PrimusLabs, a USDA-accredited certifier, improperly approved Costa Rica’s Del Valle Verde Corp. as a grower of organic pineapples.\n\nIn Pital, neighboring organic farmers felt vindicated. They believed they had further examples of how the pineapple company had gamed the USDA. U.S. importers, hurt by competition they considered unfair, expected strong action by regulators.\n\nBut they got nothing of the kind. Instead, a NerdWallet investigation found, the USDA punted — kicking a gaping hole in the credibility of its organics seal.\n\nThe USDA closed the case last summer without addressing the extensive Costa Rican investigation.\n\nNot only did the USDA allow farming company Valle Verde to choose and pay Primus for organic certification — a conflict of interest enabled by federal rules — but the agency trusted the accused certifier to declare the grower innocent.\n\n“It’s a horrible story,” said Alexis Baden-Mayer, political director of the Organic Consumers Association. “This information was handed to the National Organic Program on a silver platter, and they still don’t take the enforcement actions that are permitted under the law.”\n\nIf the USDA won’t act when presented with stark evidence of fraud, critics ask, how can consumers rely on the agency to police any of the annual $43 billion in U.S. organically certified food?\n\nThe answer is that the system can’t be trusted, NerdWallet found.\n\nUSDA appoints certification gatekeepers\n\nThe National Organic Program, a USDA division with a $9 million budget, sets standards for labeling and accredits the agency’s 80 certifiers worldwide. Many certifiers have solid records. Growers, processors and handlers they approve sell legitimately organic food under the USDA seal.\n\nBut the system is ripe for abuse.\n\nThe USDA allows growers and processors to choose their own certifiers from its accredited list. The certifiers then get paid by those producers, even getting percentage of sales, a financial incentive that creates a conflict of interest.\n\nSwindlers among the 37,000 businesses certified worldwide can double their money by misrepresenting food grown conventionally with chemicals banned for organics. But the USDA has only one compliance officer for every $9 billion in sales. The fine for each violation is capped at $11,000.\n\nFailures found in the USDA’s certification extend to corn and other bulk products, as The Washington Post reported in May regarding a shipload of conventional soybeans sold as organic for a $4 million windfall.\n\nUSDA investigators handling the Valle Verde pineapple case lacked law enforcement experience, according to their public profiles, and the compliance unit lagged at times hundreds of cases behind.\n\nNerdWallet also reviewed USDA records in another Costa Rican case, one in which the agency USDA did not prosecute an exporter who confessed to mislabeling 400,000 pineapples as organic — a racket he’s accused recently of repeating.\n\nUSDA officials refused, throughout three months of interview requests, to speak with NerdWallet.\n\nPrimus executives did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The company, which sold in 2015 and changed its name to Primus AuditingOps, approved sanitary conditions four years before at a U.S. cantaloupe plant that killed 33 people in a listeria outbreak.\n\nCustoms records show that since 2015, Valle Verde’s “USDA organic” shipments to the United States have grossed more than $6 million — a $3 million markup from conventional fruit. The company’s Costa Verde-brand pineapples, which its managers insist are organic, continue reaching Safeway, Ralphs and other U.S. chains.\n\nCompeting U.S. importers are aghast.\n\n“Why would you rob a bank, when the USDA looks the other way?” asks Stuart Follen, owner of SL Follen Co., which imports organic pineapples. “Just go into the produce business and mislabel stuff.”\n\nPineapple boss runs ranch\n\nNorthern Costa Rica’s pineapple king is Luis Alberto del Carmen Barrantes Quesada. The 48-year-old has built an organic fruit venture at extraordinary speed.\n\nBarrantes heads Del Valle Verde Corp., a longtime conventional grower with subsidiaries that export fresh and frozen pineapples. He prizes his Disney-style spread with a rodeo ring, show horses and 20 bulls.\n\nPineapple magnate Luis Barrantes at his private ranch in Pital. Barrantes runs Del Valle Verde Corp., which a Costa Rican government investigator accused of exporting bogus organics to the U.S.\n\nConcern for the environment prompted Barrantes to begin growing organics in 2013, he says. Valle Verde was able to plant them immediately on fields that had never been chemically treated, he says. The company jump-started the business by buying organics from local USDA-certified farms and exporting them.\n\nBut nearby organic farmers, including some who supplied Valle Verde, tell other stories.\n\nJose “Pepe” Castro Otarola told the Costa Rican investigator that after his USDA-certified farm sold organic pineapples to Valle Verde, a company worker had him sign duplicate invoices that could be used to exaggerate export quantities.\n\nCastro watched Valle Verde workers dump a truckload of his organics into a rinse that had just been used for conventional fruit, he said in an interview on Costa Rica’s Flecha TV news.\n\nWerner Lotz, another local grower, sold organic fruit to Valle Verde in amounts that the company inflated, the investigator wrote. To produce that much fruit, he calculated, Lotz’s farm would have had to have been nine times its 5-hectare size.\n\nValle Verde’s former farming manager provided an even more troubling view.\n\nNestor Andres Ramirez Acuna, who managed the company’s farming operations through 2012, says it had no plans then for organics, a conversion requiring lengthy preparation to buy natural fertilizers, train workers, segregate conventional crops and overhaul farming methods.\n\n“We used pesticides in the fields where they grow these organic pineapples,” said Ramirez, who convinced the investigator that the land should not have been certified.\n\nBarrantes denies the farmers’ allegations.\n\nInvestigator starts digging\n\nWhile farmers say they saw irregularities on the ground, officials in Washington D.C. and Costa Rican officials flagged the country’s pineapple surplus.\n\nIn March 2016, a top official at Costa Rica’s agriculture ministry assigned Jose Miguel Jimenez Mendez, an agrochemist and certified inspector, to investigate.\n\n“I discovered that pineapple being exported was not organic,” said Jimenez, as he alleged in two meticulously documented reports.\n\nJose Miguel Jimenez Mendez, a Costa Rican government agro-chemist, wrote reports challenging the certification of Del Valle Verde Corp. businesses.\n\nHe wrote that he found chaos in the ministry file documenting the transition of fields from conventional to organic. The USDA normally requires farmers to wait three years to plant in a field that once grew conventional crops, allowing chemicals to dissipate.\n\nThe ministry had allowed some land to convert in weeks instead of years, Jiménez wrote. Valle Verde’s files showed plots changed sizes and locations, he wrote.\n\nFields lacked required vegetation barriers between organic and conventional crops, he wrote. Soil analyses and land-use records were missing. Pages had been mysteriously added to the record, he wrote.\n\nJimenez checked with suppliers of plastic sheets, which organic growers often use for weed control. He found that Valle Verde hadn’t bought enough plastic for its acreage.\n\n“There are so many irregularities that it’s just unbelievable,” Jimenez said.\n\nHe also found that numbers didn’t balance at the Valle Verde subsidiary that shipped frozen pineapple chunks to U.S. grocery chains.\n\nJimenez examined records of 47 Valle Verde shipments exported to the United States and sold for $2.3 million during a one-year period. He concluded that shipping containers held an illegal mix of conventional and organic fruit.\n\nJimenez’s boss, Francisco Dall’Anese Alvarez, a reformer with a family history of fighting government corruption, had chosen Jimenez to investigate because he feared other officials were too cozy with Valle Verde.\n\nDall’Anese, director of the ministry’s Phytosanitary Service, acted on the findings in May 2016, suspending organic certification of Valle Verde’s processing plant, which sliced and froze pineapples for export.\n\nAnother USDA-accredited certifier, Germany’s Kiwa BCS Oko-Garantie GmbH, followed the ministry’s lead and also suspended the plant.\n\nBut then the case turned sideways. Dall’Anese left the government because, he says, he refused to sign false documents unrelated to the Valle Verde case.\n\nWith Dall’Anese gone, an agriculture ministry panel reversed the suspension of Valle Verde’s organic status. Kiwa also lifted its suspension.\n\nThe panel dismissed Jimenez’s investigation as biased, irresponsible and arbitrary.\n\nJimenez said he “was never called in to explain different aspects of the report, or how I’d reached conclusions.”\n\nValle Verde’s farm subsidiary had its certification renewed by Primus’ Costa Rica branch in December 2016.\n\nSoon after earning those certification fees for Primus, Humberto Gonzalez Guerrero, the certifier’s Costa Rica director, jumped to the same position at Kiwa, taking the Valle Verde farm account with him.\n\nGonzalez said Kiwa and Primus have certified Valle Verde correctly.\n\nUSDA drops the pineapple\n\nThe USDA received hundreds of pages of Jimenez’s investigative findings. But public records show that instead of directly investigating, the agency left the matter to Primus and Kiwa.\n\nUSDA compliance officer Karin French launched what could have developed into a full-fledged investigation of the certifiers and Valle Verde.\n\nBut like others at the agency, French lacked investigative or law enforcement experience, according to her LinkedIn entry. Nothing in the case file indicates that she traveled to Costa Rica.\n\nOn Aug. 3 of this year, the USDA issued a case closure memo signed by Betsy Rakola, the department’s new compliance and enforcement director. Rakola’s extensive LinkedIn entry also lists no investigative or enforcement skills.\n\nHer memo did not address Jimenez’s findings. It did note that “several additional complainants, who appear to be competitors” of Valle Verde had voiced concerns of fraud.\n\n“However, these complainants were unable to provide any verifiable evidence of fraudulent activity by the certifier,” she wrote.\n\nThe agency’s failure to directly investigate either the certifiers or Valle Verde doesn’t surprise Richard Mathews, who served in senior USDA National Organic Program positions for a decade, ending in 2009.\n\nMathews says that the agency’s backlogged team of five compliance officers routinely depends on certifiers to investigate.\n\nMathews, now director of the Western Organic Dairy Producers Alliance, blames former National Organic Program director Miles McEvoy for the disarray.\n\nMcEvoy retired in October, not long after the USDA Inspector General said the agency allows imports to be sold as organic despite the food having been fumigated at U.S. borders with prohibited pesticides.\n\nTesting fruit\n\nNerdWallet bought 12 Costa Verde-brand fresh pineapples in Oregon and California, and a bag of Valle Verde frozen chunks in Texas, for testing by a USDA-compliant lab. The tests detected no prohibited chemicals.\n\nPineapple farmers say the results don’t prove the absence of chemicals because they are hard to detect if applied at the start of the growing period, when their effect would be greatest.\n\nAgricultural engineer Jean-Marc Caminade, pineapple sales manager for global fruit conglomerate Compagnie Fruitiere Paris, says he began buying organic-labeled pineapple from Valle Verde in 2015.\n\nBut he says that he stopped buying after the company repeatedly failed to supply government inspection forms to prove each shipment was organic.\n\nBlood, sweat and organics\n\nCaminade recently visited what he considers an authentic organic farm, Valle del Tarso, which sits northwest of Pital. Here, farmhands live and breathe organics.\n\nProduction manager Isaac Bustos Boza stresses prevention, taking extraordinary measures to safeguard his MD2s, organic versions of the Gold Extra Sweet variety of pineapple revered worldwide.\n\nA Costa Rican organic-farm worker carries weeds from a pineapple field.\n\n“Once you have a disease, it’s explosive. There’s no way you’re going to control it in 70,000 plants,” says Bustos, an agronomist.\n\nInstead of applying a chemical to kill worms, Valle del Tarso uses a natural product from the Australian neem tree. The farm makes natural insecticides from chili pepper and tea. It ferments organic fertilizers from pineapple waste.\n\nThe farm is the kind of enterprise that Mark Kastel, co-founder of the nonprofit watchdog Cornucopia Institute, cites when urging skeptics not to write off all organics as bogus.\n\n“If you just paint this as being a corrupt system,” Kastel said, “you’re throwing literally thousands of families under the bus.”\n\nBogus exports are undercutting the legitimate industry so much that Compania Frutera La Paz, a big Pital-area fruit processor, decided in November to cut its losses by selling frozen organic pineapples as conventional.\n\nLa Paz managers say the company took a $100,000 hit.\n\nPolice close in\n\nIn recent weeks, Costa Rican television reporters have converged on pineapple fields, questioning more farmers about Valle Verde.\n\nAmid the publicity, owner Barrantes may be ready to walk away. An agriculture ministry official says the company is withdrawing some farms from organic status.\n\nA ministry official inspecting a neighboring farm recently reported a telltale odor he suspected was from an organics-prohibited pesticide applied to a Valle Verde organic field. The ministry is investigating.\n\nOn Dec. 5, the ministry disclosed that Costa Rica’s national police had seized documents concerning the agency’s decision to lift Valle Verde’s suspension as an organic processor. A week later, company competitors challenged that reversal in a lawsuit that accuses officials of ignoring evidence and railroading Jimenez, the inspector.\n\nAfter two turbulent years, the Valle Verde pineapple saga is undergoing a plot twist. But the word around Pital is that more growers are lining up to play the organic game.\n\nAnd Pital isn’t the only place that stinks.\n\nNerdWallet investigative reporter Alex Richards contributed to this article.\n\nPhoto of Jose “Pepe” Castro Otarola by Richard Read.\n\nRead more from NerdWallet's investigation\n\nRichard Read is a writer at NerdWallet.

The Park Fire continued to expand, and Tuesday had burned 600 square miles in Tehama and Butte counties, making it the fifth-largest fire in California history. It was only 14% contained as of the last update Tuesday at 4:17 p.m. Pacific Time by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection − Cal Fire.\n\nThe fire ignited last Wednesday in Upper Bidwell Park, a 3,600-acre municipal park in Chico in Butte County, although the blaze has mostly burned in Tehama County. Additional evacuations in nearby Shasta County were ordered Tuesday.\n\n\"This didn't have to happen,\" Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said at a briefing. He said Stout pulled over to the side of the road but went over a berm and into grass. Ramsey said the fire started when Stout revved his car's engine trying to drive out.\n\nWitnesses said they saw Stout watch his car burn, then push it backward. Ramsey said Stout claims he didn't push the car down the embankment but panicked and left the scene.\n\n\"The car went down an embankment approximately 60 feet and burned completely, spreading flames that caused the Park Fire,\" Ramsey said in statement. The suspect, he said, was \"seen calmly leaving the area by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area and fleeing the rapidly evolving fire.\"\n\nRamsey's office has said Stout has two previous serious felonies on his record, which would make him subject to at least a 25-year prison sentence if convicted of felony arson under California's \"three strikes'' law.\n\nVideo shows a vortex of smoke:Was it a fire tornado?\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ More than 5,000 firefighters were battling the fire, which has burned over 330,000 acres in Tehama County and more than 53,000 acres in Butte County.\n\n∎ The blaze has destroyed at least 165 homes, businesses and other structures, and damaged over a dozen more.\n\n∎ Some evacuations also were ordered in Shasta and Plumas counties. Shasta County Sheriff Michael Johnson said evacuation orders had been downgraded to warnings in some areas.\n\nHundreds evacuate as Colorado blaze grows, another fire ignites\n\nA second wildfire has ignited in northern Colorado, about 30 miles from where the Alexander Mountain Fire near Loveland quadrupled in size Tuesday, sprawling across nearly 3,600 acres with zero containment by the evening. It was at 900 acres Monday night.\n\nThe Stone Canyon Fire near the town of Lyons prompted Boulder County officials to expand an evacuation area that now includes parts of Larimer County. By 5 p.m. Mountain Time, evacuation orders also applied to parts of Lyons because of \"changing wind conditions,'' according to an alert by Boulder's Office of Disaster Management. Air tankers and 10 firetrucks and other vehicles were contending with the blaze, which was estimated at 85 acres and growing in an earlier alert.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service has taken control of the efforts to contain the Alexander Mountain Fire from Larimer County, but the blaze remained uncontrolled, according to InciWeb. Hundreds fled their homes after mandatory evacuation orders were issued for parts of Larimer County near the Wyoming border.\n\n\"We are still trying to work out our best plan of attack to get around this thing,\" incident commander Mike Smith said in a video update Tuesday. \"There are some challenges directly north.\"\n\nHigh temperatures and low humidity would likely strengthen the blaze, InciWeb warned. \"Significant\" smoke is expected over the next few days. Larimer County Sheriff’s Office Emergency Services Coordinator Justin Whitesell said drawing on firefighting resources from other states was made difficult because of wildfires burning elsewhere.\n\n\"We are doing the best we can with the resources we have,\" he said, adding firefighters were focused on evacuating people and protecting homes.\n\n− Erin Udell and Holly Engelman, Fort Collins Coloradoan\n\nOregon's extreme weather has 'tested our limits'\n\nAlmost 10,000 firefighters were battling 43 large fires across Oregon, the state Forestry Department reported. That does not include \"many of the local and agency government employees, landowners, forestland operators and members of the community who are contributing every day,\" the agency said in an update on the struggle.\n\nOregon's state climatologist, Larry O’Neill, said the state's heat waves will keep getting hotter, contributing to the fires. Deputy Director of Fire Operations Kyle Williams said the extreme weather has \"tested our limits.\" Gov. Tina Kotek has declared a state of emergency, and National Guard teams have been called in to help with the blazes.\n\n“The wildfire situation on the ground is dynamic and challenging, and we need all hands on deck,” Kotek said.\n\nFive years later, couple loses second home to flames\n\nIn California, Butte County resident Rick Pero told KHSL-TV the Park Fire was the second wildfire to destroy his home. Pero and his wife moved to Forest Ranch after losing their previous home to the Camp Fire, which killed 85 people in the Butte County town of Paradise in 2018. After that event, Pero became a fire safety advocate and educated neighbors on maintaining a defensible space around their homes.\n\n“Twenty-eight houses benefited from defensible space and are still standing,\" Pero said. But for his home and a few others, \"it was just too much mother nature,” he said.\n\nFire advisories issued in 6 states\n\nEighty-nine large wildfires are burning nationwide and have scorched more than 3,300 square miles, according to the National Interagency Fire Center report released Tuesday. Fire behavior advisories are in place for parts of California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah and Nevada. Temperatures topping 100 degrees over much of Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, combined with breezy southerly winds and low humidity, will promote a \"continued drying trend\" that could bring wildfires to the region, the fire center said.\n\nThere was some good news: \"There are no fire environment concerns in the eastern half of the country, where high humidity and areas of rainfall will continue,\" the fire center said.\n\nFlames 'right by our front door':Wildfires rage across western US\n\nPark Fire fueled by dry vegetation from record heat\n\nThe Park Fire has spread rapidly, fueled by dry vegetation resulting from weeks of record heat. Climate scientist Daniel Swain said that although data is insufficient to confirm claims the weather has been the hottest in thousand of years, \"we can also refute the myriad claims I've been seeing lately that 'it was hot like this all the time when I was a kid!'\" he wrote on social media. \"It most certainly was not.\"\n\nTehama County Sheriff Dave Kain asked evacuees to be patient, saying many areas had appeared ready for residents to return, only to erupt in flames again. \"This fire is extremely unstable and unpredictable,\" Kain said.\n\nPark Fire's massive size:Blaze one of the biggest wildfires in California history\n\nCollapse of 'carbon sink' hastening climate change\n\nForests and other land ecosystems failed to curb climate change in 2023 as intense drought in the Amazon rainforest and record wildfires in Canada hampered absorption of carbon dioxide, according to a study released Monday. A record amount of carbon dioxide entered Earth's atmosphere last year, further feeding global warming, the researchers said.\n\nForests and other land ecosystems on average absorb nearly a third of annual emissions from fossil fuels, industry and other human causes. But in 2023, that \"carbon sink\" collapsed, according to a study from the Laboratory for Climate and Environmental Sciences, a French research organization.\n\n\"The sink is a pump, and we are pumping less carbon from the atmosphere into the land,\" co-author Philippe Ciais said. \"Suddenly the pump is choking, and it's pumping less.\"\n\nWildfire smoke map: Track fires and red flag warnings across the US\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/31/quarry-wildfire-colorado-denver/74614394007/", "title": "1 dead as Colorado wildfire spreads; California Park Fire raging", "text": "Hundreds of central Colorado residents were evacuated early Wednesday after deadly wildfires spread fiercely over mountainous terrain as firefighters in California battled the fifth-largest blaze in state history.\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis told reporters Wednesday afternoon that Boulder County authorities confirmed one fatality from the blaze and at least five homes have been destroyed as strong winds and dry heat hampered emergency responders' efforts to quell the flames.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency said four firefighters were injured in Colorado's Stone Canyon Fire, which ignited Tuesday and threatened nearly 500 homes, as well as roads, bridges and other critical infrastructure.\n\nSeveral blazes across northern and central Colorado triggered waves of evacuation orders this week as they spread across more than 8,000 acres. As of Wednesday afternoon, Larimer County Sheriff John Feyen said about 4,000 people were evacuated on mandatory orders and 800 others fled their homes after voluntary evacuations were issued. The latest Colorado fire erupted Wednesday in Boulder County, where authorities issued an evacuation order for the Lake Shore Park neighborhood and urged people to keep roads clear for residents in danger zones to flee.\n\nBoulder County Sheriff Curtis Johnson said the latest blaze ignited at around 2:30 p.m. local time Wednesday and damaged two structures since, though it had only burned roughly six acres. The fire was suspected to be unintentionally started by people in the area, Johnson said. Local authorities were speaking to two people, but no arrests have been made.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Wednesday it had authorized funding for two of the largest blazes in Colorado, determining that \"the fires threatened such destruction that it would constitute a major disaster.\" The Fire Management Assistance Grant will cover up to 75% of the state’s eligible firefighting costs.\n\nIn northern California, more than 5,700 personnel were battling the Park Fire, which has torched 609 square miles, an area larger than New York City. The inferno has been burning for one week and has forced more than 25,000 people to leave their homes. Local officials say the fire started after a man, who has since been arrested and charged with arson, pushed his mother's flaming car off a 60-foot embankment.\n\nMeanwhile, Oregon's largest wildfire still posed a danger as the rain that had started to dwindle the flames gives way to another stretch of searing heat. Officials say lightning sparked the fire that has burned 459 square miles of land in eastern Oregon. As of Wednesday, it was 52% contained, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n\nOver 3,400 square miles, an area twice the size of Rhode Island, have been charred by 95 large active wildfires spreading across the western U.S., according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Experts have blamed the intensity of the fires, in part, on heat waves and dry conditions made worse by climate change.\n\nNearly 600 homes evacuated near Denver as wildfire gains momentum\n\nAround 9 p.m. Tuesday, a deputy patrolling a part of unincorporated Jefferson County, just southwest of Denver, saw “a little spot fire” that was only about 10 feet wide, Mark Techmeyer, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office said at a Wednesday morning news conference. Within three hours, the fire had spread across 100 acres of mountainous terrain.\n\nTechmeyer said officials believe the fire has grown to 130 acres, though officials are awaiting a helicopter to give a precise figure later in the day. Multiple agencies responded overnight, and authorities issued reverse 911 messages and went door-to-door to wake people up and get them to leave. Nearly 600 homes have been evacuated.\n\nAn area high school has been turned into a shelter for evacuees, while the Jefferson County Fairgrounds took in large animals. No property has been damaged and no injuries have been reported, Techmeyer said.\n\nBecause of two major wildfires to the north, “resources are thin,\" Techmeyer said. Local officials have request air support but are unsure if they'll receive any additional help on Wednesday. With over a dozen agencies responding to the blaze, there were only 70 to 80 firefighters on the ground, Techmeyer said.\n\n\"Everything is stacked against us,\" he said, noting the treacherous terrain and dangerously hot weather.\n\nDueling wildfires rage in northern Colorado\n\nThe Quarry Fire is the latest blaze to force people to flee their homes in Colorado as firefighters struggled to contain several fast-moving fires to the north.\n\nThe Alexander Mountain Fire has engulfed more than 5,000 acres of land west of Loveland, a city about 50 miles north of Denver. The blaze broke out on Monday and quadrupled on Tuesday, causing sweeping road closures and evacuations as hundreds of firefighters across the state battled the flames.\n\nWhile the Alexander Mountain Fire was expanding, a new blaze erupted nearby. The Stone Canyon Fire forced evacuations in northern Colorado's Boulder County as well as neighboring Larimer and Lyons County as changing wind conditions spread the blaze in several directions.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the blaze torched at least two homes and spread across 1,320 acres. Boulder Disaster Management said in an update that there was \"no significant growth overnight\" and that, when it's safe to do so, \"damage assessment teams will be in the field to determine structure loss.\"\n\nBoth the Stone Canyon Fire and the Alexander Mountain Fire, which had overlapping evacuation orders, were 0% contained. Meanwhile, temperatures on Wednesday were projected to reach the mid-90s, further hampering firefighters and fueling dry conditions.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued an air quality health advisory for parts of northern Colorado, including Fort Collins, Loveland and the surrounding areas because of the immense wildfire smoke.\n\nCalifornia's Park Fire grows as more hot weather is forecast\n\nMeanwhile, the fifth-largest wildfire in California history has continued to spread throughout four northern counties, causing over 25,000 people to flee from their homes and destroying at least 277 homes, businesses and other structures, mostly in Butte County, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe Park Fire, which erupted near the city of Chico one week ago, has burned about 609 square miles, an area larger than Los Angeles. As of Wednesday evening, firefighters have contained it by 18%. State fire officials warned that \"weather is expected to become much warmer and drier later this week.\"\n\nThe inferno was ignited last Wednesday when Ronnie Dean Stout II pushed his mother's flaming car into a gully, according to prosecutors. Stout, who says it was an accident and denied pushing the vehicle off an embankment, was arrested on Monday and charged with reckless arson and related charges. He's being held pending the completion of his arraignment Thursday.\n\nSouth of the Park Fire, another blaze triggered evacuations and road closures as it \"exhibits a moderate to dangerous rate of spread\" since starting on Tuesday, according to Cal Fire. The so-called Pedro Fire has burned across 2,700 acres in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties, and threatens 350 homes, businesses and other structures.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Jorge L.

For the latest, see our story for Tuesday, July 30.\n\nA suspected arson fire grew into the sixth largest blaze in California history and a new wildfire in Colorado prompted evacuations as firefighters battled flames across the western U.S. Monday.\n\nDespite improved weather conditions and an influx of firefighters, the Park Fire in Northern California expanded to more than 373,000 burned acres across four counties, making it by far the biggest blaze in the state this year and fast approaching the fifth spot on the grim list of the largest on record. The fire, near the college town of Chico, is just 12% contained.\n\nIn northern Colorado, the Alexander Mountain Fire near Loveland grew by nearly 500 acres in two hours and was up to 864 acres with zero containment as of 6:15 p.m. Mountain time, according to InciWeb, an interagency incident information system. Several helicopters and planes were battling the flames, which created a voluminous smoke cloud and prompted authorities to issue mandatory evacuation orders in Larimer County, close to the border with Wyoming.\n\nBrittany Vogel, 33, was told to \"start packing up'' by a supervisor at the Sylvan Dale Guest Ranch and Retreat in Loveland, about 50 miles north of Denver. The fire had prompted the staff to move the horses − 90 were sent by trailer to another facility − and put guests “on standby” to evacuate at a moment's notice.\n\nStanding at the reception desk, Vogel told USA TODAY she could see the fire outside and said “it was pretty much right by our front door.”\n\nDangerous fire weather notices, known as red flag warnings, and air quality alerts were in place Monday in Idaho, Wyoming and Oregon, urging residents to prepare for gusty winds and low humidity that \"can lead to rapid growth and very high intensity of any new or existing fires,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nSuspect in Park Fire charged with arson\n\nThousands of firefighters responded over the weekend to the Park Fire, which started Wednesday after authorities say a man pushed a burning car into a gully in Chico and then fled.\n\nRonnie Stout of Chico was charged with arson Monday in his first court appearance, the Associated Press reported. Stout, 42, has two previous felony convictions, the Butte County District Attorney’s Office said, and would be sentenced to at least 25 years in prison if convicted n this case, based on the state's \"three strikes'' law.\n\nLive footage of the wildfire on the website of the California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection website Monday showed flames glowing atop hillsides, creating multiple streams of dense gray smoke near Colby Mountain in Tuolumne County.\n\nThe fire poses a threat to Paradise, the California town devastated by a 2018 wildfire that stands as the deadliest in state history with 85 fatalities.\n\nHighway closures on and off because of fires\n\nIn central Oregon, fires have led to highway closures, affecting local businesses such as Tyler Fouts' Blue Mountain Fine Art studio in Baker City. Semi-trucks carrying bronze and sand Fouts uses to make sculptures haven't been able to make deliveries, he told USA TODAY.\n\n\"They seem to open and close the highway off and on,\" said Fouts, 65, who has been in Baker City for 20 years. \"I'm just hoping it goes away.\"\n\nFouts said Baker City is about 20 miles north of the nearest fire, and the community hasn't been told to evacuate yet. Over the weekend, evacuations were in effect for over 20 fires nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which reported 94 large active wildfires across the U.S. as of Monday morning.\n\nBorel Fire decimates historic mining town\n\nA handful of other fires in California are together burning more than 82,000 acres, state officials said. A blaze called the Borel Fire is \"expected to be, once again, very extreme,\" the state's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, said late Sunday.\n\nDestruction from the Borel Fire includes the historic mining town of Havilah, where gold was discovered in the 1860s. By the early 1900s, the lucrative deposits were depleted and Havilah became a ghost town, according to the Palm Springs Desert Sun, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nExcept for a handful of structures, Havilah from the northern edge to the Walker Basin is a complete loss, officials reported, according to the Desert Sun. One of the few buildings to be spared was Havilah's old schoolhouse, KGET Bakersfield reported.\n\nFive wildfires converge in Oregon\n\nIn Oregon, where officials say lightning has sparked fires, the body of a missing airplane pilot was found Friday after his plane went down while battling a fire.\n\nIn the northeast part of the state, officials said more fire responders are being sent to tackle blazes near the town of Wallowa, where five fires converged over the weekend, the Wallowa County Chieftain reported.\n\n\"The team is being ordered in anticipation of unfavorable weather in the area later in the week,\" the Oregon Department of Forestry said on its Facebook page Sunday night.\n\nSmoke outlooks across five counties in eastern Oregon said \"unhealthy\" air conditions are expected to persist Monday and Tuesday, after a weak cold front moves through the area, according to the U.S. Interagency Wildland Fire Air Quality Response Program.\n\n“You do get concerned that it will get worse, that the smoke will get worse, because at some point it does get really unhealthy to be outside,\" said Fouts, adding that some of his friends experience headaches and allergy-like symptoms from wildfire smoke.\n\nFarther west, La Pine, Oregon, recently registered an Air Quality Index of 233, breaking into the \"very unhealthy\" category, according to state air quality officials.\n\nUtah on alert for dangerous fire conditions\n\nThe National Weather Service said much of Utah will face weather conditions through Tuesday that can easily cause more fires, including wind gusts up to 30 mph and humidity as low as 5%.\n\nThe conditions will be the most dangerous across southern and central Utah through Monday, the weather service said, before shifting to higher elevations in northern Utah Tuesday.\n\nRed flag warnings in effect in Wyoming\n\nIn Wyoming, where a plane crash sparked a wildfire Friday, several red flag warnings are in effect until Tuesday, when wind gusts are expected to subside and possibly allow for clear conditions, the National Weather Service said.\n\nSeven people died in the crash that happened north of the town of Gillette, in Campbell County. By Saturday afternoon, firefighters had contained the fire caused by the accident to 38 acres, according to a Campbell County Fire Department press release.\n\nAs of Monday, there were at least three active fires still burning in the county, according to a national wildfire tracker, and Campbell County Public Information Officer Leslie Perkins told USA TODAY there was no update available on the fire caused by the plane crash.\n\nIn Idaho, warm temps could fuel 'extreme fire' conditions\n\nIn Idaho, which in July has seen nearly triple the number of wildfires compared to June, roads and trails northeast of Boise were closed Monday, according to Idaho Fish and Game. Most of the state's active fires are in its northern half, or panhandle. One of the largest fires in the state is burning near the town of Fish, Idaho.\n\nThe weather service also issued forecasts for Idaho saying fire-spurring winds could decrease overnight Monday is some areas, while elsewhere, warm temperatures through Tuesday could lead to \"extreme fire behavior.\"\n\nContributing: James Ward, Desert Sun", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/12/11/inmates-battle-thomas-wildfire-save-famed-rose-garden/943093001/", "title": "California Wildfires: Inmates battle Thomas fire to save rose garden", "text": "CARPINTERIA, Calif. — Roses, not fire alarms, were on Bill Hahn's mind a week ago when winds howled across his 15-acre garden an hour's walk from the California coast.\n\nThe Thomas Fire, as it had been dubbed, had started burning in Santa Paula, about 30 miles from the famed family-owned rose garden that Hahn operates here with his wife Danielle.

The Original Series airs Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nMariposa County, California CNN —\n\nOn a ridge overlooking the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, it would have been possible to see the first flickering flames of the Oak Fire and then how it engulfed its surroundings.\n\nIt took just 24 hours to mushroom to 10,000 acres and become California’s biggest wildfire this year.\n\n“That’s crazy fast,” said Joe Amador, one of thousands of firefighters from across the state now deployed to fight the blaze.\n\n“In the initial stages it was wind-driven and terrain-driven,” he told CNN, pointing to rolling hills, peaks and valleys that fire crews call “chimneys” that can help to spread embers and fire rapidly.\n\nWinds were light on Thursday, allowing an inversion layer to form, which kept flames shorter and held down the thick smoke blanketing the hills outside Mariposa, close to Yosemite National Park – a blessing for the teams trying to contain the fire and protect buildings.\n\nSmoke from the Oak Fire blankets the hills near Mariposa. Julian Quiñones/CNN\n\n“We’re in extreme conditions, but things can always get worse,” Amador said ruefully. “Every year we talk about record -setting years, and this year is no different. And we’re not even in the thick of things yet.”\n\nThe “megadrought” driven by climate change that is affecting California and other western states has left plenty of dry, flammable material that can become fuel so quickly, especially when humidity is low and winds are high.\n\nAnd that means grim records are barely being set before they are burned through, again.\n\n“I’ve seen the biggest fire happen year after year after year,” said Brian Vitorelo, who’s come inland from his home department of Mendocino to help the battle.\n\nBrian Vitorelo said the pace of new wildfire records being set was impressive. Evelio Contreras/CNN\n\nAmador, his Cal Fire colleague who is up from San Diego, added: “Every year it seems like we’re out here fighting these record-breaking fires.”\n\nFire trucks from all corners of the state can be seen around the fire, along with teams from the California Highway Patrol, the PG&E power company, the North Fork Mono Tribe, inmates, park rangers and the Merced-Mariposa Cattleman’s Association.\n\nIn California, a mutual-aid agreement directs fire personnel wherever they are needed and when it’s bad, many helpers and volunteers join in.\n\nA helicopter picks up water to fight the fire. Some 22 helicopters have been deployed along with 303 fire engines, 81 bulldozers and 70 water tenders, according to Cal Fire Evelio Contreras/CNN\n\nWith nearly 20,000 acres burned, 116 residential and commercial structures destroyed and hundreds more threatened, Cal Fire data shows the Oak Fire is the largest of the year so far in the state, and will not be fully contained for more than a week.\n\nBut the year is only halfway over and the Oak Fire is still small compared to blazes like last year’s Dixie Fire, which burned more than 960,000 acres, or the August Complex Fire in 2020 that became the state’s first “gigafire” in modern history, scorching more than one million acres.\n\nTrack wildfires and air quality across the US\n\nFirefighter Amador says a slice of fortune is that the wildfire, though huge, is also one of only a few active this week.\n\nFirefighters mop up hot spots while battling the Oak Fire in the Jerseydale community of Mariposa County, California, on Monday, July 25.

A new camp had been established at Lake Cachuma to accommodate the increased personnel and resources near Carpinteria and Montecito.\n\nOvernight Sunday, the fire's westward run toward the mountains behind Santa Barbara had largely petered out. Officials had been worried the fire might spread 6 miles toward Highway 154. Instead, it expanded into the unpopulated backcountry.\n\nThe threat of sundowner winds picking up overnight Monday remained.\n\nThe Thomas Fire's growth placed it in historic company, making it the fifth largest wildfire in California history, according to Cal Fire. Ventura County also holds the record for the sixth largest wildfire in state history with the Matilija Fire, which burned 220,000 acres in 1932.\n\nSo far, the price tag to fight the fire is more than $48 million and that figure will continue to increase.\n\nElusive rain\n\nNearly 6,400 fire personnel continued to battle the fire Monday, with winds that were weaker than the day before. Humidity also remained in the single digits and temperatures reached the 80s.\n\nThe National Weather Service extended its red-flag warning for the Ventura County coast until 8 p.m. Tuesday and county mountains until 8 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nLower temperatures and an onshore flow were expected to arrive near the end of the week, although no rain is expected in the 10-day forecast, said Stuart Seto, a weather service specialist.\n\nThe last measurable amount of rain Ventura County received was in February 2017, nearly 10 months before the outbreak of the fire, Seto said.\n\nStorms that normally provide almost 2 inches of rain between October and November failed to materialize this year, denying moisture to the vegetation and grasses that sprung up after last rainy season's record totals.\n\nThe blaze encroached upon Santa Barbara County communities, forcing mandatory evacuations in portions of Montecito and Carpinteria. But later on Monday, authorities said the fire slowed near Carpinteria and the aircraft drops helped keep the blaze up in the hills.\n\nFrontline updates\n\nThe fire crept eastward toward Fillmore, with unincorporated areas northwest of the city, between Hall Road and Sespe Creek, under mandatory evacuation.\n\nAlthough the threat to Fillmore remains, officials were optimistic.\n\n\"It's looking good,\" said Sebastian Ramirez, Fillmore Fire Department spokesman.\n\n\"We feel very fortunate,\" said Fillmore City Manager Dave Rowlands, noting that the fire's aggressive expansion on the western front.\n\nWe know how quickly things can change, he added.\n\nRowlands said fire air units were dropping flame retardant to the west of the city on Monday with the hope of keeping the fire within the drop line.\n\nMany portions of Ventura County remained under mandatory evacuation orders as of Monday morning including Ojai, Casitas Springs, Rose Valley and Ventura.\n\nIn Ventura, mandatory and voluntary evacuations were lifted in all but areas north of Foothill Road from Day Road to Kimball Road. A water boil advisory remained in place for the sections of Ventura north of Poli and Foothill Road, east of Cedar Street.\n\nSome residents of the Ojai area also received good news Monday afternoon as mandatory evacuation orders were lifted for the area along Highway 150 between Reeves and Osborn roads.\n\nOrders were also lifted for the residents south of Cozy Ojai Road and north of Foothill Road between Highway 33 and Foothill Road.\n\nThe number of structures destroyed continues to increase as officials get a more accurate count.\n\nAn estimated 868 structures have been destroyed by the fire; 525 in the city of Ventura, 342 in unincorporated Ventura County and one in Santa Barbara County.\n\nSanta Paula Unified School District made the decision to close school sites until Monday due to air quality test results.\n\n\"We had a professional assessment of each of our schools ... to test the impact in classrooms and common areas and determine if light cleaning or specialized deep cleaning was needed,\" said Robert Fraisse, interim superintendent at the district. \"Results were kind of all over the place, some places were good to go and others were in need of a deep clean.\"\n\nThe district contracted with deep cleaners who will work at the school sites and expect the cleaning to be complete by the end of the week. Fraisse said the air quality was improving and the schools were prepared to reopen this week, but then fire crews created backfires to protect the city which created more smoke.\n\n\"It made the city and schools safer, but contributed to air quality and the cleaning task,\" Fraisse said.\n\nWildlife watch\n\nIn Fillmore with the fire burning into the southern edge of the Sespe Condor Sanctuary, biologists were monitoring the endangered birds and at least one chick in the area.\n\n“It’s nesting and roosting habitat in there,” said Steve Kirkland, California Condor field coordinator with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n“Condors are pretty resilient and they can use that landscape after a fire. It won’t really harm the roosting habitat,” he said.\n\nBut biologists are concerned about a nest on the edge of the sanctuary where a chick has yet to leave.\n\n“The chick is just about ready to fledge, so we haven’t really been able to get anyone in there for a while,” Kirkland said Monday. “It has a radio transmitter on it, so we know that it’s still in there.”\n\nThe fire also has yet to reach the nest and at last count was about two miles from the spot.\n\nStaff writers Cheri Carlson, Wendy Leung and Gretchen Wenner contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/09/10/california-august-complex-fire-becomes-states-biggest-blaze/3461337001/", "title": "California: August Complex Fire becomes state's biggest blaze", "text": "There's a new name on top of the state's list of largest wildfires as California is hounded by its worst fire season on record.

That's about a third the size of Delaware.\n\nThe blaze burning near the coast of Northern California unseated the 2018 Mendocino Complex Fire, which had reigned as the state's largest fire for two years at 459,000 acres. The Mendocino Complex Fire burned in another part of the same forest where the August Complex Fire currently rages on.\n\nThe August Complex Fire started Aug. 17 during a series of lightning strikes that ignited 37 different fires. It was 24% contained Thursday.\n\nAbout 40 fires are burning in California weeks before the autumn months, which typically bring the year'ss most devastating blazes. Overall, across the West, 16 people have died and an area the size of Connecticut has burned in fires this month.\n\n“We are hitting the record books in ways that we never would have imagined, and definitely not records that we like breaking,” said Daniel Berlant, an assistant deputy director at Cal Fire.

One of the major concerns with this trend is it leaves less time for warnings and evacuations.\n\nRecently “we have seen multiple fires expand by tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours, and 30 years or more ago that just wasn’t fire behavior that we saw,” said Jacob Bendix, a professor of geography and the environment at Syracuse University who studies wildfires.\n\nWarmer temperatures and years of drought, conditions related to climate change, are some of the prime factors in this fire behavior trend. And fast-moving fires are difficult to predict.\n\n“When you have a fire run 15 miles in one day, in one afternoon, there’s no model that can predict that,” U.S. Forest Service forester Steve Lohr said. “The fires are behaving in such a way that we’ve not seen.”\n\nAnother reason to stay home?\n\nState air quality officials said it's rare that so many Californians are breathing in air polluted by lung-damaging particles. It's a more widespread effect of the brutal fire season, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.\n\n“What’s notable is that it’s everywhere,” said Anthony Wexler, director of the Air Quality Research Center at UC Davis. “So no matter which way the wind blows you’re getting hit by smoke and ash. It’s pretty brutal.”\n\nMany people have remained indoors as they practice physical distancing amid the coronavirus health crisis, which impacts the respiratory system. The health effects of the air due to wildfire smoke include irritation to the eyes, nose and throat. It can cause asthma attacks and increase the risk of heart attacks and stroke.\n\nChildren, pregnant women, the elderly, outdoor workers and people with asthma or other chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are most at risk.\n\nWildfire smoke sends more smog-forming pollutants in the air, according to the Los Angeles Times. Over Labor Day weekend, the smog in downtown L.A. was the worst it has been in nearly 30 years.\n\nThe levels were so far above normal it prompted a quality control check to prevent the release of any wrong data.\n\nThe Redding Record Searchlight in Northern California reports the unhealthy conditions are likely to continue through the weekend. Experts suggest residents living at lower elevations in the Sacramento Valley stay inside.\n\nDisneyland cancels Christmas event\n\nFirst it was Halloween in Los Angeles County and now it's Christmas at Disneyland. The Orange County Register reported that the Anaheim theme park is canceling its annual Candlelight Processional.\n\nThe event features dozens of choir groups who sing songs to tell the story of Christmas. Disney officials said the company was unable to commit to plans for the event while the state's reopening guidelines for theme parks is unclear.\n\nThe Disneyland Candlelight Ceremony tradition began in 1958 as a way for Walt Disney to show his gratitude to the Orange County community that was home to his first theme park.\n\nThere might be some hope for Halloween fans at Knott's Berry Farm. The Taste of Fall-O-Ween craft beer and food event will be held on select dates from Sept. 25 through Nov. 1.\n\nThe rides at Knott's Berry Farm are not running but there will be a trick-or-treat trail with candy stations for kids. Might be a good option for L.A. County parents, who have been advised not to allow their kids the Halloween rite of passage.

The inferno has been burning for over a week and has forced more than 25,000 people to leave their homes.\n\nLocal officials say the fire started after a man, who has since been arrested and charged with arson, sent his mother's flaming car off a 60-foot embankment.\n\nHow fast the Park Fire grew\n\nThe record-breaking blaze torched 71,000 acres in its first 24 hours and burned uncontrolled for several days as it made its way northward through the towns of Cohasset and Paynes Creek.\n\nHow the Park Fire compares with California's largest wildfires\n\nThe Park Fire is the largest wildfire of the year in California and the fourth-largest in the state's history dating back to 1932. The biggest fire on record was the August Complex Fire in 2020, which burned over 1 million acres in 87 days. By contrast, the Park Fire has burned enough acreage to place it as the fourth largest in just nine days.\n\nThe second- and third-largest fires – the Dixie Fire in 2021 and the Mendocino Complex Fire in 2018 – were both active for over 100 days.\n\nHere's how the Park Fire compares with California's largest fires:\n\nHow big are California's largest wildfires?\n\nThe 1 million acres burned by the August Complex Fire is nearly two times the size of nearby Sacramento County. While the Park Fire is smaller than the August Complex Fire, the nearly 400,000 acres burned is more than 13 times the size of San Francisco.\n\nThe Park fire compared with California's largest fire\n\nThe Park Fire, while massive in size, is nowhere near the scale of California's largest fire, the August Complex Fire. The fire burned 1,032,648 acres from Aug. 16 through Nov. 11, 2020. The Park Fire, which is now 24% contained, would need to burn an additional 633,211 acres to match the August Complex Fire, California's largest.\n\nThe August Complex Fire was made up of 37 separate fires ignited by lightning that merged into one blaze, including the Doe and Elkhorn fires.\n\nNine of the top 10 largest recorded wildfires in California's history have occurred since 2017.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/09/18/what-we-know-friday-north-state-wildfire/3492309001/", "title": "California wildfire updates: North Complex Fire, Slater Fire, August ...", "text": "Editor's note: We have made this story free to all readers as an important public service.

Amnesty International said Friday that at least 30 people, including four children, had died; according to state media the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, 35 people have died.\n\nThe demonstrations have also seen journalists targeted by authorities, with at least 17 arrested, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit that monitors press freedom.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has asked all people to identify protesters, the country’s semi-official news agency Fars News said.\n\nThe IRCG is the elite wing of the Iranian military that was established in the aftermath of the country’s revolution in 1979.\n\nPeople light a fire during a protest over the death of Mahsa Amini in Tehran on September 21, 2022. West Asia News Agency/Reuters\n\nDecades of repression\n\nAuthorities hope that by restricting the internet they can control the protests – the latest in a wave that has swept Iran in recent years. They started with the Green movement in 2009 over contested election results and more recently the 2019 protests sparked by a rise in fuel prices. Hundreds were believed to have been killed in the violent crackdown three years ago and thousands injured, according to estimates released by the UN and rights groups.\n\nBut this year’s protests are different – in their scope, scale and unprecedented feminist nature. There is also mobilization across the socio-economic divide. A young generation of Iranians are rising up on the streets against decades of repression – arguably bolder than ever.\n\nThe demonstrations have spread to dozens of Iranian cities, from the Kurdish region in the northwest, to the capital Tehran and even more traditionally conservative cities like Mashhad.\n\nWhile they were ignited by the death of Amini – the initial calls for accountability have turned into demands for more rights and freedoms, especially for women who for decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have faced discrimination and severe restrictions on their rights.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Iranian women open up about hijab law and morality police 01:13 - Source: CNN\n\nBut calls for regime change are growing too. People across the country are chanting for “death to the dictator,” in a reference to the Supreme Leader, tearing down portraits of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Remarkable images emerged on Friday night from Khamenei’s birthplace in the city of Mashhad, where protesters set fire to the statue of a man considered one of the symbols of the Islamic Revolution. Such scenes were unthinkable in the past.\n\nThis is all happening at a time when Iran’s hardline leadership is under growing pressure with talks to revive the stalled 2015 nuclear agreement and the state of the economy under US sanctions; ordinary Iranians are struggling to cope with soaring levels of inflation.\n\nWhile these protests are the biggest challenge for the government for years, analysts believe the government will likely move to contain them by resorting to the heavy-handed tactics it has used in the past. There are signs a brutal crackdown is coming, along with the internet restrictions on a level not seen since 2019. Other measures include the government mobilizing its supporters in mass rallies following Friday prayers; officials dismissing the demonstrators as rioters and foreign agents, and ominous warnings the army and powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps will be deployed to deal with the protests.\n\nSpeaking with state broadcaster IRIB on Friday, Iran’s Minister of Communications Ahmad Vahidi said, “Until the riots end, the internet will have limitations. To prevent riot organization through social media, we are obliged to create internet limitations.”\n\nVahidi’s comments came after videos on social media showed scenes of public defiance, with women removing and burning their headscarves and demonstrators chanting such slogans as, “women, life, freedom.”\n\nThe move to further restrict the internet also followed a call by the United Nations for an independent investigation into Amini’s death and for Iran’s security forces to refrain from using “disproportionate force” on the protesters.\n\nOutrage over Amini’s death comes from public skepticism over the account given by state officials, who claim she died after suffering a “heart attack” and fell into a coma. But Amini’s family have said she had no pre-existing heart condition.\n\nAmini’s death has now become a symbol of the violent oppression women have faced in Iran for decades, and her name has spread around the globe, with world leaders invoking her even at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City this week.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday said UN experts strongly condemned the use of physical violence against women in Iran by state authorities.\n\n“Iranian authorities said (Amini) died of a heart attack, and claimed her death was from natural causes. However, some reports suggested that Amini’s death was a result of alleged torture and ill-treatment,” it said in a statement.\n\n“We call on the Iranian authorities to hold an independent, impartial, and prompt investigation into Ms Amini’s death, make the findings of the investigation public and hold all perpetrators accountable,” it added.\n\nInternet crackdown\n\nThe internet monitoring agency Netblocks said Friday Iranians are facing a third wave of “nation-scale” loss of mobile internet connectivity as the protests continue.\n\nThe watchdog group said earlier in the week that Iran was experiencing the most severe internet restrictions since 2019, with mobile networks largely shutdown and social networks Instagram and WhatsApp restricted in the country since protests began.\n\nTo circumvent internet blocks, Iranians both inside the country and in the diaspora are turning to popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers such as Tor Project and Hula VPN – the top downloaded apps available in Iran via Google Play Store, a marketplace for Android smartphone users to download apps, according to monitoring service AppBrain.\n\nHowever, Netblocks has warned that the kind of internet disruption seen currently in the country “cannot generally be worked around with the use of circumvention software or VPNs.”\n\nSimilar internet restrictions took place in Iran in November 2019, taking Iranians almost entirely offline as authorities tried to curb the spread of nationwide protests over fuel prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Violent crackdown doesn't slow protest against Iran's morality police 02:35 - Source: CNN\n\nOracle’s Internet Intelligence called it at the time the “largest internet shutdown ever observed in Iran.”\n\nMeanwhile, Internet activist hacker group Anonymous has also targeted the Iranian government online over the past week, announcing several breaches of government websites on Thursday.\n\nUsing the hashtag #OpIran, short for Operation Iran, which started gaining traction on social media following the death of Amini, Anonymous also tweeted Thursday that the organization was successful in hacking more than 1,000 CCTV Iranian cameras – a claim CNN has not been able to independently confirm.\n\nUN calls for investigation\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres said Friday he was “concerned about reports of peaceful protests being met with excessive use of force leading to dozens of deaths and injuries.”\n\n“We call on the security forces to refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force and appeal to all to exercise restraint to avoid further escalation,” Dujarric said at the daily briefing on UNTV.\n\nThe UN said it’s closely following the protests in Iran and called on authorities to “respect the right to freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association.”\n\n“We also call on the authorities to respect women’s rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and implement effective measures to protect them from other human rights violations, in accordance with international standards.”\n\nGuterres reiterated a call from the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights for a prompt investigation into the death of Amini by an “independent competent authority.”\n\nIran’s Interior Minister denied Mahsa Amini was beaten up, citing investigations into the incident, the country’s state news agency, IRNA, reported Saturday.\n\n“The results of observations, talking with those who were on the scene, receiving reports from relevant bodies and other investigations showed that late Ms. Amini was not beaten, Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi told (Iran’s state broadcaster) IRIB,” IRNA reported.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi called Amini’s family saying he had ordered the incident to be investigated carefully so that no rights would be violated, according to IRNA. He said during his trip to the UNGA in New York last week that early coroner’s findings found no signs of beating.\n\nAfter returning to Iran follow his trip to the UNGA in New York, Raisi also called the family of a Basij member, a volunteer paramilitary group connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed during protests in Mashhad, according to his official website.\n\nIn the statement released by his office, Raisi expressed his condolences to the family of Rasool Doust Mohammadi, the Basij member, and said there is a “need to distinguish between protest and disruption of public order and security,” while also describing the protests “as rioting and evil.”", "authors": ["Artemis Moshtaghian Jomana Karadsheh Caitlin Hu Kathleen Magramo Sahar Akbarzai Richard Roth", "Artemis Moshtaghian", "Jomana Karadsheh", "Caitlin Hu", "Kathleen Magramo", "Sahar Akbarzai", "Richard Roth"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/us/nypd-anti-crime-unit-eric-adams/index.html", "title": "The NYPD has resurrected its controversial anti-crime unit. Success ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn response to a wave of violence during his first month on the job – capped by a deadly attack on two police officers – New York City Mayor Eric Adams is resurrecting a controversial unit within the NYPD to help stem an increase in shootings, hoping that oversight and training will prevent the unit from the infamy that plagued it in years past.\n\nThe so-called anti-crime unit, which was disbanded in August 2020 following racial justice protests and unrest across the country, will be rebranded Neighborhood Safety Teams and will start patrolling high-crime neighborhoods in the next three weeks.\n\nThe unit and other similarly composed units have been marked by allegations of aggressive tactics and police brutality. High-profile shootings by plainclothes officers undermined the legitimacy and perception of both the unit and the notion of plainclothes policing in New York. But Adams, who made public safety a key part of his campaign for mayor and touted his history as an NYPD captain as evidence he’s uniquely suited for tackling crime, said better training and oversight will help the city keep the unit’s troubled lineage in its past.\n\n“In doing this, we will avoid mistakes of the past,” Adams said at a press conference announcing a multi-layered plan for fighting crime that also includes investing in community violence prevention and intervention programs. “These officers will be identifiable as NYPD, they will have body cameras, and they will have enhanced training and oversight.”\n\nNew York City is not unique: Cities across the country have units of plainclothes officers assigned to high-risk policing efforts, and though their assignments vary by city, they’re similar in many ways. They’re usually identifiable, unlike undercovers. They’re typically in unmarked cars and not responsible for answering 911 calls, are assigned hours and locations depending on crime concerns, and their mandate is guns or other felony enforcement. And in other cities, they’re also associated with aggressive policing.\n\n“I can’t imagine not having a group of officers, deputies, detectives that I can pull and use to prevent and combat a problem they may be having in a certain area,” said Florida’s Orange County Sheriff John W. Mina, who also served as Chief of the Orlando Police Department.\n\n“Here we just had a series of shootings in an area that has been a challenge for years but we were able to divert resources because they’re not tied to just answering calls. And it works. It works. They make a lot of good cases, a lot of good arrests. Put a lot of bad people away to help solve the issue.”\n\nMayor Eric Adams speaks at the 32nd Precinct at a vigil for the two officers shot last week in Harlem. Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nPlainclothes officers have a checkered history\n\nCritics are quick to point to a checkered history of plainclothes officers in New York – including the three high-profile deaths of Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell and Eric Garner – and a reputation for aggressive policing and abuse of power.\n\nThe biggest problem with the anti-crime unit was the civilian complaints they racked up, said Joseph Giacalone, a former NYPD detective sergeant and current professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n“You’re going after people who’ve committed violent crimes, and firearms, you’re going to get that reaction because you’re not going to be right every time you jump out of the car,” Giacalone said. “That’s just the cost of doing business … If you’re involved in active policing, you’re going to get (complaints).”\n\nData provided by the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the watchdog agency charged with oversight of the NYPD, show the unit garnered lots of complaints over the years. They had 430 complaints in 2019 and 428 in 2018, though the vast majority of those allegations were not proven, the data shows. Officials with CCRB have also said in the past that plainclothes officers were much harder to identify because they were sometimes not wearing badges or name tags and that would lead to unsubstantiated claims.\n\nCCRB Executive Director Darius Charney, whose agency investigates racial profiling and biased policing allegations, said there must be real oversight for the unit to avoid problems that dogged this unit in the past.\n\n“Unfortunately, in the past, the history shows us that these plainclothes officers were really some of the worst offenders when it came to abusive and discriminatory policing,” Charney said. “And I think a lot of that had to do with not only how they were trained or what incentives they were given, but also there was just really a lack of oversight and accountability for officers who did break the law or violate people’s rights.”\n\nThe casket of New York City police officer Wilbert Mora is carried out of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Wednesday, February 2.

Jeenah Moon/The New York Times/Redux In pictures: NYPD mourns fallen officers Prev Next\n\nCops selected will be ‘best fit for the unit’\n\nAdams’ resurrection of this unit is part of his strategy to combat gun violence, which he announced earlier than planned after three weeks of high-profile incidents that was punctuated by the deadly shooting of two NYPD officers answering a domestic disturbance call last week. In all, five New York City Police officers have been shot in the first three weeks of the year.\n\nThe mayor’s plan calls for the new teams to be deployed to 30 of the city’s 77 precincts and housing units that are responsible for 80% of violence in the city.\n\nThe NYPD is vetting candidates for the teams now, Adams said.\n\n“We’re going to make sure the 400 plus people that are in the pipeline to go into our new unit … that they’re the best fit for the unit,” Adams said.\n\n“We must make sure we don’t continue to put dangerous people back on the street and continue the flow of guns in our cities,” Adams said during a speech, following the shooting of the two officers. “I’m going to get my cops to do their job. I need the rest of the country that are in positions of authority to do their job.”\n\nMina said that when he supervised teams in Orlando, he sought officers who could work with minimal supervision and showed they were productive with self-initiated activity.\n\n“They’ve already put together cases, shown an aptitude for writing search warrants. Finding people with guns. Or recruiting (confidential informants),” he said.\n\nElite team was involved in the death of Diallo\n\nThe NYPD’s anti-crime unit existed for decades, and was staffed and directed at the precinct level, meant to respond to concerns within those boundaries and staffed by police officers familiar with the people and places in the precinct.\n\nPromotion to NYPD’s detective squads typically ran through the anti-crime unit, though that’s not always the case in other cities. Promising or ambitious young officers with a few years working uniformed patrol – or those with older relatives or political connections on the job – would ask into NYPD anti-crime and work there for a couple years before doing 18 months or two years of detective work and earning a detective shield, Giacalone said\n\nOnce NYPD officers were selected for the anti-crime units, they were sent to training and worked their new assignment in plainclothes. They were expected to go after guns and people carrying them (referred to as “the gun police” by some residents), so they carried less equipment on their belts than uniformed officers and weren’t required to wear a uniform because of the expectation of getting into foot chases, Giacalone said.\n\nWhile the NYPD had its precinct-level anti-crime units, the department also staffed a more elite “street crime” unit whose main focus was getting guns. They were also plainclothes and in unmarked cars. In 1999, four officers from that unit fired 41 shots at Amadou Diallo as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx home.\n\nDiallo was struck 19 times and was killed. The officers, who were later acquitted of murder charges, said they confused his wallet for a gun. The entire unit was eventually disbanded in response to Diallo’s death, and the work they did became the responsibility of the anti-crime units which long operated at the precinct, borough and city levels.\n\n‘Supervision is a good thing’\n\nThe Bronx vestibule where Amadou Diallo was shot and killed by members of New York City's elite 'street crime' unit. Richard Harbus/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nControversy over the years, including drug and money related corruption scandals, led to changes and tighter supervision within plainclothes units. This happened as views on policing continued to evolve across the country and cities started seeing an influx of drugs, drug money, and street violence and police corruption related to both.\n\nAfter the Diallo shooting, the NYPD’s anti-crime unit’s focus remained on guns and violence. Then, in June 2020, then NYPD Police Commissioner Dermot Shea announced that he disbanded all levels of the anti-crime unit, sending roughly 200 members to the detective bureau and spreading others out to different units.\n\nThe move to disband the unit followed protests, in New York and across the country, over the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Other cities, in the wake of protests, reexamined their staffing and the utility of proactive policing. But the move in New York was reversed within about two months, as shootings in New York City spiked following the protests. The teams returned as Public Safety Teams, working unmarked cars but in full uniform, city officials have said.\n\nThe NYPD’s teams were typically composed of three officers and a sergeant working shifts that extend into the evening or overnight. In other parts of policing, in other cities and in patrol, sergeants will typically oversee a larger number of officers, from six to 10. Part of the reason for greater supervision, Giacalone said, was to prevent corruption.\n\nMina, who worked in and supervised a similar unit in the Orlando Police Department and whose department now has a similar unit, said that more supervision in high-risk situations was beneficial for everyone.\n\n“If it’s always wanted people you’re going after, or people known to carry guns, you’re going to want the span of control to be tighter so you can manage and supervise what’s going on,” Mina said. “Making sure you’re safe, the public’s safe, and making sure the bad guy is safe and situations can be peacefully resolved. Supervision is a good thing.”\n\nTwo points of contention – the lack of a uniform and the unmarked vehicles – came to represent, to critics, bad policing and unwarranted aggression. The officers in the new unit won’t wear uniforms but will wear jackets with police insignia, a slight departure from the past where officers were required to wear the shield identifying themselves as officers outside their outermost layer of clothing.\n\n“In many communities, that is a sign that you’re about to be attacked,” Adams said about plainclothes cops jumping out of their car. “That has created a lot of hostility. We are going to make sure that the version of plainclothes officers will have modified police attire so that they are quickly identified as police officers.\n\n‘Real accountability’ is necessary\n\nAccording to experts, for the most part, unmarked cars and officers in baseball caps and oversized shirts weren’t fooling anyone, but it’s a common defense for someone who runs from the police that they didn’t know the person chasing them was an officer. And the reason for a lighter duty belt was for it to be easier to give chase.\n\n“Defense attorneys are gonna do what they do … What are they going to say, (their client) knew he was the police and ran? You could be wearing a clown outfit and (the defense attorney) would say (their client) didn’t know it was a clown,” Giacalone said.\n\nMina said unmarked cars, especially at night, can buy an officer a few seconds of advantage. Being able to get a little closer, or evading detection for even a couple more seconds, is sometimes all an officer needs to capture someone evading custody.\n\n“If you’re standing there (selling drugs), you’re not going to throw dope or run every time you see a car that’s not marked. They’re looking, don’t get me wrong. And in some cases, we catch ‘em sleeping, not paying attention. But it buys you a few more seconds,” he said. “The idea is they get just a little bit closer than a marked unit, and sometimes even a second or two is helpful … you’re not fooling anyone but it will get you a little closer and buy you a second or two of hesitation.”\n\nThe units also came to be associated with NYPD’s stop-and-frisk policy. Stop-and-frisk, where police stopped and searched those they considered suspicious, had been used to deter crime, law enforcement officials have said in the past in defense of the tactic. But it has also resulted in a slew of lawsuits by residents complaining of unlawful stops.\n\nIn August 2013, a federal judge ruled that stop-and-frisk violated the Constitution and ordered the city to develop remedies, including a federal monitor overseeing the NYPD.\n\nCharney, now with the CCRB, was the plaintiff’s attorney in the landmark stop-and-frisk case that ended the practice in New York. It was the same case where Mayor Adams – then a state senator, testified that he had a sit-down with then New York Gov. David Paterson and the NYPD commissioner at the time, Ray Kelly, regarding a stop-and-frisk bill.\n\nAdams testified that Kelly said the policy targeted Blacks and Hispanics disproportionately, “because he wanted to instill fear in them, every time they leave their home, they could be stopped by police,” according to court records. Kelly denied that assertion.\n\n“I think this time around, we really need to learn from the lessons of the past and make sure that there is going to be real accountability and oversight for these officers. And frankly, any officers in the police department,” Charney said.\n\nGiacalone said Adams’ first test will come with the unit’s first high-profile use of force.\n\n“When something goes bad, and always something will happen … whether a situation goes sideways, or there’s a questionable shooting, going after people with guns and violent crimes, things will happen. Does Adams have the stomach to deal with what comes next? That’s the whole thing.”", "authors": ["Mark Morales Peter Nickeas", "Mark Morales", "Peter Nickeas"], "publish_date": "2022/01/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/china/china-2022-zero-covid-intl-hnk-mic/index.html", "title": "China zero-Covid policy: How did it all go so wrong for Xi Jinping ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\n2022 was supposed to be a triumphant year for China and its leader Xi Jinping, as he began his second decade in power with a pledge to restore the nation to greatness.\n\nInstead, China had its most difficult year under Xi’s rule as it reeled from his costly zero-Covid policy – from months of overzealous enforcement that crushed the economy and stoked historic public discontent, to a wholesale abandonment so abrupt that left a fragile health system scrambling to cope with an explosion of cases.\n\nThe chaos and disarray is a stark contrast to the start of the year, when Beijing showcased the success of its Covid containment measures by keeping the coronavirus largely at bay from the Winter Olympics.\n\nOver the span of a year, Xi’s hallmark pandemic policy has turned from a source of legitimacy for the ruling Communist Party into a spiraling crisis that threatens to undermine it.\n\nAs an unprecedented wave of infections – and deaths – sweeps the country, many have questioned why after sacrificing so much under zero-Covid and waiting for so long to reopen, the government ultimately let the virus rip through a population with little prior warning or preparation.\n\nAs 2022 draws to a close, CNN looks back at five key events of the year for China’s zero-Covid policy.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China's reported less Covid deaths since scrapping zero-Covid. CNN is seeing a different story 03:06 - Source: CNN\n\nBeijing Winter Olympics\n\nThe Games proved to be a resounding success for China’s zero-Covid strategy.\n\nIn its tightly sealed, meticulously managed Olympic bubble, the ubiquitous face masks, endless spraying of disinfectant and rigorous daily testing paid-off. Any infected visitors arriving in the country were swiftly identified and their cases contained, allowing the Winter Olympics to run largely free of Covid even as the Omicron variant raged around the world.\n\nThe success added to the party’s narrative that its political system is superior to those of Western democracies in handling the pandemic – a message Xi had repeatedly driven home as he prepared for a third term in power.\n\nIt also boosted China’s confidence that its well-honed zero-Covid playbook of lockdowns, quarantines, mass testing and contact tracing could build an effective defense against highly transmissible Omicron and contain its spread. In the lead-up to the Games, these measures worked in January to tame the country’s first Omicron outbreak in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing.\n\nBeijing kept the Winter Olympcis largely free of Covid inside a strictly managed bubble. Thomas Peter/reuters\n\nShanghai lockdown\n\nBut it didn’t take long for Omicron to seep through the cracks of zero-Covid. By mid-March, China was battling its worst Covid outbreak since the initial wave of the pandemic, reporting thousands of new cases a day, from northern Jilin province to Guangdong in the south.\n\nThe financial hub of Shanghai soon became the epicenter. Local officials initially denied a citywide lockdown was necessary, but then imposed one after the city reported 3,500 daily infections.\n\nThe two-month lockdown became a glaring symbol of the economic and social costs of zero-Covid. In the country’s wealthiest and most glamorous city, residents were subject to widespread food shortages, lack of emergency medical care, spartan makeshift isolation facilities and forced disinfection of their homes. The draconian measures triggered wave after wave of outcry, severely eroding public trust in the Shanghai government.\n\nThe lockdown also wracked havoc on the economy. China’s GDP shrunk by 2.6% in the three months ending in June, while youth unemployment hit a record high of nearly 20%.\n\nBut the costly lockdown did not prod China to shift away from its zero-tolerance approach. Rather, officials hailed it as a victory in the war against Covid. Other local governments came away with the lesson that they must curb infections at all cost, before outbreaks spiraled out of control.\n\nCovid workers disinfect a residential community under lockdown in Shanghai in April. VCG/Visual China Group/Getty Images\n\nParty Congress\n\nAs the party’s all-important national congress approached, the pressure only grew.\n\nHaving tied himself so closely to zero-Covid, Xi was stuck in a trap of his own making. He couldn’t afford to move away from it, the potential surge of infections and deaths posing too great a risk to his authority before he secured his norm-shattering third term at the congress.\n\nAnd so instead of vaccinating the elderly and bolstering ICU capacity, authorities wasted the next crucial months building larger quarantine facilities, rolling out more frequent mass testing, and imposing wider lockdowns that at one point affected more than 300 million people.\n\nBut even the most stringent measures failed to tame Omicron’s spread. By October, China was reporting thousands of daily infections again. Amid mounting public frustration, the People’s Daily, the party’s main mouthpiece, insisted zero-Covid is “sustainable” and the country’s “best choice.”\n\nAt the opening of the congress, Xi gave a sweeping endorsement of his Covid policy, saying it had “prioritized the people and their lives above all else.” He scored a big political victory, securing a third term and stacking the party’s top ranks with staunch allies – including those who had loyally carried out his Covid policies.\n\nOfficials took the hint and became ever more zealous in enforcing zero-Covid, dashing hopes that the country could open up after the congress.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping emerges from the 20th Party Congress with more power than ever. Tingshu Wang/Reuters\n\nNationwide protests\n\nAs restrictions tightened, more suffering and tragedy emerged from the unrelenting lockdowns.\n\nMigrant workers abandoned a locked-down Foxconn factory en masse, walking for miles to escape an outbreak at China’s largest iPhone assembling site. A 3-year-old boy died of gas poisoning in lockdown after he was blocked from being taken promptly to a hospital. A 4-month-old girl died in hotel quarantine after a 12-hour delay in medical care.\n\nThen, in late November, a deadly apartment fire in the western city of Urumqi finally ignited public anger that had been simmering for months. Many believed lockdown measures had hampered rescue efforts, despite official denials.\n\nProtests erupted across the country, on a scale unseen in decades. On university campuses and the streets of major cities, crowds gathered to call for an end to incessant Covid tests and lockdowns, with some decrying censorship and demanding greater political freedoms.\n\nIn Shanghai, protesters even demanded that Xi step down – an unimaginable act of political defiance toward the country’s most powerful and authoritarian leader in decades.\n\nThe nationwide demonstrations posed an unprecedented challenge to Xi. By then, Omicron had seemingly spun out of control, with the country logging a daily record of more than 40,000 infections, and the economic strain becoming too severe, with local governments running out of cash to pay huge lockdown bills.\n\nProtesters march down the streets of Beijing to call for an end to zero-Covid on November 28. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHaphazard reopening\n\nIn an apparent effort to appease protesters, some cities began to loosen restrictions.\n\nThen, on December 7, the central government announced a drastic overhaul of approach, rolling back lockdowns, testing and allowing residents to isolate at home – effectively abandoning zero-Covid.\n\nState media and health officials have since flipped from preaching the dangers of the virus to downplaying its threat.\n\nWhile the easing of stifling restrictions is a long-awaited relief for many, the abruptness and haphazardness of it has caught an unprepared public off guard and left them to fend for themselves.\n\nOver-the-counter cold and fever medicines – which had been restricted from purchase under zero-Covid – sold out instantly at pharmacies and on online shopping sites. Huge lines have formed outside fever clinics and hospital emergency rooms overflow with patients, many elderly. Crematoriums are struggling to keep up with an influx of bodies.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN report: The world's harshest quarantine is no more 03:43 - Source: CNN\n\nAmid the chaos, the government has stopped reporting the bulk of the country’s Covid infections and narrowed its criteria of counting Covid deaths in a way that the World Health Organization warned would “very much underestimate the true death toll.”\n\nWhile that move has taken the public’s panic into consideration, the political undertones are also hard to miss.\n\nFor nearly three years, China’s low Covid caseload and death count compared with countries like the United States had been held up as a measure of the party’s merit and legitimacy.\n\nNow, the true scale of the outbreak and deaths could deal a serious blow to the credibility of a government that had justified years of painful restrictions on the grounds that they were necessary to save lives.\n\nSome studies have estimated China’s abrupt and under-prepared reopening could lead to nearly a million deaths – close to the Covid death toll of the US.\n\nAs China enters its third – and darkest – pandemic winter, zero-Covid is finally dead, but the fallout from its demise will haunt the country into the next year.", "authors": ["Nectar Gan"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/05/super-tuesday-2024-live-results-updates/72839863007/", "title": "Super Tuesday recap: Trump, Biden pick up big wins; Haley set to ...", "text": "Nikki Haley will drop out of the 2024 presidential race after voters across the country made their voices heard on Super Tuesday.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump defeated Haley, the former South Carolina Governor, in more than a dozen states, taking his most significant step yet towards the 2024 Republican nomination.

Former President Barack Obama carried the state in 2008, but North Carolina has gone for Republican presidential candidates ever since.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nAre Massachusetts Democrats showing out for Haley?\n\nMore than 15,000 Massachusetts Democrats switched their party affiliation to either unenrolled or Republican ahead of Tuesday’s primary, in a potential boon to Nikki Haley’s campaign .\n\n“It seems to be because a lot of these Democratic voters were trying to figure out how to vote for Nikki Haley in the in the Republican primary,” said Debra O’Malley, communications director for the Massachusetts Secretary of State’s office.\n\nWhile polls have showed Haley trailing Trump in Massachusetts, her campaign views the state as potentially winnable because of its large independent voting bloc.

The president has 206 delegates ahead of Tuesday polls closing.\n\nAmong Biden’s Democratic challengers are Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn. The multimillionaire launched his presidential bid in October attempting to pull moderate and liberal voters with disapproval for the president. Last month, Phillips announced major layoffs at his campaign staff citing a lack of funds but has persisted in his long-shot battle.\n\nAnother opponent is author Marianne Williamson, who announced her run for presidency in February 2023. Williamson’s campaign focused on forgiving student debt and confronting the climate crisis.\n\nThe “Peace Alliance” founder rejoined the race on Wednesday after she announced plans to suspend her campaign last month. Williamson said she rethought her decision after questioning Biden’s ability to beat Trump in the general election calling the former president a “fascist standing at the door.”\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nJoe Biden racks up Vermont’s delegates\n\nJoe Biden won Vermont’s primary on Tuesday night defeating his Democratic challengers including Rep.

They pledged not to let it happen again and revamped their campaign strategy to engage voters year-round.\n\nThey have swept the last three elections, including flipping the state for Biden in 2020. But it remains to be seen whether the strategy will work again this fall: Trump is ahead in recent state polls.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden declared victory in Virginia primary\n\nJoe Biden has won the Democratic primary in Virginia, racking up delegates in the state that borders the nation’s capital.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow many delegates does Joe Biden have?\n\nJoe Biden heads into Super Tuesday as the clear frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nBiden has 206 delegates headed into Super Tuesday, with a whopping 1,420 Democratic delegates up for grabs across tonight's elections. He also officially won Iowa's Democratic Caucuses on Thursday.\n\nBiden needs to secure 1,968 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n− Cy Neff\n\nAlabama voters head to the polls two weeks after IVF ruling\n\nAs Alabama voters head to the polls, the repercussions of the state's Supreme Court decision are reverberating across the country. Two weeks ago, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos used in in vitro fertilization are considered children and are entitled to protections under the state’s wrongful death laws.\n\nThe blowback was immediate: The decision kicked off a frenzy among patients and doctors grappling with its implications for people attempting to conceive, often after years of struggling to have children or other complications in family planning. Democrats immediately began messaging on the ruling as further evidence of a GOP-led effort to restrict reproductive rights.\n\nThe Senate Republican campaign arm urged Senate candidates to \"clearly and concisely reject efforts by the government\" to restrict IVF. Candidates followed suit, as did most Republican lawmakers in Congress.\n\nBut when Democrats in the Senate put them to the test by asking them to greenlight a bill that would protect IVF at the federal level, many Republican senators said it’s an issue best left up to the states.− Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden wins Iowa's Democratic Caucus\n\nJoe Biden won Iowa's Democratic caucus, clinching a quick victory to kick off Super Tuesday's results.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nChris Christie, Ryan Binkley, Asa Hutchinson: Which candidates have dropped out of the 2024 race?\n\nOn the Republican side, Florida Gov.

Doug Burgum have dropped out of the presidential election.\n\nDonald Trump and Nikki Haley are still competing against each other for the Republican nomination\n\nOn the Democratic side, President Joe Biden, Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and author Marianne Williamson (who suspended and later unsuspended her campaign) are running.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Michelle Obama run for president?\n\nThe office of former first lady Michelle Obama has made it clear that she won't be throwing her hat in the 2024 race for the White House.\n\n“As former First Lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president,” Crystal Carson, director of communications for Obama's office, told NBC News in a statement. “Mrs. Obama supports President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ re-election campaign.”\n\nPolitical observers for years have noted that the former first lady is a popular political figure who could bring voters together on the left and right. But she has repeatedly denied that she wants to run for national office.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen do polls close on Super Tuesday?\n\nHere's a look at when polls will close states across the country holding elections on Super Tuesday.

As for voters who submitted their ballots by mail, roughly 19,000 ballots have been counted across North Carolina.\n\nWhile 49,000 mail-in ballots were requested, Bell said the actual number of submitted mail-in ballots can change if voters decide to vote in person on election day.\n\n— Molly Wilhelm, Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSuper Tuesday critique: Donald Trump attacks Fox commentators ahead of election night\n\nTrump took some time off from Super Tuesday preparation to criticize a pair of Fox News commentators.\n\nHard to say what exactly set off Trump, but he claimed on his Truth Social platform that Marc Thiessen \"was wrong about me in 2016, and in 2020 I got more votes than any sitting President in history.\"\n\nTrump, who otherwise used Truth Social to endorse other Republican candidates running on Super Tuesday, also looped former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove into his media critique.\n\n\"Put on people who understand what is going on in politics,\" Trump said. \"And while you’re at it, GET RID OF KARL ROVE!!!\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nFact checking campaign ads for you\n\nCampaign ads have flooded social media leading up to Super Tuesday as the remaining presidential candidates attempt to win over primary voters in 15 states and one territory.\n\nThese ads have spread widely – to more than a million screens in some cases – but many include false or misleading descriptions of past actions and policy proposals. Here’s a rundown of recent ads debunked by the USA TODAY Fact-Check Team:\n\n– Eric Litke\n\nWhen will Super Tuesday results come in?\n\nIt depends on the state. Most polls are closing by 8 p.m. local time, but states across time zones are holding elections on Tuesday, from Maine to Alaska and California.\n\nCheck back here as the USA TODAY Network keeps you updated on races across the country.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow many delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday?\n\nThere are 865 Republican delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday and 1,420 Democratic delegates.\n\nThe Trump campaign suggested in a memo last month that the former president will likely lock in the nomination on March 12, just one week after Super Tuesday, with 1,223 delegates. In a worst case scenario, the campaign estimates he will become the designated nominee no later than March 19.\n\nA candidate must secure the majority of delegates, 1,215, to secure the Republican nomination.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWill new election laws impact the outcome in North Carolina's primary?\n\nA trove of new election laws – including a ban on ballot drop boxes, new limits for mail-in ballot returns and required proof of voter ID at polls – will be tested in North Carolina on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe key swing state’s legislature was one of 14 states that passed additional restrictions last year. Some experts and advocates fear the laws could impact turnout on Super Tuesday, a test for the November general election.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Chris Kenning\n\nHow many states vote on Super Tuesday?\n\nThe states holding primary elections on March 5 include: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nOne territory, American Samoa, will also hold a primary election.\n\nIowa's Democratic Party will also release the results of its mail-in voting on Super Tuesday.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nCalifornia Senate race: Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff and other Democrats compete\n\nTuesday will also determine which two candidates in the heated California Senate race will advance to the general election. California has a top-two primary system, meaning the two candidates who receive the most votes, regardless of party affiliation, will land on the ballot in November.\n\nWhile Californians will choose from 27 candidates on Tuesday, the likely frontrunners are among three Democrats – California Reps. Adam Schiff, Katie Porter and Barbara Lee – and one Republican, Steve Garvey, a former baseball player for the Los Angeles Dodgers. The candidates are running to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who died last year.\n\nPolling from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, last week found Garvey in a two-point lead over Schiff coming in at 27%. Schiff polled at 25% followed by Porter and Lee.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nSome states hold primaries, while others opt for a caucus. While a primary election is run by state and local governments, a caucus is run by political parties. A traditional primary election resembles the general election, with voting taking place via private ballot.\n\nA caucus, however, involves voters dividing themselves into groups based on the candidate they prefer, and arguing for others to join them. At the end of the caucus, the number of members in each group determines how many delegates that candidate gets.\n\nUp for grabs in each caucus and primary is a certain number of delegates. The delegates are sent to each party's national convention, and the candidate with the majority secures the nomination.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nJoe Biden competes in Super Tuesday ahead of the State of the Union\n\nJoe Biden is competing in more than a dozen Super Tuesday states before he delivers his 2024 State of the Union address to lawmakers and Americans across the country on Thursday.\n\nThe president is expected to address the issues dividing the nation, ranging from inflation to abortion rights and the U.S. southern border. You can read more about the history of the presidential address here.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAlabama voters were sent wrong information ahead of election\n\nA representative from the Montgomery County Board of Registrars confirmed Tuesday that a portion of Montgomery voters got the wrong voting information ahead of the election.\n\nRegistrar Mark Anderson said on Super Tuesday that a mapping issue led to voters in the 2nd Congressional District being told that they were in a different district.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center reported that at least 5,604 voters received information that they were in the 7th Congressional District, instead of the newly established, majority-Black 2nd District. Of the 5,604 voters, 4,513 of them are Black, SPLC reported.\n\nThe SPLC became aware of the issue over the weekend. Some Montgomery County voters received postcards with the incorrect congressional district.\n\n– Alex Gladden\n\nTrump says he’s not worried about raising money for legal cases\n\nIn addition to running a presidential campaign, Trump is spending his recent days trying to figure out how to pay more than $500 million in civil damages for bank fraud and defamation.\n\nIn his Super Tuesday interview on Fox News, Trump said he will be able to raise the money - but he didn’t say how.\n\n“I don’t worry about anything,” Trump said. “No, I don't worry about the money. I don't worry about money.”\n\n-David Jackson\n\nWhat states did Trump, Biden win on previous Super Tuesdays?\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, 14 states held primaries on Super Tuesday.\n\nTrump, the incumbent nominee running for his second term, carried all 13 of the Super Tuesday states (Virginia cancelled its GOP primary). Biden won by slightly smaller margins, winning delegates in 11 states with four going to then-candidate Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nWhen Trump launched his first presidential campaign in 2016, 11 states held primaries on Super Tuesday. The former president competed in a crowded field of Republicans but ultimately won in seven of the eleven states. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was declared the winner in three states and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio won one state.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWill Nikki Haley suspend her campaign?\n\nThe former South Carolina governor has repeatedly said she has no plans to drop out of the 2024 race for the White House. But Tuesday has the potential to deliver one of the heaviest blows to her campaign, and speculation has grown about her next steps.\n\nWould she join the long list of Republicans who have dropped out of the race and backed Trump as nominee? Or will Haley, seen by many as a moderate alternative to a Biden-Trump rematch, launch a third-party run?\n\nHaley continued to dodge the first question, defiantly telling Fox News Monday afternoon that they should ask Trump whether he would support another Republican nominee instead.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhat will Donald Trump do after Super Tuesday?\n\nSince announcing his campaign in 2022, the former president has looked like a shoo-in for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAnd while Super Tuesday can’t clinch the spot for him – a nominee needs 1,215 delegates, and Trump will still be a handful short even if he sweeps the country – Tuesday could very well boost him closer to the finish line.\n\nBut despite his popularity with his conservative base, Trump would also likely need to tap into support from moderates and independents in a general election. Trump appeared to be starting that shift after his first primary election victory in January’s Iowa Caucuses.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nFacebook down on Super Tuesday\n\nFacebook users may have encountered the social media site not working properly on the morning of Super Tuesday.\n\nAround 9 a.m. ET, hundreds of thousands of users reported Facebook being down during one of the biggest election days of the year, according to Downdetector.\n\nMany users were reporting being logged out of Facebook accounts with no ability to log back in. It's unclear when Facebook will be back online for some users as polls begin opening for primary voters.\n\n-- Jonathan Limehouse\n\nStein: ‘Grab your photo ID’ North Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein had some sage advice for voters flocking to the polls on Tuesday: bring a photo ID card.\n\nThat’s because the swing state has a litany of new laws that will be tested for the first time on Super Tuesday as Tar Heel State voters make a choice in one of the most closely watched gubernatorial contests this year.\n\nAmong them is a 2018 voter identification law that had been delayed by lawsuits. Another rule change also required mail-in ballots to include a copy of the voter’s photo ID.\n\nIn 2023, Republican state legislators went further by establishing a rule that any mail-in ballot received after the election wouldn’t be counted which Democratic opponents slammed because it kills the previous three-day grace period that allowed ballots to be counted as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.\n\nVoting rights groups have warned such laws will be hard to navigate for some, and they are keeping an eye out for trouble.\n\nStein, who is favored to win the Democratic nomination for governor, has spoken against the new laws and resisted them in his capacity as attorney general. He is likely to face Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who has spoken in favor of such laws as needed to protect election integrity.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhat to watch in North Carolina’s governor’s race\n\nNorth Carolina will serve as the battleground for a marquee gubernatorial race: a likely faceoff between a Southern Democrat and a GOP candidate who is popular with Donald Trump's base.\n\nAs millions are flocking to the polls for Super Tuesday, primary voters in North Carolina have a sharp contrast in the two party's leading contenders to fill Cooper's seat: Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein and Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson.\n\nOnce a reliable Republican stronghold − long associated with the southern fried conservatism of the late Sen. Jesse Helms − the Tar Heel State has become more competitive largely because of diverse population growth.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar and Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNorth Carolina primary to set the stage for 2024 battleground\n\nPresidential candidates have been focusing their attention on North Carolina in the leadup to Super Tuesday, setting the groundwork for what analysts expect will be a hyper-competitive general election matchup.\n\nNorth Carolina hasn’t voted for a Democratic president since Barack Obama flipped the state in 2008. But it represented Donald Trump’s narrowest margin of victory in the 2020 election when he won it by just 1.34 percentage points over Joe Biden.\n\nBiden’s campaign is already setting its sights on an expected rematch, earlier this year installing a team of campaign staffers on the ground and committing Biden and other surrogates to appearing in the state.\n\nDemocrats dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to Durham ahead of Super Tuesday to announce a $32 million investment from the American Rescue Plan Act, and Biden was in the state in January announcing a major investment in broadband internet infrastructure.\n\nOn the Republican side, Trump campaigned in Greensboro March 2 while his primary competitor Nikki Haley rallied supporters in Charlotte and Raleigh.\n\nPolling places are open in North Carolina until 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\n—Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nWhy is today called Super Tuesday?\n\nSuper Tuesday is the primary election day that decides the bulk of delegates for candidates in their respective parties.\n\nThe name “Super Tuesday” historical has been used to reference primary days when a significant number of states hold their primary elections, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nIn 1984, the modern \"Super Tuesday\" began when March became the month to “frontload” the primaries.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDonald Trump to hold rally Saturday in Georgia\n\nThe Trump campaign is starting to outline its post-Super Tuesday schedule, and it includes a weekend rally in a politically and legally significant state: Georgia.\n\nThe Saturday event takes place in Rome, Ga.\n\nTrump held a similar rally in nearby Dalton, Ga., on Jan. 4, 2021 - two days before the attempted insurrection by Trump supporters that tried to block Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote that elected Biden.\n\nUsing that rally in part to protest the 2020 election, Trump basically urged Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans to toss Biden electoral votes and re-elect him instead.\n\n\"People will remember the people who don’t support us,\" Trump said on that occasion.\n\nTrump now faces criminal trials in Georgia and in Washington, D.C., over efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nIowa Poll: Trump dominates Biden in 2024 lead-up\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump would nearly double his margin of victory in Iowa over incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden if a rematch of their 2020 contest were held now, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nIn an early test of the expected matchup, Trump leads Biden by 15 percentage points among likely voters, 48% to 33%. Another 15% of poll respondents would vote for “someone else,” 1% would not vote and 2% are not sure.\n\nIn 2020, Trump defeated Biden in Iowa by about 8 percentage points.\n\n- Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nWhat states are involved on Super Tuesday?\n\nThe states holding primary elections on Tuesday include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nOne territory, American Samoa, will also hold a primary election.\n\nIowa's Democratic Party will also release the results of its mail-in voting on March 5.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump calls for Republican unity - while blasting Haley\n\nTrump began his Super Tuesday with a phone interview on Fox News and predicted Republican unity in the fall election - though he had few good things to say about Haley and her supporters.\n\n\"There's no path for her to win,\" Trump said on \"Fox & Friends,\" adding that her continuing candidacy is only \"hurting the Republican Party.\"\n\nStill, Trump said that \"our party has to come together because we have to beat the Democrats.\"\n\nAccording to exit polls, many Haley supporters say they will not back Trump in the general election; that could create a drag that will undercut Trump's chances of defeating Biden.\n\n--David Jackson\n\nTaylor Swift encourages fans to vote on Super Tuesday\n\nTaylor Swift encouraged fans to vote on Super Tuesday but did not make a presidential endorsement.\n\n\"Today, March 5, is the Presidential Primary in Tennessee and 16 other states and territories,\" Swift wrote in her Instagram story. \"I wanted to remind you guys to vote the people who most represent YOU into power. If you haven't already, make a plan to vote today.\"\n\n\"Whether you're in Tennessee or somewhere else in the US,\" Swift continued, \"check your polling places and times at vote.org.\"\n\n- Bryan West\n\nDo Democrats vote on Super Tuesday?\n\nYes – Democrats also vote on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe Democratic primary is not as consequential as the Republican primary because President Joe Biden is the incumbent candidate running for his second term and the likely Democratic nominee for the party in a much less contentious race for the nomination.\n\nWhile Biden does face two Democratic challengers – Dean Phillips and Marianne WIlliamson – both have yet to receive any delegates during state primaries held previously. Biden has 206 delegates prior to Super Tuesday polls closing.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat races are at stake on Super Tuesday – other than the presidential election?\n\nIt’s not just the presidential primaries that matter on Super Tuesday. Other competitive election are slated to happen in the states voting on March 5.\n\nCalifornia, for instance, is seeing a fierce intra-party primary battle between three major Democrats for a solidly blue open Senate seat in the liberal state. California voters will also consider a ballot measure known as Proposition 1, which would address the state's mental health system and homelessness crisis.\n\nNorth Carolinians will also vote in a gubernatorial primary on Tuesday, setting up what's expected to be a high-pressure race in the fall. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein has emerged as the Democratic frontrunner, while North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is expected to lead Republicans.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCandidates need to reach 1,968 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, 1,420 delegates are up for grabs, nearly three quarters of the delegates needed to become the party nominee.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhich Super Tuesday states have open primaries?\n\nMost primaries fall into one of five categories: closed, partially closed, open to unaffiliated voters, partially open and open, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. The critical distinction among the categories is whether voters who are not registered party members can participate in a party’s primary.\n\nOpen primaries allow voters to choose which party’s ballot to vote without having to disclose or register with that respective party. This gives voters the opportunity to vote across party lines. Six Super Tuesday states will hold open primaries: Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Texas, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nFive other states - Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Tennessee – will be open to unaffiliated voters on Super Tuesday, meaning voters who are not registered to a specific party can participate in a party’s primary of their choosing.\n\n- Kathryn Palmer and Rachel Looker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/africa/953606/why-tunisia-president-sacked-prime-minister", "title": "Why has Tunisia's president sacked the prime minister? | The Week", "text": "Tunisia’s president has sacked the country’s prime minister and suspended parliament after violent mass protests broke out yesterday.\n\nDemonstrators took to the streets after “anger over the government’s handling of a massive recent spike in Covid cases” compounded “general unrest over the nation’s economic and social turmoil”, the BBC reports.\n\nSunday saw thousands of people take to the streets in protest against Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, prompting President Kais Saied, who was elected in 2019, to announce that he was taking over.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Last week, Mechichi also sacked the country’s health minister amid a slow vaccination rollout.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFollowing Saied’s announcement that he was sacking Mechichi – an independent politician with no party affiliation – and freezing parliament, supporters took to the streets in celebration with “cheering and honking car horns” recalling the scenes that started the revolution which “triggered the Arab Spring protests across the Middle East”, the broadcaster adds.\n\nHowever, “opponents in parliament immediately accused him of staging a coup”, the BBC says, and security forces “blocked off parliament and streets around the central Avenue Bourguiba” as protesters stormed the offices of Tunisia’s largest political party, Ennahda, “smashing computers and setting fire to its local headquarters in Touzeur”.\n\n‘Save the state’\n\nIn a televised address, Saied said that he had taken the decision to sack Mechichi in order to ensure “social peace returns to Tunisia” and to “save the state”.\n\nSaied, who later joined celebrations on the streets of the capital Tunis, continued that he would respond to any unrest with force, adding: “I warn any who think of resorting to weapons… and whoever shoots a bullet, the armed forces will respond with bullets.”\n\nThe “extent of support” for the move is “not clear”, Sky News says, with Ennahda’s leader, Rached Ghannouchi, calling for Tunisians to take to the streets to end what he described as “a coup against the revolution and constitution”. In a phone call with Reuters, Ghannouchi said: “We consider the institutions still standing, and the supporters of the Ennahda and the Tunisian people will defend the revolution.”\n\nFormer president Moncef Marzouki also described the move as a coup, adding: “I ask the Tunisian people to pay attention to the fact that they imagine this to be the beginning of the solution. It is the beginning of slipping into an even worse situation.”\n\nSaied’s decision to take executive action has triggered “one of Tunisia’s biggest political crises since the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy”, Al Jazeera says, with ongoing anger over “accusations of police violence and the devastation the Covid pandemic” putting “an already weak economy” under further strain.\n\nWhat next?\n\nGhannouchi was yesterday barred from entering the parliamentary building in Tunis when “the army surrounded parliament”, The Guardian reports.\n\n“Dozens of Ennahda supporters” also “faced off against Saied supporters” near the site, the paper adds, with televised images showing the two groups “exchanging insults as the police held them apart”.\n\nUnder the Tunisian constitution “the president oversees only the military and foreign affairs”, the BBC says. However, Saied has now said that he will “govern alongside a new prime minister, with parliament suspended for 30 days”.\n\n“The president cited Article 80 of the constitution for his actions”, arguing that it allows him to suspend parliament if it was in “imminent danger”, the broadcaster adds. “The 2014 constitution calls for a special court to be set up to decide disputes like this, but it has not been established.”\n\nSaied was elected on a pledge to “overhaul a complex political system plagued by corruption”, The Guardian says. The country’s last election, however, “delivered a fragmented chamber in which no party held more than a quarter of seats”.\n\nA decade on from the revolution that overthrew dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia is still racked by “crumbling public services” and a “fractious political class” that “has been unable to form lasting, effective governments”, the paper adds.\n\nSaied has also repeatedly clashed with Mechichi, amid accusations that the president has “blocked ministerial appointments and diverted resources from efforts to tackle Tunisia's economic crisis”, The Telegraph says.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Anya Jaremko-Greenwold", "Rafi Schwartz", "Arion Mcnicoll", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Harriet Marsden", "Peter Weber"], "publish_date": "2021/07/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/11/11/hong-kong-police-shoot-protester-man-set-fire/2560215001/", "title": "Hong Kong police shoot protester, man set on fire", "text": "HONG KONG – A Hong Kong anti-government protester was shot by police Monday in a dramatic scene caught on video as demonstrators blocked train lines and roads in a day of spiraling violence fueled by demands for democratic reforms.\n\nElsewhere, a man was set on fire following an apparent dispute over national identity in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, which has been wracked by five months of protests. The man was in critical condition in a city hospital.\n\nThe violence is likely to further inflame passions in Hong Kong after a student who fell during an earlier protest succumbed to his injuries Friday and police arrested six pro-democracy lawmakers over the weekend.\n\nMonday’s video shows a police officer shooing away a group of protesters at an intersection, then drawing his gun on a masked protester in a white hooded sweatshirt who approaches him.\n\nAs the two struggle, another protester in black approaches, and the officer points his gun at the second one. He then fires at the stomach area of the second protester, who falls to the ground.

A spokeswoman for the Hong Kong hospital authority said the person shot was in critical condition but gave no further details.\n\nThe incident marked the second time a protester has been shot since the demonstrations began in early June, although police have repeatedly drawn their firearms to ward off attacks. More than 3,300 people have been arrested in the protests.\n\nFew details were available about the burning incident in the Ma On Shan neighborhood. Video posted online shows the victim arguing with a group of young people before someone douses him with a liquid and strikes a lighter.\n\nPolice fired tear gas and deployed a water cannon in various parts of the city on Monday and charged onto the campus of Chinese University, where students were protesting. Video posted online also showed a policeman on a motorcycle riding through a group of protesters in an apparent attempt to disperse them.\n\nPolice spokesman Tse Chun-chung said the shooting, burning and motorcycle incidents were all under investigation, but defended the officers’ actions as necessary to safeguard their own safety. Tse said two people were arrested in the shooting incident, including the person shot, but no one has yet been detained over the burning.\n\nProtesters built barricades and blocked roads at about 120 locations across the city of 7.4 million and demonstrations were still ongoing, Tse said.\n\n“Continuing this rampage is a lose-lose situation for Hong Kong. Everyone is a loser,” Tse said.\n\nRail service was partly suspended because of fires and obstacles on the tracks and windows smashed at a branch of the state-owned Bank of China. Large parts of the downtown business district were closed to traffic as protesters surrounded by onlookers engaged in a standoff with police.\n\nThe protests began over a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for greater democracy and police accountability. Activists say Hong Kong’s autonomy and Western-style civil liberties, promised when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997, are eroding.\n\nThe video of Monday’s shooting was posted on Facebook by Cupid Producer, an outlet that started last year and appears to post mostly live videos related to local news.\n\nThe shooting occurred in a crosswalk at a large intersection strewn with debris that had backed-up traffic in Sai Wan Ho, a neighborhood on the eastern part of Hong Kong Island.\n\nProtesters blocked intersections around the city and disrupted subway and commuter rail service. The rail operator, MTR, suspended service on several lines, and public broadcaster RTHK reported that a fire had been set inside a train at Kwai Fong station.\n\nIn a news release, the Hong Kong government said police had been responding to vandalism and disruptions to traffic, including protesters throwing heavy objects onto roads from above.\n\n“During police operations, one police officer has discharged his service revolver, one male was shot,” the release said, adding that officers also drew their guns in the Shatin and Tung Chung neighborhoods.\n\nThe release denied what it called online rumors saying police had been ordered to “recklessly use their firearms,” calling the allegation “totally false and malicious”\n\n“All police officers are required to justify their enforcement actions,” the statement said.\n\nA patch of what looked like dried blood could be seen in a cordoned-off area after the shooting, as onlookers shouted insults at the police.\n\nMasked protesters continued to try to block other intersections in the area. Police chased them away with pepper spray, hitting some bystanders as well.\n\nOn Sunday, police fired tear gas and protesters vandalized stores at shopping malls in anti-government demonstrations across Hong Kong. They targeted businesses whose owners are seen as pro-Beijing and also damaged the Sha Tin train station.\n\nPolice said they arrested at least 88 people on various charges, including unlawful assembly, possession of an offensive weapon, criminal damage and wearing masks at an unlawful assembly.\n\nIn a sign of growing frustration on behalf of Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, and her backers in Beijing, the administration on Saturday announced the arrest of six lawmakers on charges of obstructing the local assembly during a raucous May 11 meeting over the extradition bill.

Chris Christie, is mostly dry now except for a few muddy patches.\n\nNow the bad news: Margate’s unwelcome body of water, which residents derisively nicknamed “Lake Christie,” could return any day. It all depends on what storm blows off the Atlantic and whether an elaborate system of pipes and pumps now being installed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers works.\n\nSuperstorm Sandy, which ravaged New Jersey and much of the East Coast five years ago, on Oct. 29, 2012, certainly sounded alarms about the vulnerability of the Jersey Shore to major ocean storms. But on a Friday evening last July, Margate received a warning of another sort when a severe thunderstorm rolled across its beaches.\n\n\"We got a message from God,” said Margate's mayor, Michael Becker, recalling those heavy rains. “It turned us into Lake Christie.”\n\nThere are many ways to examine the aftermath of Sandy, which knocked out power to more than 3 million customers across New Jersey, damaged or destroyed 340,000 homes and racked up $30 billion in losses to businesses. But Margate, a 1.5-square-mile city that sits on the same low-lying barrier island as Atlantic City, offers a unique glimpse into the complicated and sometimes emotional battle over how best to protect beach communities from future storms like Sandy.\n\nThe dispute pits Republicans like Christie, who courted conservative supporters during his failed presidential campaign by openly questioning whether climate change and rising sea levels are a real problem, against the overwhelming majority of climate scientists, who point to increases in ocean and air temperatures — along with the volatility of recent storms like Sandy — as prime reasons to worry about towns like Margate.\n\nAdding to the uneasy mix of politics, science and economics are the millions of federal and state dollars being spent each year along the 127-mile Jersey Shore to fill in eroded beaches, erect dunes and build new drainage systems as part of a 30-year “beach re-nourishment” project to hold back the ocean’s tides and protect the state’s tourism economy.\n\nIn the middle, inevitably, are ordinary people like the 6,400 residents of Margate, who just want to go to the beach and enjoy the sun, surf and sand. In these post-Sandy years, this is not always so easy.\n\nWelcome to the story behind “Lake Christie.”\n\nSUPERSTORM SANDY:5 years later, New Jersey is still storm proofing\n\nMORE FROM MIKE KELLY:North Jersey lawyer at center of the campus rape debate\n\nMORE FROM MIKE KELLY: John Kelly missed his chance to explain the pain of war\n\nAs New Jersey started the long, painful cleanup from Hurricane Sandy in late 2012, Christie ordered shore towns to set aside portions of their beaches for the building of protective dunes. The idea was that surges from storms like Sandy might be held back by mounds of sand, some of them rising as high as 25 feet.\n\nThis was hardly an original concept. State environmental officials — along with scientists who monitor rising sea levels — began encouraging shore towns to build dunes in the 1980s.\n\nSome communities, like Atlantic City, joined the dune plan. Others, like Margate, did not.\n\nBut after Sandy, towns did not have a choice. It was Christie’s orders.\n\nThe fight begins\n\nMargate filed a series of lawsuits in state and federal court to block the mandatory dune plan along its beaches — a strategy followed by other communities along the Jersey Shore.\n\nChristie shot back in his blunt style, accusing towns that opposed his dune plan of being more concerned about the beach views of their wealthy homeowners.\n\nMargate officials say Christie’s criticism was misplaced. Yes, they acknowledge that some residents worried that the dunes would block their views of the Atlantic. But the city, supported by a town-wide nonbinding referendum in 2013 in which 65 percent of voters opposed the dunes, offered another, far-more-nuanced reason for pushing back against the governor.\n\nIt turns out Margate already had a protective concrete-and-wood bulkhead where the beach meets its residential blocks. Margate was one of the few Jersey Shore communities to invest in a town-wide bulkhead beginning in the 1940s. As part of its construction, Margate designed a drainage system that carries rainwater from its streets to its wide beach, and then into the Atlantic.\n\nIf dunes were built, Margate warned, the rainwater would be blocked and might collect behind the dunes in small lakes. In any event, city officials pointed out that most of town’s damage from Sandy did not come from the Atlantic’s tides but from rising water in the bay.\n\nFederal and state judges sided with Christie and ruled that the dunes had to be constructed in Margate.\n\nSo last summer, bulldozers and backhoes from a New Jersey firm hired by the Army Corps of Engineers began pushing sand into long mounds on Margate’s beach.\n\nBut the Corps’ engineers miscalculated. By placing the dunes in the middle of Margate’s beach, they left a stretch of sand — in some places 100 feet wide — between the dunes and the town’s seawall bulkhead.\n\nMargate officials say they again warned the engineers that the dunes would block the flow of water toward the beach from the city's existing drainage system, causing unsightly ponds to form.\n\nOnce again, city officials said, the Corps ignored the town’s warnings.\n\nIn late July, a thunderstorm blew in, dropping more than 3 inches of rain — much of which drained into that sandy space between the seawall and the dunes.\n\n\"Lake Christie,\" as it came to be known, was born.\n\nChuck Cavanaugh, 55, a commercial airline pilot, remembers trying to walk to the beach for a swim the next morning.\n\n“I was staring at 3 feet of water,” he recalled.\n\nCavanaugh waded through the water to get to the beach and the ocean surf, figuring the “lake” might drain away.\n\nIt didn’t.\n\n“It was heartbreaking,” Cavanaugh said as he stood on the edge of Margate’s beach on a recent afternoon.\n\n“We always say we have the best beach on the East Coast,” he said. “All of a sudden, we had perpetual mucky muddy mess. I was floored.”\n\n'Off-the-charts' bacteria levels\n\nWithin days, the stagnant lake became a home for “off-the-charts” levels of bacteria, according to Mayor Becker. Two lifeguards, who walked through the water on several occasions to get to their beach patrol stations, came down with infections and were placed on sick leave, Becker said.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers tried pumping the water out. But more rains came to fill Lake Christie again.\n\nMargate residents organized a protest. This itself was an unusual occurrence in a mostly quiet, upscale residential community best known as the home of the 136-year-old wood and steel “Lucy the Elephant,” which looms 65 feet above the beach and is considered America’s oldest roadside tourist attraction, and the quaint Marven Gardens neighborhood of Tudor and stucco homes made famous by the Monopoly board game (which misspelled it as “Marvin Gardens”).\n\nOne protestor carried a sign reading, “Drain the Swamp: Locals know Best.” Another placard proclaimed, “Don’t fix what isn’t broken.”\n\nGlenn Klotz, 68, a retired property manager who grew up in Margate — his father, Red, coached the Washington Generals, the hapless team that toured with, and usually lost to, the Harlem Globetrotters — watched the protests that day and wondered if the message was being heard in Trenton or anywhere else.\n\n“They don’t care about home rule,” Klotz said. “The governor made it clear: We’re a bunch of idiots.”\n\nAsked to comment about Margate's dilemma, Christie’s office responded only that the governor \"has been on the record about the importance of protecting the Jersey Shore against future storms.\"\n\nBut the Army Corps of Engineers insists that it wants to fix Margate’s “lake” problem.\n\nSteve Rochette, a Corps spokesman, explained that the unwanted \"ponding\" formed because the summer’s rainwater “didn’t percolate as anticipated.” He added that the Corps now has a new plan that is “mitigating and managing the situation.”\n\n“Sometimes in constructing a project, something doesn’t work as designed,” said another Corps spokesman, Ed Voigt. “So you fix it.”\n\nStewart Farrell, a geologist who runs the Stockton University Coastal Research Center, points out that man-made dunes saved several towns from devastation during Sandy. But building a system of dunes along the entire Jersey Shore — and replenishing the sand after each storm — is a decades-long project that involves mind-boggling amounts of sand.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Farrell said, more than 110 million cubic yards of sand have been dredged from the ocean and dumped onto New Jersey beaches — the equivalent of almost 863,000 tractor-trailer loads of sand. If all those trailers were placed bumper to bumper, they would stretch nearly 8,376 miles, or roughly the distance from Anchorage, Alaska, to Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nAn 'industrialized beach'\n\nIn practical terms, fixing the Margate beach now means that the Corps has set up a series of portable pumping stations — each of them orange and about the size of a small car — that are supposed to suck any new rainwater from the low-lying sand between the dunes and the Margate bulkhead. In the coming months, the Corps plans to install permanent drainage pipes that are supposed to take rainwater from Margate’s streets and the bulkhead and into the ocean.\n\nDan Gottlieb, a leader of Margate’s anti-dune coalition, said the Corps’ configuration of pipes and pumps has forced his town “to industrialize our beach.”\n\n“They came to fix a problem we never had and created one that we never had,” Gottlieb said of the Corps’ plan.\n\nOn a recent morning, Anne and Frank Murphy strolled from their homes near Margate’s Marven Gardens section and stopped to gaze at the series of new portable pumps.\n\n“I think Christie just wanted to stick it to us,” said Anne, 64, a former Ramsey resident and a retired office manager who moved to Margate when she married Frank several years ago.\n\nFrank, 65, a retired salesman, nodded.\n\n“We love it here,” he said, adding that Sandy left him with a renewed respect for the raw and unpredictable power of Mother Nature.\n\n“The ocean is going to take what it wants to take,” Frank said. “It’s more powerful than anything. If the ocean wants to take our beach, it will.”\n\nEmail: kellym@northjersey.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/04/ohio-9th-congressional-district-primary-creates-chaos-for-republicans/72683179007/", "title": "Ohio 9th Congressional District primary creates chaos for Republicans", "text": "The longest-serving woman in Congress has represented northwest Ohio for over 40 years.\n\nRepublicans say it's time for Rep.

But first...\n\nAfter a Memphis police officer shot him in the back last year as he fled a traffic stop, a recovering Martavious Banks now faces a list of charges, our Phillip Jackson reports.\n\nPhillip had the latest in an article posted this morning:\n\nMartavious Banks, 25, was indicted on evading arrest, reckless driving, unlawful possession of a weapon, and driving without a license, which were in violation of his parole, according to the Shelby County Courts system. Banks was shot and critically injured by a Memphis police officer on a Monday night on Sept. 17 during a traffic stop in South Memphis at 1258 Gill Ave. as he was entering into a home nearby.\n\nAs a refresher, the officer accused of shooting Banks, 26-year-old Jamarcus Jeames, did not have his body camera operating during the incident. Two other officers involved, Christopher Nowell and Michael Williams II, were suspended for not having their body cameras on, and another officer, Lt. Charles Mowery, was reprimanded for not having his camera on when he arrived on the scene after the shooting.\n\nHere's the statement from Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich:\n\nAfter reviewing the investigative file and all of the evidence available to us, I asked the TBI to seek an indictment against Martavious Banks. I have not requested and will not request criminal charges against any police officers involved in the incident. There is no evidence of any criminal conduct on the part of these officers.\n\nSHELBY COUNTY DA:No charges against Memphis police officers involved in Martavious Banks shooting\n\nOther than the gun charge, the indictment was...underwhelming — which could again raise questions about whether police should be conducting these \"routine\" traffic stops. But the indictment is also raising concerns for some people that Weirich is targeting the wrong people for prosecution — a point Shelby County commissioner, activist and mayoral candidate Tami Sawyer made yesterday:\n\nComing during a national conversation about the shooting of unarmed black men, the shooting has sparked protests and calls to hold police accountable. But the public has yet to see the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report on the shooting, so many of the details remain unclear or are contested — like whether Banks had a gun at all.\n\nI'll continue withholding judgment on the case until we hear all of the evidence, but here's what Banks' attorney, Arthur Horne, told Phillip about the alleged gun:\n\n\"During the course of our investigation, it never came up. May be it came up in the TBI report, but we've never seen it [a gun],\" said Horne in an interview on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking of Shelby County prosecutions: Just City's Josh Spickler just wrote an op-ed for us: a review of a book that shows how prosecutors hold \"all the cards.\" The book wasn't very flattering of Weirich or her office, Spickler writes.\n\nMemphis drivers wreck planter plans\n\nThe University of Memphis tried to kill two birds with one stone when it plopped down a panoply of planters to beautify Highland Street and slow down traffic for pedestrians.\n\nBut Memphis drivers weren't having any of it, our Micaela Watts reports. They mowed over the planters so many times, the U of M was forced to get rid of some of the pots:\n\nCody Fletcher, a neighborhood development officer with the University of Memphis, confirmed that some, but not all of the planters installed in the turning lane of Highland will be removed today after the latest incident of bumper-meets-planter. \"We may have underestimated the aggressiveness of the drivers and the level of distracted driving,\" Fletcher said.\n\nIn fairness to Memphis drivers, the planters were a dull gray, making them blend into the street. A word of advice to the U of M: Paint the remaining planters bright colors.\n\nYes, Memphis has lots of rainy days\n\nIn case you weren't already aware, rain loves Memphis. As WMC Action News 5 weatherman Ron Childers points out on Twitter, Oct. 4-7 was the last time we had a Thursday through Sunday without rain on at least one of those days:\n\nSo long, 495 Union, and thanks for all the fish\n\nThe first time I walked into The Commercial Appeal's headquarters at 495 Union, I was a nervous wreck. This University of Memphis kid was there to interview for one of the coveted internships at his hometown paper — one of the few paid internships available.\n\nI got it. Over the next decade or so, I worked in Mississippi and Alabama — but the smell of 495's presses stayed with me, pulling me back home. Well, The CA is this weekend leaving behind the old building at an address it's called home since 1933 to move into Pembroke Square, 119 S. Main, near the southern end of Main Street Mall.\n\nThe move is bittersweet, as you can tell from reading the farewell column from David Waters, a CA veteran now at the U of M. But it's the right move for a paper that has undergone significant — and sometimes painful — changes over the years.\n\nThe new home is a new chapter for The CA, which is doing a better job than ever of tailoring its content to what Memphians need and want.

Maybe perhaps it's the nostalgia; the taste just reminds you of summer and the beach,\" one reader wrote.\n\n\"Grotto's should change their name to Gross Pizza.

You wouldn't know it was fried unless they told you. The crust is reminiscent of the popular Totino's frozen pizza, but tastes healthier.\n\nEnzo said their pizza is the best in the state because it's a product that hasn't changed in over 40 years, from their sauce to the cheese.\n\nThe brothers won't share their playbook on what makes their sauce and cheese so tasty.

More than 1,900 were rated high performing in at least one area, but none were rated high performing in all areas.\n\nHospitals were also ranked from 1 to 50 nationally in each of 15 specialties, with hospitals not in the top 50 but still in the top 10% of all rated hospitals receiving a designation of “high performing.”\n\nBest general hospitals in Delaware\n\nChristianaCare in Stanton was ranked No. 1 in Delaware and tied at No. 4 in the Philadelphia metro area with Temple University Hospital.\n\n\"High performing\" ratings were achieved in 13 procedures/conditions: leukemia/lymphoma/myeloma, lung cancer surgery, prostate cancer surgery, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, heart attack, heart bypass surgery, congestive heart failure, stroke, diabetes, maternity care (uncomplicated pregnancy), hip replacement, knee replacement and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nThe report said the hospital was also high performing in two specialties, but didn’t list which of the above procedures were specialties.\n\nBeebe Healthcare in Lewes was ranked No. 2 in Delaware.\n\n\"High performing\" ratings were achieved in seven procedures/conditions: colon cancer surgery, lung cancer surgery, pneumonia, heart attack, diabetes, hip replacement and knee replacement.\n\nBayhealth Hospital, Kent Campus, in Dover, did not receive a state ranking from U.S. News & World Report, but it was the only other general hospital in Delaware to receive “high performing” marks.\n\n\"High performing\" ratings were achieved in three procedures/conditions: congestive heart failure, stroke and diabetes.\n\nBest children’s hospitals\n\nNemours Children’s Hospital in Rockland was ranked No. 1 in Delaware and No. 9 in the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\nNemours was nationally ranked in the top 50 in five children’s specialties: pediatric orthopedics, No. 31; pediatric cardiology and heart surgery, No. 33; pediatric cancer, No. 37; pediatric diabetes and endocrinology, No. 38; and pediatric gastroenterology and GI surgery, No. 47.\n\nWhat statistics were used in the ratings?\n\nThe Best Hospitals ratings evaluate almost every hospital in the U.S. that admits patients in any of 21 common procedures and conditions and 15 specialties.\n\nU.S. News said data came from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' standard analytical file database and from the American Hospital Association and professional organizations.\n\nNo veterans or military hospitals were included.\n\n“Claims data for VA and military hospitals are unavailable in Medicare claims data and are largely unavailable. If these data become publicly available, we will consider evaluating them,” U.S. News said. “Claims data from the Medicare database are the most comprehensive source data available.”\n\nMore medical news:Delaware residents with rare diseases hit Capitol Hill to push changes to health care\n\nThe report used files of every hospital admission paid by traditional Medicare for inpatients age 65 and older treated from 2017-2021 to assess each hospital's risk-adjusted mortality rates, readmissions and other outcomes.\n\n“How well older patients are treated is generally considered a good test of a hospital's capabilities,” U.S. News said. “Such patients have a greater chance of being admitted with one or more conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, that put them in a higher-risk category.”\n\nThe analysis included publicly-available data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services including federally mandated patient-satisfaction surveys.\n\n“We put the heaviest reliance on outcomes because of the self-evident connection between a patient's outcomes, including survival and the quality of their care,” the report said.\n\nThe outcomes included 30-day mortality rate, 30-day readmission rate and length of stay.\n\n“These measure how well the hospital performed the procedure at the time of care and also was able to prevent an unplanned re-visit to the hospital due to the same condition. A shorter length of stay is indicative of a lower complication rate,” U.S. News said.\n\nOther data included the number of patients, the ratio of nurses to patients and the physician survey.\n\nWhat if my hospital is rated average or below average?\n\nAbout 50% to 70% of the hospitals in each procedure or condition were rated as average.\n\nU.S. News & World Report said some hospitals were rated below average “partly because of low patient volume, not necessarily because of a high number of deaths or other adverse events. No firm conclusion can be reached about an unrated hospital; these hospitals did not treat enough patients to be evaluated thoroughly.”\n\nBased on your health situation, the report said it could make more sense to go to an average hospital closer to you or within your insurance network than a high-performing hospital that is farther away and out-of-network.\n\n“As always, these ratings should be taken as a starting point. All care decisions should be made in conjunction with medical professionals,” the report said.\n\nDebate about the validity of the rankings\n\nThis year for the nationally rated hospitals, U.S. News & World Report changed from ordinal rankings in favor of an “Honor Roll” in no particular order, according to a report in USA TODAY.\n\nThe change came after recent user surveys found a growing need to highlight ratings based on specialties, conditions, procedures and region instead of national rankings, \"because in most cases patients should consider a provider near where they live,\" said Ben Harder, U.S. News chief analyst and managing editor.\n\nThe hospital rankings emerge amid a national conversation debating the value, transparency and methodology of such rating systems, USA TODAY reported.\n\nIn June, the San Francisco city attorney’s office announced it was launching an investigation into U.S. News, alleging bias, questionable methodology and undisclosed financing.\n\nNot long after, the University of Pennsylvania Health System declared it was no longer actively participating in the annual U.S. News & World Report “Best Hospitals” rankings, underscoring the need for greater transparency.\n\nAlthough U.S. News later announced changes to its methodology in July, emphasizing health equity and outpatient outcomes, University of Pennsylvania Health System CEO Kevin Mahoney was not assuaged.\n\n“Overall, rankings systems are an oversimplified, dated way to measure 21st century health care,” he said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nHowever, hospital rankings are one of the only sources of up-to-date data that patients have to compare hospitals in a comprehensible and transparent way, Michael Millenson, an expert on quality care and patient safety, said in a July USA TODAY interview.\n\nHospital rankings “are not perfect – sometimes they mislead and we have to ask questions – but it’s the best we have,” he said.\n\nUSA TODAY is part of the Gannett company with Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nReach reporter Ben Mace at rmace@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/06/20/us-news-hospital-rankings-san-francisco/70337075007/", "title": "US News' hospital rankings questioned by San Francisco city attorney", "text": "U.S. News & World Report’s hospital ranking system is being investigated by the San Francisco city attorney’s office, which alleges the annual report is fraught with bias, questionable methodology and undisclosed financing.\n\nIn a letter sent to the media company Tuesday, City Attorney David Chiu alleged U.S. News’ rankings incentivize hospital systems to focus on certain specialties, including treatments primarily used by white people, to score higher in its ranking system.\n\nThis ranking system puts less weight on primary care, specialties that reduce health care costs, or treatment for conditions typically experience by people of color, according to the letter obtained by USA TODAY.\n\n\"(U.S. News) holds itself out as an expert on ranking hospitals, but medical experts have recently raised concerns that (its) rankings suffer from poor and opaque methodology, mislead those using the rankings, and create perverse incentives for hospitals nationwide,\" he wrote.\n\nThe city attorney’s office is also demanding U.S. News publicly disclose the payments it receives from the hospitals included in their rankings, claiming the media company receives fees from medical institutions to display a “Best Hospital” badge on their online or print advertising.\n\n\"Many (San Francisco) hospitals aren't even ranked in this that we think are providing good services and it's just been mystifying to us on how these rankings are happening. So, that's why we were digging into it,\" Chiu told USA TODAY Tuesday.\n\n\"In the recent wake of public scrutiny of (U.S. News') ranking methodology of other institutions, which has led law schools, medical schools, and colleges to withdraw from its rankings, the public deserves answers to many questions,\" he wrote.\n\nCalling it quits:Growing number of colleges, graduate schools with draw from US News' rankings\n\nAccusations precede debut of latest rankings\n\nU.S. News “categorically” disagreed with the city attorney’s “assumptions and conclusions,” in a statement sent to USA TODAY, and said the media company’s rankings are “an important public service” to Americans making critical health care decisions.\n\n“We have consistently stated that our rankings should be one factor in that decision-making process, and any medical decisions should be made in consultation with a physician,” the statement read. “Families facing a serious or complex medical problem deserve to have a place where they can easily identify the factors that are important to them and help determine which hospital is the best suited for their individual needs.”\n\nThe media outlet did not respond to questions about receiving “badge fees” or other undisclosed payments.\n\nU.S. News had previously received backlash before from dozens of ranked medical and law schools who said they would no longer provide information to the outlet in recent years. The institutions argued the rankings formula discouraged them from admitting promising graduates of less-prestigious colleges who hadn’t performed as well on entrance tests as applicants from top schools, and that they were penalized in the rankings when their graduates chose careers in public service over more lucrative options.\n\n\"That piqued interest from the past year and as we were looking at a variety of reports, we realized that the data in the hospital context is just as questionable. But the stakes are arguably much higher,\" Chiu said.\n\nConsidering 'all legal options'\n\nUnder California state law, Chiu's letter is requesting U.S. News substantiate advertising claims that the outlet is an \"authoritative resource\" for hospital rankings, and provide more information about its ranking methodology and financing.\n\n\"If U.S. News & World Report is violating (Federal Trade Commission) regulations, we will look at all legal options,\" he said. This \"is more than a heads up.\"\n\nChiu’s letter comes a day before U.S. News was expected to release its 2023-24 rankings for the nation’s best children’s hospitals. Americans have widely relied on its annual hospital rankings, which began publishing in 1990, to help make informed health care decisions.

U.S. News reached out to every hospital in the country with maternity services but only about 20% responded.\n\nThe publication is working to include more hospitals and data on maternal health for the next report, said Min Hee Seo, a health data scientist at U.S. News.\n\n“Maternity health equity, increase feedback and provide more information to patients and expecting families – that’s something we’re going to put more effort in,” she said. “We’re going to focus on hospitals that are smaller or located in maternity deserts so those hospitals are not penalized by larger populations in the area.”\n\n'Advanced maternal age':Pregnancy risks increase with age but there’s no reason to believe risks ‘jump’ after turning 35, study suggests\n\nOpinion:Tackle maternal health disparities, mortality with data and better care\n\nThe report notably didn’t include information on maternal mortality and morbidity.

What ...", "text": "Humana was recently named the \"Best Overall Medicare Advantage Plan Company\" by U.S. News & World Report. ChristianaCare announced that as of January, it would no longer accept plans from this Medicare Advantage carrier as in-network.\n\nDelaware's largest health care system said contract negotiations between it and the country's top-rated Medicare Advantage insurance carrier were unsuccessful. Beginning in September, ChristianaCare began sending letters to Delaware's 5,656 Humana Medicare Advantage plan participants, informing them that the plans offered by Humana would not be in-network as of Jan. 1.\n\nThe notice caught some impacted plan participants off guard, especially because regular open enrollment ended Dec. 7. However, Humana Medicare Advantage plan enrollees have an opportunity to select a new plan.\n\nHumana Medicare Advantage plan members have until March 31 to consider these options:\n\nSwitch to another Medicare Advantage plan\n\nDrop Medicare Advantage and go back to original Medicare\n\nJoin a Medicare drug plan\n\nWhat is Medicare Advantage?\n\nMedicare is a health insurance program for people 65 and older. There are several names for the multitude of plans that cover a wide range of services and coordinated benefits. Upon enrolling, individuals must choose between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage.\n\nOriginal Medicare is known as Part A and Part B. It is a fee-for-service insurance managed by the federal government. Part A refers to coverage for hospital service and Part B is coverage for medical care.\n\nMedicare Advantage plans, also known as Part C, are provided by private insurers and offer a range of services that can vary by state and plan. In addition to the benefits available through Original Medicare, some Medicare Advantage plans include extras such as routine vision, hearing, and dental care, as well as options like gym memberships and transportation. When weighing costs, enrollees must choose between an HMO, PPO or a private fee-for-service plan.\n\nStand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans are called Part D. Most original Medicare plans and Medicare Advantage plans offer Part D.\n\n'A REVOLUTIONARY LEGAL THEORY':ChristianaCare agrees to pay $47.1M to settle whistleblower lawsuit claiming kickbacks\n\nThe challenge of choosing a new plan\n\nDeciding which option to pick can be difficult because there are benefits and drawbacks the average person may not consider, according to Lakia Turner, director of the Delaware Department of Insurance Medicare Assistance Bureau.\n\nAs an example, Turner pointed out that as former Medicare Advantage plan participants, new Medicare enrollees may not be eligible for a Medicare supplement policy called Medigap. Medigap pays the 20% of costs that Medicare doesn't cover. Pre-existing health conditions cannot be used to deny coverage. However, these limitations are only available to seniors within the first six months of a Medicare Part B plan.\n\nNow, if a Humana Medicare Advantage plan member chooses to switch to original Medicare and opts for a supplemental policy to cover gaps in Medicare coverage, they'll likely face increased costs, fewer coverage options and \"they'll go through medical underwriting, which means that the insurance company will look at their age and their health and determine whether or not to sell them a policy,\" Turner said.\n\nTo help seniors navigate the complexities of Medicare, the Delaware Department of Insurance Medicare Assistance Bureau offers free, one-on-one assistance by federally trained state employees and volunteers who can help enrollees determine which option is the right choice.\n\nCall the department at 302-674-7364 to schedule a phone, virtual or in-person appointment.\n\nAdditional questions to ask about Medicare Advantage plan options\n\nWhen contacting the Delaware Department of Insurance Medicare Assistance Bureau, enrollees should be prepared to discuss factors that may affect their choice of plan, Turner advised. These include:\n\nWhether all their doctors, including those outside of the ChristianaCare health system, are covered by the plan they choose.\n\nUnderstanding of the costs involved with Medicare Advantage plans because they typically include co-pays for doctor visits.\n\nProviding counselors with a list of medications to ensure that the prescriptions are covered by the preferred plan.\n\nDoes ChristianaCare accept any Medicare Advantage plans?\n\nYes. The healthcare provider's website listed these carriers offering in-network plans for the 2024 Medicare benefit year:\n\nAetna Medicare Advantage.\n\nUnited Healthcare Medicare Advantage.\n\nHighmark Medicare Advantage (Delaware only).\n\nWellCare Medicare Advantage (Delaware only).\n\nCigna Medicare Advantage (Delaware and Pennsylvania).\n\nAlterwood Medicare Advantage (Maryland only).\n\nAlso according to the health care provider's webpage, in-home nursing care through ChristianaCare HomeHealth continues to be in-network with Humana Medicare Advantage.\n\nIn an email sent to Delaware Online/The News Journal after the original publication of this story, ChristianaCare stated it \"remains committed to expanding access to high-quality, affordable health care for everyone in the communities we serve.\" The company said it is still willing to engage in negotiations with Humana for potential coverage offerings.\n\nContact reporter Anitra Johnson at ajohnson@delawareonline.com.

Nice evening in Houston w/ Hallie; will share update when we have it,\" Biden wrote in a tweet that he sent Tuesday morning, along with a photo of he and his wife, to thousands of supporters.\n\nBiden, 44, spent part of his day Tuesday at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, a source close to the attorney general said.\n\nThe second-term Democrat had suffered a mild stroke more than three years ago and last week became \"weak and disoriented\" after driving to Indiana for a family vacation, triggering visits to hospitals in Chicago, Philadelphia and now Texas, his spokesman said.\n\nBiden's father, Vice President Joe Biden, was in Houston on Tuesday with \"no public events scheduled,\" according to his office.

Miller, Beau Biden's spokesman, said Tuesday he could not confirm that his boss was being treated at Anderson.\n\n\"We have no additional information to provide,'' Miller said. \"We have no update on his status or condition.''\n\nOn Monday night, though, Biden seemed \"fit as a fiddle\" when he ate dinner with his wife, father, stepmother and several other people, including Secret Service agents, at D'Amico's Italian Market Café in Houston, owner Nash D'Amico said Tuesday.\n\n\"He was friendly and healthy and hungry,\" D'Amico said.

He was transferred to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia and kept for observation until May 18, 2010.\n\nHe soon returned to the Office of the Attorney General, a post to which he was elected in 2006. He was re-elected to a second four-year term in 2010. He has been raising money and is expected to seek re-election in 2014.\n\nEarlier this month, rescue crews were sent to Joe Biden's house in Greenville to respond to a report of a \"possible stroke,\" according to a dispatch on a police scanner that night. While reports related to the call did not identify Beau Biden as the source of the emergency, the dispatch was recorded at 9:25 p.m. on Aug. 1.\n\nCranston Heights sent a basic life support unit and New Castle County sent a paramedic unit and a supervisor to Joe Biden's house, but the call was soon canceled, a fire company official said that night, declining to be identified.\n\nBeau Biden's current medical problems were not made public until Monday night, when Miller issued a brief statement that said his boss had become \"weak and disoriented following a long drive to Indiana for a family vacation.\" The White House also issued a statement Monday night, saying that \"Beau is being evaluated to determine the cause of an episode of disorientation and weakness that he experienced.\"\n\nAfter falling ill Wednesday, Biden was admitted to the Northwestern University Hospital in Chicago, Miller's statement said. On Thursday morning, he was \"feeling better\" and consulted with his doctor at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia about his earlier symptoms, Miller said. Biden was discharged and spent the weekend at home.\n\nMiller also said Biden had spoken by phone to Chief Deputy Attorney General Ian McConnel over the weekend and had been in touch with his office Monday evening.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden tweeted a picture showing himself sitting by his father as they talked by phone with members of the Newark National Little League team about their trip to the Little League World Series.\n\nWith Biden still in Texas, one organizer of his $100-per-person fundraiser scheduled for tonight at the Lewes Yacht Club said he did not know whether the attorney general would attend.\n\nSpeaker of the House Pete Schwartzkopf, who is on the host committee for the event, said he has not been given any official word.\n\nBiden campaign staffer Molly Magarik would not comment.\n\nContributing: News Journal reporter Doug Denison", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/maryland/2019/07/01/peninsula-regional-health-systems-absorb-mccready-health-somerset-county-prmc-salisbury-merger-care/1616394001/", "title": "Peninsula Regional Medical Center to absorb McCready Health", "text": "With Peninsula Regional Medical Center just ranked at No.11 among Maryland's top hospitals by U.S. News & World Report, its network has become a little bit bigger.\n\nMcCready Health of Crisfield and Peninsula Regional Health Systems announced Monday the Salisbury-based company will be absorbing McCready Hospital pending final regulatory approval, which will likely come by the fall.\n\nThe deal comes about a year and a half after McCready approached PRHS about a possible affiliation, as hospital usage in Somerset County had been dropping for years.\n\nMcCready will continue providing hospital services until the final approval, approximately Nov. 1, and the transition will be overseen by the Peninsula Regional Health System Board of Directors, according to the press release.\n\nLand has been purchased on Route 413 just east of Crisfield, according to the press release, and design work will soon begin on the \"McCready Health Pavilion\" — a new freestanding medical facility under executive leadership of Peninsula Regional, to include 24/7 emergency care, physical therapy, speech therapy, behavioral health services, family medicine, imaging and laboratory services.\n\nSen.

And despite a balmy February forecast for the East, Mount Washington, New Hampshire, recorded the nation's coldest wind chill ever.\n\nThe end of La Niña, a weather phenomenon that increases cold and snow in the Northwest and dry conditions in the South, \"is one of the reasons we believe winter last year turned out warmer than normal,\" wrote the Almanac's managing editor Sandi Duncan in a statement.\n\nThe Almanac had expected a third La Niña winter, but \"by February, it had virtually collapsed. The West turned wet, and the contiguous US ended up with its 17th-warmest winter on record,\" the Farmers' Almanac said.\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac, which originated in 1818, says its longtime fans claim the publication's weather predictions are accurate approximately 80-85% of the time. It uses \"a top-secret mathematical and astronomical formula, taking sunspot activity, tidal action, the position of the planet, and many other factors into consideration,\" the Almanac states.\n\nFor winter 2023-2024, the Almanac takes into account the strengthening of El Niño, which should result in more moisture and storms in the southern U.S., its editors said.\n\nEl Niño is back, NOAA says:Will it help fuel Earth's hottest year on record?\n\nA graphical explanation of El Niño:It could return in 2023; what that means for the world's weather\n\nShould you trust the Farmers' Almanac? Well ...\n\nWeather forecasters annually prepare for media requests about the accuracy of almanacs, including The Old Farmer's Almanac, which was founded in 1792 and plans to release its winter forecast on August 29.\n\n\"They attract attention and get people talking about it. But a lot of times what they do is use general phrases that are true most any year,\" Russ Schumacher, a professor and climatologist at Colorado State University, told the Coloradoan last year.\n\n\"What does 'glacial and snow-filled' for our area mean? Is that we get a few days of really cold weather and some snow? That happens pretty much every winter.''\n\nA University of Illinois study from 2010, cited by Popular Mechanics in an October 2022 story, found The Old Farmer's Almanac only about 52% accurate over the years, \"which is essentially random chance,\" the news site wrote.\n\nThat doesn't make The Farmer's Almanac any less interesting. Here's a closer look at its regional winter forecasts.\n\nThe Farmers' Almanac forecast for the Northeast and New England\n\nForecast for Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington D.C.: Those living along the East Coast \"who saw a lack of wintry precipitation last winter … should experience quite the opposite, with lots of rain/sleet and snowstorms to contend with,\" the Almanac forecasts. In January, the second week \"will be stormy, snowy, and wet for both the Pacific Coast and the Eastern States,\" it forecasts. Then, during the second week of February, \"an East Coast storm affecting the Northeast and New England states will bring snowfall, cold rain and then frigid temperatures.\" The first week of March, the Almanac forecasts, \"another East Coast storm will bring a wintry mess to this area.\" Come spring, during the third week of April, a \"possible late-season snowfall\" is expected \"over the high terrain of New England.\"\n\nGreat Lakes, Ohio Valley and Midwest\n\nForecast for Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin: January and February should bring lower than average temperatures and lots of \"snowstorms, sleet, ice (and) rain\" around the Great Lakes and Midwest, the Almanac forecasts.\n\nSoutheast\n\nForecast for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia: Florida and the rest of the Southeast \"will see a wetter-than-normal winter, with average winter temperatures overall, but a few frosts may send many shivers to snowbirds trying to avoid the cold and snow back home,\" the Almanac forecasts. In mid-February, the Southeast will experience \"unseasonably cold temperatures,\" and during the first week of March \"another East Coast storm will bring a wintry mess to this area.\"\n\nNorth Central\n\nForecast for Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming: This winter, the Great Plains and Rockies can expect \"plenty of cold temperatures and occasional bouts of storminess, bringing widespread rains and snows,\" the Almanac forecasts. During the first week of March, \"potential blizzards … will remind folks in the North Central states that winter isn’t over yet,\" it forecasts.\n\nSouth Central\n\nForecast for Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas: During the middle of January, South Central states can expect \"lots of cold temperatures and some storms,\" the Almanac forecasts. Texas can expect \"unseasonably cold weather\" during January and February, \"with a possible major winter storm in mid-January.\"\n\nNorthwest\n\nForecast for Idaho, Oregon and Washington: \"An unusually snowy and wet winter\" is forecast for the area, according to the Almanac. Heavy mountain snows are expected the first week of February in the West, including the mountains on the Pacific Coast.\n\nSouthwest\n\nForecast for Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah: An El Niño could lead to \"copious amounts of rain and snow across the entire Southwest,\" the Almanac forecasts. The Pacific Coast can expect a \"stormy, snowy, and wet\" second week of January followed, in the first week of February, by \"heavy mountain snows\" that will cover the western U.S., it forecasts.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider &mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Let's look at the almanac", "text": "As autumn and cooler weather arrive in Delaware, curiosity about what Mother Nature will deliver this winter begins to surface.\n\nWednesday is the fall equinox, ushering in the new season at 3:20 p.m., and one popular forecaster is predicting a drastic change in weather from last year.\n\nThe 2022 Old Farmer’s Almanac predicts “a season of shivers” this winter with below-average temperatures across most of the United States.\n\n“This coming winter could well be one of the longest and coldest that we’ve seen in years,” said Janice Stillman, editor of the almanac, which has been published since 1792.\n\nStillman said higher-than-normal snow is expected in areas of New England as well as throughout the Ohio Valley, in northern portions of the deep South, along a track from eastern Montana south through the western halves of the Dakotas and into northeastern Colorado and southeast New Mexico – no specific mention of Delaware or our region.\n\nBut the Old Farmer’s Almanac website map outlines a “cold and snowy” winter for northern New Castle County and a “cold and dry” winter for extreme southern New Castle County and for Kent and Sussex counties.\n\nAccording to its website, the almanac makes long-range forecasts using solar science, the study of sunspots and other solar activity; climatology, the study of prevailing weather patterns; and meteorology, the study of the atmosphere.\n\n“We predict weather trends and events by comparing solar patterns and historical weather conditions with current solar activity,” the website states. “Our forecasts emphasize temperature and precipitation deviations from averages, or normals. These are based on 30-year statistical averages prepared by government meteorological agencies.”\n\nThe almanac says one of the reasons for the frigid prediction is the early stages of solar cycle 25, “which is expected to bring very low solar activity – historically associated with cooler temperatures, on average, across Earth.”\n\nHow did the almanac’s numbers for last winter stack up for the First State? It said the 2020-2021 winter season would bring warmer-than-average temperatures across the eastern and northern parts of the United States. Precipitation was forecast to be below normal from Delaware into North Carolina.\n\nFor Delaware, the temperature prediction was pretty much on the money, but the state actually averaged higher-than-normal precipitation in December, January and March. February was the outlier in both categories, with cooler-than-normal temperatures and below-average precipitation.\n\nMORE WEATHER NEWS:Record floods prompt home evacuations in Wilmington\n\nAccording to the Delaware Climate Office, the December 2020 statewide average temperature was 40.0 degrees, 1.9 degrees higher than the 1981-2010 mean or \"normal.\" Precipitation statewide averaged 6.11 inches, 2.54 inches above the mean.\n\nJanuary’s average temperature was 37.1 degrees, 3.0 degrees above normal, the 28th warmest since observations began in 1895. Precipitation statewide averaged 2.33 inches, 0.99 inches below normal.\n\nFebruary’s average temperature was 36.3 degrees, 0.2 degrees below normal, the coolest February since 2015. Precipitation averaged 5.72 inches, 2.81 inches above normal.\n\nMarch’s average temperature was 48.0 degrees, 4.0 degrees above normal, the 12th warmest March since observations began in 1895. Precipitation statewide averaged 4.35 inches, 0.15 inches above normal.\n\nThe almanac reported its overall accuracy rate last winter was lower than most years.\n\n“Specifically, the accuracy rate in forecasting the change in temperature versus the previous winter across all 18 regions of the U.S. was 72.2%, while our accuracy rate in forecasting the change in precipitation was 77.8% This is below are traditional average rate of 80%,” the website states.\n\nBut a study at the University of Illinois said the almanac’s accuracy is closer to a coin toss.\n\nProfessor emeritus John Walsh in the university’s department of atmospheric sciences conducted a study testing the accuracy of the almanac’s monthly temperatures and precipitation forecasts by comparing them with the actual weather data over a five-year period.\n\n“Results of this study found that 51.9% of the monthly precipitation forecasts and 50.7% of the monthly temperature forecasts were accurate, concluding that these percentages are similar to the 50% success rate expected by chance,” according to the University of Illinois extension service website.\n\nLooking back on Delaware's summer weather, in June, the average temperature was 74.5 degrees, 2.4 degrees above normal. Rainfall statewide averaged 2.82 inches, 0.91 inches below normal.\n\nIn July, the statewide average temperature was 78.4 degrees, 1.8 degrees above normal, while rainfall statewide averaged 5.75 inches, 1.61 inches above normal.\n\nThe August summary hasn’t been released by the Delaware Climate Office as of Sept. 21.\n\nReach reporter Ben Mace at rmace@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/08/31/old-farmers-almanac-delaware-2022-2023-winter-weather-predictions/65463843007/", "title": "The Old Farmer's Almanac's winter weather predictions for Delaware", "text": "In a showdown of science mixed with folklore, are the almanacs on the same page with their winter forecasts for Delaware?\n\nA few weeks ago, we previewed Farmers’ Almanac, but now the granddaddy of all prognosticators, The Old Farmer’s Almanac, has weighed in with its winter predictions.\n\nPublished every year since 1792, The Old Farmer’s Almanac bills itself as the oldest continuously published periodical in North America, with 2.5 million copies printed and distributed each year in addition to the readers on its website.\n\n“Depending on where you live, this will be the best of winters or memorable for all the wrong reasons,” said editor Janice Stillman. “One half of the country will deal with bone-chilling cold and loads of snow, while the other half may feel like winter never really arrives.”\n\nFor the Atlantic corridor which includes Delaware, The Old Farmer’s Almanac is predicting winter temperatures below normal and precipitation and snowfall above normal.\n\n“The coldest periods will be in early December, early and late January, and most of February. The snowiest periods will be in early to mid-January, late January and late February,” according to The Old Farmer's Almanac website.\n\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac's predictions are similar to those of Farmers' Almanac\n\nA forecasting competitor, Farmers’ Almanac, which dates back to 1818, said the northeast should prepare for a “cold and snowy winter.”\n\n“The first bite of winter should come earlier than last year’s,” according to a press release. “December 2022 looks stormy and cold nationwide with an active storm pattern developing and hanging around for most of the season over the eastern half of the country. Maybe there will be a white Christmas in some areas.”\n\nFarmers’ Almanac forecasts are based on a mathematical and astronomical formula, taking sunspot activity, tidal action, the position of the planet and other factors into consideration.\n\nMeanwhile, The Old Farmer’s Almanac uses a model developed by founder Robert B. Thomas, and the staff has “refined and enhanced the formula with state-of-the-art technology and modern scientific calculations.” They use solar science, the study of sunspots and other solar activity; climatology, the study of prevailing weather patterns, and meteorology, the study of the atmosphere.\n\nHow accurate are the almanacs' winter weather predictions?\n\nFarmers’ Almanac editor Peter Geiger said his publication predicted many of the 2021-2022 winter storms, most notably the early-season nor’easter in the end of October and the unusual blizzard in the last week of April in parts of Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas.\n\n“Longtime fans…who follow our weather predictions claim they are accurate approximately 80% to 85% of the time,” according to the Farmer’s Almanac website.\n\nThe Old Farmer’s Almanac website said, “Our results are often very close to our traditional claim of 80 percent.”\n\nA look back at last winter:Wilmington hit by snow, wind, cold - sights and sounds\n\nThe University of Illinois has studied the forecasts and said the accuracy of such long-range predictions is closer to a coin toss.\n\nProfessor emeritus John Walsh in the university’s Department of Atmospheric Sciences examined forecasts of monthly temperatures and precipitation of The Old Farmer’s Almanac by comparing them to the actual weather data over a 5-year period.\n\n“Results of this study found that 51.9% of the monthly precipitation forecasts and 50.7% of the monthly temperature forecasts were accurate, concluding that these percentages are similar to the 50% success rate expected by chance,” according to the University of Illinois extension service website.\n\nMore weather news:After nor'easter lingers at Delaware beaches, towns focus on repairing dune crossings\n\nReach reporter Ben Mace at rmace@gannett.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/08/04/somerset-county-pa-2022-23-winter-weather-predictions/65390539007/", "title": "Somerset County, PA 2022-23 winter weather predictions", "text": "The Old Farmer's Almanac claims it is 80% accurate and modern predictions use solar science, climatology and meteorology to predict weather patterns for the next year.\n\nAlbeit vague and general in wording, the almanac predicts average temperatures, snowfall totals and precipitation across the country.\n\nAlmanac 2022-23 winter predictions:Ready for snow this winter?

But sometimes, what we may think is helping is not necessarily the best way to provide support.\n\nHere are some common myths about donating and volunteering with food banks and pantries − and whether or not they should be believed, according to representatives from local organizations.\n\nThe envelope had been opened by the time the card reached the house.\n\nIt was clear, based on the way the glue stuck to both sides of the envelope, that the white paper was sealed at one point.

But on March 19, the astronomical winter ends and spring begins. It's also known as the vernal equinox – when day and night are the about same length almost everywhere on Earth.\n\nWhen the vernal equinox takes place on Tuesday evening in the U.S., it will already be March 20 for most of the world. A March 21 equinox won't occur on the continental U.S. during the entire 21st century, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac.\n\nHere's what happens on the first day of spring.\n\nWhen is the spring equinox?\n\nThe March equinox comes at 11:06 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, the precise moment the sun's rays shine directly on the equator. Meteorologists actually consider March 1 the beginning of spring.\n\nTuesday is one of two days of the year – the other is the day of the autumnal equinox in September – when the Earth's axis is tilted neither toward nor away from the sun, resulting in roughly 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness almost everywhere on the planet.\n\nUnable to view our graphics?

Here's when the first day of spring is in 2024.\n\nWhat causes the seasons to change?\n\nAfter the spring equinox, the north pole continues tilting toward the sun until summer solstice, or the day when the northern hemisphere receives the most sunlight. After that longest day in June, the north pole begins its six-month retreat in the sky toward winter.\n\nThe word \"equinox\" comes from the Latin words \"aequalis\" and \"nox,\" meaning \"equal night.\" On the autumnal (and the spring) equinox, day and night are roughly 12 hours long each in most of the world.\n\nDay and night aren't exactly 12 hours long on the day of the equinox because the Earth's atmosphere refracts, or bends, light in an optical illusion that brings more daylight than there really is. Because of this, the date when day and night are of exactly equal length is usually a few days after the spring equinox.\n\nWhat's the difference between an equinox and a solstice?\n\nEquinoxes – when day and night are roughly equal – occur in March and September and mark the astronomical beginning of spring and autumn in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nSolstices occur in June and December, which mark the beginning of astronomical summer and winter.

A recent housing assessment commissioned by the Delaware State Housing Authority found developers are capable of building homes to meet much of the demand. However, the report emphasized a known crisis: a severe shortage of affordable housing, especially for those with the lowest incomes.\n\nFor example, the median selling price of single-family homes in the First State increased from $370,000 in June to $375,000 in July. Condominiums and townhomes experienced a 5.6% increase, jumping from a median of $286,000 in June to $302,000 in July.\n\nThe matter is even more pronounced in Wilmington where the per capita income is $33,567 compared with the state's per capita income of $42,571. Amid the housing shortage, the city has around 1,400 vacant units that could be potentially restored for housing. However, renovating these homes, although believed to be a cost-effective option, can be as expensive as buying a new home in Delaware.\n\nCreating affordable, safe housing has long been a challenge in the city, but for over 100 years, one institution has attempted to tackle the issue.\n\nIn the 1930s, William Bancroft founded Woodlawn Trustees to buy land and develop affordable housing in Wilmington. The nonprofit later formed the Todmorden Foundation in 2014 to continue its mission to create affordable housing in the city. These nonprofits are renovating 20 housing units in Wilmington's Eastside neighborhood to make them available for the economically disadvantaged.\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal met with Richard Przywara, president and CEO of Woodlawn Trustees, at a few of these properties to explore the factors that contribute to the high costs associated with the development of affordable housing.\n\nSince COVID pandemic, just buying a vacant unit can cost $40K-$70K\n\nThe inflated cost of renovating vacant houses is immediately evident in the purchase price, according to Przywara. In the past, he said, neglected residential properties in Wilmington could be bought for $15,000 to $30,000. Since the onset of the pandemic, the market values of property in Wilmington have experienced a significant increase, and this trend has also extended to the costs of vacant homes.\n\nPrzywara said you can now expect to pay $40,000 to $70,000 for these types of properties.\n\nOnce acquired, it is necessary to clear the interior of the house before proceeding with any renovations. While it is typically assumed that no one is residing in the homes that Woodlawn Trustees and the Todmorden Foundation are renovating, there may be instances where they are still occupied.\n\nPrzywara sends a staffer to check for any squatters before entering homes to begin work. If any are found, they will be asked to vacate the premises, kindly — as in alignment with the organizations' Quaker values. In some cases, when a family is discovered residing in one of the homes, the nonprofit will cover the expense of relocating them to another property.\n\nAny rodent or roach infestation and cleanup from previous residents are also an expense to factor in.\n\nThe increased costs of materials apply to every address\n\nBoth Przywara and Richard Dyton, a contractor who works with Woodlawn Trustees and the Todmorden Foundation, said it's important to realize that certain expenses related to renovating a residential building are fixed and cannot be avoided irrespective of whether the property is a rowhome on Wilmington's Eastside or an estate home in Greenville.\n\nThe developers said due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the supply chain, the costs of house-building materials, including lumber, plumbing, electrical components and paint, have significantly increased. \"If you had a material list of $20,000 pre-COVID, it's now at least 50, maybe $60,000 just for material costs,” Dyton said.\n\nThe cost of labor, as well as the expense of replacing all electrical wiring, plumbing fixtures and the heating system in a home, can easily add up to nearly $40,000, regardless of the home's size, Dyton explained.\n\nCosts before demolition and construction work begin\n\nIn the early 1900s, when many homes in Wilmington were built, there were few building codes in place. Today, when remodeling changes exceed $25,000, strict regulations must be followed.\n\nTo obtain a building permit for construction work on structural, mechanical, electrical and plumbing modifications exceeding this amount or on commercial roofing projects, it is necessary to obtain approval from the city based on an architectural plan. Przywara said the services of an architect or engineer can cost between $8,000 and $10,000.\n\nThe architect or engineer will assess the building's structures and major systems to identify which ones need to be updated to meet modern codes. In certain cases, the installation of a sprinkler system may be necessary. According to Dyton, the cost of sprinkler systems can reach up to $70,000.\n\n\"Sometimes you get into a unit and you're like, 'What did I get into? I thought I was at $150,000 and now I'm at $225,000,'\" Przywara said.\n\nAfter the building permit approval, the focus shifts to actual renovation. According to Przywara and Dyton, it is essential to prioritize the repair of the roof to ensure the stability and security of the entire structure beneath it.\n\nMany homes on Eastside were built during the 1930s and 1940s with brick. Some are in such a state of severe disrepair that the mortar has begun to crumble. Pointing out the damage along the roofline of one rowhome on Bennett Street, Przywara said correcting the brickwork there would cost an estimated $10,000 to $15,000 not to mention the possibility of having to fix a neighboring roof.\n\n\"All of these roofs are connected. One building having a problem on the roof can actually affect the neighbor,\" Przywara said. Brickwork aside, according to Dyton, if there is no need for sub-roof repair, a new roof will cost around $12,000. However, if sub-roof repair is necessary, the cost can range from $15,000 to $22,000.\n\nLead paint remediation is a given in older homes\n\nThe remediation of lead paint hazards in older homes also has to be addressed. To do this, Przywara said that all paint, wallpaper, and drywall would need to be removed. The threat of lead contamination extends to the paint or lead-filled caulk on windows necessitating the replacement of all existing windows instead of simply painting over them. Evaluating the condition of existing wood frames to determine if any repairs or replacements are required, will also affect costs.\n\nIf interior framing of the house is necessary, an additional $25,000 to $30,000 will need to be allocated. Between framing and essential mechanicals, expenditures are around $70,000.\n\nIt's important to note that these estimates do not cover other significant expenses such as drywalling, flooring options or counter and cabinet selections. These factors can further increase the overall cost of the construction or renovation project.\n\nContact reporter Anitra Johnson at ajohnson@delawareonline.com.

Expect regular ...", "text": "In Delaware, 7,500 houses are projected to flood at least once a year by 2050 because of rising sea levels.\n\nSussex County ranks third among all coastal counties in terms of the number of new homes built in the highest-risk areas for future flooding.\n\nPeople are still willing to spend millions to take the risk. $500 million worth of new homes have been built on vulnerable land in Sussex since 2010.\n\nSouthern Delaware Realtor Lee Ann Wilkinson has been helping people achieve their dreams of owning a beach house for more than 30 years.\n\nBut owning beachfront property in a low-lying and storm-prone state like Delaware comes with flood risks.\n\nBy the time some of Wilkinson's newer clients pay off their mortgages, their dreams of living on the coast may be dashed as storms and high tides push floodwaters farther inland, threatening property and cutting off neighborhoods.\n\nYet, there are more people than one might think who are ready to spend millions of dollars anyway. For every homebuyer who passes, Wilkinson said, there are plenty of others waiting to swipe it off the market almost as quickly as it can be listed.\n\n“Not everybody gambles,” Wilkinson said. “Not everybody sky dives. Everybody’s different. There are always people that are risk-takers and others that are not.”\n\nIn coastal Delaware, such gamblers abound. A new analysis shows that between 2010 and 2017 more than 700 homes – worth roughly $500 million – were built on land that’s projected to be inundated at least once a year on average by 2050 unless pricey measures are taken to keep the water away.\n\nStatewide, roughly 7,500 houses face such risks – 10 percent of which are less than a decade old. While that threat exists nearly anywhere in America with a coastal view, it is more heavily concentrated in Delaware, the analysis found.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic is a hotspot for sea-level rise and coastal construction, spurred in part by rebuilding following Hurricane Sandy and gradual recovery from the Great Recession of 2008. The only two counties among 24 coastal states with more new houses in such vulnerable areas than Sussex County are in southern New Jersey— Ocean and Cape May counties.\n\nRELATED:See if your home will be regularly flooded in 30 years\n\nThe News Journal produced this story in partnership with Climate Central, a Princeton, New Jersey-based nonprofit that researches and reports facts about climate change.\n\nClimate Central performed the analysis of future risks of flooding by combining scientific projections with data from real estate listing company Zillow. Parts of Kent and New Castle counties were also found to face risks.\n\nIn Sussex County, dozens of vulnerable houses have been built in Lewes, a town bordered by expansive marshland and tributaries to the north and Cape Henlopen State Park and the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Neighborhoods found to be most at risk in the Lewes area included Lewes Beach and Cape Shores.\n\nThe Lewes that Wilkinson sells to her clients today has evolved from its earliest days as a Dutch trading post into a hub for menhaden fishing into now a quaint, historic town known for its charm, quiet beaches and multi-million-dollar waterfront homes.\n\nEven in those earliest of days, settlers without access to the Weather Channel knew it best to build on higher ground. So much of Lewes is surrounded by water that more than 50 percent of the land within city limits has been set aside as open space, a place to absorb incoming flood waters and rising seas, said City Mayor Ted Becker.\n\n“The people who come here in the summer time or on a beautiful day, when the canal is in its banks and everything is gorgeous, they never think about the idea that [a recent] Saturday at the high tide, the water was across Savannah Road and up over the sidewalk in front of the Beacon Motel,” he said. “Now, we could have much worse. People are more sensitive to it, but habits are hard to change.”\n\nWhen the late Thomas Orr bought his new bride one of the first homes on Lewes Beach in the late 1940s, people in town thought the couple was “wacky” to want to deal with all that sand, said Carol Orr.\n\nBut after 71 years of watching the sun rise over the bay – and a few instances of needing to flee to higher ground for their safety – Orr said she would not have chosen anywhere else to raise a son and grow old.\n\nBut as she has watched other homes be built on the beach over the years – some at ground level and greater risk of inundation – Orr said she would wonder how people could take the risk of living so close to the water for granted.\n\n“How can you be so stupid?” she asked.\n\nSeas are rising faster as heat-trapping pollution is released from fossil fuels, farming and forest losses, driving up air and ocean temperatures, melting ice into seas and expanding ocean waters.\n\nEfforts to reduce emissions could lessen future impacts, but won't undo the damage already done, which will continue to push up sea levels for decades to come.\n\nNatural geological processes and groundwater pumping are accelerating local sea-level rise along the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nWater levels have risen more than a foot during the past century at the site of a federal tide gauge in Lewes. The new analysis examined the likely impacts of a little more than a foot of additional sea level rise here by 2050.\n\nLast year was the second-warmest year on record in Delaware, and the warming temperatures are fueling violent storms that produce storm surges and heavy rain.\n\nEven as risks become more apparent, they’re having little impact on coastal building and buying. Southern Delaware real estate agents told The News Journal earlier this year the coastal real estate market is the best they have seen in a decade.\n\nWith more homes exposed to rising seas – which are climbing in the country’s lowest-lying state at a rate nearly twice the global average – why do people keep building and buying in the same places scientists say will face the greatest risks in coming decades?\n\nFor those willing to take the risk, the answer may be quite simple: Because they can.\n\nThe impact of a drenching nightmare\n\nWilkinson works with both modestly and high-priced homes in southern Delaware. Most recently, she sold a $4 million beach house to a Delaware couple who had worked abroad and are now ready to retire on the water.\n\nThe previous owners, after paying off the mortgage, had foregone flood insurance because they thought it was a waste of money. The house sits well above the 100-year floodplain, she said.\n\nLewes is one of more than a dozen communities in Delaware with locally required freeboard, additional elevation that towns can require to keep a structure above modeled flood waters from a 100-year storm. A 100-year storm has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.\n\nIn Lewes, homes must be built at least 18 inches above that base. At least one Delaware beach town requires an additional 3 feet above the minimum.\n\nFor those newer coastal homes like that $4 million one located in a private beachside neighborhood called Cape Shores, strict federal, state and local regulations on building elevations and flood insurance requirements can potentially mean more protections from rising floodwaters, Wilkinson said.\n\n“There are enough people that want this and will spend the money,\" she said. \"And they will take the chance.”\n\nWhen the Union of Concerned Scientists released a similar report this summer, estimating that up to 31,000 people and 24,000 homes in Delaware could see impacts from climate change and rising sea levels by the end of the century, analysts warned that those facing the greatest risks were living in homes worth far less than the state's median home value. Many others were retirees, relying heavily on the value of their homes, the report said.\n\nIn Lewes, about 40 percent of the population is over 65, said Danielle Swallow, a coastal hazards specialist at the University of Delaware’s Sea Grant program. That could make it more difficult for them to relocate or recover from a natural disaster.\n\n\"You have this population of retirees that are moving toward the coast and in the floodplain, and in a lot of cases, a lot of their personal savings and their life's wealth is tied up in that home,\" Swallow said. \"Do they have the capacity to recover as quickly as someone who is still in the work force?\"\n\nPaul Camenisch, a local custom builder whose three-man company takes jobs only by word of mouth, agreed. A few years ago, they were building a house a few miles to the north along Delaware Bay when a nor’easter hit and they could not get to the site because the road had flooded out.\n\nBut that didn’t change his clients’ minds.\n\n“It’s where we live,” he said. “We live on a peninsula surrounded by water and under the land, it’s water.”\n\nThe Delaware native said it is not his job to tell clients where or what they should build. It is his job to build the home of their dreams, even if it means erecting a home on stilts that could be tough to access if projected sea levels flood the roads leading to it.\n\n“We put it where they tell us to put it,” he said. “We’ve had houses built within fractions of an inch of what the regulation is supposed to be. We’re very diligent in how we build a house. We don’t hide anything.”\n\nCamenisch lives farther inland in Delaware’s most southern, coastal county, close to a river known to overflow and flood downtown Milton, the home of Dogfish Head, during even the mildest nor’easter.\n\nHe is no stranger to rising seas and the impacts of climate change.\n\n“I’ve lived here 50 years and I’ve seen the change,” he said. “Water rises up and goes to places it’s never been before.”\n\nBut as a business owner, he said it doesn't make much sense to turn them down.\n\n“I don’t think we’ve ever heard anybody say, ‘we’re not going to build this house because it’s going to flood,’” he said. “They’re all susceptible. But that’s why they want it. They want to see the water. They want the $1 million house and the $1 million view to go with it.”\n\nAll Camenisch can do is make sure he is following the law and using the most updated techniques and materials available. Because if he doesn’t, another builder will.\n\nRegulating the American Dream\n\nThe draw to live near the water, even if it’s only for part of the year, is not subsiding even though officials along Delaware’s coasts know those waterfront views are changing.\n\nBecause the desire to build homes and condominiums with stunning waterfront views is so strong, it means more people are now in the path of those storms and rising seas than when the Orrs cozied into their beach-front home.\n\nIn Lewes alone, several parcels of land like the Groome Church property on New Road near the Great Marsh are being eyed for new neighborhoods. That could bring hundreds of new residents within stone's throw of floodplains and roads already known to flood at high tide.\n\nDelaware has done a lot of progressive work regarding planning and accounting for the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise, over the last decade, said Sea Grant's Swallow. All that planning cannot stop the building driven by a high-demand market, though.\n\n“In Delaware, there’s not enough appreciation that our storms are getting more intense, so when we do have storms there’s potentially more rainfall, there could be more storm surge, and all that gets exacerbated by sea level rise and the fact that we’re continuing to develop in our flood plain,” she said.\n\nPlans and studies may not seem sexy, but evaluating how many rooftops and pavements cover the coastal areas and force storm water into the streets can shape how communities driven by coastal tourism ensure that future visitors can still get to the beach or their homes.\n\nEven owners of houses that are elevated are impacted by flooding. With only three roads in and out of Lewes, Becker said the risk of rising seas is more than an inconvenience. In the face of another Superstorm Sandy or a direct hit from a hurricane, flooded roads could cut residents off from reaching safer, higher ground.\n\n“This is not a unique problem for Lewes,” Becker said. “There’s always more we can do, but we have to create a culture of awareness.”\n\nThe trouble, though, is that many of the people who own homes that will face the greatest risk in coming decades are not around all year. They don’t see what happens when nor’easters trap water inland and wash out the roads, he said.\n\nPeople also may not be assuming all of the risk because that risk is often subsidized through the National Flood Insurance Program, state officials said. As of June 30, the flood insurance program was more than $20 billion in debt while managing more than 5 million policies nationwide, 26,752 of which are in Delaware, according to FEMA spokesman Michael Hart.\n\nBecause it has been so long since Delaware has been hard hit by a major coastal storm, some home owners, buyers and builders may be living a false sense of complacency, Swallow said.\n\n\"I think the day is just around the corner when attitudes are going to change,\" she said.\n\nUnless drastic changes are made to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses, Delaware’s coastline is expected to change dramatically by the time today's toddlers are retired. In a 2012 report, Delaware experts estimated that up to 11 percent of the state’s landmass could be underwater by 2100 if nothing is done to move toward cleaner energy production.\n\n\"Delaware is a smaller piece of what we need to do nationally, which is a smaller piece of what we need to do globally,” said Shawn Garvin, secretary of the state’s Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. “Despite the retreat from the federal government, at least for now, on the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Accord, we’re still moving forward in doing our part.\"\n\nNot worth the risk\n\nWilkinson said there are plenty of affluent, well-educated home buyers who have the means to buy right on the beach but are not remotely interested or willing to take the risk of living so close to encroaching waters.\n\n“There are certain people who will mention sea level rise to me and say, ‘I’m not interested in looking there.’ Period,” she said. “And those people won’t look. They won’t ever consider it.”\n\nAmong that group are Brian and Patricia McCarthy, who spent most of their lives overseas working for the Department of State.\n\nWhen it came time to think about retirement, the McCarthys realized that moving around so much meant they did not really have a hometown to return to. They had known of Lewes as a vacation spot, and spent a few years living in the higher part of town while they weighed the risks of building near the water.\n\nInstead of living along the sandy shores of Lewes Beach or Cape Shores, they recently built a home 200 yards outside the 100-year floodplain on a little rise of land. They also elevated the structure 3 feet.\n\n“It wasn’t until we moved in that we realized how much water there is to deal with,” said Patricia, thankful for a generous amount of pervious surface included in the landscaping after an abnormally wet spring and summer.\n\nAcross the street from the McCarthy’s is a small parking area and grassy lot that dips down to the banks of the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal. There, the couple has a boat dock and installed a retaining wall; they’ve seen high tides lap at the front of their parking spots.\n\n“We’re not naïve,” Brian McCarthy said. “But it’s not something I worry about every day. My bigger concern is wind from nor’easters.”\n\nFor those willing to splurge on high-priced homes that are expected to flood by the time the mortgage is paid off, Wilkinson said all it means is one less weekend overlooking the water.\n\n“I think people probably would have that concern anywhere around here, and yes, there is a percentage of people that no matter what, even if they had the money, they’re not buying this stuff,” she said. “But there are enough people that want this and will spend the money. And they will take the chance.”\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Climate Central.

That’s if only moderate measures are taken to address greenhouse gas emissions, which fuel stronger storms and rising seas that will make flooding problems worse.\n\n• Statewide, nearly 7,500 houses face such risks – 10 percent of which are less than a decade old.\n\n• Research and journalism group Climate Central used scientific projections and data from Zillow and found that Delaware ranks No. 5 out of 24 coastal states for the most newly built homes facing this risk.\n\n• Sussex County ranks No. 3 among coastal counties. The only two counties with more new homes built in risk zones are found in nearby New Jersey, where Hurricane Sandy destroyed thousands of houses and buildings.\n\n• Among 24 coastal states, just over 10,000 newly built houses are at risk of flooding regularly shortly after the average mortgage would be paid off if only moderate cuts to pollution are made. Deep cuts would bring that number just under 10,000, while unchecked pollution would bring to the total to a little more than 11,000.\n\n• The numbers are worse for the end of the century. If greenhouse-gas pollution goes unchecked, 2.5 million existing homes – currently worth about $1.33 trillion or 6 percent of the U.S. economy – would be at risk of flooding at least once a year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/07/permit-to-purchase-handgun-bill-approved-by-delaware-house/72869604007/", "title": "'Permit to purchase' handgun bill approved by Delaware House", "text": "After hours of debate, the Delaware House of Representatives approved a bill requiring training and a permit before purchase of a handgun.\n\nHouse representatives spent nearly four hours debating 11 amendments proposed to the legislation, most of which were brought to the floor for the first time Thursday evening after caucusing for over an hour before debate.\n\nRepublican representatives attempted to table the bill given the considerable back-and-forth lawmakers had over the proposed changes, but the move was defeated.\n\nHouse Democrats as recently as December had pledged to approve the bill when the full House reconvened in January, but inclement weather and uncertainty around Gov. John Carney’s rescheduled State of the State address forced the public body to remain flexible and keep schedules open, House Democratic spokesperson Jenevieve Worley had said.\n\nEARLIER:Why Delaware lawmakers failed to vote on 'permit to purchase' in first weeks of session\n\nBecause the House revised the bill, it must now go back to the Senate for a vote, which likely will be added to next week’s Senate session agenda.\n\nCarney also pledged his support for the bill, speaking confidently during Tuesday's State of the State address that it would be passed: \"This year, we’ll take another big step forward and pass the permit to purchase law.\"\n\nThe final vote was 23 to 16. Two members were absent.\n\nWhat does the latest bill do?\n\nThe House made several revisions to the bill that was sent to the legislative body by the Senate last year.\n\nThose who supported the legislation argued the measure would cut down on straw purchases of guns as well as homicides and suicides. Lawmakers who opposed the bill argued the regulations violate the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms and warned that constitutional challenges would be brought against the legislation if passed.\n\nSTRAW PURCHASES:How a pattern of shoplifting ammunition led Delaware to demand Cabela's records\n\nThe bill's sponsor in the House, Rep. Melissa Minor Brown, encouraged lawmakers seeking revisions to the bill to work across the aisle to develop additional legislation, reminding them that \"permit to purchase\" has been in the works since 2019.\n\n\"This legislation has been the product of years of discussions, meetings and collaboration with colleagues in this building, constituents, advocates and stakeholders,\" she said, adding that 123 people die and 577 people are wounded by guns in Delaware in an average year. \"That is the fifth-highest rate of gun violence in the nation.\"\n\nMinor Brown said that Delaware crime data shows that the \"vast majority of crime guns\" are pistols and revolvers, and 83% of our crime guns are handguns. Plus, she said 70% of these crime guns are purchased in Delaware.\n\n\"Senate Bill 2 will drastically reduce these statistics by creating a requirement for a handgun qualifier purchase permit,\" she said. \"The bill would require people to undergo a gun safety training course and apply for a permit to qualify for the purchase of handguns.\"\n\nWhile applicants must shell out money for fingerprinting and the required training, there will be no fee to obtain the permit, according to Senate Substitute 1 for Senate Bill 2.\n\nAmendments passed remove the voucher program that would have provided financial assistance to low-income residents to cover the firearms safety training, which the legislation’s fiscal impact note indicated would cost about $1.7 million annually.\n\nThe amendments to the bill also make technical changes, including language that empowers law enforcement to ensure the surrender of guns purchased under a revoked permit and reiterates that information collected for the permit would be exempt from the state's Freedom of Information Act Law.\n\nPeople who already hold a valid concealed carry permit, qualified law enforcement officers as well as retired police are not required to obtain or present a handgun purchase permit. Other amendments passed Thursday exempt \"certain professionals and individuals\" from the training requirement \"only if the firearm training they undertake as part of their employment meets the requirements for training set forth\" in the bill.\n\nThe majority of the costs associated with the bill are for the staff and technology needed for the implementation and continued operation of the permit program.\n\nThe first year of the program’s implementation is estimated to cost about $2.7 million, for which Carney’s 2025 budget proposal includes nearly $3 million for the implementation.\n\nBy the second year, costs would climb to about $7.8 million annually – a figure that includes the cost of the voucher program. The bill’s fiscal note suggests that the voucher program wouldn’t be rolled out until the second year of its implementation.\n\nWhat if it’s constitutionally challenged?\n\nDelaware Republicans have come out in opposition to the bill, mirroring resistance by gun rights advocates to place restrictions on gun ownership.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Mike Ramone said during a Facebook live recording reacting to Carney’s recent State of the State address that other states that have passed similar bills faced legal pushback.\n\n“If we want to keep creating environments where we’re making our communities safer, why don’t we just make sure the bill is constitutional and not copy a bill that’s similar to Maryland or another state where they’ve already ruled it’s not constitutional?” Ramone said.\n\nA U.S. appeals court last year declared Maryland's licensing requirements for people seeking to buy handguns unconstitutional, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision that expanded gun rights.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on a 2-1 vote blocked Maryland’s 2013 law that required people to undergo training and background checks before applying for licenses to buy handguns, arguing it violated the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, according to Reuters.\n\nThe lawsuit was backed and paid for by the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe ruling was cited by several Republican lawmakers during their final remarks before the vote on the legislation was taken, many of them warning that a constitutional challenge would be forthcoming.\n\nDelaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said during the House meeting Thursday that the 4th Circuit’s ruling will be reheard by the full court because the panel of judges that ruled on the case was not representative of the full 4th Circuit.\n\nTwo of the judges on the case were former President Donald Trump appointees, and the third dissented, office spokesman Mat Marshall said. Jennings also noted that the First State falls under the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and so whatever happens in the 4th Circuit has no bearing on Delaware.\n\n\"I am convinced this bill is constitutional and that the appropriate courts will rule that it is constitutional,\" Jennings testified Thursday evening. \"My office is defending all the challenges to gun bills passed by this legislature, and I can tell you that as I stand here tonight, not one of those challenges has been successful.\"\n\nLegal challenges on gun reforms\n\nThe Delaware State Sportsman Association in 2022 filed a lawsuit challenging state legislation that prohibits most people under the age of 21 from purchasing or owning a firearm, arguing it discriminates against a class of people who have a “God-given and constitutionally protected right to defend themselves.”\n\nA Delaware Chancery Court judge later dismissed that lawsuit. Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock III said the suit raised legal issues that don't fall under the purview of the Chancery Court. Delaware gun rights advocates sought a permanent injunction to prevent the state from enforcing the law.\n\nThe association, along with other gun rights advocates, also filed similar suits in the U.S. District Court seeking a preliminary injunction to block legislation that banned assault weapons and high-capacity firearm magazines.\n\nMORE:Federal judge denies Del. gun groups preliminary injunction in assault weapons ban lawsuit\n\nJudge Richard Andrews last March denied the request, writing in his decision that the gun groups “failed to meet their burden” of proving two necessary factors: The likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawsuit over the state's ghost gun ban continues and a suit filed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation challenging Delaware's public nuisance law was dismissed in August.\n\nMarshall defended Delaware’s “permit to purchase” legislation’s constitutionality.\n\n“Permit to purchase laws have been on the books in this country for close to 30 years and, despite the NRA’s frantic efforts, none of Delaware’s gun laws have been overturned in court,” he said. “The leading cause of death for children in this country is not car accidents, not disease, but guns. This bill will help change that. If the gun lobby challenges it, we’ll be proud to defend it, and we’ll win.”\n\nGot a tip? Contact Amanda Fries at afries@delawareonline.com.

The legislation would make it a felony for medical providers to prescribe puberty-blockers or hormones to anyone under age 19 or to perform gender confirmation surgery on minors. The bill, sponsored by Trussville Republican Sen. Shay Shelnutt, passed 22-3, news outlets report. The legislation now moves to the state’s House of Representatives, where a similar bill was also approved by a health committee last month. Proponents have said it would stop “vulnerable children” from getting medical procedures and medications with uncertain long-term effects. LGBTQ activists and opponents of the bill have countered it is discriminatory and spreads misinformation. The American Academy of Pediatrics advised in 2018 that such treatments can be part of certain care models for children.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: Shoppers will no longer see a blue-sticker label on Gulf of Alaska cod after its sustainability certification is suspended starting in April. The label designates which fish are sustainably caught. Alaska’s Energy Desk reports the Marine Stewardship Council, which sets standards for sustainable fishing, will suspend the label starting April 5. Gulf of Alaska cod have had the certification for about 10 years. The impacts of losing certification are unclear. An independent audit found there were not enough young cod entering the gulf fishery, which led to the suspension. But auditors blame a climate change-caused heatwave from 2013 to 2016 for reducing gulf cod by more than half and pushing them to near-overfished status last year.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The U.S. Forest Service has given final approval to a project to replace and upgrade a ski lift at the Arizona Snowbowl. The Forest Service’s decision allowing replacement of the current chairlift is based on an environmental assessment published in October. Forest officials concluded that replacing the new lift would not significantly impact the land and environment, despite claims that it would affect Native American cultural values, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Arizona Snowbowl is located on the Coconino National Forest on the west side of the San Francisco Peaks, near Flagstaff. Arizona Snowbowl said the current chairlift will be replaced with a high-speed combination version that includes enclosed eight-person gondola cars and open-air six-person chair seats. The new lift will be installed in time for the 2020-21 season, the ski area said.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: A film festival co-founded by Academy Award-winning actress Geena Davis announced Friday that it’s moving to later in the year because of concerns about the new coronavirus. The Bentonville Film Festival, in northwest Arkansas, announced it will move this year’s festival, originally scheduled for April 29-May 2, to Aug. 5-8. The festival said it will honor passes and badges that have already been purchased for the festival. The official lineup will be announced by June, organizers said. “Our number one concern is the safety of our content creators and our community of attendees,” Davis, who is also the festival’s chairwoman, said in a statement. The Bentonville Film Festival began in 2015 and last year screened 162 films. Arkansas has not had any cases of coronavirus, which causes the illness called COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles International Airport will experiment with a limited restoration of taxi pickups in the central terminal area beginning later this month. Taxi drivers have been pushing to resume pickups there since taxi and ride-hailing pickups were moved to a lot outside the terminal loop last fall to ease traffic amid major construction. Airport officials said one taxi pickup location will be established in a parking structure near the Tom Bradley International Terminal and adjacent Terminal 3. Another taxi stand will be put back into service for travelers passing through Terminals 7 and 8. Last October, the airport moved all taxi and ride-hailing pickups from curbside to a satellite lot, dubbed LAX-it. Airport officials said the move was necessary to reduce traffic for construction of an automated people-mover train and its stations, as well as redevelopment of every terminal. Passengers can walk there or take constantly circulating shuttles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The owner-operator of a Denver-area oil refinery will pay $9 million to settle air quality violations dating to 2017, state officials announced Friday. The settlement with Calgary-based Suncor Energy is the biggest leveled by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to resolve air pollution violations. The Colorado Sun reports the settlement was announced by John Putnam, the agency’s environmental director, at a news conference. Suncor’s Commerce City refinery produces about a third of gasoline used by motor vehicles in Colorado and most of the jet fuel used at Denver International Airport. It processes about 98,000 barrels of oil daily, most of that from drillers along Colorado’s Front Range. On Dec. 11, the refinery released an ashy substance that blanketed adjacent neighborhoods. Suncor called the clay-like material catalyst and said it wasn’t hazardous.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: The state’s wine and spirits industry has joined forces with environmentalists to reduce litter, especially mini bottles of wine and spirits known as nips. The anti-litter partnership, known as Three Tiers for Connecticut, plans to launch the retail portion of its “Don’t Trash Connecticut - Nip it in the Bin!” campaign Tuesday. The campaign will focus on signage at retail locations, urging consumers to properly dispose of the bottles. A news conference is planned Tuesday at CT Beverage Mart in New Britain. The partnership has already held two community cleanup events in Norwalk and West Haven. More more cleanups and initiatives are scheduled for the coming year. Wine and spirits companies and organizations in Connecticut formed the partnership last year with the group Live Green CT, a statewide environmental organization that’s dedicated to eradicating land-based litter by 2025.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A federal judge has refused to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit against the state’s largest hospital system. The lawsuit filed by former Christiana Care compliance officer Ronald Sherman and backed by the federal government alleges that the hospital system defrauded taxpayers by funneling Medicaid payments to independent doctors as kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals. The judge denied Christiana’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit after holding a hearing Friday. Christiana Care argued that Sherman had no standing to file the lawsuit because he had previously executed a release discharging all causes of action against the hospital system when he was terminated in 2014. Christiana also argued that Sherman, on behalf of Christiana Care, had disclosed the allegations contained in his complaint to the government through compliance disclosure logs submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general’s office.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A federal magistrate on Friday excoriated the government for refusing to turn over its investigative file in the death of a Virginia man shot by U.S. Park Police. The files are sought by the family of Bijan Ghaisar, who died in 2017 after he was shot by Park Police officers multiple times at the conclusion of a stop-and-go chase on the George Washington Parkway. Ghaisar’s family is suing the government and the officers who shot Ghaisar. At a hearing Friday, U.S. Magistrate Ivan Davis said the government had no right to withhold the file from the Ghaisar family’s lawyers. He ordered the government to turn over the entire file by next Friday. Government lawyers said they have been delayed in turning over the file because the material in the file is sensitive and voluminous. Judge Davis, though, was unsympathetic. “You’re required to produce, period,” Davis said. “You do not decide unilaterally for yourself” whether material should be turned over.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: A woman who plays the French Horn in the Royal Canadian Navy took top honors in Key West’s 58th annual Conch Shell Blowing Contest on Saturday. Alliszon Zaichkowski of Victoria, British Columbia, won the women’s title performing excerpts from several melodies including composer Igor Stravinsky’s “The Firebird” and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” She’s such a fan of the quirky “instrument” that she had a large conch shell tattooed on her arm. “I like to think of the conch shell as my travel horn because I can’t bring my French horn everywhere, and you also don’t want to be playing a French horn at the beach,” she said. “So I always just take my conch shell with me, and that’s my vacation instrument.” In the men’s division, Vinnie Marturano of Big Pine Key tooted his way to victory by playing a portion of Aram Khachaturian’s “Sabre Dance.” The fluted, pink-lined conch shell, an enduring symbol of the Florida Keys, has been used as a signaling device in the islands for centuries. Today, native-born residents are known as Conchs, and the Keys island chain is often called the Conch Republic.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some students at a private school have been suspended indefinitely after a video surfaced showing them conducting an apparent mock lynching of another student with toilet paper in a school bathroom, officials said. Several boys at Cristo Rey Atlanta Jesuit High School were seen on video wrapping toilet paper around their heads and cutting holes for their eyes, news outlets report. Some were also seen wrapping what appears to be a toilet paper noose around another boy’s neck as he appears to pull up on a bathroom stall support beam as if being hanged. Officials at the college preparatory school acknowledged the incident Thursday. They said the act was reprehensible and wouldn’t be tolerated. They also said the students were suspended indefinitely while the school investigates. A school statement didn’t say how many youths were suspended, and the races of those involved weren’t immediately disclosed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A million trees could be planted in the state each year under a proposed program to increase the number of noninvasive trees. The Legislature is considering backing the tree-planting project started by University of Hawaii geography professor Camilo Mora to offset carbon emissions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Carbon Neutrality Resources initiative is responsible for planting thousands of trees in Hawaii. The most recent project involved 2,000 volunteers planting 11,000 trees in December, Mora said, adding that he hopes to increase to 100,000 this year and plant a million in 2021. The bill would place the state Department of Land and Natural Resources in charge of a program to plant a million native trees statewide each year. It was approved by the Senate on Tuesday and passed its first reading in the House on Thursday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The FBI is investigating after hackers stole as much as half a million dollars of state payments that were intended to go to contractors. Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf’s office revealed the theft in a statement late Friday afternoon, saying the hackers posed as state vendors and then changed the vendor’s banking information, diverting the payments into the hackers’ bank accounts. The fraud was first noticed by a controller’s office employee Feb. 26, according to the office. Few details were released about exactly how the thefts occurred, but officials said the hackers were able to change the banking information by “navigating state procedures.” “Regular payments made to those vendors by 20 state agencies were then diverted and stolen,” the release said. “The State has recovered some of the funds to date, however, the total amount of funds diverted is under $550,000.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials from the city and the NHP Foundation celebrated the opening of a renovated historic housing unit offering affordable single-room occupancy. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday that restoration of the Mark Twain on Chicago’s Near North Side will help keep the city affordable. The city teamed up with the NHP Foundation, a nonprofit real estate organization dedicated to preserving and expanding affordable housing, in a $54 million rehabilitation of the building. It created 148 affordable apartment units with private bathrooms and added private kitchenettes. It has all new plumbing and electrical systems, a rooftop deck, a restored vintage facade and nearly 10,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. The Chicago Housing Authority will provide rental assistance to the Mark Twain’s occupants. Fifty residents who lived there before the renovation have returned; the rest of the units will be leased to people on the authority’s waiting list.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: The city will start supplying free feminine hygiene products in all city building restrooms, including men’s and gender-neutral restrooms. The decision came after Purdue University’s move to offer an assortment of menstrual care products for free in campus bathrooms. After the City Council approved a similar resolution, Mayor John Dennis said West Lafayette was ready to start stocking feminine products in all restrooms in city facilities, including the $31.5 million Wellness and Aquatic Center scheduled to open in early 2021. City Council members Shannon King and Kathy Parker sponsored the resolution. “The mayor gave us a thumbs up, and he really had our back,” King said. During a pilot project in restrooms at Purdue, the faculty-led University Senate found the building averaged $27 a month to restock menstrual care products used from seven dispensers.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The names of three nominees to fill a vacant state Supreme Court seat have been passed to Gov. Kim Reynolds, who now has 30 days to appoint one of them as the high court’s next justice. The Judicial Nominating Commission on Friday afternoon announced the finalists: Mary Chicchelly, District Court Judge in the Sixth Judicial District out of Cedar Rapids; Matt McDermott, an attorney at Belin McCormick, P.C. in Des Moines; and David May, an Iowa Court of Appeals Judge in Polk City. The commission, composed of eight individuals elected by Iowa lawyers and nine commissioners appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, interviewed 15 applicants Friday to fill the seat that will be left empty upon former acting chief justice David Wiggins’ retirement in the coming weeks. The finalist will be Reynolds’s fourth appointment to the court since taking office in May 2017.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A couple hundred million years ago, an ocean covering Kansas teemed with prehistoric life. Yet for millennia, Kansas has been a dry, sometimes even dusty place. The ocean is long gone, but traces of that long-ago aquatic life were captured for the ages in fossil form. Now, paleontologists from the University of Kansas have an app they hope will help motivate people to go out and find that evidence, reports the Kansas News Service. The Digital Atlas of Ancient Life app was created by a group of paleontologists and researchers led by KU ecology and evolutionary biology professor Bruce Lieberman. The app boasts an extensive database with detailed pictures of fossils common to Kansas. KU owns thousands of fossil specimens, especially trilobites, cephalopods and ancient clams. The app is one way to share all of that information to smartphones around the world. If it motivates people to go out and find some of their own, Lieberman said, all the better.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state House overwhelmingly passed its version of a new two-year budget Friday, but some lawmakers said the unwillingness to tap into more revenue sources would shortchange many of the state’s pressing funding needs. The GOP-crafted spending plan drew bipartisan support in clearing the House 86-10. The measure now goes to the Republican-dominated Senate, which will put its imprint on the budget. The differences will likely be ironed out by legislative leaders in a conference committee. The House version changed Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s proposed pay raise for teachers to spread it to other school employees. It boosted school-security funding to hire hundreds of counselors. The House plan also scaled back Beshear’s proposal to add more social workers but offered salary enhancements to hire and retain more of them working in child protective services. The only new revenue source to help support the House spending plan would come from new taxes on vaping and tobacco productions, which would raise nearly $50 million over two years.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: The opening of an urban park is being delayed because the nonprofit organization behind the project has obtained more money for additional features. Lafayette Central Park Inc. initially hoped to open Moncus Park this spring, but with an extra $5 million in money raised, the organization is planning to open later in the year. Features already completed include a dog park. Features being added this year are an amphitheater and a “family area,” which includes a tree house, splash pad and playground. The nonprofit has received some contributions earlier than expected. For example, plans for the amphitheater were put into motion when Iberia Bank advanced a pledge of $1 million to the park, which wasn’t expected for another three years. With the additional money, the nonprofit and its board had to consider whether to push back the park’s opening date; use sporadic openings of sections; or have construction underway while the park is open.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: A historical museum that is part of the state’s popular Acadia National Park will be closed to the public this season as it undergoes rehabilitation work. The Islesford Historical Museum has been in the midst of rehab since November 2019. The National Park Service said the work will “allow for the protection and longevity of a historic building and for the safe exhibition of historical objects.” The museum is on the National Register of Historic Places and opened in the summer of 1928. The rehab work will include replacement of the original slate roof. The park service said money for the $1.1 million rehab is coming from entrance passes purchased at Acadia National Park and the service’s repair and rehabilitation funds. The service said the museum is scheduled to reopen during the following season with an exhibit about the Cranberry Isles.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A comprehensive education measure that will cost billions of dollars over the next decade with the goal of making the state’s K-12 schools among the world’s best was approved by the House of Delegates on Friday night. The House voted 96-41 for the bill, which still needs Senate approval. The legislation, known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, is based on the recommendations of a state commission that worked for three years on the proposal. The plan focuses on five policy areas: expanding early childhood education like pre-K; increasing teacher salaries; college and career readiness; aid for struggling schools; and accountability in implementation. The proposal would be phased in over a 10-year period. It would cost an additional $4 billion in fiscal year 2030, with a majority of the cost paid by the state while local governments also contribute.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWestborough: Fish and wildlife officials have started stocking the state’s ponds, lakes and rivers with more than 500,000 trout raised in five hatcheries. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife stocking program began last week with bodies of water on Cape Cod, as well as in southeastern Massachusetts and areas west of Boston. Some of the places stocked with rainbow trout include Spectacle Pond in Sandwich, Lake Cochituate in Natick and Houghton’s Pond in Milton. Other bodies of water will be stocked with brook, brown and tiger trout raised in hatcheries in Sandwich, Palmer, Belchertown, Sunderland and Montague. These fish, coupled with the more than 60,000 stocked last fall, will provide some excellent fishing in the coming months, the agency says. Most of the trout are longer than 12 inches, with more than 600 brown trout and 500 brook trout over 18 inches.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Five people who worked in a wildlife disease lab have been diagnosed with a latent form of tuberculosis, a spokesman said Friday. The Department of Natural Resources’ lab processes thousands of deer heads during the annual hunting season to check for chronic wasting disease and bovine TB. An illness caused by bacteria that attack the lungs, TB can be fatal, although a latent form shows no symptoms, doesn’t make people feel sick and is not contagious, according to federal health experts. It typically involves treatment to prevent full-blown TB. The DNR learned about the infections last year, including three people in June and two later in the summer, spokesman Ed Golder said. He said it was the department’s “working assumption” that the workers got TB from infected deer, “but we can’t say for sure.” The lab is located at Michigan State University.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Overall graduation rates for the state’s high school students have hit a historic high. The state Department of Education released data Thursday that shows a graduation rate of 83.7% for the class of 2019. That’s up half a percentage point from the prior year and up nearly 1.5 points over the past five years. Minnesota Public Radio News reports black and Hispanic students made the biggest gains, with improvements of more than 3 percentage points for Hispanics and more than 2 points for black students. Racial and socioeconomic disparities persist, with graduation rates higher for white students than they are for students of color. The data shows the rate for Native American students fell slightly this year. The rate remains the lowest among Minnesota high school students at just over half.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State legislators have killed bills that would either ban or regulate kratom, an herbal drug that can be used for pain relief. Kratom is currently unregulated in most parts of the United States but has been outlawed by a few local governments in Mississippi amid concerns that it can be harmful. Kratom is derived from a tree that’s native to Southeast Asia. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says the leaves can be crushed and then smoked, put into capsules, or taken with water or other liquids. The DEA characterizes kratom as one of its “drugs of concern.” The agency says people have used it to relieve muscle strains and as a substitute for opium; the drug has also been used to manage withdrawal symptoms from opioids. Bills to either ban or regulate kratom died Tuesday when committees did not consider them before the first big deadline of the legislative session.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: More than 170 firearms seized or recovered by police during an eight-month period last year were purchased from a single St. Louis-area pawn shop, federal authorities said in announcing charges against three men connected to the shop. Carlos Jones, 31; Robert Thornton, 36; and Steven Johnson, 44, were charged Thursday with unlawful transfer of firearm to a convicted felon and making false statements on firearm records. All three men worked at Piazza Jewelry and Pawn in Overland, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb. The federal complaint said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced 170 seized and recovered guns to sales at the pawn shop, with 102 of those guns recovered in the city of St. Louis. ATF Special Agent Chad Foreman wrote in an affidavit released Thursday that six of the confiscated guns were used in homicides, four in robberies and 20 in weapons offenses and were found in 36 cases in which a prohibited person was in possession of a firearm.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A landslide was blocking a BNSF Railway freight line in eastern Montana on Friday. The slide happened about 10 p.m. Wednesday about 10 miles west of Miles City, BNSF Railway spokeswoman Maia LaSalle said. Dirt covered about 800 feet of railway that runs along the Yellowstone River. Crews were still working Friday to clear the tracks, but the slide activity had not been stabilized, LaSalle said. Freight traffic was being rerouted around the blockage on Montana Rail Link tracks. The track that is blocked is part of a path that connects trains from North and South Dakota to southern routes through the Powder River region into Wyoming, The Billings Gazette reports. No trains were in the area at the time of the slide, and no injuries have been reported, BNSF said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOgallala: The state game and parks commission will vote March 20 on banning both alcohol possession and consumption at Lake McConaughy and neighboring Lake Ogallala in western Nebraska. The alcohol ban in the state-controlled areas is among several agreements the state worked out with local leaders to avert drastic cuts in access, The North Platte Telegraph reports. The commission had been considering access restrictions following complaints about overcrowding and rowdy behavior last Fourth of July. The proposed changes, which would have taken effect later this year, were meant to address the overcrowding on the lake’s beaches. But the commission delayed action in January after hundreds of people showed up for a hearing on the proposed rules. Most said they wanted more law enforcement and greater attention to checkpoints, not a crackdown to limit access.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Social media comments about protecting bears that were posted by Lake Tahoe activists and referred to a longtime wildlife biologist as a murderer constitute “good faith communications” protected as free speech, the state Supreme Court says. The recent opinion doesn’t end a lawsuit filed in Washoe County District Court in Reno. But it settles a key legal question in the dispute between Carl Lackey, a Nevada Department of Wildlife biologist, and Carolyn Stark, who administers a Facebook page that posts criticism of the state’s bear control tactics. The lawsuit is the latest development in a years­long legal and public relations battle between the agency and a group of activists who oppose state methods for managing bears. In 2018, a judge issued a protective order to keep Stark away from another state biologist who says Stark stalked her in a dispute over the capture of nuisance bears.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has written to congressional leaders asking for continued funding of the State Opioid Response Grant program, which helped New Hampshire create a new “hub and spoke” caregiver system. The state used its $45.8 million share of funding to set up its Doorway program of nine regional recovery centers. Sununu, in his letter Friday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said the program served more than 7,300 people in 2019 and provided more than 3,200 clinical evaluations to identify needed services. Of that group, over 2,400 people had opioid-related needs, and more than 5,000 referrals were made to medication-assisted treatment, outpatient, residential and peer recovery services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate: Residents in a Jersey Shore town that hates its new sand dunes will get a chance to say whether they support building a boardwalk. Margate’s government decided late Thursday to authorize a nonbinding referendum during the November general election asking voters whether they support building a boardwalk in the wealthy town south of Atlantic City. The proposal arose from widespread unhappiness with a beach replenishment project completed in 2017. Mayor Michael Becker said Friday that the town is not committing itself to building one if the vote goes that way. Rather, he said, there needs to be a mechanism for the town’s voters to clearly express their preference, and the commission will then weigh the pros and cons before deciding. Margate had a boardwalk in the early 1900s; it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1944.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMagdalena: The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is canceling group tours of its Very Large Array to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The observatory said Friday that the visitor center and gift shop will remain open, and self-guided walking tours will continue. But a semi-annual open house, guided tours and special tours for school groups will be put on hold between March 15 and May 31. The move is meant to protect visitors and the workers who keep the facility running, Tony Beasley, the observatory director, said in a news release. “Our first priority is the safety and health of our visitors and our staff, and these cancellations are being done to minimize the risk of exposure to this virus,” Beasley said. Astronomers use the Very Large Array to observe natural radiowaves from distant stars and planets.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Video showing New York City police officers arresting a young black man sparked outrage and elicited questions about the amount of force used to make the arrest in a city where mistrust of police remains high more than five years after Eric Garner’s death from an officer’s chokehold. Fitzroy Gayle, 20, pleads for help in the video, recorded by a woman who then tweeted it, as several officers wrestle him into submission Wednesday evening on a Brooklyn sidewalk. When Gayle asks a lone plainclothes officer why he was being stopped, the officer does not appear to answer before uniformed backup rushes in. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said he was ordering an internal investigation. The man in the video had fled officers who approached him and another man as they were smoking marijuana in a park about 7 p.m., Shea said. The officers were responding to an automated alert to gunshots, Shea said. Both men were later apprehended, but there is no indication they were linked to the gunfire, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s residents are getting more site-specific information this year about the air that they breathe and whether it might make sense to keep inside. The state Division of Air Quality announced last week that daily air-quality forecasts will now be issued for 91 of the state’s 100 counties and two mountain ridge zones. In the past, forecasts have been regional. A website provides real-time air quality index measurements, while next-day and extended forecast products will be posted each afternoon and updated in the morning. Index readings correspond to a color-coded advisory system that describes when the air can be unhealthy for some or many. Last week started what’s considered the ozone season, or when concentrations of the gas can be highest in the air as days get warmer. The division says ozone concentrations have been declining due to emission reductions from power plants, cars and industry.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: New rules for the state’s presidential caucuses are likely to drive up turnout and could shrink Bernie Sanders’ organizational advantage over Joe Biden when the state’s Democratic voters get their say this week in what has essentially become a two-man race. North Dakota is the smallest prize of the six states holding caucuses or primaries Tuesday, with only 14 pledged delegates at stake. As a result, it hasn’t gotten much attention from either candidate. What’s new for North Dakota voters in 2020 is that the system is more like a primary than a traditional caucus. People are free to vote and leave. Democrats can vote at 14 locations across the state, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. CST and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. MST. Republicans will have seven polling places open from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time, where voters can express their support for President Donald Trump. And in a boon to rural voters, mail-in ballots will be accepted.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A tree that appeared overnight during the 1979 U.S. Open to become a part of golf lore has met its end. The Black Hills spruce known as “The Hinkle Tree” was partially uprooted by a gust of wind last week at Inverness Club in Toledo and was cut down. The tree dated to the 79th Open, when a journeyman pro named Lon Hinkle came up with a way to outsmart the course during the first round. Hinkle noticed he could take a shortcut by hitting through a gap of trees near the eighth tee and drive his ball on the adjacent 17th fairway, shaving 75 yards off the dogleg hole. It made for an easy birdie, but U.S. Golf Association officials were not amused. The USGA dispatched the course’s greens chairman to bring in a tree from a nursery and block the shortcut. Overnight, the Black Hill spruce, about 20 feet tall, appeared in the gap. But during the next round, Hinkle and his playing partner, Chi Chi Rodriguez, decided to hit their tee shots over the tree.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A man who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2018 has been found guilty of assault and battery for shooting a process server trying to give him legal documents. Jurors on Thursday rejected Christopher Jonathan Barnett’s argument that he shot and wounded the man who came to his Tulsa home in July in self defense. On the stand, Barnett asserted the process server presented a threat to him, though he conceded the man never pointed a weapon at him. Jurors recommended Barnett be sentenced to 32 years in prison and fined $10,000. A judge will sentence Barnett in April. The Tulsa World reports video and audio evidence presented to the jury showed the process server just flashed legal documents at Barnett, who kept his front door closed while they spoke. Defense attorney Jason Lollman said he plans to appeal and believes the sentencing recommendation was too harsh.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state has reached an agreement with private health insurance companies to waive co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles for Oregonians who undergo testing for COVID-19 at a facility that’s within their insurance network, Gov. Kate Brown announced. The agreement also will apply to a vaccine for the virus if one becomes available, she said in a statement Thursday. The state is pursuing the same agreement with self-insured health plans and also seeking clarification from the federal government about exceptions to cost-sharing for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as health savings account-eligible high-deductible health plans, she said. “No one should have to ask if getting a COVID-19 test is something they can afford. I hope this agreement sets a framework that other states can follow nationwide,” Brown said in the statement.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nEphrata: A small family-owned pharmacy chain is closing its five central Pennsylvania stores after a 141-year run. Royer Pharmacy in Lancaster County calls itself one of the oldest continuously operating independent pharmacies in the nation. It’s been operated by two families since a young pharmacist named George Royer bought the business in 1879. Company officials cited the age of the owners and decreasing insurance reimbursements that made it difficult to remain in business. “It’s been a great run,” Royer President Donald Sherman said in a news release. Royer said patient files will be transferred to CVS after the stores close by March 18, and employees would be considered for jobs at the nationwide chain. Royer had locations in Ephrata, Lancaster, Akron and Leola.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s highest court has refused to hear a strip club’s appeal of a punishment the city had levied against it over allegations of prostitution. The Rhode Island Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the Wild Zebra’s bid to have its adult entertainment license restored. The court did not explain why it would not consider the appeal. The Providence Board of Licenses heard testimony in January from two detectives who said that while undercover at the Wild Zebra Gentlemen’s Club in May dancers offered to have sex with them or perform sexual acts on them in exchange for money. The club denies the allegations of prostitution. An attorney for the club didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Providence Journal. The Providence board stripped the Wild Zebra of its liquor and adult entertainment licenses. A state regulatory department gave the club its liquor license back while it pursues its appeal, but it has remained closed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With spring just around the corner, emergency officials in the state say it’s time to begin preparing for severe weather. Gov. Henry McMaster declared this week South Carolina Severe Weather and Flood Safety week. Emergency officials will work all week with the National Weather Service to give safety and preparation tips for floods, tornadoes and severe storms that became more likely as the weather warms. On Wednesday, there will be a statewide tornado drill as schools and businesses across the state are asked to take shelter under their tornado safety plans and as forecasters test weather radios and other devices programmed to go off when a tornado warning is issued. Emergency officials are also pushing for flood safety. Flash floods after massive rains in October 2015 killed 19 people in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State wildlife officials have decided to scale back Gov. Kristi Noem’s program that pays bounties for predators that raid migratory birds’ nests. KELO-TV reports the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission voted 6-2 on Friday to extend the program for a second year. But the commission reduced the spending cap from $500,000 to $250,000. It also reduced the size of the bounty from $10 per tail from a raccoon, striped skunk, opossum, red fox or badger to $5 per tail. Bounties will now be paid regardless of whether the predator is shot or trapped; last year bounties applied only if a predator was trapped. The program starts April 1 and runs through July 1. Only South Dakota residents can participate. Chairman Gary Jensen and Mary Anne Boyd were the only two commissioners who voted against continuing the program. Jensen said science doesn’t support the program, and it’s designed to help trappers, whom he says are doing well anyway.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to move toxin-laden coal ash from a retired plant in the city to an off-site landfill, at the cost of roughly $300 million, the federal utility said Friday. TVA is considering six landfills in the South after it decided to move 3.5 million cubic yards of coal ash – the byproduct of burning coal for power – from the old Allen Fossil Plant in south Memphis, rather than keep the material in place. The TVA said it prefers taking the coal ash to an offsite landfill rather than moving it to a processing facility because construction and operation of the facility would delay economic development of the Allen site and lead to issues with air and noise emissions, safety risks and public disruption, the TVA said in an environmental impact report. Removal would cost about $300 million and take about seven to 10 years, TVA spokesman Scott Brooks said.\n\nTexas\n\nSanta Fe: A teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a high school in 2018 was able to buy more than 100 rounds of ammunition online because his age was not verified, according to a lawsuit alleging the website involved broke federal law. Dimitrios Pagourtzis was a 17-year-old junior at the time of the May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School. Federal law prohibits minors from purchasing handgun ammunition and bars licensed gun companies from selling handgun or shotgun ammunition to minors or anyone they have reason to believe is under the age of 21. According to an amended lawsuit filed Thursday, Pagourtzis initially ordered 50 rounds of hollow-point handgun ammunition and 105 rounds of 12-gauge shotgun ammunition, the Houston Chronicle reports. Two weeks later, he purchased an additional 35 rounds of shotgun ammunition – both times from the website Luckygunner.com that did not require him to make an account, submit proof of age or set-up a secure two-step authorization, the filing said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A slimmed-down version of a measure to require warning labels on pornography passed the state Senate on Friday. The proposal would now mandate a one-sentence warning label for online or print material deemed legally obscene, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. A relatively small slice of porn is considered obscene, but that hardcore material has fewer constitutional protections. The label would say that “exposing minors to obscene material may damage or negatively impact minors.” A website could also embed in its metadata the searchable text, “utahobscenitywarning.” The porn industry has objected to the plan, saying it could have constitutional problems and open the floodgates for lawsuits. If it does not appear on a print publication or is not displayed for 15 seconds online, producers could be fined $2,500 for each civil violation.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Three out of about a dozen Vermont towns passed resolutions on Town Meeting Day to become Second Amendment “sanctuary” towns, supporting gun rights and opposing more state and federal gun control laws, organizers said. About a half-dozen towns where the resolution was proposed did not take up the measure on Town Meeting Day on Tuesday because officials did not feel it was appropriate for the setting, said Eric Davis, president of Gun Rights Vermont. Lowell, Eden and Whittingham passed the resolution, he said. The town of Barton rejected the proposal. The voice vote Tuesday was close, Town Clerk Kristin Atwood told the Caledonian Record. Select boards in the towns of Holland and Pittsford adopted the resolution to become sanctuary towns earlier this year. The resolutions are not legally binding.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Three black astronauts joined hundreds of other mourners Saturday at a memorial service for pioneering African American mathematician and NASA researcher Katherine Johnson. Johnson, who calculated rocket trajectories and Earth orbits for NASA’s early space missions and was later portrayed in the 2016 film “Hidden Figures,” about pioneering black female aerospace workers, died Feb. 24 at the age of 101. More than 700 people turned out for Saturday’s memorial service at the Hampton University Convocation Center. “I think about the journey that she’s going on now,” astronaut Leland Melvin said. “We can’t calculate the speed that she’s traveling to get to heaven.” Melvin was joined by fellow astronauts Yvonne Cagle and Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space. Johnson was remembered not just as a pioneering researcher but as a faithful church leader and family matriarch. “Grandma, because of you, our world will forever be unlimited,” grandson Michael Moore said. “And because of you, I have no bounds.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state has become the 10th to prohibit homicide defendants from claiming a defense based on panic over a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Gov. Jay Inslee signed the measure Thursday. It takes effect in June. Nine other states – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey New York and Rhode Island – have already banned the use of gay or transgender panic as a legal defense. The Washington state measure is named after Nikki Kuhnhausen, a transgender teen who was killed last year, The Columbian reports. It was approved with bipartisan support in the state House and the Senate, though some lawmakers questioned if the legislation was necessary since a panic defense has never been used in Washington.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Foster parents who adopt children with special needs may soon get more money under a wide-ranging proposal passed Friday by the state Senate to reduce the state’s overburdened foster system. Senators voted unanimously to approve the proposal. It now moves back to the House of Delegates for that chamber to approve the Senate’s amendments. The measure directs state officials to expand a tiered system that would give higher payments to people who take in children with emotional, behavioral or intellectual problems. It sets aside $16.9 million for the payment system. The tiered system would have to be up and running by July 2021. Child-placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSpring Green: The school that architect Frank Lloyd Wright started nearly 90 years ago may stay open after all. The board of the School of Architecture at Taliesin announced in January that the school would close in June because the board and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, the school’s biggest financial supporter, had failed to come up with a way to keep the school open. The foundation said then that the school lacked a sustainable business model. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the board voted Thursday to keep the school open in light of new funding. The decision to remain open is still subject to approval by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. The foundation issued a statement Friday saying it has little information about the new funding sources. Board Chairman Dan Schweiker said new supporters have come forward.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Jackson Hole’s largest elk herd is thriving and appears to have grown slightly over the past year after hunters had a historically tough time finding animals and filling tags. Wyoming Game and Fish Department harvest data for 2019 estimates that 794 hunters who targeted zones roamed by the Jackson Elk Herd found success and filled their freezer, according to the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “That’s about half of what it normally is,” Game and Fish wildlife biologist Aly Courtemanch said. “Usually, there’s more like 1,500 or 1,600 elk harvested, both bulls and cows.” The 30-year average harvest in the Jackson Herd is 2,098 elk, though the kill hasn’t surpassed 2,000 since the early 2000s – when the herd size started shrinking by design. Fall 2019 elk hunts were slow across the board.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2016/05/25/overtime-rules-small-businesses/84916292/", "title": "New OT rules pose challenges for Delaware small businesses", "text": "Scott Goss\n\nThe (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — The Obama administration's new overtime policy unveiled last week updates a long-standing exemption that allows employers to avoid paying overtime wages to executive, administrative or professional employees. The new rules will boost pay for up to 4.2 million workers nationwide who are currently excluded from receiving one-and-a-half times their regular pay for working more than 40 hours a week.\n\nFor Ryan Davis, who works about 50 hours a week as an assistant manager at a Grotto Pizza in Rehoboth Beach, Del., he could be eligible for overtime pay starting Dec. 1.\n\nDuring the summer he works up to 70 hours, but as a salaried employee, his paycheck is the same no matter how many hours he puts in.\n\n\"I would definitely benefit from that,\" the 26-year-old said. \"I think it would be something like another $500 in my paycheck.\"\n\nInvestors aren't sweating over overtime pay\n\nIn announcing the new rules, the president said, \"This is a step in the right direction to strengthen and secure the middle class by raising Americans' wages. When workers have more income, they spend it — often at businesses in their local community — and that helps grow the economy for everyone.\"\n\nWhile workers like Davis may benefit, trade groups and labor leaders in Delaware are divided over whether the new rule will be a boon for the economy or just another costly regulation for small businesses, which employ about half of the state's private work force.\n\n\"Anytime workers can get a raise, that's good news,\" said James Maravelias, head of the Delaware AFL-CIO. \"I'm sure businesses are going to think of 101 reasons why it's going to hurt them, but I don't see this being a detriment to anyone.\"\n\nRichard Heffron, president of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, said he agrees federal overtime rules needed to be updated to keep up with inflation. But he said the changes announced last week will impose too great a burden, too fast.\n\nOvertime pay: What you need to know about the new rule\n\n\"What businesses like is certainty and this rule means that all of a sudden they're facing this big additional cost,\" he said. \"If it were imposed over time, I think it would have been a lot easier for small businesses to adjust.\"\n\nMany local businesses say they're still grappling with how to deal with the changes, which go into effect on Dec. 1 — during the holiday shopping season.\n\nTough choices ahead\n\nCurrently, U.S. businesses can avoid paying overtime to certain salaried employees who earn more than $455 a week by classifying them as a \"manager.\" At an annual salary of $23,660 a year, that pay puts a family of four below the federal poverty guideline with no means of earning extra income by working more hours.\n\nThe regulations issued by the U.S. Labor Department last week will double that threshold to $913 a week. That means salaried employees who earn less than $47,476 a year — from fast food and retail supervisors to bank branch managers — will soon qualify for overtime. That's about $57 per week less than the proposed rules released in draft form last year.\n\nA harsh blow to small businesses: Opposing view\n\nThe current threshold covers about 7% of full-time, salaried workers. The new rules would lift that ratio back to 35%, raising aggregate pay by $1.2 billion a year over the next decade.\n\nThe change represents the first time the federal overtime rules have been updated since 2004. The new regulations require that the threshold now be updated every three years, while pegging that increase to the 40th percentile of full-time salaried workers in the U.S. Census region with the lowest incomes. That means the threshold could rise to more than $51,000 on Jan. 1, 2020, according to the White House.\n\nSeveral business owners said they are now facing four basic options for dealing with the new rules: They can hike managers' salary to keep them exempt from the new rules. They can make no changes and simply pay out the overtime to their managers. They can shift those salaried workers to an hourly wage and hold them below 40 hours per week. Or they can hire part-time workers without benefits to cover the overtime that was previously worked by those managers.\n\nRada Paul Rada, chairman of the Delaware Hotel & Lodging Association, said the new rules pose a particularly difficult problem for small businesses.\n\n\"Larger businesses are in a better position to handle these things, but for us small guys paying a ton of overtime is not something we can afford,\" he said.\n\nMillions more Americans to be eligible for overtime pay\n\nFor small shops, the National Retail Federation predicts the majority of store managers will see a loss of hours, rather than a bump in pay.\n\n\"With the stroke of a pen, the Labor Department is demoting millions of workers,\" said David French, the trade group's senior vice president.\n\nGrotto Pizza, which operates 23 locations in three states, is still trying to figure out which of those options makes the most sense, said human resources director Glenn Byrum.\n\nThe company employs about 1,300 workers at the height of the summer season; about 3% are impacted by the new overtime threshold.\n\n\"It definitely poses a problem for us,\" said Byrum. \"It's either going to cost more money or we'll need to have some sensitive conversations with some of our key staff about why we're cutting back their hours.\"\n\nMore with less\n\nOvertime has become a sore subject for many managers and assistant managers in recent years. Workers with Chipotle, Dollar General, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo have filed suits against their employers, claiming their overtime hours are spent doing the same work as hourly staff.\n\nRada said he understands how not being forced to work extra hours with no extra pay will be a big plus for some salaried workers. But, the general manager of the Clarion Hotel The Belle near Wilmington, said the new rules means \"somebody is going to have to do more with less.\"\n\n\"I think for us little guys, everyone is going to have to come up with their own way to handle it, whether that's adjusting schedules or adding part-time staffers,\" he said.\n\nBob Older, president of the Delaware Small Business Chamber, questioned the assumption that the rule change will be a boon for the economy.\n\n\"Consumers are going to be hit just as hard because the only way businesses can pay for this is by raising prices,\" he said. \"I think it's going to wind up costing people more money than the bump in pay they might get in which case it will hurt the very people it's trying to help.\"\n\nOther business owners offered a more optimistic view.\n\n\"I think it's great,\" said SoDel Concepts President Scott Kammerer, whose company operates eight Sussex County, Del., restaurants, with a ninth on the way.\n\n\"We're all for everything that helps the community and the people in it,\" he said through a spokesperson. \"And we support anything that's going to make the country stronger.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.

While it has dominated news coverage for weeks, it's for good reason: There won't be another solar eclipse in the U.S. for 20 years.\n\nJournalists with Delaware Online/The News Journal were out and about throughout the day, reporting from communities, schools and museums.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the event.\n\nEclipse glasses:Where to get solar eclipse glasses, eclipse safety and how to make your own solar viewers\n\nWhat time does the solar eclipse start in Delaware?\n\nThough Delawareans won't be able to see a full eclipse of the sun, the partial eclipse began at 2:07 p.m. and will end at 4:34 p.m. local time.\n\nThe maximum eclipse begins at 3:23 p.m.\n\nFor the 0.55% of the population, or 43.8 million people who will be able to see the total eclipse, it will be visible at 4:41 p.m. The duration of totality will last four minutes and 28 seconds, nearly double that of the total solar eclipse seen in the United States in 2017, according to Great American Eclipse.\n\nAbout 8.19% of the population, or 652 million people, will be able to see the partial eclipse. No matter the time of day it is, the sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk.\n\nNo, you're not imagining a temperature drop\n\nAs the moon begins to obscure more and more of the sun, you may have noticed it's already getting darker out. With that decrease in light also comes a drop in temperature.\n\nNASA says most people can expect the temperature to decrease about 10 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius) depending on the humidity and cloud cover. It'll get warmer again once the moon moves past the sun.\n\nEclipse viewing at Auburn Heights Preserve in Yorklyn\n\nMore than 100 people parked cars around 2:30 p.m. and began making a short trek to a Yorklyn hillside to watch the eclipse.\n\nThe Auburn Heights Preserve, directly across from the historic 19th century Marshall mansion in Auburn Valley State Park, is normally only used for parking, a state park employee said on Monday.\n\nBut on Eclipse Day, a crowd hiked up the steep, grassy hill, spread out blankets, and set up camping chairs.\n\nA park employee said the site is considered one of the highest spots in Delaware.\n\nSome families with children blew soap bubbles to pass the time, others chased dogs through the grass, and still others donned glasses and eagerly looked toward the slightly overcast sky.\n\n\"Let's hope the clouds move,\" said another park official as she handed out eclipse glasses. \"It's playing hard to get.\"\n\nThe atmosphere felt like an outdoor music festival but with no music or stage.\n\n\"We might have a slight chance to see something,\" said a man who sat with a group of women. \"Oh, here we come!\" he said as the sun peeked out of the clouds and brightened the sky.\n\nThe crowd began cheering at about 3:10 p.m. and many started clapping.\n\n\"It's so slight, but I can see it!\" said a woman, who also joined in on the clapping.\n\n— Patricia Talorico\n\nAt University of Delaware, students watch eclipse\n\nCheers and claps carried across the University of Delaware’s campus as the maximum partial eclipse set in.\n\n“Woohoo! Yeah!” a student could be heard shouting at 3:23 p.m., eventually joined by a chorus of peers.\n\nMorris Library staff took over the area outside of the building as they took a quick break to enjoy the event. Students looking for a last-minute spot to watch stopped in their tracks or quickly huddled with others to see the action.\n\nAlthough some students packed up and left once 3:30 p.m. hit and the maximum partial eclipse passed, plenty of observers remained camped out for the long haul, phones and eclipse glasses still pointed toward the sky. A student on the South Green climbed a tree to set up a hammock.\n\nThe once-crowded Green saw a lot less action once the partial eclipse approached its last leg in Newark.\n\nPeople could still be seen enjoying the sunshine and spring weather, but most photographers and eclipse-watchers parted ways with the astronomical event and went on with their days. Backpacks were slung over shoulders and folded blankets were thrown over arms as students headed to their next destinations.\n\nAs the partial eclipse wound down around 4:30 p.m., eclipse glasses were unfolded for a final time.\n\n— Krys'tal Griffin\n\nClear skies, perfect viewing in Rehoboth Beach\n\nIt was a downright gorgeous day in downtown Rehoboth Beach. Clouds did not block views of the sun as the moon passed in front of it, much to the delight of people gathered on the beach and boardwalk to watch. The mood was merry as strangers chatted with each other about where they were from and shared past eclipse experiences.\n\nDevar Burbage, of Potomac, Maryland, walked down the boardwalk offering views of the crescent shadows through backwards binoculars.\n\nJJ Catts, of Rehoboth Beach, sat with family and friends on the steps of the bandstand, looking at the sky through protective glasses. He was in Rehoboth in the 1970s for a total solar eclipse, he said.\n\nNina Helwig and three female family members, from Maryland and New Jersey, had just arrived and checked into their hotel before making their way to the boardwalk to watch the eclipse.\n\nEd and Beth Redfield, of Wilmington, were in town for Beth's birthday. They were laid out on the sunny beach with their dog, Kona, and protective glasses.\n\nDwight Johnson and Michelle Terry, of D&S Equestrian Center of Dover, had a unique eclipse experience. They rode their horses, Romeo and Rain, down the beach from Lewes to Rehoboth as the moon moved in front of the sun. They wanted to see how the horses behaved, Terry said.\n\n\"They were very anxious,\" Johnson said. \"I was waiting for (Rain) to get her breath, but she didn't want to stop, she just kept going.\"\n\nThey horses calmed once they got into some shade on Rehoboth Avenue, Johnson said, where people were stopping to pose for photos with them.\n\n— Shannon Marvel McNaught\n\nWatching the solar eclipse from Eclipse Bistro\n\nIt should come as no surprise that a place named Eclipse Bistro had a busier-than-normal lunch business during Monday’s solar eclipse.\n\nThe Wilmington restaurant lured diners with half-price wine bottles, day-long happy hour specials and $8 espresso martinis with manager Nick Taggart giving them free eclipse glasses when they left.\n\nAmong the crowd was Brandywine Festival of the Arts organizer Barry Schlecker, brought there by his wife Weiss to celebrate his 84th birthday over crab cakes and French fries.\n\n“I asked him where he wanted to go to lunch. He was hemming and hawing so I said, ‘Let’s go to Eclipse.’ It seemed appropriate,” she said.\n\nAbout a half hour before the maximum eclipse, two tables filled on the restaurant’s patios with diners alternating between munching beef skewers and looking skyward at the solar anomaly.\n\nKerri Klingensmith and her husband M.J. drove from Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, for the event, armed with their own plastic eclipse glasses.\n\n“Being at Eclipse for the eclipse is going to make it memorable,” she said. “We’ll always remember it.”\n\nThe next table over, Wilmington’s Sheri Stump and Bill Irvin, owner of city restaurants Snuff Mill Restaurant, Butchery & Wine Bar and The Brandywine, couldn’t pass up the uniqueness of it all.\n\n“How could we not come to a place called Eclipse?” Irvin asked.\n\nBut shortly after the two tables got settled, several large clouds moved in overhead, blocking the big moment.\n\nThe sky darkened, the temperature dropped and there was suddenly no need for sunglasses.\n\n“This sucks,” Kerri Klingensmith lamented. Responded her husband: “Nobody’s going blind today.”\n\n— Ryan Cormier\n\nJust before peak eclipse: A family reunion finds itself by the side of I-95\n\nA family reunion in New Jersey found itself on the side of a Delaware highway during the eclipse.\n\nOn the sidewalk out front of the Delaware Welcome Center outside Newark, also known as the Biden Welcome Center, sisters Barbara Miller and Mary Finch, and niece Kira Mauro, set up shop with their eclipse glasses next to barren trees adorned by stray strips of tissue caught in the breeze.\n\nThey hadn't intended to be along the side of a Delaware highway for this eclipse: But they got a late start this morning, said Kira.\n\nNone live in Delaware, nor New Jersey for that matter. Barbara lives in Fort Howard, Maryland, while Mary lives in Illinois. Kira, at the rest stop with her young daughter, had flown in from Florida.\n\nBut the family had traveled from all over the country Sunday night to support an art show by Kira's father, Paul Miller, showing his mosaic art at the April show for the Ocean County Artists Guild in Island Heights, New Jersey.\n\nAnd on their way back to Maryland, they all found themselves here, just outside Newark, when they realized the eclipse had caught up with them.\n\nAs clouds passed over the sun again and again, we wondered if they were disappointed at the overcast weather.\n\n“Not at all,” said Kira. “It’s easier to take pictures with my phone.”\n\nThen she stopped, observing a bird picking up a strand of apparent toilet paper caught in the trees outside the Welcome Center.\n\n“Oh look!” she said. “It’s building a nest.”\n\n— Matthew Korfhage\n\nSen. Cory Booker watches the eclipse from a Delaware rest stop\n\nYou never know whom you’ll run into during an eclipse.\n\nAround the eclipse’s peak at 3:23, New Jersey U.S. Sen. Cory Booker strolled onto the parking lot of the Delaware Welcome Center with eclipse glasses in hand. He was greeted warmly by other onlookers.\n\n“It wasn’t intentional,” Booker told us a little later about his eclipse viewing along the side of I-95 in Delaware.\n\nBooker was on his way to the capital from his home state, he said, when he and his team witnessed a terrible car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. “Literally right in front of us,” he said.\n\nThey pulled over to the site of the accident, he said. (The 511NJ Twitter account shows a crash, with a truck fire, at around 2 p.m. near the Delaware Memorial Bridge.)\n\n“We got out of the car to try to help render aid to the first responders out there,” Booker said. “And so we ended up trapped there just trying to help out. The car burst into flames.”\n\nBy the time he got back on the road, there was no hope of getting to Washington, D.C. before the eclipse. And so as the eclipse neared its peak, the former Newark, New Jersey, mayor pulled off the highway near Newark, Delaware, to get a look.\n\n“I’m happy to be here at Joe Biden’s rest stop!” he said, smiling as a young man approached with his hand outstretched.\n\n“Senator Booker,” said the young man. “I just wanted to shake your hand.”\n\n— Matthew Korfhage\n\nUD groups gathered ahead of eclipse\n\nIn Newark, University of Delaware students trickled to and from classes as the partial eclipse in Delaware began a little after 2 p.m.\n\nSmall groups of students were spaced out on the Green, a grassy area running through the main campus, enjoying the sun and waiting for the maximum eclipse to begin. With just over an hour until the main show, eclipse glasses eagerly popped out of bags and back pockets as students checked for changes in the sky.\n\nAside from students, locals could also be seen camping out and periodically looking up at the sun, along with a few lucky tour groups that passed through campus once in a while.\n\nOn the eastern portion of campus, the Harrington Turf was filled with students on blankets and towels minutes before the maximum eclipse began. Where you’ll usually find undergraduates playing volleyball in the sand or kickball on the turf, today’s crowd was filled with shared snacks and upturned heads.\"\n\nWhile the University of Delaware did not officially cancel classes for the event, some professors took the liberty of canceling class duties to let students enjoy the occasion. One student walking from an academic building could be heard saying that their professor canceled their exam to make sure everyone would be available to watch the eclipse.\n\nStudents who had been parked on the grass since the onset of the partial eclipse could be seen playing soccer to pass the time. Or taking a nap, as one student chose to do.\n\nA baby, who may be the youngest eclipse-goer on campus, toddled on a blanket under the shade of a tree. Despite the shining sun, cloud cover over Newark made for chilly spells as wind blows through town.\n\nAs the countdown to the maximum partial eclipse continued, more students congregate in green spaces and walkways to solidify their viewing plans. Some professors head outside with their classes for group eclipse viewing. Even a few runners had pairs of eclipse glasses in their hands while jogging around the area.\n\n— Krys'tal Griffin\n\nEclipse begins in Wilmington, but some nap instead\n\nIn Rodney Square and all around the Market Street area, pockets of office workers cheered at little glimpses of the eclipse that appeared through the clouds. They squinted at their cell phones, trying to capture a social-media worthy image and passed around glasses so everyone could try to get a view.\n\nAnd as the clouds over Wilmington began to dissipate and the sky brightened as the moon and sun’s positions began to diverge, people started slowly trickling back into their offices.\n\n“Back to work,” one man in a suit said as he took his eyes off the sky.\n\nAs the moon began to pass between the Earth and Sun above Market Street in Wilmington, delivery workers continued their routes, lawyers trudged toward Wilmington's courthouse and business continued as normal.\n\n\"We are going to try to get out,\" said one local coffee shop barista when asked if she was going to sneak outside to see the event.\n\nIn Rodney Square, one group was set up with a blanket on the ground and glasses over their eyes feet away from another person taking a mid-afternoon nap on the grass.\n\nAs the eclipse neared its peak, pockets of office workers stood on street corners downtown looking up.\n\nWhen a thick patch of clouds obscured the sun, a delivery driver stood in the middle of Shipley Street, hands to the sky and yelling \"boooooo.\"\n\n\"Welcome to the East Coast I guess,\" he said with a laugh after.\n\n— Xerxes Wilson\n\nDelaware beachgoers begin watching the sky\n\nDebbie McGill of Laurel, Maryland, had scored a prime boardwalk bench at the top of Rehoboth Avenue in Rehoboth Beach around 2 p.m.\n\n\"When I was a kid my dad took us to one and he loved astronomy, so it's kind of a memory of him,\" she said.\n\nThe eclipse is a spiritual experience for McGill, too.\n\n\"You think about tribes a thousand years ago... What they thought when this happened. It's really bigger than us. It's a big deal, I think.\"\n\n— Shannon Marvel McNaught\n\nWhy you should play 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' during your viewing\n\nHave the lyrics to the 1983 single \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" been running through your mind in recent weeks?\n\nWell, it's an appropriate ballad for Monday's eclipse.\n\nRunning for 4 minutes and 27 seconds, the song perfectly matches up with the eclipse's longest duration of totality, which NASA said will be 4 minutes and 28 seconds near Torreón, Mexico. The path of totality is where observers will see the moon completely cover the sun.\n\nMost residents situated along the path of totality will see a totality duration between 3.5 and 4 minutes.\n\nWatch the solar eclipse from NASA telescopes\n\nIf you can't − or don't want to − head outside, you can watch the eclipse on YouTube, through NASA's telescope feed.\n\nWatch USA Today's solar eclipse livestream\n\nWant to see the eclipse from multiple perspectives? USA Today's live broadcast has you covered. Watch here:\n\nWhat happens if you look at the solar eclipse without glasses?\n\nJust because our former president did it doesn't mean you should, too.\n\nYes, we mean that you shouldn't stare directly at the sun during a solar eclipse − or any other time, for that matter.\n\nThe concentrated solar rays will burn through your eye lenses and corneas, reaching the macula, which is part of the retina, NASA says.\n\nYES, IT REALLY IS DAMAGING:Can you really go blind from looking at a solar eclipse? Real life cautionary tales.\n\nAnd according to the American Medical Association, even a few seconds of viewing the sun during an eclipse can temporarily or permanently burn the macula.\n\n\"Once retina tissue is destroyed, it cannot regenerate, resulting in permanent central vision loss,\" a March 8 research article says.\n\nCan you drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nYes, it's safe to drive, but AAA reminds drivers that there could be more traffic on the road before, during and after the event, so people should use caution.\n\nAdditionally, Delaware State Police is reminding motorists not to wear their eclipse glasses while they drive.\n\nADDITONAL ECLIPSE DRIVING TIPS:Solar eclipse 2024: Is it safe to drive during the eclipse? How to stay safe\n\nNASA launching rockets to study effects of eclipse\n\nNASA is using spacecraft called sounding rockets that are equipped with scientific instruments to take measurements and perform experiments during Monday's eclipse, USA Today reported.\n\nThe three rockets will launch from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia and will reach an intended altitude of 260 miles, NASA said. That's high enough to study disturbances during a total solar eclipse in the ionosphere, a region of Earth’s atmosphere between 55 to 310 miles above the ground.\n\nSTORY:NASA is launching 3 sounding rockets into space during the total solar eclipse. Here's why\n\nThe mission team hope to collect data on how the sun's sudden disappearance during the eclipse creates disturbances that could interfere with communications on Earth.\n\nTargeted launch times for the three rockets are 2:40 p.m., 3:20 p.m., and 4:05 p.m., NASA said, but that may change.\n\nWeather permitting, Delawareans may be able to see the rockets 10-30 seconds after takeoff.\n\nAccording to Delaware Surf Fishing, which had a rocket photo contest several years ago, some of the best places are at the beaches. For a complete list, visit their page.\n\nThe launches will also be streamed on YouTube beginning at 2:30 p.m.\n\nWhere can I buy eclipse glasses?\n\nDid you wait until the last moment to buy your eclipse glasses and now it's too late to order them online?\n\nSome locations of the following retail chains sell ISO-compliant eclipse glasses and/or handheld viewers made by companies verified by the American Astronomical Society:\n\nWalmart\n\nWegmans\n\nCracker Barrel\n\nLowes\n\nStaples\n\nAdditionally, some libraries and museums in the state are offering glasses.\n\nThe Delaware City library, for example, will give them out for free while supplies last. While the library doesn't officially open until noon, residents can knock on the door or call ahead and someone will bring them out.\n\nREAD:Still hunting for glasses? Here are stores selling them in Delaware\n\nWhile chain stores and libraries will likely be offering glasses that meet American Astronomical Society standards, if you want to double-check, look at the arm of the glasses for the the \"ISO 12312-2\" label. The standard may also be written as \"ISO 12312-2:2015.\"\n\nEither of these means that the glasses will properly block light and radiation.\n\nI can't find glasses. How do I make a pinhole projector?\n\nSupplies you’ll need:\n\nTwo pieces of stiff white cardboard (two paper plates will work) or two sheets of plain white paper\n\nA thumbtack, a sharp pin or a needle\n\nPuncture a hole in one piece of cardboard or paper and hold it above your shoulder with your back to the sun. Have another person hold the second piece of cardboard or paper at a distance, and you'll see the shape of the sun projected onto the second piece of cardboard.\n\nTo see a more detailed explanation and visual of how to make a quick and easy pinhole projector for the eclipse, visit timeanddate.com.\n\n2017 eclipse path\n\nWe know the last eclipse was in 2017.

But what about my phone?\n\nMany residents know not to look directly at the sun during an eclipse. But is pointing a phone or other camera OK?\n\nPhotography experts caution against doing so unless the optics are fitted with a certified solar filter. Cameras can magnify the intensity and brightness of sunlight, B & H Photo and Video says, which can damage equipment.\n\nExperts also warn that pointing a phone at the sun could \"fry\" the device. They instead recommend shielding the lens with eclipse glasses or obtaining a solar lens ahead of time.\n\nSolar eclipse time by zip code\n\nWondering when the eclipse will area in your area?

John Carney, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control and the Delaware Open Space Council.\n\n“It represents the largest investment and private partner contributions to a DNREC Division of Parks and Recreation project in the Open Space Program’s history,” said Carney. “And it honors the oath that elected officials take to ‘respect the right of future generations to share the rich historic and natural heritage of Delaware.’”\n\nThe $26 million project included:\n\n$19.5 million from the Delaware Open Space Program,\n\n$6 million from the Mt. Cuba Center through The Conservation Fund,\n\na $500,000 grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation through Walmart’s Acres for America program.\n\nThis is the first time Acres for America has funded a project in Delaware. The grant was one of only 10 awarded nationwide in 2023 in the competitive program.\n\nThe land is being added to White Clay Creek State Park in three phases and includes the last major privately-owned land surrounded by park property.\n\nAbout 90 acres was bought in September. The second parcel, about 97 acres, is scheduled to be added early this year, and the last property, about 88 acres, is scheduled to be acquired later this year.\n\nThe park, nearly 3,650 acres, is north of Newark near both Maryland and Pennsylvania, and is connected to the White Clay Creek Preserve which stretches into Pennsylvania.\n\nOver 45,000 acres in Delaware preserved by Open Space Program\n\nWith this 275-acre addition, DNREC has acquired more than 45,000 acres through the Open Space Program with combined state, federal and partner funds.\n\nDelaware’s 2023 budget included $20 million in funding for the Open Space Program, enabling the purchase of the new land for White Clay Creek State Park.\n\nCreated in 1990 by the Delaware Land Protection Act and guided by the Delaware Open Space Council, the program is shared between DNREC’s divisions of Parks and Recreation and Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Agriculture’s Delaware Forest Service and the Department of State’s Historical and Cultural Affairs.\n\n“As our state’s population continues to grow, we have to make sure that we have first-class recreational opportunities for our residents to enjoy, as well as our visitors,” said Carney.\n\nMore nature news:Delaware is a top state for birdwatching.

But for many Main Street business owners, who saw sales decline with less people willing to head downtown before the pandemic, the damper of construction has been replaced by a much larger barrier — the pandemic itself.\n\n\"Construction deterred a lot of our local business,\" said Mike Slattery, owner of Delaware Growler. \"It'll take some time to get customers acclimated to coming down Main Street. It'll help when construction is done, but [coronavirus] will certainly be in the back of their heads.\"\n\nDELAWARE BEACHES: With short-term rentals still banned, Delaware locals fear visitors will leave for new beaches\n\nThe University of Delaware emptied its campus in mid-March after Delaware's first coronavirus case was discovered in a faculty member who traveled to an out-of-state conference. Days later, Gov. John Carney initiated a stay-at-home order.\n\nSince, most shops have been completely closed and restaurants have been limited to takeout and delivery. Earlier this month, the state allowed retailers to offer curbside pickup and last Wednesday opened the possibility of shopping by appointment. Without foot traffic from students, most haven't taken advantage of the looser rules and remain closed.\n\n\"During the construction, the store wasn't impacted by it, as a lot of our business is from students,\" said Michael Romagnoli, who helps his father, Aldo, run the 85-year-old Newark Camera Shop. The store is currently closed.\n\n\"The business landscape has obviously changed quite a bit, so it's difficult to make plans for what things will be like when they do reopen. We're just playing it by ear, trying to survive.\"\n\nBusinesses driven by students weren't as affected by the construction as those who rely on customers from the community who must drive to get downtown.\n\nShops and restaurants that lost business said their customers from outside Newark were less likely to drive in given trouble with parking and traffic delays. Some owners said the construction didn't cause those issues but led to the perception among many that Main Street was \"a mess\" not worth visiting.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: How Newark's Main Street transformed from classic American downtown to college town food court\n\nThat was damaging enough. More than a half-dozen Main Street businesses closed during the construction project. There are around 10 current vacancies, eight of which were previously restaurants.\n\nRestaurants owners lamented that the project's timeline covered two springs, when business is at its peak leading up to UD's graduation. Now, days from when families would flood Newark to see their graduates, the traffic has almost dried up completely.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding when or if students will return it the fall has added to the alarm.\n\n\"The University of Delaware is crucial for survival of any business on Main Street,\" said Javier Acuna, who owns Santa Fe Mexican Grill and Pachamama Rotisserie Chicken through his restaurant group Hakuna Hospitality. \"An empty street is not convenient long term.\"\n\nUD COMMENCEMENT: University of Delaware postpones commencement, hopes to hold in-person celebration at later date\n\nConstruction crews are expected to be done in the first two weeks of June after finishing the pavement striping and addressing \"small punch list issues,\" according to city spokesperson Jayme Gravell.\n\nThe project was originally forecast to take up to 18 months. Crews completely reconstructed the road to correct structural issues beneath the surface and install a new drainage system.\n\nThe team created a string of bump-outs, an extension of the sidewalk sometimes called \"parklets\" that feature bike racks, metal fencing and brick columns.\n\nThe bump-outs bookend each side of a parking strip on a block, typically near a street corner. The wider sidewalks will make walking safer by shortening crossing distances and improving lines of sight, officials say. The project cost close to $12 million.\n\n\"Main Street will look a lot nicer,\" Romagnoli said. \"Beautifying Main Street and making sure it'll last for a really long time is important.\"\n\nWhen the road renovation is complete, there will still be construction work ongoing downtown. Newark developer Jeff Lang is building a 144-room Hyatt Place hotel at the site of the historic Green Mansion.\n\nHis development group is also redeveloping the Fulton Bank property at Main Street and Tyre Avenue. The bank will be replaced by a three-story building with Fulton Bank and a retailer on the ground floor and 30 apartments above.\n\nDaily Veg, a restaurant serving vegan comfort food, is slated to take the place of the former Jimmy John's between Academy and Haines Streets. It will open in late summer or early fall.\n\nA Chase Bank branch is under construction at the Newark Shopping Center and is scheduled to open in August.\n\nContact Brandon Holveck at bholveck@delawareonline.com.

A few shuttered spots that come to mind: Ground Round and its peanut shell-covered floor; Bennigan's, one of the first casual dining chains; and Chi-Chi's, which made fajitas a mainstream dish in America.\n\nOver the years, we have said goodbye to many. Here is a look back at 10 restaurants we miss.\n\nOld Time Tavern in Toms River\n\nEveryone who grew up in Toms River remembers this restaurant, a historic place near the intersection of Routes 9 and 37, in the old Dover Mall (there was a movie theater there, too). For many, it was where you went to celebrate special occasions - graduations, birthday, bridal showers.\n\nThe tavern housed a piece of township history: A portion of the building came from The Ocean House, an 18th-century hotel that was relocated from downtown Toms River in the 1950s to avoid demolition (A 7-Eleven now stands at the site, at Main and Water streets). After considerable renovation, the portion that was saved became the dining room and southeast part of the tavern.\n\nOld Time Tavern was demolished in 2008, prior to the widening of Route 9 and the construction of a new plaza that now houses Buffalo Wild Wings, Social 37 and Panera Bread, among other businesses.\n\nDover Diner\n\nLike the nearby Old Time Tavern, this Toms River landmark was torn down in 2008 to allow for road widening and improvements on Route 9. The diner - which attracted customers with a sign that read \"Eat here - or we'll both starve!\" - opened in 1949 and was housed in a stainless steel 1950 Silky City dining car.\n\nIt was a small place, as many of the great ones are - a counter stretched the width of the restaurant and a handful of booths were available - and it was a part of town before the Garden State Parkway ran through Toms River.\n\nWinkelmann's Restaurant in Lakewood\n\nIn 1961, at the age of 19, a man named Hermann Winkelmann emigrated to the United States from Germany. Within a few years, he had opened a butcher shop, then a liquor store. In 1972, he opened Winkelmann's German-American restaurant on Route 9 in Lakewood.\n\nThose who don't remember Winkelmann's surely know the location: The grand space, with its own version of a German clock tower (figurines included) become Chateau Grand, then a shopping plaza.\n\nBut what happened to Winkelmann's? The restaurant grew and grew over the years, but the bank that lent Hermann the money to expand became the subject of a federal investigation. The bank was seized in the early 1990s, and the restaurant subsequently closed.\n\nCircus Drive-In in Wall\n\nThis is the most recently closed restaurant on this list, but after 63 years, it deserves a mention. The beloved Circus Drive-In - known for serving hamburgers, hot dogs and milkshakes under a striped big top.\n\nThe drive-in got its start in 1954, when Richard Friedel and his wife, Barbara, took out a mortgage and a loan from family. Barbara designed the restaurant's mascot, a smiling clown that overlooks Route 35.\n\n\"It stood the test of time,\" Friedel, 90, recently said of the business, which he sold 13 years ago. \"I was proud of it, and I'm still proud of it. And I'm sorry to see it go. But, like everything else, nothing is forever.\"\n\nSteak & Ale\n\nIf you have ever filled your plate at a salad bar, you can thank (in part) restaurateur Norman Brinker, who founded the British-style Steak & Ale in 1966 and helped put make-it-yourself salads on the map.\n\n\"The customer can get a salad while the waiter is turning in the order and delivering it,” Brinker told a National Public Radio reporter in 2002. “The speed was much faster. And you, the customer, ate what you wanted from the salad bar, right off the bat.\"\n\nRemember Bennigan's and Steak & Ale? This Long Branch native bringing them back\n\nThe restaurant, which had locations in Middletown, Cherry Hill and Upper Saddle River, closed nearly a decade ago when its parent company went bankrupt. But Steak & Ale is making a comeback: A new owner has revamped the concept, and Food & Beverage magazine reports a location has opened in Cancun, with more planned for India and Australia.\n\nIt could also be making a comeback at the Jersey Shore thanks to a Long Branch man.\n\nSizzler\n\nAh, Sizzler. Who can forget the commercials - happy families, in the latest '80s fashion, enjoying steak, fried shrimp, baked potatoes and burger toppings from the fixins' bar - and that line from the 1992 film \"White Men Can't Jump\": \"We going Sizzler, we going Sizzler\"?\n\nIt all started in 1958 with the opening of a restaurant that served a steak dinner for 99 cents. Today, there are dozens of Sizzlers throughout the country - mostly out West, plus one in Florida - still dishing up rib-eyes and crispy shrimp.\n\nFuddruckers\n\nWhat makes the World's Greatest Hamburger? The folks at Fuddruckers do - or so they say.\n\nThe 37-year-old chain, which remains in Parsippany and Succasanna, was among the first to put custom-made burgers in a customer's hands.\n\nThe restaurant's cooks grill third-, half-, and two third-pound patties to your liking and put them on store-baked buns. Then, it's off to the fixins' bar for pico de gallo, sliced jalapenos, diced onions and cheese sauce.\n\nAnd yes - they still have the buffalo, elk and wild boar burgers.\n\nHoward Johnson's\n\nThere is one Howard Johnson's restaurant left in the country, in New York's Lake George.\n\nBut at its peak in the 1960s, there were hundreds of these orange-roofed restaurants, which founder Howard Deering Johnson started in the early 1920s as an ice cream shop. A full-service restaurant followed in 1929, then smartly planned franchises took off: They were built in close proximity to the nation's highways.\n\nKnown as “a landmark for hungry Americans,” HoJos dished up fried clam strips, the \"frankfort\" (a hot dog sandwiched in a buttered roll), steaks, sandwiches, and Johnson's nearly 30 flavors of ice cream.\n\nDenny's\n\nIf you didn't spend late nights in your 20s eating bacon cheese fries and piles of pancakes at Denny's, you missed out.\n\nThere still is time - there are 10 of the 24-hour restaurants left in New Jersey, mostly in the southwest part of the state. The Brick location closed in 2011 - it is now an Asian fusion restaurant - and the closure marked the chain's departure from Ocean County. There are no Denny's locations in Monmouth County.\n\nA bit of trivia: Denny's Grand Slam breakfast - two buttermilk pancakes, two sunny-side-up eggs, two bacon strips and two sausage links - was introduced in 1977 in honor of Milwaukee Brewers' slugger Hank Aaron.\n\nChevy's\n\nHere is what I remember about this Mexican chain: a woman making tortillas by hand, a delicious corn dish called tomalito, and very large margaritas.\n\nThis was at Chevy's in Brick, which closed in 2012 and became Quaker Steak & Lube. The Tex-Mex chain had some troubles - parent companies experienced bankruptcies - but today, nearly 40 remain. Most locations are in northern California, and the Chevy's closest to the Shore is in Linden.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2021/06/01/list-all-49-food-trucks-evansville-henderson-area-streets/7481106002/", "title": "Evansville food truck guide: 55 vendors peddle BBQ, tacos and more", "text": "EVANSVILLE, Ind. — If you're hungry, there's a food truck for you on the streets of the Tri-State.

A few years later, he worked his way into the back of the house where he learned to make the pizzas.\n\nHe watched as his dad made a pizza so good customers would come back week after week for it.\n\nFriday nights were especially thrilling, Schiano recalled. He’d spend those busy nights peeling garlic while doing his best to keep up with the phones as they’d ring off the hook with customers’ orders. It was on those nights, when the shop would churn out 200 to 300 pizzas in just two hours, Schiano fell in love with the job.\n\n“It was just that rush. The people standing, waiting, watching us perform. It’s the whole experience and environment and energy, it’s something that’s been built in me. Those Friday nights is what made me realize inside this could be my future. And just to see my father grow (the business) from a little house to an empire. Watching him grow from nothing, coming over to this country, and into success. He was the pizza king. And one day I hope people look back and say the same thing about me.”\n\nYears later, Schiano has followed in his dad’s footsteps, opening up Lucatelli’s Pizzeria in Doylestown Borough. The pizza shop’s name is a play on his 7-year-old son’s name, Luca.\n\nThe Doylestown spot is Schiano’s second chance at owning a pizzeria. He originally set up shop in Philadelphia just before COVID hit, and the ripple effects of the pandemic forced him to close his doors last year. But giving his dream another go has been a blessing, he explained.\n\n“Everything happened the way it should happen, and I feel like it’s the way it should be. Doylestown has been really good to me. Not being able to work for a year and finding a dream location and the response from this community in helping me grow is making me really fall in love with Doylestown,” said Schiano, who originally grew up in Horsham.\n\nAs Schiano’s plans for Lucatelli’s fell into place, he was encouraged by the support of his dad every step of the way. But 12 days after the pizzeria’s soft opening on Jan. 11, his father, who had been his inspiration and mentor, passed away.\n\n“Through all his pain and everything he was cheering for me,” said Schiano.\n\n“My father has given me all his strength and all his knowledge,” he added. “Up until he was 77 years old, he was still inside that pizza shop. He worked every day, 7 days a week. If I’m half the man my father was, I know I’m a good man.”\n\nUsing recipes passed down from his parents who both emigrated from Italy, Schiano crafted a menu that includes many classic Italian items, like stromboli and grandma pie, finetuned by his passion for creativity in the kitchen and a commitment to using fresh, high-quality ingredients.\n\nThe eggplant parmesan, Schiano said, was recreated from a recipe his mother brought over from Sicily. The pizza sauce is the same one his dad used at Maple Glen Pizza all those years.\n\n“My father has the best sauce, so the only thing to improve upon is the crust. And it’s how I’ve taken the pizza to another level,” he said.\n\nOn the table:Bucks County jumps on board the charcuterie trend. Meats and cheese will never be the same\n\nA table for one: He came into her restaurant twice a day, without fail. Then, he was gone.\n\nSchiano worked to improve the crust by using a double zero flour, rated for its finer, silky texture. He also allows the yeast starter to ferment for 72 hours, which adds more flavor. The combination of these two factors creates a lighter, airier crust that’s easier to digest, he said.\n\nThe restaurant itself, located in Mercer Square Shopping Center, has plenty of seating, surrounded by the modern Italian vibe of Vespa-inspired décor. They offer a gluten-free crust for those with dietary restrictions. And for anyone looking to end their meal on a sweet note, they currently serve up two dessert options — Nutella sticks and Italian doughnuts stuffed with cannoli cream.\n\nSchiano hopes to carry on his dad’s legacy by creating a space where families can gather over good food, just like he remembers at his dad’s pizza shop on those busy nights peeling garlic and answering phones.\n\n“They come to see us, so they can sit around and talk and laugh. We became a part of every household and every family, so they could be together. We need to keep creating this experience every Friday night. I just want it to live on,” said Schiano. “My inspiration is being able to share those moments and memories with people as they come together around the table.”\n\nGo: Lucatelli’s Pizzeria, located in Mercer Square Shopping Center at 73 Old Dublin Pike in Doylestown, is open every day 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. 215-377-9990. https://lucatellispizzeria.godaddysites.com\n\nAlso check out these new eateries on the scene in Bucks County:\n\nBakery Bethlehem, Levittown\n\nHusband and wife team, Mauricio Valencia and Marly Orjuela, natives of Colombia, moved to the U.S. last summer, bringing with them their two daughters and a shared dream of starting their own bakery.\n\nJust this month, that dream became a reality when they opened Bakery Bethlehem, a name inspired by its Hebrew namesake meaning “House of Bread.”\n\nAt Bakery Bethlehem, you’ll find both European- and Colombian-inspired breads and pastries.\n\nAs you walk up, stop for a peek through the large window showing the bakers at work.

Positive, up-lifting messages adorn the walls of this sparkling clean little place, including one that proclaims, “Every little thing is gonna [sic] be alright!”\n\nWe relaxed as we settled at our table and perused the menu.\n\nI saw something to love right away, chicken and waffles ($9.95). The light and fluffy buttermilk waffles served with warm maple syrup were so comforting and the wings that came with it were finger-licking good.\n\nThe batter-dipped fried chicken tenders, though, were indescribably delicious.\n\nMy husband had the five-piece tenders combo with french fries, roll and a large drink for $10.50. He had the option of dirty rice instead of the fries and could add coleslaw for $1.\n\nBesides the various chicken options on the menu, Phatz serves shrimp, salads, burgers, fish sandwiches and a pork chop sandwich.\n\nThis is the place to get great Southern sides like okra, corn nuggets and sweet potato fries for $2.49 each.\n\nAs we talked with the friendly staff, we learned the Vero Beach restaurant is the second restaurant for Phatz; the first is at Avenue D in Fort Pierce.\n\nPhatz Chick-n-Shack in Vero Beach is tucked away in a little strip shopping center at the corner of 43rd Avenue and 20th Street.

It's a 15-year contract to bring passenger air service to Lakeland starting in May 2024, with an optional five-year extension if both parties agree.\n\n\"Our purpose is to inspire travel. We do so by providing safe, convenient, reliable and affordable travel for customers in the communities we serve,\" said Trevor Yealy, Avelo's head of commercial. \"There is no better potential for that safe, affordable, convenient, reliable travel than the opportunity here at Lakeland Linder International Airport.\"\n\nAvelo has been looking at the Lakeland-Winter Haven area as one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas for several years running, Yealy said.\n\nThe ultra low-budget carrier strategically focuses on serving \"secondary markets,\" Yealy said, or highly urban and suburban areas near major cities. Its bases include Los Angeles' Hollywood Burbank Airport, Connecticut's Tweed-New Haven Airport, Delaware Valley's Wilmington Airport, Raleigh-Durham International Airport and Orlando International Airport.\n\nLearn about Avelo:What you need to know about the low-cost airline coming to Lakeland Linder\n\n\"When we were looking at airports across the country at what opportunities exist, this is certainly one of the low-hanging fruits so to speak in terms of serving large, growing, vibrant communities but with an airport that's entirely untapped so far,\" he said.\n\nAvelo has not provided any details on what destinations it will fly to from Lakeland, how frequently or at what cost. Yealy said specific route information will be unveiled in the upcoming months.\n\nThe commission approved an Airline Carrier Incentive Program to Avelo to waive rent and the airport's landing, per-turn and fuel-flowage fees based on the number of passengers it brings through the terminal doors.\n\nFor Avelo to achieve no-cost operations at Lakeland Linder after the first two years, Airport Director Kris Hallstrand said the carrier would have to move 22,050 people per month through the terminal.\n\nWhile many Lakeland officials and staff are excited, some residents are concerned about the noise inherent in adding more jet traffic to Lakeland Linder.\n\n\"I have nothing against Lakeland getting a passenger airline service, it would be great,\" said attorney Trey Harden, a Lakeland resident. \"It's compounding the issue with Amazon jet noise. They say they are going to fix the problem, but are adding more planes. Why don't they address the noise issues before they increasingly add more flights?\"\n\nHarden was not able to attend Monday's commission meeting. He submitted three pages of written comments to commissioners via email.\n\n\"Private studies regarding Lakeland Linder’s current aircraft operations indicate that, on average, approximately 581 Amazon Boeing 737’s and 767’s fly into and out of the airport each month,\" he wrote in a Dec. 15 email. \"Noise modelling technology also indicates that many of these flights exceed 75 decibels over several densely populated areas within the Lakeland city limits. These numbers are sufficient to create a nuisance to Lakeland residents that reside in the affected areas.\"\n\nLakeland residents have complained about the thunderous rumble of low-flying jets over the city since at least January 2021, less than six months after Amazon began its cargo freight operations.\n\nAvelo Airlines owns a fleet of 16 Boeing 737s. Of these planes, Boeing 737-700s carry 147 passengers and Boeing 737-800s carry up to 189, Hallstrand said. They are the same size as Amazon's smaller, bright blue cargo jets.\n\nLakeland Linder staff and city officials began working on developing an alternate approach, which would ideally have planes come south over South Florida Avenue and turn to travel west over the Polk Parkway. The Federal Aviation Administration rejected the airport's attempt to implement a visual approach in December 2021.\n\nThe city then hired Texas-based contractor Hughes Aerospace Corp. to map out the route in detail. Hallstrand said the route and public feedback gathered at the Nov. 16 forum have been sent to the FAA, which is roughly 80% through its review. The plans must also undergo an approved environmental review before being accepted and published for use.\n\nThe proposed alternative take off and departure plan will, hopefully, be approved by late winter or early 2024, Hallstrand said.\n\nHarden and other Lakeland residents are more cautious about the speed of approval and whether the new plan will offer noise relief.\n\n\"It still causes aircraft to fly at low altitudes over densely populated areas of the City,\" Harden wrote. \"Further, no hard data exists to support the City’s position that noise from jet aircraft will be abated.\"\n\nLakeland resident Rick Garrity wrote in a Dec. 17 email asking commissioners to delay approval of the city's new contract with Avelo until the new air corridor pathways were approved and they secure assurance that Avelo's pilots would use the new flight path.\n\nCity officials and staff made no mention of Garrity's comments during Monday's public discussion.\n\n\"Aircraft noise is a concern of some in the community, and I completely understand. We are doing our best to minimize that,\" Hallstrand told commissioners on Monday.\n\nThe airport director stressed the city is \"not responsible for the sky,\" and even when the new takeoff and departure paths are published, it cannot force pilots to use them.\n\n\"We are encouraging all our partners to use this approach,\" she said.\n\nIssues such as strong headwinds, bad weather conditions, conflicting air traffic and other issues could potentially deter pilots from using an airport's preferred approach.\n\n\"We cannot have operations of cargo or passenger service without having some level of noise. It’s inherent to the business of an airport,\" Hallstrand said. \"We are working to mitigate that.\"\n\nSara-Megan Walsh can be reached at swalsh@theledger.com or 863-802-7545.

John Carney and numerous government officials gathered under a white tent on the apron of the New Castle Airport with representatives of Frontier Airlines.\n\nOn that January morning, they announced the return of commercial air service to the First State. Frontier was back for a second stint and here to stay, the company said.\n\nFour months after Frontier pulled out of Delaware, Carney and his government colleagues found themselves in the same place Thursday morning. This time, they were shoulder to shoulder with Andrew Levy, the CEO of a new budget airline called Avelo that will start flying from New Castle in February.\n\n'This isn't just another airport'\n\nThe question Levy and Carney were both asked is an obvious one. Why will this time be any different?\n\n\"This isn't just another airport in the region we're serving,\" Levy said. \"Frontier, they're a great company; they do a great job. Their principal focus was on Philadelphia. That's not what we to do. This is where we want to be.\"\n\nCarney deferred to the airline and its plans for Delaware.\n\n\"I think their concept is a good one, and they've got routes that I think will be appealing to people,\" Carney said. \"They know this business. This is not my expertise, but we're excited to be a partner.\"\n\nAvelo will fly from the New Castle Airport to five Florida destinations: Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Tampa and West Palm Beach. It advertised an introductory promotional one-way rate of $49 Thursday. As far as additional fees, Levy said Avelo uses an \"unbundled pricing approach,\" with extra charges for bags, reserved seating and priority boarding.\n\nOrlando will be Avelo's most frequent destination with morning flights offered on Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays. The airline will fly to the other destinations twice a week.\n\nFrontier, by comparison, initially flew to Orlando three times per week before cutting its schedule to two times a week. In its first Delaware go-around, the airline flew to several other destinations, including Atlanta, Chicago and Denver.\n\n\"We believe that this market can work and work really well,\" Levy said. \"And we believe that the level of commitment that we're making in this market is different than what's been done before.\n\n\"We hope to be more relevant from day one.\"\n\nWhat is Avelo Airlines and how will it look here?\n\nAvelo Airlines debuted in April 2021 with flights from the Hollywood Burbank Airport in California. It positions itself as a low-cost alternative to larger carriers with a focus on smaller, secondary airports in large markets. When flights started last year, it became one of the first new airlines in the U.S. in the last 14 years.\n\nShortly after getting its start in Burbank, Avelo added bases in New Haven, Connecticut and Orlando. The New Castle Airport will be its fourth home base.\n\nAvelo will have one Boeing 737 based at the New Castle Airport to start. As part of its business plan, the company flies round trip each day to avoid the costs of overnighting crews. When Avelo decides to add another plane, it will consider New Castle, which would enable more destinations, but Levy made no guarantees.\n\nIt has two planes based in Burbank, five in New Haven and five in Orlando. The company reaches 31 locations overall.\n\n\"We have to get Florida to work and we'll go from there,\" Levy said, later adding the company relies on \"grass-roots marketing.\" \"We have to allocate resources to the things that are most promising.\"\n\nWill Avelo Airlines work for Delaware?\n\nWhen Frontier left in June, it continued a cycle that Delawareans have seen often over the past three decades. A new airliner moves in with the promise of low fares and easy flights only to pull out within a few years. Some with national staying power and others lost to history, the airlines that have tried Delaware include Delta, Frontier, Crown Airways and Skybus Airlines.\n\nEach time they leave, they gift Delaware the ignominious but relatively meaningless title of the only state without commercial airline service.\n\nIn June, officials at the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the airport, remained steadfast that commercial service could work at the airport. Stephen Williams, DRBA's deputy director and director of airports, said at the time it was a matter of the authority finding the \"sweet spot\" with an airline that could take advantage of the airport's easy access and dense surrounding population.\n\nWilliams said Thursday that Avelo hit the spot.\n\nOthers are less optimistic.\n\n\"It's just not a passenger-based airport,\" Alan Levin, who led the state's economic development office under Gov. Jack Markell and is the former CEO of the Happy Harry's drugstore chain, previously told Delaware Online/The News Journal. \"It's just not going to work.\"\n\nJosh Verde, an aviation consultant with Aerovise, believes Avelo's business could work because it's targeted at an underserved, but historically popular route. It will come down to getting the word out and filling seats early.\n\n\"If the fares are too cheap and they're not making a profit, they're just going to bail because they can't afford the route,\" Verde said. \"Let the convenience be the selling point.\"\n\nHow did Avelo Airlines end up here?\n\nDiscussions with the company began about two years ago, prior to the airline's debut, according to Thomas Cook, DRBA's executive director. At the time, Levy said Thursday, Avelo couldn't get an economic deal that would work. It decided to start elsewhere, but continued conversations with DRBA. Avelo would have pursued service at the New Castle Airport if Frontier hadn't left, Levy said, but perhaps wouldn't have flown to Orlando.\n\n\"Operationally, it's a little easier, but that didn't really matter to us,\" Levy said.\n\nDRBA's agreement with Avelo is for five years. Avelo has the option to extend the agreement for an additional five years. In September, the DRBA board approved a lease agreement with Avelo for 3,900 square feet of hangar and office space adjacent to the commercial terminal. Avelo will pay $23,400 annually for the space. They can renew the lease for an additional year up to nine times.\n\nBefore Frontier's return, DRBA spent about $2 million to renovate its commercial terminal to meet Transportation Security Administration standards. Avelo expects to hire around 35 flight attendants, technicians, customer service representatives and pilots before its Feb. 1 Delaware debut.\n\nCarney sees the airport as part of the state's larger goals of attracting businesses and becoming a more desired place to live.\n\n\"Young people come to places where there's cool things to do,\" Carney said.\n\nA $49 flight is cool, the governor said.\n\nContact Brandon Holveck at bholveck@delawareonline.com.
